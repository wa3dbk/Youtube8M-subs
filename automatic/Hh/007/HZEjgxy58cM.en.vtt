life drawing and he really didn't focus

the<00:01:00.699> body<00:01:00.940> as<00:01:01.620> shapes<00:01:02.620> forms<00:01:03.269> and<00:01:04.269> basically

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
the body as shapes forms and basically

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.500 
the body as shapes forms and basically
chunks<00:01:06.040> of<00:01:06.100> ham<00:01:06.310> or<00:01:06.580> footballs<00:01:06.970> or<00:01:07.210> whatever

it's<00:01:07.720> I've<00:01:07.900> never<00:01:08.050> really<00:01:08.409> learned<00:01:08.740> where

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
it's I've never really learned where

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.070 
it's I've never really learned where
each<00:01:09.430> muscle<00:01:09.729> starts<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.390> ultimately<00:01:10.900> know

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
each muscle starts and ultimately know

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.560 
each muscle starts and ultimately know
the<00:01:11.140> names<00:01:11.409> of<00:01:11.560> them<00:01:12.180> except<00:01:13.180> for<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:13.390> major

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
the names of them except for the major

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.010 
the names of them except for the major
muscles<00:01:14.259> and<00:01:15.090> but<00:01:16.090> it<00:01:16.180> really<00:01:16.330> focus<00:01:16.720> more<00:01:16.990> on

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
muscles and but it really focus more on

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.480 
muscles and but it really focus more on
shape<00:01:17.950> of<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:19.119> arms<00:01:19.479> place<00:01:20.159> depending<00:01:21.159> on

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
shape of the arms place depending on

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.990 
shape of the arms place depending on
whether<00:01:21.909> it<00:01:22.149> was<00:01:22.270> forced<00:01:22.659> put<00:01:22.899> on<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.640> arm<00:01:24.640> leg

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
whether it was forced put on the arm leg

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.540 
whether it was forced put on the arm leg
or<00:01:25.360> not<00:01:25.509> because<00:01:25.780> your<00:01:26.170> muscles<00:01:26.800> change<00:01:27.280> shape

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
or not because your muscles change shape

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.419 
or not because your muscles change shape
it's<00:01:28.479> as<00:01:28.600> pointless<00:01:28.780> to<00:01:29.080> learn<00:01:29.380> like<00:01:29.979> where<00:01:30.340> it

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
it's as pointless to learn like where it

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.400 
it's as pointless to learn like where it
starts<00:01:30.700> ends<00:01:31.060> it's<00:01:31.840> more<00:01:32.020> important<00:01:32.380> that

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
starts ends it's more important that

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.320 
starts ends it's more important that
what<00:01:32.710> shape<00:01:32.950> it<00:01:33.130> is<00:01:33.250> when<00:01:33.520> you<00:01:33.640> can<00:01:33.820> try<00:01:34.000> to<00:01:34.060> it

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
what shape it is when you can try to it

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.669 
what shape it is when you can try to it
reflects<00:01:35.550> so<00:01:36.550> that's<00:01:36.759> a<00:01:36.970> lot<00:01:37.210> of<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:38.410> lot

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679 
reflects so that's a lot of like a lot

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:40.380 
reflects so that's a lot of like a lot
of<00:01:38.770> what<00:01:38.950> I<00:01:38.979> did<00:01:39.220> when<00:01:39.310> I<00:01:39.399> think<00:01:39.670> drawings<00:01:40.270> I

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
of what I did when I think drawings I

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.560 
of what I did when I think drawings I
draw<00:01:40.869> a<00:01:41.350> hydraulic<00:01:42.340> arm<00:01:42.490> coming<00:01:42.759> forward<00:01:43.149> I'll

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
draw a hydraulic arm coming forward I'll

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.660 
draw a hydraulic arm coming forward I'll
cut<00:01:43.869> it<00:01:43.990> off<00:01:44.110> at<00:01:44.289> the<00:01:44.380> forearm<00:01:44.830> and<00:01:45.039> think

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
cut it off at the forearm and think

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.410 
cut it off at the forearm and think
about<00:01:45.910> the<00:01:46.060> silhouette<00:01:46.800> the<00:01:47.800> contour<00:01:48.280> line

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
about the silhouette the contour line

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.179 
about the silhouette the contour line
cuz<00:01:50.170> its<00:01:50.320> answer<00:01:50.880> they<00:01:51.880> might<00:01:52.090> but<00:01:52.689> most<00:01:52.900> ppl

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
cuz its answer they might but most ppl

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.859 
cuz its answer they might but most ppl
