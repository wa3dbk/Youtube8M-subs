 I will show you how we are going to 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.770
 transfer a design from the dark see 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.980
 I have this fabric that is a color like 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.570
 coral or melon, well, let's go 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.390
 do we are going to transfer the design that 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.160
 we want to move to the web 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.099
 obscura we are going to transfer it here what 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.289
 I have transferred the hair if it does not have 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.450
 but you can transfer it in Chinese paper 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.270
 can transfer it on bond paper or 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.070
 can transfer on paper albal nenÃ© in 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.050
 any paper only that is white 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.630
 they leave and if they are going to occupy but even if 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.300
 a little thick for this girlfriends I 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.340
 I will occupy a color or paint of 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.060
 I do not know how you know her in 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.780
 where they live 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:54.690
 this is a common color and see 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.730
 I think it's wax 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.800
 it's normal you can of the colors that the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.289
 children occupy for school that I'm going to 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.879
 to do is is the design by the part of the 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.830
 right I always use to put him 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.009
 right not to be wrong we are going to 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.830
 turn our design and with this same 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.240
 friendly color we will transfer all the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.399
 shore 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.790
 let's go highlighting the entire shore of 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.500
 design but for the opposite direction not 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.050
 for the right it comes out so that our 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.820
 figure does not come out right 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.940
 these friends can do it 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.650
 only in this melon colored fabric what 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.960
 can do in black what can 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.960
 Do in blue I will teach 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.820
 paint these beautiful flowers since 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.520
 one of my beautiful friends gave me 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.300
 well these napkins are true and 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.980
 let's use here by painting 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.560
 and I'm going to show you how we're going to 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.690
 transfer the design to the dark fabric 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.310
 this we are going to do during all the 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.110
 design let's try that when 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.060
 we are taking our design 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.840
 we are not going to recharge our little hand 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.000
 here where we already marked with the color 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.730
 we are simply going to highlight all 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.940
 the contours 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.950
 a little bit strong 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.570
 and we are going to turn our work to 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.240
 do not go putting our hand here where 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.620
 we already apply the color true because what 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.760
 let's move on to bring with your hand and 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.760
 let's make it lose strength 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.180
 this we are going to do during all the 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:25.610
 design in all the contours only 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.040
 let's go marking contours 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.740
 I'm going to finish pointing out all the 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.500
 design and now I show you that it continues 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.420
 comes out 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.190
 good friends how can you see that here the 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.050
 transfer and all my design I will search 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.020
 the corner of the napkin I'm going to 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.730
 do here in the corner you can 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.060
 put your design in the middle part 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.130
 where they like to come out see always we are going to 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.590
 center our drawing taking care that 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.490
 two or three fingers on each side 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.610
 so that we do not stay very close to the shore 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.790
 here I have two games there is 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.950
 perfect in my design see now what 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.720
 I will need is a painting cut 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.620
 normal ordinary and any 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.470
 paint they have 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.610
 and we will carve up our 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.610
 paint design 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.560
 a little bit strong and trying to make 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.450
 where we go carving is where 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.870
 we mark with our color the 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.870
 design 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.720
 in this way it will be that 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.670
 transfer our designs either manta 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.620
 boleada or any dark fabric in 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.480
 any part of the republic or part 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.580
 of the world that you are if you do not 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.710
 find cocoa pencil transfers 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.080
 This is a very easy way to 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.300
 transfer the designs to dark fabrics 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.510
 friends if you would like to transfer 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.810
 this design to a clear fabric can 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.430
 use any paint or color of 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.560
 wood 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.000
 that is red green anyone who 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.670
 you want only that it is not a 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.439
 very dark color saleh because yes 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.290
 we use a very dark color 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:05.629
 as black is often difficult to 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.079
 to pass or to cover it with the paint and 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:11.460
 so if we paint with light colors 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:13.380
 well you can see 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.490
 and we do not look pretty then we're going to 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.840
 try to use colors like these yes 

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:21.510
 but of all the clearings for example and 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.790
 here I am using this target and it is 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:28.640
 of this brand as I tell you I bought it in 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.640
 a stationery mediating those colors 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:34.969
 Well, this is what we are going to do during the whole 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:38.009
 design during everything we transfer 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:40.649
 we are going to carve him but taking care that it is 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:43.439
 well and trying to here the time 

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:45.269
 we are emphasizing remarquemos all the 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:48.679
 design so that we do not remain milestones 

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:48.679
 something that left us full 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.990
 if you want you can insure with 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.370
 a sticky purpose pin with what 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.199
 want me like that I 'm just 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.789
 doing here good since what 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.310
 we have ready only the only thing 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:06.250
 we are going to do is remove the rock with 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.500
 careful and see us is transferred 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.840
 our design if you can see them now 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.780
 which is very clear in white colors 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.780
 see how they are all marked very well 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.210
 the contours you do not perhaps not 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:22.240
 reach to see friends can highlight a 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.430
 little bit more with its color but well 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.370
 I feel that it is very good to see 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.330
 highlight a little more but well 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.490
 it's perfect since we're going to paint it 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.990
 Well, beautiful friends, I hope this 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.509
 video is very helpful for you 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.280
 for all my beautiful companions that I 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:40.560
 they ask how to transfer the designs to 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.960
 dark fabric this is an excellent idea 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.669
 very practical and economical since these 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.520
 wooden colors where they want they do not 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:49.080
 They find good, I hope they are 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.340
 of a lot of help and to carry it out 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.930
 friends this design I'm going to 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.729
