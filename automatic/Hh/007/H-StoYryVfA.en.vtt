the winter hats and hoodies you haven't

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.800 
the winter hats and hoodies you haven't
got<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.579> same<00:01:53.759> sort<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.299> friction<00:01:54.689> and

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
got that same sort of friction and

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.679 
got that same sort of friction and
rubbing<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.200> all<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.409> time<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.360> will<00:01:57.570> be

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
rubbing it all the time so that will be

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.899 
rubbing it all the time so that will be
why<00:01:57.869> you're<00:01:58.770> starting<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.189> get<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.310> little<00:01:59.369> more

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
why you're starting to get a little more

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.639 
why you're starting to get a little more
loose<00:02:00.030> hair<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.509> you'll<00:02:00.960> start<00:02:01.140> noticing<00:02:01.259> a

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
loose hair and you'll start noticing a

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.010 
loose hair and you'll start noticing a
lot<00:02:01.770> more<00:02:01.850> during<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.390> hotter<00:02:03.600> some

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
lot more during the hotter some

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.580 
lot more during the hotter some
appearance<00:02:04.439> as<00:02:04.560> well

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
appearance as well

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.100 
appearance as well
um<00:02:07.200> yeah<00:02:08.580> but<00:02:09.580> I<00:02:09.759> one<00:02:10.690> thing<00:02:10.720> I<00:02:10.840> wouldn't

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
um yeah but I one thing I wouldn't

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.290 
um yeah but I one thing I wouldn't
encourage<00:02:11.349> is<00:02:11.739> washing<00:02:12.190> them<00:02:12.430> too<00:02:12.640> much<00:02:12.819> like

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
encourage is washing them too much like

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.449 
encourage is washing them too much like
like<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:13.840> said<00:02:13.989> you<00:02:14.080> get<00:02:14.230> sweaty<00:02:14.470> up<00:02:14.650> but<00:02:15.430> i

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
like I said you get sweaty up but i

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.880 
like I said you get sweaty up but i
wouldn't<00:02:16.150> say<00:02:16.330> watch<00:02:16.629> them<00:02:16.840> too<00:02:17.709> often

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
wouldn't say watch them too often

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.820 
wouldn't say watch them too often
because<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.930> same<00:02:20.140> reason<00:02:20.170> again<00:02:20.650> you<00:02:20.739> are

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
because the same reason again you are

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.070 
because the same reason again you are
starting<00:02:21.010> even<00:02:21.220> more<00:02:21.550> reset<00:02:21.940> because<00:02:22.360> your

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
starting even more reset because your

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.610 
starting even more reset because your
hair's<00:02:23.260> wet<00:02:23.440> all<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.860> time<00:02:25.019> and<00:02:26.019> to<00:02:26.349> be<00:02:26.440> honest

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
hair's wet all the time and to be honest

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.070 
hair's wet all the time and to be honest
it<00:02:26.860> wants<00:02:27.099> to<00:02:27.220> knock<00:02:27.400> mostly<00:02:27.879> when<00:02:28.299> it's<00:02:28.480> dry

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
it wants to knock mostly when it's dry

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.660 
it wants to knock mostly when it's dry
and<00:02:31.620> there's<00:02:32.620> more<00:02:32.769> friction<00:02:32.920> involved<00:02:33.459> so

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
and there's more friction involved so

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.180 
and there's more friction involved so
when<00:02:34.629> it's<00:02:34.780> lubricated<00:02:35.140> in<00:02:35.349> wet<00:02:35.530> it's<00:02:35.860> won't

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
when it's lubricated in wet it's won't

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.690 
when it's lubricated in wet it's won't
look<00:02:36.430> up<00:02:36.640> quite<00:02:37.060> as<00:02:37.180> well<00:02:38.280> then<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.400> move<00:02:39.579> on

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
look up quite as well then you move on

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.780 
look up quite as well then you move on
to<00:02:40.420> sort<00:02:40.840> of<00:02:40.900> often<00:02:41.650> time<00:02:41.860> when<00:02:42.459> it<00:02:42.549> starts

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
to sort of often time when it starts

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.009 
to sort of often time when it starts
crawling<00:02:42.940> down<00:02:43.180> again<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:43.630> start<00:02:43.900> wearing

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
crawling down again you start wearing

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.620 
crawling down again you start wearing
hats<00:02:44.319> to<00:02:44.500> start<00:02:44.799> you<00:02:45.250> know<00:02:45.310> lying<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.299> do<00:02:46.450> they

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
hats to start you know lying you do they

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.569 
hats to start you know lying you do they
more<00:02:46.900> things<00:02:47.709> like<00:02:47.769> that<00:02:47.980> you're<00:02:48.459> not

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
more things like that you're not

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.330 
more things like that you're not
sweating<00:02:48.849> and<00:02:49.299> you<00:02:49.680> probably<00:02:50.680> watching<00:02:51.069> us<00:02:51.190> a

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
sweating and you probably watching us a

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.569 
sweating and you probably watching us a
little<00:02:51.549> bit<00:02:51.700> less<00:02:51.879> but<00:02:52.180> i'd<00:02:52.780> say<00:02:52.930> like<00:02:53.579> during

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
little bit less but i'd say like during

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.190 
little bit less but i'd say like during
the<00:02:54.670> summer<00:02:54.910> i<00:02:55.150> probably<00:02:55.450> wash<00:02:55.690> my<00:02:55.870> hair<00:02:55.989> maybe

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
the summer i probably wash my hair maybe

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.009 
the summer i probably wash my hair maybe
twice<00:02:56.500> a<00:02:56.560> week<00:02:56.970> maybe<00:02:57.970> three<00:02:58.239> times<00:02:58.420> if<00:02:58.810> it's

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
twice a week maybe three times if it's

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.530 
twice a week maybe three times if it's
really<00:02:59.379> hot<00:02:59.590> this<00:02:59.709> way<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.970> because<00:03:01.329> you're

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
really hot this way and because you're

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.880 
really hot this way and because you're
outside<00:03:01.780> doing<00:03:01.989> a<00:03:02.110> lot<00:03:02.200> more<00:03:02.260> stuff<00:03:02.530> as<00:03:02.709> well

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
outside doing a lot more stuff as well

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.199 
outside doing a lot more stuff as well
you're<00:03:03.400> probably<00:03:03.519> gonna<00:03:03.730> give<00:03:03.879> me<00:03:03.970> getting

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
you're probably gonna give me getting

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.319 
you're probably gonna give me getting
dirtier<00:03:04.690> so<00:03:05.459> like<00:03:06.459> dust<00:03:06.700> and<00:03:06.970> all<00:03:07.030> that<00:03:07.150> sort

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
dirtier so like dust and all that sort

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.500 
dirtier so like dust and all that sort
of<00:03:07.420> stuff<00:03:07.480> like<00:03:07.900> mud<00:03:08.560> and<00:03:08.769> grass<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:09.880> or

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
of stuff like mud and grass and or

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.050 
of stuff like mud and grass and or
you<00:03:10.660> have<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:11.769> probably<00:03:12.340> want<00:03:12.609> to<00:03:12.639> wash<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:12.819> lot

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
you have and probably want to wash a lot

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.729 
you have and probably want to wash a lot
of<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.780> little<00:03:14.049> bit<00:03:14.170> more<00:03:14.290> but<00:03:14.470> not<00:03:14.590> too<00:03:14.709> much

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
of a little bit more but not too much

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.830 
of a little bit more but not too much
more<00:03:15.069> you<00:03:15.160> know<00:03:15.220> almost<00:03:15.430> too<00:03:15.609> much<00:03:15.700> more<00:03:15.970> and

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
more you know almost too much more and

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.220 
more you know almost too much more and
then<00:03:17.310> this<00:03:18.310> comes<00:03:18.459> into<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.790> winter<00:03:19.230> you

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
then this comes into the winter you

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.229 
then this comes into the winter you
probably<00:03:20.440> won't<00:03:20.769> be<00:03:20.920> rushing<00:03:21.190> them<00:03:21.609> quite<00:03:22.120> as

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
probably won't be rushing them quite as

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.720 
probably won't be rushing them quite as
often<00:03:22.389> maybe<00:03:22.720> once<00:03:23.139> or<00:03:23.889> twice<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:24.130> week<00:03:24.370> which

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
often maybe once or twice a week which

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.379 
often maybe once or twice a week which
is<00:03:24.880> you<00:03:25.030> know<00:03:25.060> that's<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.510> average<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:27.389> that's

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
is you know that's the average so that's

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.379 
is you know that's the average so that's
good<00:03:28.480> that's<00:03:28.900> when<00:03:29.079> you<00:03:29.170> start<00:03:29.440> seeing<00:03:29.620> the

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
good that's when you start seeing the

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.400 
good that's when you start seeing the
locking<00:03:31.389> up<00:03:31.510> again<00:03:31.810> they'll<00:03:32.019> go<00:03:32.139> through<00:03:32.170> that

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
locking up again they'll go through that

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.190 
locking up again they'll go through that
cycle<00:03:32.680> of<00:03:32.920> loose<00:03:33.730> hair<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:34.239> them<00:03:34.389> being<00:03:34.660> babied

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
cycle of loose hair to them being babied

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.440 
cycle of loose hair to them being babied
Reds<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.739> then<00:03:35.889> convert<00:03:36.430> into<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:37.209> rest<00:03:37.389> of

Reds to then convert into the rest of

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.750 
Reds to then convert into the rest of
your<00:03:37.540> threats<00:03:37.720> or<00:03:38.349> if<00:03:38.590> you<00:03:38.709> maintain<00:03:38.889> then<00:03:39.549> you

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
your threats or if you maintain then you

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.129 
your threats or if you maintain then you
might<00:03:40.180> have<00:03:40.269> already<00:03:40.359> been<00:03:40.630> taken<00:03:40.720> up<00:03:40.989> those

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
might have already been taken up those

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.110 
might have already been taken up those
loose<00:03:41.290> says<00:03:41.500> but<00:03:42.280> it<00:03:42.549> will<00:03:42.730> happen<00:03:42.880> naturally

eventually<00:03:44.609> and<00:03:46.169> yeah<00:03:47.169> so<00:03:47.470> wearing<00:03:47.769> hats<00:03:48.010> but

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
eventually and yeah so wearing hats but

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.580 
eventually and yeah so wearing hats but
obviously<00:03:48.810> downside<00:03:49.810> of<00:03:49.930> wearing<00:03:50.169> hats<00:03:50.410> all
