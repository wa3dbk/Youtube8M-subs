00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 the sum must be understood color 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:07.319
 seismic forecast are becoming more 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.750
 possible are more assertive and by the way 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.639
 yesterday many people without collapsing 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.139
 absolutely the social networks the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.880
 people thanked him for a lot 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.830
 those who are prepared to whom 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.990
 they call ticos they made the predictions of 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.789
 for example front ghost thank you 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.880
 for heaps 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.289
 I had not asked a question that 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.289
 had to do with what could be come 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.510
 with respect to the central area and thistle 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.309
 what happens is that this 82 that was generated 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.750
 yesterday could have repercussion in the area 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.879
 central and we know of removing 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.079
 received a lot of threats and that those 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.089
 Threats have been made in many 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.339
 moments to be silenced and not announce what 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:46.050
 who know they have to announce what 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:49.170
 newspapers say for the downtown area 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:55.480
 of the country in the coming days 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:01:00.430
 not the north with codes just 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:05.350
 occur a single moon cml 6.5 se 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:10.360
 activate this perfect moment and the 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:14.640
 next hours of sunshine north of Chile 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:19.560
 that is , from Antofagasta 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.750
 the same thing can happen 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.210
 attention I will explain what does not end 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.830
 to be Ricardo he does some time 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.420
 does not explain that one of the pillars for 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.460
 to be able to make these so successful 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.680
 civic forecasts had to do with 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.720
 solar storms partly and with the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.310
 ionospheric charge must not have the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.830
 turn a little bit more about the shared 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.080
 the clouds and purpose of what happened 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.340
 in the sun could in the next few hours 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.530
 six are saying to neither more nor less 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.930
 that there could be something in the menu south 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.950
 similar to what happened yesterday but 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.600
 maybe at a not so urbanized point 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.890
 let's continue with that but friends friend 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.720
 I want you to have to tell me 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.240
 the video please I want you to return 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.130
 Something similar can happen again or 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.170
 less intensity and you are talking 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.369
 ricardo of some ladies here in 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.369
 forward more less correct me 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:22.760
 and then by increasing the load 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:22.760
 of the area that can already be 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.400
 I remembered something that does sometime 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.400
 more less not much more than that look 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.959
 that a group of scientists finished 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.690
 somehow determining and 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.120
 confirming that before a large earthquake 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.370
 it was produced as a rainbow effect 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.870
 in the clouds and that has to do with what 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.489
 which is today that is how it is charged and 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:50.640
 only the sky 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:53.040
 then eclipse then let's say a 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.290
 Again again have reason 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.940
 those who are obviously being 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.370
 pioneers in this idea of how can 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.890
 understand when an earthquake or 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.330
 a strong earthquake and this one once again a 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.130
 point for you my combination of 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.700
 pantasma yes clearly yesterday the 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.560
 terms 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.330
 you people send pictures of clouds 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.700
 strange let's say they presented this 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.799
 colorful and finally you think 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.640
 with 40 inhabitants it seems that they look 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.290
 now old 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.420
 also save ricardo I want to contribute 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.069
 with another data yesterday review the report the 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.660
 time in detail for the northern area it 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.060
 I saw cleared all week included 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.190
 yesterday and today and change however change 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.560
 changes 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.390
 in the northern zone dawned very covered 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.340
 should open a little more to the 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.590
 late and for the rest of the days already 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.450
 returns to stabilize always says that 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.370
 that's not real if they say it's not real 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.880
 that of any connection to jon erice if 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.250
 before moving to my 45 years when there 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.319
 a strong tremor change what happens what 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.360
 it means it has been depopulated two years ago 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.459
 days and it's going to continue like that they come out are 100 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.110
 says see science insists on keeping 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.220
 that there is no connection between the 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.810
 tremors the moments and with the 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.810
 earthquakes over time however 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.430
 there is a relationship with time 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.160
 generates creates pressures because the psoe 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.390
 Nica was also part of the system 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.640
 the different elements of the equation 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.870
 that you pre-set to determine the 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.870
 prognosis we decide true 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.090
 time 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.900
 quite 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.360
 rich about that just 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.460
 I want I know I do not want you will lock 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.410
 envy I know that you have us a 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.810
 definitive theoretical framework regarding this 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.419
 but I understand, I think you do not 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.330
 discard what the moon can generate 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.280
 full on triggering a tremor more 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.889
 strong that that will happen if I do not 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.160
 I mistake next April 15 that 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:55.410
 It is usually the beginning 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.410
 before the full moon 2 days 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.690
 let say 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.690
 now simply the invitation that 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.270
 made for us we have 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.009
 programs that not only until noon 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.410
 you can be attentive to everything 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.150
 that publishes front ghosts and acs already a 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.560
 great hugs congratulations friends of mine 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.130
 and thank you very much for this contact 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.130
 crucial
