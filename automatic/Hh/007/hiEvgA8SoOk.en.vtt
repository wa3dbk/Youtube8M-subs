00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.940
 comment on a completely different game on which I have an optimization 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.240
 today UCI 3 at the start 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.210
 and I would say I just found out how to tell her 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.890
 ever a modification of the most recent at his worst this game on 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.960
 using this console said to be his friend that definitely takes the time 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.419
 whole broadcast min it is relatively easy 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:23.390
 He does not want to claim there 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.259
 then I know Aabar 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:26.999
 it could be easier 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:30.189
 yes and maybe just to hold on why that's what we'll do now 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.930
 find out together against the 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.380
 yes guess that you can just quit the internet at the moment 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.300
 Run browser, go back or notice a location and then download 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.920
 It's on the hard drive, so to speak, and then you had the opportunity 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.950
 to combine with the game that is not so but a small detour 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.700
 Generali who me he is now that you can bring closer you but can 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.120
 Parallel or even the proof by too fast were again barons in the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.370
 Concentration camps were on tour soon wide that you can meticulously again 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.080
 clarified under this article you will find a small video with us 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.420
 is looking for this modification case is already one of these 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.490
 To look at any map you can do that by clicking on this video Kinect 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.560
 Quite simply, I'm just waiting for nothing 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.850
 ZM what logically even with the console 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.050
 that special 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.540
 then you can n these consular officials of Zarges Heistenbach 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.510
 Network and you need either a usb-stick or a memory card like that and 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.070
 then at the beginning of march I also already have a toenail who likes my computer 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.480
 affiliated 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.690
 Thank you Fachwart he as follows we create a partner that means the first three 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.980
 There so nice 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.970
 lsw this folder is created by a subspecies of the IV dat op 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.170
 a now from once the most important has definitely around 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.500
 honestly this folder should be the LGS time 1 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.670
 Hirst no Bread will continue the NPD pro Athens made contribution rate to yes 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.700
 that's actually for a ticket to the game because depending on whether you're on 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.510
 my german european 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.459
 Roda 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.459
 American version of Anett Herrmann 2008 2007 Wichmann a meter times 3 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.760
 there would have to make changes accordingly 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.489
 Here is the name of the folder for the German version 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.909
 allowed exactly in the article linked but is definitely also the page again 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:31.859
 Qt's three themed incomes are related to garbage cans 3 Motz Maps was 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.709
 synonymous always turns and then it is also explained how to do that 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.639
 Example with the European or American version 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.629
 yes, she was the only place that stopped us a bit 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.879
 if you managed that percent I know the hardest part actually 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:44.439
 already tight 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:48.980
 not until he starts attacking the console itself 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:53.629
 dat thing internet browser it's all huge easier than workshop 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.449
 Call the internet browser and call the following page on this 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:59.409
 Pothier 3 Motz 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.249
 So, at the moment, come to her 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:06.349
 There you have to find two download links 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.069
 and there then kicked and then you will experience already 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.900
 prompted on your USB device so say the memory card had October 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.129
 to access the aesthetics and since he knows all the folders before 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.699
 has created that is not a problem at all 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:28.229
 their share is this but thank you very easily create so s3 Internet 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:32.189
 up to 11 darters and then the stocks mentioned fort folder 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:37.189
 the first league 31 on it and Lauritz then the modification in this folder 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.060
 exactly in the duel 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.099
 b i'm not saying that's actually 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.929
 the only thing you can say that is a bit peaceful that you take this detour 

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:51.039
 must serve over the usb-stick and not on the hard disk loading can 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.499
 directly 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:55.689
 but if you did that, it's easy if you have enough 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.480
 the strong play to what extent a ton 3 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.709
 the CDA then just show you ZAK weeks Master in Lorsch 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:03.309
 UBI 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:06.329
 Lawrence raises but three of the army 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.149
 it is being done 

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:13.159
 Community luck one of the first foci of us to «low» 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.499
 should jump in the face immediately 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:19.069
 and if you did that there is a rubric called my 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:20.489
 content 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.129
 and in there 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:26.249
 you can already find imported pugs or maps 

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:28.949
 or can you say that you want to import world? 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.430
 and that after of course by specifying from where should that be imported 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.889
 here is community 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.419
 from the community on the ZOB Euro bring point Main content and there you can see 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.199
 Deathmatch Leo Deathmatch for example 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.499
 or I have the opportunity to go with the square on import and 

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:48.689
 can then say of possibly import currently is now the memory 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:52.449
 Card displayed you must now just connect the usb-stick front 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.479
 press on rookie he then looks at the data on it 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.210
 and then I would still need to press hockey if he asks me if I am 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.080
 want to protest and from then on sadly do nothing more than 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.370
 actually then whatever clearer would like multiplayer-maps 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.210
 Manufacturer BYD Inspire then there to become the / mode 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.210
 and under the normal girl just like you are living here 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.960
 then there is also the guys added version «Beyond zum 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.680
 Example love or silence 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.839
 occasionally a few times to Rheine 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:25.349
 but of course you can watch the whole video with us 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:28.149
 look at the article if you do not notice it now and easily if 

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:28.870
 get it right away 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.900
 Of course, a bit more accurate look at things because there's also the 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.309
 one or the other funny physics bauble 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:38.309
 ensures even start shooting 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.659
 Building site 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:43.539
 the partial wave broadcasting 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.479
 So he left several of them so often
