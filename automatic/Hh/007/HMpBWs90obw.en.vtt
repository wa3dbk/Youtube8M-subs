00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.160
 decorative curtains 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.679
 eyes and fireplaces where Thanos then most 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.609
 all you got into the room created 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.920
 famous artist Salvador gave 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:23.400
 which is called the face of the actress 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.180
 mei west today in our workshop 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.330
 playlaplay we will make the famous sofa 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.960
 gave for our favorite dolls from the fact that 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.930
 you already have a home you need dumb 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.480
 cartilage tissue i'm here only to you 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.730
 inspire if you want to make a sofa 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.010
 a different color or something to add your 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.370
 please use your imagination 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.010
 and so for barbie i will take pink for 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.770
 files and lilac you would need 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.360
 need sintepon or vata so what 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.199
 pillows and cardboard stuffed all the glue 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.600
 but I think you can find it all at home 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.680
 so i will take an ordinary sheet of paper folded 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.110
 him in half 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.479
 it should be about your length 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.930
 dolls if you do for barbie then 30 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:17.280
 centimeters and I'll polish it 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.500
 meadow relief 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:27.810
 just like you would draw a heart and then 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:34.100
 I will measure down for the back of the sofa I will measure 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.100
 about 8 centimeters down and 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:48.080
 right here I have a relief back 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.370
 sofa half back of the sofa 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:57.050
 then I will cut it out and here I am 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:59.270
 patterns I sofa that I put on 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.120
 carton 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:07.610
 I will circle and cut out 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:10.830
 such a back for the sofa and I will start 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:16.140
 glue it with glue you can take 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:24.250
 any glue should be hot and i will 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:26.680
 lay out sintepon like this 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.950
 just so I have it does not slide out 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.760
 fabric I cut out a rectangle with 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.160
 seam allowance 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:38.200
 about 45 centimeters on each side 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:43.830
 the right side of the material i will put on 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:49.900
 table and back on top and i'll start 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:52.260
 glue in a circle and glue 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.260
 like this 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.220
 and so I got the back of the sofa but 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.650
 something is not neatly behind me i believe that 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.560
 what everything you do should look like 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.629
 beautiful on all sides and i will close this 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.629
 another piece of materials 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.800
 please be very careful 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.900
 if you use hot glue or 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.080
 ask for help in adult and 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.250
 now it's time to do the bottom 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.170
 part of the sofa 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:12.690
 I will take again a piece of paper and 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:17.640
 measure it it should be back length 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:20.940
 couch folded it in half and draw a part 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:25.280
 lower lip and i will start drawing part 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.280
 lower lip less than the middle of the sheet 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:36.819
 and so I got the form not for 

00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:41.919
 the sofa and now I fold the fabric in half 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:45.019
 I 'll cut it out like that and make it 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:49.819
 leaving the back 

00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:52.429
 open so and so I stitched on 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:54.519
 typewriter not from the sofa you can flash 

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:58.309
 it by hand and to look neater 

00:04:54.519 --> 00:05:01.639
 when you turn out you can 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:04.479
 remove a few corners like this 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:07.479
 way where it bends and you will have 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.479
 neater 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:46.610
 and now I sewed the back of the sofa down and 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.330
 that's how it looks like when i have it 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.420
 flipped over 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.000
 he should look like this but he doesn't 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.340
 worth it I came up with this version 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.400
 so I tried several times and 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:01.100
 the best taking if you fold it 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.690
 so how do you want him to be 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:09.140
 and then hidden stitches when counting 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:11.750
 down to the top inside if it's hard for you 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.410
 ask yourself mom or 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.410
 girlfriend 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:28.060
 so our chic sofa is ready i am even 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.240
 attached a ribbon of feathers to it 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:35.050
 look how nice it turned out and I 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.940
 I also did a sofa for Twilight and I 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.889
 made her a bud and then she came from 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.889
 great idea on said mom so 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:43.690
 you can turn it over and I made it 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:45.790
 here so he even turned out more 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:49.060
 steady i attached from him such 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.800
