00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
got three by three

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.750 
got three by three
and<00:01:39.760> a<00:01:40.690> two<00:01:41.200> by<00:01:41.410> two<00:01:41.440> no<00:01:41.920> that's<00:01:42.160> not<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.400> two<00:01:42.610> by

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
and a two by two no that's not a two by

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.690 
and a two by two no that's not a two by
two<00:01:42.790> that's<00:01:43.450> a<00:01:43.600> box<00:01:43.810> of<00:01:44.110> air<00:01:44.620> so<00:01:45.190> I<00:01:45.220> guess<00:01:45.400> you

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
two that's a box of air so I guess you

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.090 
two that's a box of air so I guess you
just<00:01:45.910> sitting<00:01:46.120> that<00:01:46.330> for<00:01:46.960> packaging<00:01:47.560> purposes

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
just sitting that for packaging purposes

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.010 
just sitting that for packaging purposes
you<00:01:48.610> tricked<00:01:48.940> me<00:01:49.060> I<00:01:49.150> thought<00:01:49.390> I<00:01:49.420> got<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:49.660> two<00:01:49.720> by

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
you tricked me I thought I got a two by

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.200 
you tricked me I thought I got a two by
two<00:01:50.050> anyway<00:01:50.830> but<00:01:51.250> that's<00:01:51.490> just<00:01:51.700> fine<00:01:51.910> that's

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
two anyway but that's just fine that's

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.480 
two anyway but that's just fine that's
not<00:01:52.420> a<00:01:52.450> big<00:01:52.600> deal<00:01:52.980> alright<00:01:53.980> it<00:01:54.130> looks<00:01:54.190> like

not a big deal alright it looks like

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.490 
not a big deal alright it looks like
it's<00:01:54.730> on<00:01:54.850> another<00:01:54.970> Guan<00:01:55.390> long<00:01:55.630> which<00:01:56.020> is<00:01:56.050> a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
it's on another Guan long which is a

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.980 
it's on another Guan long which is a
great<00:01:56.800> cube<00:01:57.190> you<00:01:57.910> guys<00:01:58.090> aren't<00:01:58.540> familiar<00:01:58.750> with

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
there which would match up with that may

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.330 
there which would match up with that may
be<00:02:36.010> a<00:02:36.130> question<00:02:37.020> side<00:02:38.020> looks<00:02:38.680> like<00:02:38.890> one<00:02:39.160> two

anything out alright guys so we're back
and<00:02:57.730> as<00:02:57.880> you<00:02:58.030> can<00:02:58.209> see<00:02:58.239> I<00:02:58.660> finally<00:02:59.170> figured<00:02:59.350> it

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
and as you can see I finally figured it

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.390 
and as you can see I finally figured it
out<00:02:59.769> I<00:03:00.100> will<00:03:00.760> say<00:03:01.090> that<00:03:01.120> this<00:03:01.780> was<00:03:02.080> equally<00:03:03.070> as

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
out I will say that this was equally as

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.479 
out I will say that this was equally as
challenging<00:03:04.060> as<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.269> 42<00:03:05.260> cube<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:06.100> answer

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
challenging as the 42 cube the answer

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.670 
challenging as the 42 cube the answer
cube<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:07.060> this<00:03:07.090> one's<00:03:07.959> really<00:03:08.200> cool<00:03:08.440> it's<00:03:08.620> got

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
cube and this one's really cool it's got

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.800 
cube and this one's really cool it's got
a<00:03:08.769> lot<00:03:08.890> of<00:03:08.950> cool<00:03:09.160> stuff<00:03:09.190> on<00:03:09.549> it<00:03:09.610> you<00:03:09.760> see<00:03:09.940> lete

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
a lot of cool stuff on it you see lete

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.440 
a lot of cool stuff on it you see lete
or<00:03:11.220> 1337<00:03:12.220> there<00:03:12.430> with<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.760> question<00:03:13.180> mark

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
or 1337 there with the question mark

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.199 
or 1337 there with the question mark
we've<00:03:14.200> got<00:03:14.670> seven<00:03:15.670> times<00:03:15.940> seven<00:03:16.209> minus<00:03:16.420> 7<00:03:16.840> 42

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
we've got seven times seven minus 7 42

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.140 
we've got seven times seven minus 7 42
dots<00:03:19.209> on<00:03:19.510> two<00:03:19.780> dice<00:03:20.049> now<00:03:20.380> I'm<00:03:20.500> not<00:03:20.709> sure<00:03:21.150> what

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
dots on two dice now I'm not sure what

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.720 
dots on two dice now I'm not sure what
that<00:03:22.180> means<00:03:22.570> but<00:03:22.989> maybe<00:03:23.320> that's<00:03:23.620> just<00:03:23.739> these

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
that means but maybe that's just these

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.360 
that means but maybe that's just these
two<00:03:25.060> squares<00:03:25.420> I'm<00:03:25.750> not<00:03:25.959> sure<00:03:26.820> 14<00:03:27.820> times<00:03:28.030> 342

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
two squares I'm not sure 14 times 342

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.420 
two squares I'm not sure 14 times 342
binary<00:03:30.370> this<00:03:30.760> says<00:03:31.060> 42<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:31.989> six<00:03:32.890> times<00:03:33.160> six

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
binary this says 42 and six times six

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.819 
binary this says 42 and six times six
plus<00:03:34.090> six<00:03:34.330> that's<00:03:34.690> 42<00:03:35.110> so<00:03:35.350> that's<00:03:35.530> pretty<00:03:35.739> cool

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
plus six that's 42 so that's pretty cool

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.460 
plus six that's 42 so that's pretty cool
he<00:03:36.549> definitely<00:03:36.880> has<00:03:37.090> incorporated<00:03:37.329> 42<00:03:38.019> into

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
he definitely has incorporated 42 into

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.960 
he definitely has incorporated 42 into
this<00:03:38.590> probably<00:03:39.070> in<00:03:39.280> more<00:03:39.489> ways<00:03:39.670> than<00:03:39.700> I'm

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
this probably in more ways than I'm

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.780 
this probably in more ways than I'm
actually<00:03:40.239> seeing<00:03:40.660> and<00:03:41.049> I<00:03:42.040> thought<00:03:42.340> this<00:03:42.519> was<00:03:42.730> a

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
actually seeing and I thought this was a

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.420 
actually seeing and I thought this was a
really<00:03:43.239> cool<00:03:43.540> sticker<00:03:43.900> mod<00:03:44.170> now<00:03:44.739> i<00:03:44.769> will<00:03:45.250> say

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
really cool sticker mod now i will say

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.190 
really cool sticker mod now i will say
that<00:03:45.459> i<00:03:45.610> had<00:03:45.850> some<00:03:46.090> difficulties<00:03:46.660> with<00:03:46.690> it<00:03:47.019> and

sorry sorry Savannah I had to cheat a

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.069 
sorry sorry Savannah I had to cheat a
little<00:03:55.129> bit<00:03:55.280> but<00:03:55.939> I<00:03:55.969> still<00:03:56.239> solved<00:03:56.719> it<00:03:56.840> fair

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
little bit but I still solved it fair

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.869 
little bit but I still solved it fair
and<00:03:57.109> square<00:03:57.290> I<00:03:57.500> just<00:03:57.980> had<00:03:58.189> to<00:03:58.219> see<00:03:58.549> what<00:03:58.760> it

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
and square I just had to see what it

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.479 
and square I just had to see what it
looked<00:03:58.909> like<00:03:59.180> because<00:04:00.170> what<00:04:00.950> it<00:04:01.099> turned<00:04:01.340> out

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
looked like because what it turned out

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.259 
looked like because what it turned out
to<00:04:01.549> be<00:04:01.819> was<00:04:02.090> I<00:04:02.420> had<00:04:03.079> this<00:04:03.590> flipped<00:04:04.010> and<00:04:04.250> I<00:04:05.030> could

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
to be was I had this flipped and I could

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.319 
to be was I had this flipped and I could
not<00:04:05.420> solve<00:04:05.719> a<00:04:06.019> couple<00:04:06.409> other<00:04:06.620> of<00:04:06.889> the<00:04:07.180> edges<00:04:08.180> I

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
not solve a couple other of the edges I

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:09.789 
not solve a couple other of the edges I
thought<00:04:08.510> I<00:04:08.540> just<00:04:08.780> had<00:04:08.900> two<00:04:09.049> edges<00:04:09.379> slip<00:04:09.590> for<00:04:09.739> a

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
thought I just had two edges slip for a

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.589 
thought I just had two edges slip for a
little<00:04:09.889> while<00:04:10.099> and<00:04:10.430> I<00:04:10.760> was<00:04:10.909> super<00:04:11.180> confused

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
little while and I was super confused

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.959 
little while and I was super confused
until<00:04:11.780> I<00:04:11.930> realized<00:04:12.260> you<00:04:12.469> know<00:04:12.680> duck<00:04:13.099> that<00:04:13.819> one

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:13.969 
until I realized you know duck that one

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:15.369 
until I realized you know duck that one
right<00:04:14.090> there's<00:04:14.329> probably<00:04:14.689> flipped<00:04:15.019> and<00:04:15.260> it

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
right there's probably flipped and it

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.379 
right there's probably flipped and it
just<00:04:15.560> doesn't<00:04:15.920> matter<00:04:16.039> as<00:04:16.370> well<00:04:16.820> as<00:04:16.940> this<00:04:17.150> one

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
just doesn't matter as well as this one

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.060 
just doesn't matter as well as this one
luckily<00:04:17.600> I<00:04:17.780> didn't<00:04:18.109> have<00:04:18.199> this<00:04:18.350> twisted<00:04:18.829> I<00:04:18.919> got

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
luckily I didn't have this twisted I got

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.590
