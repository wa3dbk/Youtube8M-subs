world he feels no anxiety about it his
libido<00:05:05.730> was<00:05:06.000> somewhat<00:05:06.360> intact<00:05:06.720> but<00:05:07.140> his<00:05:07.350> urges

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770

and<00:05:07.890> feelings<00:05:08.790> and<00:05:08.880> everything<00:05:08.940> are<00:05:09.240> somehow

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
and feelings and everything are somehow

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.390 
and feelings and everything are somehow
suppressed<00:05:10.050> so<00:05:10.590> it's<00:05:10.740> very<00:05:10.830> interesting<00:05:11.190> to

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
suppressed so it's very interesting to

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.680 
suppressed so it's very interesting to
get<00:05:11.610> that<00:05:11.820> kind<00:05:12.030> of<00:05:12.060> dynamic<00:05:12.240> and<00:05:12.630> I

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
get that kind of dynamic and I

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:13.790 
get that kind of dynamic and I
definitely<00:05:12.960> think<00:05:13.320> the<00:05:13.410> light<00:05:13.560> novels

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
definitely think the light novels

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.530 
definitely think the light novels
probably<00:05:14.070> go<00:05:14.160> even<00:05:14.400> deeper<00:05:14.550> into<00:05:15.000> his<00:05:15.090> his

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
probably go even deeper into his his

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.780 
probably go even deeper into his his
psyche<00:05:15.990> at<00:05:16.110> this<00:05:16.290> point<00:05:16.560> but<00:05:17.040> dude<00:05:17.400> Demi<00:05:17.669> are
