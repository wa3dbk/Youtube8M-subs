physicals to the front of the chest lift

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
physicals to the front of the chest lift
this<00:00:18.420> up<00:00:18.630> like<00:00:19.439> this<00:00:19.500> ease<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.369> up<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:21.230> it'll

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
this up like this ease that up and it'll

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.939 
this up like this ease that up and it'll
lift<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.859> it'll<00:00:23.609> keep<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.210> same<00:00:24.949> it'll

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
lift this it'll keep this the same it'll

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.189 
lift this it'll keep this the same it'll
lift<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.490> make<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.090> harness<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.960> little

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
where the center is put it there

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.150 
where the center is put it there
pin<00:02:16.190> it<00:02:16.370> there<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.209> go<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.600> then<00:02:18.590> once<00:02:18.950> that's

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
set put right sides together again

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.290 
set put right sides together again
hopefully<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.280> got<00:02:25.400> a<00:02:25.459> little<00:02:25.700> point<00:02:25.970> I<00:02:26.120> don't

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
have one in here we'll put right sides

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:35.020 
have one in here we'll put right sides
together<00:02:28.400> line<00:02:29.090> up<00:02:29.269> those<00:02:29.390> points<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:34.030> so

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
together line up those points and so

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.059
