00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.450 
temple of light but that was almost two
years<00:01:11.570> ago<00:01:11.630> when<00:01:11.930> this<00:01:12.079> is<00:01:12.200> up<00:01:12.380> almost<00:01:13.159> two

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
years ago when this is up almost two

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.429 
years ago when this is up almost two
years<00:01:13.640> ago<00:01:14.140> that's<00:01:15.140> insane<00:01:16.840> that<00:01:17.840> is<00:01:17.990> insanity

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
years ago that's insane that is insanity

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.740 
years ago that's insane that is insanity
how<00:01:18.950> do<00:01:19.009> I<00:01:19.430> should<00:01:20.299> have<00:01:20.390> done<00:01:20.509> one<00:01:20.659> before

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
how do I should have done one before

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.630 
how do I should have done one before
then<00:01:21.170> but<00:01:21.350> I<00:01:21.619> guess<00:01:22.159> it<00:01:22.280> makes<00:01:22.399> it<00:01:22.520> more

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
then but I guess it makes it more

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.880 
then but I guess it makes it more
special<00:01:22.700> because<00:01:23.270> obviously<00:01:23.770> been<00:01:24.770> on

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
special because obviously been on

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.910 
special because obviously been on
YouTube<00:01:25.039> for<00:01:25.280> four<00:01:25.850> years<00:01:26.030> now<00:01:26.469> only<00:01:27.469> done<00:01:27.679> two

two-part videos for Lego so I guess I

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:35.410 
two-part videos for Lego so I guess I
stand<00:01:31.310> out<00:01:32.439> yeah<00:01:33.439> so<00:01:34.340> carrying<00:01:34.850> on<00:01:34.969> some<00:01:35.359> of

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
you may have noticed that this video is

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.590 
you may have noticed that this video is
a<00:01:37.340> bit<00:01:37.460> different<00:01:37.700> how<00:01:38.030> we<00:01:38.090> do<00:01:38.359> things

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
a bit different how we do things

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.499 
a bit different how we do things
normally<00:01:39.170> but<00:01:40.009> depending<00:01:40.310> on<00:01:40.429> plot<00:01:40.700> like<00:01:41.270> the

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
normally but depending on plot like the

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.029 
normally but depending on plot like the
the<00:01:41.869> store<00:01:42.109> is<00:01:42.229> a<00:01:42.259> bit<00:01:42.409> different<00:01:42.590> than<00:01:42.889> normal

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
the store is a bit different than normal

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.120 
the store is a bit different than normal

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
can't fight since he would because he

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.180 
can't fight since he would because he
looks<00:03:07.640> up<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:07.910> him<00:03:08.060> he<00:03:08.210> season<00:03:08.630> as<00:03:08.810> a<00:03:09.190> mentor

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
yeah that's the kind of idea I fought

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.770

it's like they're friends and I can't do
it<00:03:32.810> and<00:03:33.020> we<00:03:33.170> know<00:03:33.290> Kai<00:03:33.590> is<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.580> I<00:03:34.940> say<00:03:35.810> he's<00:03:36.080> got

probably<00:03:36.500> one<00:03:36.620> he's<00:03:37.010> got<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.280> strongest<00:03:37.490> bond

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880

probably one he's got the strongest bond
for<00:03:38.060> sensei<00:03:38.360> will<00:03:38.510> have<00:03:38.690> everyone<00:03:39.020> I<00:03:39.380> think

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
the Chi and woo relationship is a lot

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.870 
the Chi and woo relationship is a lot
stronger<00:03:42.320> than<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.680> other<00:03:42.800> ninja<00:03:43.190> apartment

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880

probably<00:03:44.150> Lloyd<00:03:44.780> maybe<00:03:45.290> in<00:03:45.470> Garmadon<00:03:46.270> but<00:03:47.270> I

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
probably Lloyd maybe in Garmadon but I

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.550 
probably Lloyd maybe in Garmadon but I
thought<00:03:47.540> that<00:03:47.600> was<00:03:47.810> really<00:03:48.170> important<00:03:48.500> to

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
thought that was really important to

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.350 
thought that was really important to
show<00:03:48.800> and<00:03:49.070> I<00:03:49.190> also<00:03:49.400> kind<00:03:49.610> of<00:03:49.760> built<00:03:49.970> this<00:03:50.150> up

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
show and I also kind of built this up

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.780 
show and I also kind of built this up
the<00:03:50.990> reason<00:03:51.410> why<00:03:51.830> that<00:03:52.340> little<00:03:52.520> scene

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
the reason why that little scene

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.160 
the reason why that little scene
appeared<00:03:53.090> of<00:03:53.240> crime<00:03:53.450> ruin<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.840> Christmas

have a little seen the temple of light
like<00:04:18.650> I<00:04:18.919> decided<00:04:19.370> to<00:04:19.520> cut<00:04:19.760> it<00:04:20.410> just<00:04:21.410> because

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
like I decided to cut it just because

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.220 
like I decided to cut it just because
the<00:04:21.830> video<00:04:21.950> is<00:04:22.100> getting<00:04:22.400> quite<00:04:22.580> long<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:24.020> I

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
the video is getting quite long and I

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.170 
the video is getting quite long and I
thought<00:04:24.530> it'd<00:04:24.710> be<00:04:24.740> better<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.460> focus<00:04:25.700> on<00:04:26.060> the

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
thought it'd be better to focus on the

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.450 
thought it'd be better to focus on the
2011<00:04:26.810> sets<00:04:27.050> because<00:04:27.169> if<00:04:27.830> you<00:04:27.980> guys<00:04:28.220> have<00:04:28.400> been

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
2011 sets because if you guys have been

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.280 
2011 sets because if you guys have been
watching<00:04:28.700> since<00:04:29.090> I<00:04:29.240> started<00:04:29.510> these<00:04:29.810> videos

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
his video I hope yes so it was the

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.540 
his video I hope yes so it was the
cliffhanger<00:04:54.020> but<00:04:54.140> the<00:04:54.440> Destructoid's<00:04:55.250> are<00:04:55.400> in

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
cliffhanger but the Destructoid's are in

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.170 
cliffhanger but the Destructoid's are in
this<00:04:55.730> one<00:04:55.940> after<00:04:56.240> so<00:04:57.230> long<00:04:57.260> them<00:04:58.100> not<00:04:58.460> being<00:04:58.880> in

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
this one after so long them not being in

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.290 
this one after so long them not being in
it<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.480> people<00:04:59.990> died<00:05:00.710> to<00:05:00.860> mention<00:05:01.160> it<00:05:01.300> yeah

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
it and people died to mention it yeah

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.120 
it and people died to mention it yeah
but<00:05:02.510> the<00:05:02.720> structure<00:05:02.960> words<00:05:03.170> are<00:05:03.260> in<00:05:03.350> this<00:05:03.440> this

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
but the structure words are in this this

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.260 
but the structure words are in this this
was<00:05:04.250> the<00:05:04.280> plan<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:04.670> whole<00:05:04.820> time<00:05:04.880> the

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
was the plan the whole time the

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.520 
was the plan the whole time the
Destructoid's<00:05:05.840> were<00:05:05.990> planned<00:05:06.320> for<00:05:06.380> the

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
Destructoid's were planned for the

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.860 
Destructoid's were planned for the
animated<00:05:06.890> movie<00:05:06.920> too<00:05:07.360> they<00:05:08.360> were<00:05:08.510> going<00:05:08.690> to<00:05:08.720> be

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
animated movie too they were going to be

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.360 
animated movie too they were going to be
in<00:05:08.960> it<00:05:09.140> but<00:05:09.350> I<00:05:09.410> decided<00:05:09.890> that<00:05:10.100> it<00:05:10.250> would<00:05:10.310> be

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
in it but I decided that it would be

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.660 
in it but I decided that it would be
better<00:05:10.610> it<00:05:11.420> would<00:05:11.540> be<00:05:11.630> better<00:05:11.810> to<00:05:12.430> keep<00:05:13.430> all<00:05:13.640> of

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:13.670 
better it would be better to keep all of

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.370 
better it would be better to keep all of
them<00:05:14.000> and<00:05:14.240> then<00:05:14.330> they<00:05:14.510> could<00:05:14.570> be<00:05:14.780> used<00:05:15.020> in<00:05:15.260> the

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
them and then they could be used in the

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.070 
them and then they could be used in the
finale<00:05:15.650> of<00:05:15.950> rebooted<00:05:16.550> instead<00:05:16.910> to<00:05:17.840> eat<00:05:17.990> that

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
finale of rebooted instead to eat that

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.720 
finale of rebooted instead to eat that

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920 
planned the finale for the tournament

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.550 
planned the finale for the tournament
series<00:05:25.310> already<00:05:25.610> I<00:05:26.170> haven't<00:05:27.170> but<00:05:27.260> I<00:05:27.350> could

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
series already I haven't but I could

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.380 
series already I haven't but I could
have<00:05:29.050> yeah<00:05:30.050> anyway<00:05:30.410> but<00:05:31.070> the<00:05:31.280> structured<00:05:31.730> was

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
have yeah anyway but the structured was

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.930 
have yeah anyway but the structured was
planned<00:05:32.690> this<00:05:33.530> entire<00:05:33.740> time<00:05:34.190> to<00:05:34.610> be<00:05:34.730> in<00:05:34.820> the

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
planned this entire time to be in the

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.090 
planned this entire time to be in the
finale<00:05:35.110> so<00:05:36.110> I<00:05:36.140> think<00:05:36.200> the<00:05:36.470> enjoyed<00:05:36.830> are<00:05:36.950> quite

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
finale so I think the enjoyed are quite

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.650 
finale so I think the enjoyed are quite
frightening<00:05:37.430> on<00:05:37.580> their<00:05:37.670> own<00:05:37.820> if<00:05:38.060> you<00:05:38.210> remember

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
frightening on their own if you remember

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.800 
frightening on their own if you remember
from<00:05:38.690> the<00:05:39.760> the<00:05:40.760> actual<00:05:40.880> series<00:05:41.510> that<00:05:41.660> was

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
from the the actual series that was

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.130 
from the the actual series that was
enough<00:05:42.080> episode<00:05:42.710> 2<00:05:42.980> I<00:05:43.630> think<00:05:44.630> the<00:05:44.720> first<00:05:44.900> time

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
enough episode 2 I think the first time
