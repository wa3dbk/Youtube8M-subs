00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.049 

I<00:00:42.810> was<00:00:43.470> always<00:00:43.740> interested

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
I was always interested

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.110 
I was always interested
in<00:00:46.570> spiritual<00:00:47.320> experience

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
in spiritual experience

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.380 
in spiritual experience
I<00:00:50.039> was<00:00:51.039> interested<00:00:51.399> in<00:00:51.640> the<00:00:51.730> concept<00:00:52.270> that

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
I was interested in the concept that

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.830 
I was interested in the concept that
there<00:00:52.539> was<00:00:52.629> something<00:00:53.050> beyond

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
there was something beyond

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.170 
there was something beyond
whatever<00:00:54.530> just<00:00:54.770> immediately

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.440 

I<00:00:59.240> believe<00:01:00.020> that<00:01:00.200> spiritual<00:01:00.710> experience<00:01:01.450> can

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
I believe that spiritual experience can

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.580 
I believe that spiritual experience can
happen<00:01:02.810> in<00:01:02.900> many<00:01:03.080> different<00:01:03.290> settings<00:01:05.410> it<00:01:06.410> can

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
happen in many different settings it can

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.850 
happen in many different settings it can
happen<00:01:07.330> in<00:01:08.330> churches<00:01:08.900> and<00:01:08.930> synagogues<00:01:09.260> and

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
happen in churches and synagogues and

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.400 
happen in churches and synagogues and
mosques<00:01:10.240> but<00:01:11.240> I<00:01:11.420> think<00:01:11.660> it<00:01:11.780> can<00:01:11.900> also<00:01:12.080> happen

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
mosques but I think it can also happen

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.360 
mosques but I think it can also happen
in<00:01:12.710> concert<00:01:13.160> halls<00:01:13.370> I<00:01:13.780> think<00:01:14.780> it<00:01:14.900> can<00:01:15.050> happen

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
in concert halls I think it can happen

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:22.240

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.740 
endeavor I have
and<00:03:30.480> I<00:03:30.630> think<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.110> spiritual<00:03:31.650> experience

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
and I think that spiritual experience

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.650 
and I think that spiritual experience
helps<00:03:33.750> us<00:03:33.870> do<00:03:34.140> that<00:03:34.350> I<00:03:34.410> think<00:03:34.830> it<00:03:35.210> helps<00:03:36.210> inform

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
helps us do that I think it helps inform

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:44.150 
helps us do that I think it helps inform
us<00:03:37.350> on<00:03:37.710> how<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.340> live<00:03:40.760> it<00:03:41.760> shapes<00:03:42.150> us<00:03:43.160> it

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
us on how to live it shapes us it

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.250 
us on how to live it shapes us it
changes<00:03:45.020> the<00:03:46.020> way<00:03:46.230> we<00:03:46.260> encounter<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.130> world

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
changes the way we encounter the world

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.420 
changes the way we encounter the world
so<00:03:49.260> we<00:03:49.680> have<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:50.040> try<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.459> do<00:03:50.790> good<00:03:52.130> to<00:03:53.130> try<00:03:53.370> to

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
so we have to try to do good to try to

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.340 
so we have to try to do good to try to
improve<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:54.060> world<00:03:54.300> to<00:03:54.780> make<00:03:54.959> it<00:03:54.990> a<00:03:55.170> better

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
improve the world to make it a better

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.650 
improve the world to make it a better
place<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:56.510> think<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:58.100> any<00:03:59.100> single<00:03:59.730> act<00:03:59.970> that

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
place I think that any single act that

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.920 
place I think that any single act that
you<00:04:00.900> do<00:04:01.140> potentially<00:04:02.300> could<00:04:03.300> change<00:04:03.600> the

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
you do potentially could change the

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:04.570 
you do potentially could change the
world

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
world

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.920 
world
so<00:04:05.580> I<00:04:05.610> have<00:04:05.850> to<00:04:06.030> make<00:04:06.180> every<00:04:06.480> one<00:04:06.660> of<00:04:06.690> them

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
so I have to make every one of them

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.140 
so I have to make every one of them
count
