00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
actually in size medium size so she

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.180 
actually in size medium size so she
actually<00:00:35.489> started<00:00:36.149> putting<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.690> small<00:00:37.190> ones

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
actually started putting the small ones

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.739 
actually started putting the small ones
in<00:00:38.489> because<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:38.879> asked<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.179> wanted<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.480> kind<00:00:39.659> of

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:39.749 
in because I asked I wanted to kind of

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:41.119 
in because I asked I wanted to kind of
see<00:00:39.870> what<00:00:40.019> the<00:00:40.079> small<00:00:40.320> look<00:00:40.499> like<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.980> then<00:00:41.070> I

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
see what the small look like and then I

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.549 
see what the small look like and then I
was<00:00:41.249> like<00:00:41.399> let's<00:00:42.149> stop<00:00:42.329> there<00:00:43.109> little<00:00:43.289> bit<00:00:43.379> too

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
was like let's stop there little bit too

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.849 
was like let's stop there little bit too
small<00:00:43.679> but<00:00:44.519> she<00:00:44.909> um<00:00:45.260> so<00:00:46.260> she<00:00:46.319> said<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.620> is

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:46.859 
small but she um so she said this is

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.079 
small but she um so she said this is
probably<00:00:47.159> being<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> back<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.760> my<00:00:47.879> be<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
probably being the back of my be the

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:49.639 
probably being the back of my be the
medium<00:00:48.390> size<00:00:48.600> but<00:00:48.809> she<00:00:48.899> put<00:00:49.050> out<00:00:49.170> four<00:00:49.409> or<00:00:49.499> five

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
medium size but she put out four or five

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.930 
medium size but she put out four or five
different<00:00:49.829> ones<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.579> guess<00:00:50.730> they're<00:00:50.909> like

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
different ones I guess they're like

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.910 
different ones I guess they're like
different<00:00:51.390> types<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.690> patterns<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.679> guess

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
different types of patterns so I guess

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.469 
different types of patterns so I guess
she<00:00:53.069> wanted<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.429> just<00:00:53.609> kind<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.909> see<00:00:54.179> you<00:00:54.449> know

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:54.479 
she wanted to just kind of see you know

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:57.110 
she wanted to just kind of see you know
which<00:00:54.989> pattern<00:00:55.620> my<00:00:55.890> hair<00:00:56.129> kind<00:00:56.339> of<00:00:56.489> took<00:00:56.670> or

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
which pattern my hair kind of took or

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.450 
which pattern my hair kind of took or
whatever<00:00:57.839> I<00:00:57.899> guess<00:00:57.960> for<00:00:58.199> technique<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:58.979> I'll

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
whatever I guess for technique so I'll

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.860 
whatever I guess for technique so I'll
be<00:00:59.670> back<00:00:59.879> January<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.199> 18th<00:01:01.850> to<00:01:02.850> have<00:01:03.719> her
