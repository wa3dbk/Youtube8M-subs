um and i'll give you a general rancor

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.280 
um and i'll give you a general rancor
all<00:02:54.030> obviously<00:02:54.570> started<00:02:54.870> off<00:02:54.959> at<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.110> lower

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
all obviously started off at a lower

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.949 
all obviously started off at a lower
rank<00:02:55.560> but<00:02:55.769> I'll<00:02:56.610> think<00:02:56.850> of<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.180> rake<00:02:57.390> ranking

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
rank but I'll think of a rake ranking

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.530 
rank but I'll think of a rake ranking
system<00:02:58.290> sometime<00:02:58.680> just<00:02:59.060> in<00:03:00.060> case<00:03:00.209> when<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.420> get
