00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.109
 hi everyone this is peanuts 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.460
 I hope you are well 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.050
 we find ourselves today for a 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.960
 gameplay a little bit so 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.100
 already we are on the month of one year by two 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.510
 a little bit in the shake did not 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.430
 wrong I was a little tired of 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.300
 see that from the ghost youtube of which I am 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.739
 I said a little while longer 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.589
 by two it will change 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.449
 and so we are on the terminal map in 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:47.860
 general melee I'll see you that 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.199
 these general scrums a little bit on purpose 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.629
 and I make a real carnage there 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.430
 no other word I play with the sniper 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.989
 so the intervention one of the best 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.489
 sniper and it's also one of 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.760
 main topics of good commentary 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.449
 so snipers short I'll enjoy 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.860
 that the strictest 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.939
 I 'm going to throw but you'll see 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.680
 that killstreaks do not serve me 

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:07.270
 strictly to nothing that is to say that I 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.830
 throw them there I unlock the laurels 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.000
 by the way I will launch but who 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.560
 strict but I will do absolutely 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.240
 no he's with so that's right 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.320
 it was the equivalent of not having 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.240
 in fact, finally, I'm really looking forward to 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.549
 nothing in my series of they're going to me 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.930
 nothing brought I will play too with the 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.759
 nuclear bomb so to follow 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.930
 we will see if in the general fray I 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.119
 will succeed to unblock the bomb 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.530
 nuclear or not so brief you've seen 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.450
 that there I link very very well 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.040
 enemies and I already have eleven who I'm going to 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.630
 unlock my apache self 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.740
 I'm not going to launch it though and 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.070
 you will see later what will 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.480
 happen 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.680
 in short, I have a little bit of time 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.110
 to talk a little bit about my subject 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.490
 commentary so that is to say the snipers 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.030
 I wanted to talk a little about 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.380
 snipers because I think it got you 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.580
 of invention this is one of the best 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.380
 sniper of all call of duty 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.210
 confused so I do not know if you 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.040
 reject my opinion on it but it's 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.900
 true that so I had not touched mw2 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.640
 since jack m a lot of time and I 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.710
 will play again to ghost and his blackhawks 2 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.100
 black ops short a little bit every 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.770
 call of 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.229
 before the mw2 and it's true that the 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.940
 snipers are not that good so what 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.190
 there by returning to modern warfare 2 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.750
 edit interventions 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.039
 it's really pure pleasure and 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.379
 besides georges also at kotka there 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.269
 not long ago and I tested the 40 m to 3 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:16.090
 and for me it's really the two of them 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.620
 two best sniper to call of duty 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.480
 confused so there is no other 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.129
 scary styles they are up to 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.780
 these two there after that is that my opinion 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.489
 staff I do not know what you 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.420
 think 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.280
 tell me by the way by comment 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.629
 what snipers do you prefer 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.340
 what are the snipers you use 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.410
 more often there was also the bar is 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.790
 what a hero 50 that was pretty good 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.079
 but OK 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.640
 we could have this loan so it was not 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.409
 terrible but by cons in blow by 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.730
 stroke 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:41.019
 frankly the intervention of 40 m to 3 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.120
 these are for me the two best 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.680
 Snipers no photo and it's true 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.269
 that it's a little pity that we 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.040
 do not find that kind of sniper in the 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.859
 new call of duty to the passage of 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.450
 blockages of the neck so bomb 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.680
 nuclear melee general soon the 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.840
 end of the game there I made you 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.090

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.769
 I support 25 he I'm going to do a little 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.959
