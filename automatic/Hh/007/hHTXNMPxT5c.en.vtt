00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
inch nickel silver crash it's probably

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.129 
inch nickel silver crash it's probably
was<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.400> ride<00:00:14.670> originally<00:00:15.240> Irie<00:00:15.660> hammered<00:00:16.020> it

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
was a ride originally Irie hammered it

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.890 
was a ride originally Irie hammered it
into<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.500> crash<00:00:17.340> been<00:00:18.090> playing<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.570> for<00:00:18.600> about<00:00:18.869> a

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
into a crash been playing it for about a

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.510 
into a crash been playing it for about a
year<00:00:19.230> since<00:00:19.439> then<00:00:19.740> little<00:00:20.220> maybe<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.400> little

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
year since then little maybe a little

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.609 
year since then little maybe a little
more<00:00:20.670> than<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.910> year<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.330> it's<00:00:21.779> now<00:00:22.050> got<00:00:22.320> a

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
more than a year and it's now got a

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.200 
more than a year and it's now got a
small<00:00:23.310> crack<00:00:23.760> right<00:00:24.060> here<00:00:24.230> about<00:00:26.029> 5/16<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.119> an

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
small crack right here about 5/16 of an

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.320 
small crack right here about 5/16 of an
inch<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.859> was<00:00:29.340> thinking<00:00:29.640> about<00:00:29.730> cutting<00:00:30.119> it

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
inch so I was thinking about cutting it

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.720 
inch so I was thinking about cutting it
on<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.539> lathe<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.340> you<00:00:32.340> know<00:00:32.369> getting

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
on the lathe and and you know getting

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.340 
on the lathe and and you know getting
rid<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.030> little<00:00:33.300> edge<00:00:33.480> there<00:00:33.780> but<00:00:34.079> I

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
rid of that little edge there but I

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.840 
rid of that little edge there but I
think<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.829> would<00:00:34.920> change<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.370> sound<00:00:35.610> too

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
think that would change the sound too

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.880 
think that would change the sound too
much<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.719> what<00:00:36.840> I'm<00:00:36.930> gonna<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.649> I'm<00:00:37.860> just

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
much so what I'm gonna do is I'm just

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.700 
much so what I'm gonna do is I'm just
gonna<00:00:38.129> drill<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.700> out<00:00:39.079> using<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.350> drill<00:00:40.559> press

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
gonna drill it out using the drill press

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.910 
gonna drill it out using the drill press
and<00:00:41.129> then<00:00:41.700> I'm<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.450> take<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.440> bandsaw

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
and then I'm going to take the bandsaw

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.330 
and then I'm going to take the bandsaw
and<00:00:44.219> trim<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.180> off<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.980> round<00:00:46.980> out<00:00:47.190> the

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
and trim it off and round out the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.010 
and trim it off and round out the
corners<00:00:47.520> very<00:00:47.910> similar<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.510> what<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.660> did<00:00:48.780> in

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
corners very similar to what I did in

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.520 
corners very similar to what I did in
episode<00:00:49.140> 48<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.579> Paiste<00:00:51.059> cymbals<00:00:51.170> so<00:00:52.170> here

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:48.770 
that didn't go so hot
that's<00:01:08.970> all<00:01:09.210> dead

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.240 

okay<00:01:49.780> now<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.050> repair<00:01:50.470> is<00:01:50.500> done<00:01:50.800> it's<00:01:51.070> all
