00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello channel I killed you today 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:10.410
 I will show the legs automatically st-1 tactical 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.960
 response tr3 matchmaker limited edition 8 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.000
 full eighty nine hundredths 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:21.570
 centimeter blade 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:23.850
 rt tr3 matchmaker and this is so completely 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.490
 He is called if I did not have under 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.019
 hand paper I would not say it exactly 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:34.770
 and so there is a little button here 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:36.870
 shifted from the handle centerline over here 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.700
 closer to you like flour I'll try now 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.910
 click what's out of it most likely 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:49.350
 the blade is some kind of black coating 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:52.129
 similar to paint 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.129
 say about this knife 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.710
 and what else can really say about 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.240
 Does this knife just have to say for a long time ? 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.690
 will still be interested in what is behind 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.410
 steel 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:12.230
 keep this knife simple 154 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:14.690
 B m is a steel powder or not, I do not 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.400
 I know powder we have no owner too 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.770
 Do I know where the powder is believed to 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.780
 the handle here is longitudinal such long 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.240
 to keep it comfortable and not really 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.920
 not done not in vain the hand does not slip 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.470
 there is a clip clip rearranged 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.750
 it cannot be only in one position 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:37.720
 three holes attached here 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.720
 very nice plastic or is it iron 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:45.680
 This is an aviation fool, I will ask 7 to someone 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:54.520
 plastic and very cool 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:54.520
 good coverage of paris to lyre 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.710
 annotated aluminum alloy 366 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:12.620
 then 6 nuclear aluminum alloy t6 here in 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.440
 hands holding a very nice rough 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.920
 so good i don't know how he will 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.610
 cut 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:24.380
 these are no less acute tests for something 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.690
 like jealousy to 4 as they say 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.790
 experts all knives need to be driven 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:34.340
 undermine the factory to the point she cuts 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.960
 all the same good for the average man in the street 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.300
 even more than 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:44.150
 and for people like me so generally super duper 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:48.360
 so here are these slots 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.010
 so as not to slip a finger here probably 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.340
 this is called in poland blades i am so 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:57.320
 guess bevel i will try to fold 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:00.420
 this boy here he goes goes go go 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.890
 snaps in somehow there is no such click 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.370
 he just seems so very that he 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.370
 sticks there so 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.569
 yes it is 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.459
 sticking some kind of plastic click 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.189
 so soft and very pleasant that is 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.549
 no such growth only teaches all very 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:25.340
 dark good quality well blades clearly 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.920
 in the middle it is natural to even be different 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.500
 can not 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.799
 Well, that's all I could say 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.409
 would my place be alexander herzen he then 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.239
 told of course more than I 100 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:43.310
 by the way there is another one of his 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:46.099
 the twin pen here is a little bit 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.989
 such a different form on the scales that I and 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.389
 button 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.810
 it's black here and I'll try everything white too 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.560
 south 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.620
 as he clicks too, flies out enough 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.769
 so confident and 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.950
 yes and again such plastic click 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:07.129
 very nice by the way pen 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:11.450
 skewed and if for example take it 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:15.220
 with an emphasis on the rear of the brush is very good 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:18.889
 you can not use this review 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.109
 how could and told not judge 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:24.560
 strictly 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:27.560
 if you can remove better and by the way here 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.190
 this one with scales is also limits on mid 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.310
 opinion standard but here it is 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:38.470
 limited and the only difference is Plato 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:41.300
 clearance so panda different handles him 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:45.110
 norton i.e. this difference is all pure 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:49.960
 in the design and also it is not very similar 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.500
 on can and cover like twins 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.930
 same size 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.139
 all design elements are the same 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:01.479
 just color a little bit of role and pen but 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.479
 this limited shines standard 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.190
 I will try to immediately open 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.520
 with you was abdulla channel
