 Hello everybody. This is Champagne J. In this video I am going to show you how to braid your hair 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.880
 In 2 quick styles. Lets start. 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.349
 We begin brushing the hair back 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.669
 Cutting it into parts 2. 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:35.669
 Comb the section well and start braiding. We braid it right up to the end and fasten it 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:53.300
 With a rubber band. Do the same for the other side. 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:07.550
 We bring one of the horse tail up and secure it with a "U" pin. You will have to use 2 "U" 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.740
 Pins for this hairstyle. One upward one down. 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.560
 If your hair is heavy, you may need a little more. 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.990
 Because your hair is long you will have to bring a cue down and ensure you get it with "U" pins. 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.990
 Do the same for the other side. 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:42.090
 This tuck goes in space between the braids. Make sure to put "U" in the 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.729
 The area you've tucked in. And thats it for the first style. 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.169
 Lets you go to the second style. 

00:01:57.169 --> 00:02:01.649
 For the second method, we part will have her hair on and brush side of it. we 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:08.649
 He will take a thick section of hair from underneath and start braiding it. 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.280
 If you do not want to do a regular braid, you can also do fishtail braid.This is braid.This 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:28.280
 Go as a hair band to keep the hair back. 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:39.710
 Secure with rubber band. You edit the hair above and comb it out 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.060
 one more time. Then we take the cue we just made and brought 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.940
 So cross and release the rubber band. We then secure the cue with Bobby pin. 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.710
 With this we do with braided two hairstyles. 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:07.710
 This is Champagne J. Thanks for watching.
