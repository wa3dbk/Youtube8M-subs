appreciate the support a lot of you have
been<00:00:19.609> asking<00:00:20.380> how<00:00:21.380> I<00:00:21.439> do<00:00:21.679> my<00:00:22.009> paintings<00:00:22.429> so<00:00:22.699> I'm

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
been asking how I do my paintings so I'm

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.810 
been asking how I do my paintings so I'm
doing<00:00:23.869> this<00:00:24.109> little<00:00:24.289> video<00:00:24.710> to<00:00:25.400> give<00:00:25.609> you<00:00:25.640> an

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
doing this little video to give you an

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.079 
doing this little video to give you an
idea<00:00:25.970> of<00:00:26.269> what<00:00:26.449> my<00:00:26.599> process<00:00:27.079> is<00:00:27.230> like<00:00:28.089> my

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:29.089 
idea of what my process is like my

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:31.860 
idea of what my process is like my
paintings<00:00:29.509> are<00:00:29.630> really<00:00:29.929> about<00:00:30.730> exploration

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:31.870 
paintings are really about exploration

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.780 
paintings are really about exploration
about<00:00:32.870> the<00:00:33.020> relationship<00:00:33.739> between<00:00:33.950> the

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
about the relationship between the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.450 
about the relationship between the
surface<00:00:35.030> I<00:00:35.390> paint<00:00:35.690> on<00:00:35.930> the<00:00:36.500> materials<00:00:37.040> I<00:00:37.160> use

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
surface I paint on the materials I use

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.330 
surface I paint on the materials I use
and<00:00:37.820> gravity<00:00:38.800> so<00:00:39.800> let<00:00:39.920> me<00:00:39.980> talk<00:00:40.070> about<00:00:40.130> the

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
and gravity so let me talk about the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.040 
and gravity so let me talk about the
materials<00:00:40.820> a<00:00:40.880> little<00:00:41.090> bit<00:00:41.240> I've<00:00:41.750> been

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
materials a little bit I've been

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.110 
materials a little bit I've been
experimenting<00:00:42.320> with<00:00:42.740> all<00:00:42.980> sorts<00:00:43.400> of<00:00:43.490> surfaces

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
experimenting with all sorts of surfaces

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.630 
experimenting with all sorts of surfaces
to<00:00:44.240> paint<00:00:44.480> on<00:00:44.690> canvas<00:00:45.560> being<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.220> first<00:00:46.460> one

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
to paint on canvas being the first one

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.240 
to paint on canvas being the first one
on<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:46.790> obvious<00:00:47.270> one<00:00:47.510> and<00:00:47.750> I<00:00:48.110> like<00:00:48.260> canvas<00:00:48.590> but

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
on the obvious one and I like canvas but

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.550 
on the obvious one and I like canvas but
I<00:00:49.280> like<00:00:49.520> painting<00:00:49.820> in<00:00:50.060> large<00:00:50.360> scale<00:00:50.780> so<00:00:51.440> it

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:51.560 
I like painting in large scale so it

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.950 
I like painting in large scale so it
becomes<00:00:51.890> sort<00:00:52.130> of<00:00:52.190> prohibitively<00:00:52.760> expensive

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
becomes sort of prohibitively expensive

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.540 
becomes sort of prohibitively expensive
but<00:00:53.960> I<00:00:53.990> found<00:00:54.260> an<00:00:54.470> alternative<00:00:55.040> that<00:00:55.190> I<00:00:55.250> like

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
but I found an alternative that I like

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.960 
but I found an alternative that I like
better

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
better

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.120 
better
and<00:00:56.120> that's<00:00:56.630> hardboard<00:00:57.410> otherwise<00:00:57.830> known<00:00:58.100> as

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
and that's hardboard otherwise known as

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.360 
and that's hardboard otherwise known as
masonite<00:00:58.790> it's<00:00:59.720> very<00:00:59.930> durable<00:01:00.230> it<00:01:00.950> has<00:01:01.130> no

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
masonite it's very durable it has no

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.950 
masonite it's very durable it has no
chemicals<00:01:01.610> in<00:01:02.060> it<00:01:02.180> because<00:01:02.420> it's<00:01:02.570> made<00:01:02.750> from

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
chemicals in it because it's made from

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.649 
chemicals in it because it's made from
compressed<00:01:03.320> wood<00:01:03.770> fiber<00:01:04.159> and<00:01:04.519> with<00:01:05.360> steam<00:01:05.630> and

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
compressed wood fiber and with steam and

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.520 
compressed wood fiber and with steam and
pressure<00:01:06.140> okay<00:01:06.920> this<00:01:07.400> is<00:01:07.550> what<00:01:07.700> it<00:01:07.790> looks<00:01:07.970> like

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
pressure okay this is what it looks like

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.270 
pressure okay this is what it looks like
this<00:01:09.530> is<00:01:09.680> hardboard

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
this is hardboard

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.390 
this is hardboard

it's<00:01:17.630> relatively<00:01:18.290> inexpensive<00:01:18.380> six<00:01:19.250> bucks

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
it's relatively inexpensive six bucks

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.120 
it's relatively inexpensive six bucks
for<00:01:19.729> a<00:01:19.760> sheet<00:01:20.060> that's<00:01:20.330> 4<00:01:20.960> foot<00:01:21.200> by<00:01:21.409> 8<00:01:21.590> foot<00:01:21.620> and

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
for a sheet that's 4 foot by 8 foot and

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.370 
for a sheet that's 4 foot by 8 foot and
I<00:01:22.580> have<00:01:22.790> them<00:01:22.970> cut<00:01:23.240> it<00:01:23.270> into<00:01:23.900> three<00:01:24.170> sections

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
I have them cut it into three sections

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.410 
I have them cut it into three sections
the<00:01:24.710> long<00:01:25.010> way<00:01:25.190> so<00:01:25.729> I<00:01:25.760> end<00:01:25.970> up<00:01:26.060> with<00:01:26.120> three

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
the long way so I end up with three

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.620 
the long way so I end up with three
sections<00:01:26.690> that<00:01:26.990> are<00:01:27.050> this<00:01:27.229> size<00:01:27.729> 32<00:01:28.729> inches<00:01:29.090> by

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
sections that are this size 32 inches by

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.140 
sections that are this size 32 inches by
48<00:01:30.070> ok<00:01:31.070> I<00:01:31.280> can<00:01:31.670> further<00:01:31.940> cut<00:01:32.360> that<00:01:33.460> in<00:01:34.460> half<00:01:34.490> and

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
48 ok I can further cut that in half and

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.460 
48 ok I can further cut that in half and
end<00:01:35.990> up<00:01:36.200> with<00:01:36.620> this<00:01:36.830> size<00:01:37.100> which<00:01:37.760> is<00:01:37.940> 32<00:01:38.330> by<00:01:38.810> 24

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
end up with this size which is 32 by 24

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.170 
end up with this size which is 32 by 24
and<00:01:40.070> I<00:01:40.220> can<00:01:40.370> cut<00:01:40.549> this<00:01:40.700> in<00:01:40.909> half<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:43.670> end<00:01:44.000> up

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
and I can cut this in half and end up

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.420 
and I can cut this in half and end up
with<00:01:44.690> this<00:01:44.900> size<00:01:45.200> which<00:01:46.010> is<00:01:46.190> 16<00:01:46.909> by<00:01:47.510> 24<00:01:48.340> in<00:01:49.340> the

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
with this size which is 16 by 24 in the

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.420 
with this size which is 16 by 24 in the
other<00:01:49.549> case<00:01:49.729> you<00:01:49.970> have<00:01:50.360> a<00:01:50.390> smooth<00:01:50.810> side<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:51.470> we

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
other case you have a smooth side and we

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.840 
other case you have a smooth side and we
have<00:01:52.460> a<00:01:52.610> rough<00:01:52.909> side<00:01:53.210> I<00:01:53.770> can<00:01:54.770> use<00:01:54.920> either<00:01:55.220> but<00:01:55.820> I

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
have a rough side I can use either but I

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.850 
have a rough side I can use either but I
prefer<00:01:56.299> the<00:01:56.510> rough<00:01:56.720> side<00:01:56.990> most<00:01:57.290> people<00:01:57.590> paint

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
prefer the rough side most people paint

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.010 
prefer the rough side most people paint
on<00:01:58.010> the<00:01:58.100> smooth<00:01:58.369> side<00:01:58.670> I<00:01:58.970> prefer<00:01:59.659> the<00:01:59.810> rough

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
on the smooth side I prefer the rough

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.260 
on the smooth side I prefer the rough
side<00:02:00.350> because<00:02:00.740> this<00:02:00.860> has<00:02:01.070> sort<00:02:01.700> of<00:02:01.820> a<00:02:01.909> canvas

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
side because this has sort of a canvas

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.899 
side because this has sort of a canvas
like<00:02:02.720> texture<00:02:03.350> and<00:02:03.560> paint<00:02:04.189> adheres<00:02:04.610> to<00:02:04.790> it

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
like texture and paint adheres to it

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.660 
like texture and paint adheres to it
much<00:02:05.119> better<00:02:05.650> but<00:02:06.650> in<00:02:06.770> order<00:02:06.979> to<00:02:07.040> use<00:02:07.310> it<00:02:07.520> I

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
much better but in order to use it I

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.669 
much better but in order to use it I
need<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:08.179> prep<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.629> and<00:02:08.810> I'm<00:02:09.349> going<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:09.500> show

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
need to prep it and I'm going to show

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.880 
need to prep it and I'm going to show
you<00:02:09.709> how<00:02:10.099> to<00:02:10.159> prep<00:02:10.459> it

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
you how to prep it

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.220 
you how to prep it
first<00:02:12.890> thing<00:02:13.070> I<00:02:13.160> do<00:02:13.220> is<00:02:13.550> I<00:02:14.980> sand<00:02:16.870> this<00:02:17.870> side

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
first thing I do is I sand this side

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.980 
first thing I do is I sand this side
with<00:02:19.100> a<00:02:19.130> piece<00:02:19.430> of<00:02:19.460> sandpaper<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:20.540> get<00:02:20.690> all<00:02:20.840> the

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
with a piece of sandpaper to get all the

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.050 
with a piece of sandpaper to get all the
rough<00:02:21.200> stuff<00:02:21.590> off<00:02:21.860> just<00:02:22.220> lightly<00:02:22.520> sand<00:02:22.910> it

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
rough stuff off just lightly sand it

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.880 
rough stuff off just lightly sand it
then<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:25.600> waterproof<00:02:26.600> it<00:02:26.810> with<00:02:27.230> something<00:02:27.710> like

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
then I waterproof it with something like

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.030 
then I waterproof it with something like
this<00:02:28.870> stuff<00:02:29.870> you<00:02:29.960> used<00:02:30.140> for<00:02:30.320> decks<00:02:30.590> like

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
this stuff you used for decks like

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.790 
this stuff you used for decks like
Thompson's<00:02:31.580> water<00:02:31.820> seal<00:02:31.910> or<00:02:32.450> Jasco<00:02:32.960> or<00:02:33.410> any<00:02:33.680> of

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
Thompson's water seal or Jasco or any of

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.010 
Thompson's water seal or Jasco or any of
those<00:02:33.920> brands<00:02:34.400> do<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.000> light<00:02:35.300> coat<00:02:35.600> on<00:02:35.780> both

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
those brands do a light coat on both

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.420 
those brands do a light coat on both
sides<00:02:37.360> then<00:02:38.360> I<00:02:38.390> sand<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:38.960> again<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:40.130> start

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
sides then I sand it again and I start

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.910 
sides then I sand it again and I start
to<00:02:40.550> prime<00:02:40.820> it<00:02:40.850> but<00:02:41.210> before<00:02:41.360> I<00:02:41.570> do<00:02:41.690> that<00:02:41.840> as<00:02:42.230> you

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
to prime it but before I do that as you

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.970 
to prime it but before I do that as you
can<00:02:43.070> see<00:02:43.510> this<00:02:44.510> is<00:02:44.690> very<00:02:44.720> flexible<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.830> has

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
can see this is very flexible and it has

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.520 
can see this is very flexible and it has
a<00:02:46.010> tendency<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.670> warp<00:02:46.910> so<00:02:47.810> what<00:02:47.960> I<00:02:47.990> do<00:02:48.080> is<00:02:48.380> I

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
a tendency to warp so what I do is I

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.620 
a tendency to warp so what I do is I
build<00:02:48.770> an<00:02:48.920> armature<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.640> mount<00:02:49.910> it<00:02:50.120> on<00:02:50.240> I'll

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
build an armature to mount it on I'll

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.700 
build an armature to mount it on I'll
show<00:02:50.840> you<00:02:50.930> how<00:02:51.050> to<00:02:51.110> do<00:02:51.290> that

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
show you how to do that

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:59.800 
show you how to do that
I<00:02:55.090> do<00:02:56.090> that<00:02:56.480> with<00:02:56.990> one<00:02:57.260> by<00:02:57.440> two<00:02:57.500> pine<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:59.570> coal

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
I do that with one by two pine the coal

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.500 
I do that with one by two pine the coal
furring<00:03:00.200> strips<00:03:00.560> therefore<00:03:01.510> relatively

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
furring strips therefore relatively

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.080 
furring strips therefore relatively
inexpensive<00:03:03.410> an<00:03:03.860> 8<00:03:04.100> foot<00:03:04.340> length<00:03:04.550> of<00:03:04.850> this

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
inexpensive an 8 foot length of this

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.980 
inexpensive an 8 foot length of this
cost<00:03:05.810> about<00:03:06.080> 98<00:03:06.650> cents<00:03:07.360> and<00:03:08.360> what<00:03:08.540> I<00:03:08.570> do<00:03:08.660> is

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
cost about 98 cents and what I do is

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.170 
cost about 98 cents and what I do is
using<00:03:09.320> a<00:03:09.380> miter<00:03:09.590> saw<00:03:09.740> I<00:03:10.100> have<00:03:10.280> a<00:03:10.310> power<00:03:10.580> saw<00:03:10.940> but

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
using a miter saw I have a power saw but

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.930 
using a miter saw I have a power saw but
you<00:03:11.270> can<00:03:11.420> do<00:03:11.570> it<00:03:11.750> with<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.530> hand<00:03:12.860> saw<00:03:12.980> I<00:03:13.400> cut

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
you can do it with a hand saw I cut

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.960 
you can do it with a hand saw I cut
45-degree<00:03:14.900> angles<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.950> length<00:03:16.220> of<00:03:16.460> the<00:03:16.730> the

width of the canvas and the length of
the<00:03:20.090> canvas<00:03:20.330> and<00:03:20.780> I<00:03:21.290> cut<00:03:21.500> to<00:03:21.740> one<00:03:22.100> for<00:03:22.340> each

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
the canvas and I cut to one for each

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.680 
the canvas and I cut to one for each
side<00:03:22.760> top<00:03:23.600> bottom<00:03:24.080> left<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:25.160> right<00:03:25.280> side<00:03:25.700> and

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.880 
side top bottom left and right side and
I<00:03:26.900> put<00:03:27.170> these<00:03:27.350> together<00:03:27.560> with<00:03:28.310> a<00:03:28.340> staple<00:03:28.790> gun<00:03:28.820> I

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
I put these together with a staple gun I

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.970 
I put these together with a staple gun I
staple<00:03:30.890> them<00:03:31.040> together<00:03:32.200> so<00:03:33.200> that<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.560> corners

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
staple them together so that the corners

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.610 
staple them together so that the corners
match<00:03:34.220> perfectly<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:35.540> what<00:03:35.930> I<00:03:35.960> end<00:03:36.230> up<00:03:36.410> with

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
match perfectly and what I end up with

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.200 
match perfectly and what I end up with
is<00:03:38.860> something<00:03:39.860> like<00:03:40.250> this<00:03:40.490> that<00:03:40.790> looks<00:03:41.030> like<00:03:41.150> a

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
is something like this that looks like a

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.190 
is something like this that looks like a
frame<00:03:42.400> okay

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
frame okay

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.990

I<00:03:47.650> also<00:03:48.650> waterproof<00:03:49.130> this<00:03:49.580> because<00:03:49.760> I<00:03:49.849> don't

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
I also waterproof this because I don't

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.150 
I also waterproof this because I don't
want<00:03:50.209> any<00:03:50.420> of<00:03:50.510> the<00:03:50.599> oils<00:03:50.959> in<00:03:51.110> the<00:03:51.230> wood<00:03:51.410> to<00:03:51.920> seep

all around this framing this mount and I
amount<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:11.480> masonite<00:04:12.640> directly<00:04:13.640> on<00:04:13.760> top<00:04:13.970> of

then<00:04:19.010> I<00:04:19.750> waterproof<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:20.900> whole<00:04:21.049> thing<00:04:21.229> again

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
then I waterproof the whole thing again

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.610 
then I waterproof the whole thing again
and<00:04:21.709> I<00:04:22.610> use<00:04:22.880> a<00:04:23.240> lot<00:04:23.810> of<00:04:23.840> people<00:04:24.169> a<00:04:24.380> lot<00:04:24.440> of

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
and I use a lot of people a lot of

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.610 
and I use a lot of people a lot of
painters<00:04:25.070> use<00:04:25.600> from<00:04:26.600> something<00:04:26.990> called<00:04:27.020> gesso

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620

to<00:04:27.889> prep<00:04:28.700> a<00:04:28.729> canvas<00:04:29.300> I<00:04:30.020> like<00:04:30.680> using<00:04:31.450> materials

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
to prep a canvas I like using materials

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.620 
to prep a canvas I like using materials
from<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:33.110> hardware<00:04:33.440> store<00:04:33.500> so<00:04:34.280> what<00:04:34.970> I<00:04:35.000> use<00:04:35.330> is

canvas<00:05:12.680> in<00:05:12.919> one<00:05:13.160> direction<00:05:14.060> or<00:05:14.180> another<00:05:14.390> a<00:05:14.660> few

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
canvas in one direction or another a few

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.860 
canvas in one direction or another a few
degrees<00:05:15.400> that<00:05:16.400> gives<00:05:16.789> me<00:05:17.000> the<00:05:17.150> direction<00:05:17.690> in

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
degrees that gives me the direction in

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.140 
degrees that gives me the direction in
which<00:05:18.020> the<00:05:18.229> paint<00:05:18.470> is<00:05:18.620> going<00:05:18.800> to<00:05:18.890> run<00:05:19.070> and<00:05:19.430> then

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150

paint and experiment and then I let the

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.120 
paint and experiment and then I let the
paint<00:05:43.740> run<00:05:44.100> so<00:05:44.910> that<00:05:45.210> gravity<00:05:45.890> does<00:05:46.890> the<00:05:46.920> work

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
paint run so that gravity does the work

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.550 
paint run so that gravity does the work
the<00:05:47.970> interesting<00:05:48.480> thing<00:05:48.660> about<00:05:48.690> the<00:05:49.050> work<00:05:49.260> for

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
the interesting thing about the work for

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.470 
the interesting thing about the work for
me<00:05:49.710> is<00:05:50.160> that<00:05:50.220> once<00:05:50.610> I<00:05:50.730> start<00:05:50.970> applying<00:05:51.240> the

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
me is that once I start applying the

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.960 
me is that once I start applying the
paint<00:05:51.720> the<00:05:52.440> paint<00:05:52.800> the<00:05:52.950> painting<00:05:53.220> itself<00:05:53.640> and

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
paint the paint the painting itself and

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.210 
paint the paint the painting itself and
the<00:05:54.120> paint<00:05:54.360> start<00:05:55.050> talking<00:05:55.380> to<00:05:55.500> me<00:05:55.650> so<00:05:56.130> it

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
the paint start talking to me so it

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.160 
the paint start talking to me so it
becomes<00:05:56.550> interactive<00:05:57.330> the<00:05:57.600> painting<00:05:57.930> tells

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.170 
becomes interactive the painting tells

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.810 
becomes interactive the painting tells
me<00:05:58.350> I<00:05:58.530> need<00:05:58.890> more<00:05:59.070> blue<00:05:59.340> here

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
me I need more blue here

I<00:05:59.850> need<00:06:00.000> more<00:06:00.150> red<00:06:00.450> here<00:06:00.930> I<00:06:00.960> need<00:06:01.380> more<00:06:01.530> color

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830

here I need more paint here and

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.920 
here I need more paint here and
eventually<00:06:05.130> it<00:06:05.700> tells<00:06:06.000> me<00:06:06.180> when<00:06:06.330> it's<00:06:06.480> done

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930
