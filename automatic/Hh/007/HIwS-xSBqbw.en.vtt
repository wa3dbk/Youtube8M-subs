form<00:03:23.269> is<00:03:23.419> why<00:03:23.690> these<00:03:23.930> guys<00:03:24.290> can<00:03:24.530> use<00:03:24.650> form<00:03:24.889> and

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
form is why these guys can use form and

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.309 
form is why these guys can use form and
get<00:03:25.099> results<00:03:25.220> look<00:03:25.849> even<00:03:26.750> if<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:26.959> put<00:03:27.139> them<00:03:27.199> on

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
get results look even if you put them on

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.349 
get results look even if you put them on
similar<00:03:27.769> programs<00:03:28.280> with<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.879> overload

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
similar programs with the overload

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:30.550 
similar programs with the overload
they're<00:03:29.569> doing<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:30.139> weight<00:03:30.349> they're

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
they're doing and the weight they're

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.199 
they're doing and the weight they're
doing<00:03:30.829> at<00:03:30.919> the<00:03:31.040> full<00:03:31.250> contraction<00:03:31.790> of<00:03:31.849> the<00:03:31.909> rep

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
doing at the full contraction of the rep

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.750 
doing at the full contraction of the rep
I<00:03:32.449> do<00:03:32.900> think<00:03:33.349> that<00:03:33.500> branch<00:03:33.829> and<00:03:34.159> all<00:03:34.639> these

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
I do think that branch and all these

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.270 
I do think that branch and all these
guys<00:03:34.970> who<00:03:35.209> are<00:03:35.239> IFBB<00:03:35.900> pros<00:03:36.109> are<00:03:36.500> maximizing

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
guys who are IFBB pros are maximizing

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.550 
guys who are IFBB pros are maximizing
their<00:03:37.609> gains<00:03:37.879> are<00:03:38.269> maximizing<00:03:38.989> the<00:03:39.199> results

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
their gains are maximizing the results

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.199 
their gains are maximizing the results
it's<00:03:39.889> unconventional<00:03:40.310> it's<00:03:40.760> probably<00:03:41.030> a<00:03:41.060> bit

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
it's unconventional it's probably a bit

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.119 
it's unconventional it's probably a bit
more<00:03:41.359> dangerous<00:03:41.599> on<00:03:42.079> their<00:03:42.229> system<00:03:42.590> is<00:03:42.709> it

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
more dangerous on their system is it

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.610 
more dangerous on their system is it
optimal<00:03:43.579> maybe<00:03:43.879> not<00:03:44.299> but<00:03:45.109> again<00:03:45.349> there's<00:03:45.530> no

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
optimal maybe not but again there's no

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.500 
optimal maybe not but again there's no
control<00:03:46.129> group<00:03:46.159> so<00:03:47.000> what<00:03:47.150> we're<00:03:47.269> doing<00:03:47.299> is

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
control group so what we're doing is

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.369 
control group so what we're doing is
we're<00:03:47.659> just<00:03:47.690> guessing<00:03:48.280> okay<00:03:49.629> so<00:03:50.629> my<00:03:50.840> opinion

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
we're just guessing okay so my opinion

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.920 
we're just guessing okay so my opinion
on<00:03:51.500> the<00:03:51.709> difference<00:03:52.129> in<00:03:52.310> how<00:03:52.430> enhanced<00:03:53.180> versus

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:56.449 
natural trainers should train it depends

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:58.119 
natural trainers should train it depends

advanced lifters who've been training 10
plus<00:04:08.120> years<00:04:08.540> I<00:04:08.780> think<00:04:09.199> they<00:04:09.590> can<00:04:09.799> do<00:04:09.949> a<00:04:09.979> 5<00:04:10.370> to<00:04:10.579> 6

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
plus years I think they can do a 5 to 6

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.699 
plus years I think they can do a 5 to 6
to<00:04:10.970> 7<00:04:11.269> days<00:04:11.299> well<00:04:11.569> I<00:04:11.629> think<00:04:11.870> most<00:04:12.109> people<00:04:12.319> can

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
to 7 days well I think most people can

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.069 
to 7 days well I think most people can
as<00:04:12.979> Lane<00:04:13.519> Orton<00:04:13.879> once<00:04:14.030> told<00:04:14.299> me<00:04:14.509> he'll<00:04:14.900> you

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
as Lane Orton once told me he'll you

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.749 
as Lane Orton once told me he'll you
could<00:04:15.229> train<00:04:15.409> every<00:04:15.709> day<00:04:15.739> of<00:04:15.979> the<00:04:16.070> week<00:04:16.220> but

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:16.759 
could train every day of the week but

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:18.370 
could train every day of the week but
would<00:04:16.970> it<00:04:17.090> be<00:04:17.239> better<00:04:17.449> results<00:04:17.989> than<00:04:18.109> five

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
would it be better results than five

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.430 
would it be better results than five
days<00:04:18.620> a<00:04:18.680> week<00:04:18.829> maybe<00:04:19.579> not<00:04:20.019> but<00:04:21.019> if<00:04:21.169> you<00:04:21.289> enjoy

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
days a week maybe not but if you enjoy

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.070 
days a week maybe not but if you enjoy
training<00:04:22.070> there<00:04:22.219> are<00:04:22.310> ways<00:04:22.520> to<00:04:22.550> do<00:04:22.849> that<00:04:23.060> ok

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
training there are ways to do that ok

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.110 
training there are ways to do that ok
so<00:04:24.349> my<00:04:24.590> whole<00:04:24.860> thing<00:04:25.159> is<00:04:25.190> I<00:04:25.580> think<00:04:25.639> we<00:04:25.880> need<00:04:25.940> to

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
so my whole thing is I think we need to

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.409 
so my whole thing is I think we need to
get

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
get

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.360 
get
from<00:04:26.719> this<00:04:26.900> hole<00:04:27.080> steroids<00:04:27.979> are<00:04:28.219> these

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
from this hole steroids are these

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.369 
from this hole steroids are these
magical<00:04:29.030> magical<00:04:29.539> things<00:04:29.810> that<00:04:29.990> make<00:04:30.139> it<00:04:30.289> so

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:30.379 
magical magical things that make it so

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:32.559 
magical magical things that make it so
you<00:04:30.439> could<00:04:30.590> train<00:04:30.889> uncontrollably<00:04:31.699> that<00:04:32.360> your

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:32.569 
you could train uncontrollably that your

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:34.450 
you could train uncontrollably that your

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:37.069 
that joint pain and issues don't exist

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:39.010 
that joint pain and issues don't exist
and<00:04:37.310> you<00:04:37.699> just<00:04:37.849> make<00:04:38.029> gains<00:04:38.360> after<00:04:38.659> gains

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020

all I'm getting at are they're my new

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:55.689 
all I'm getting at are they're my new
differences<00:04:54.860> and<00:04:54.979> how<00:04:55.069> they<00:04:55.219> should<00:04:55.279> train

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
and how they should do everything maybe

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.010 
and how they should do everything maybe
but<00:04:58.759> even<00:04:58.789> dieting<00:04:59.389> at<00:04:59.479> the<00:04:59.599> end<00:04:59.719> of<00:04:59.779> the<00:04:59.840> day
