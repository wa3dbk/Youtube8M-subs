you're kind of on the fence about it

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.910 
you're kind of on the fence about it
whether<00:01:42.600> or<00:01:42.689> not<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.990> drop<00:01:43.140> 60<00:01:43.530> bucks<00:01:43.740> or<00:01:43.890> not

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
whether or not to drop 60 bucks or not

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.160

you<00:01:44.430> know<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.700> video<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.030> for<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.210> now<00:01:46.140> I

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
you know this video is for you now I

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.080 
you know this video is for you now I
think<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.619> safe<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.920> say<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.670> last<00:01:47.880> few

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
think it's safe to say that the last few

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.539 
think it's safe to say that the last few
call<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.420> duty's<00:01:48.750> seem<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.770> be<00:01:49.860> basically<00:01:50.159> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
call of duty's seem to be basically the

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.609 
call of duty's seem to be basically the
same<00:01:50.790> game<00:01:51.090> as<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.509> year<00:01:51.630> before<00:01:51.780> about<00:01:52.470> with

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
same game as the year before about with

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.560 
same game as the year before about with
some<00:01:52.799> new<00:01:52.920> skins<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:53.729> guns<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.299> sound

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
some new skins and like guns and sound

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.600 
some new skins and like guns and sound
effects<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.049> stuff<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:55.890> what

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
effects and stuff like that so what

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.310 
effects and stuff like that so what
exactly<00:01:56.700> will<00:01:57.149> be<00:01:57.299> new<00:01:57.509> with<00:01:57.689> black<00:01:57.869> ops<00:01:58.110> 2

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
exactly will be new with black ops 2

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.990 
exactly will be new with black ops 2
well<00:01:58.979> let's<00:01:59.219> start<00:01:59.399> off<00:01:59.460> with<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.729> actual

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
well let's start off with the actual

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.300 
well let's start off with the actual
game<00:02:00.119> engine<00:02:00.810> we<00:02:01.680> already<00:02:01.920> know<00:02:02.070> it's<00:02:02.219> gonna

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
game engine we already know it's gonna

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.889 
game engine we already know it's gonna
be<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.520> exact<00:02:02.790> same<00:02:03.000> engine<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.390> has<00:02:03.689> been

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
be the exact same engine that has been

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.380 
be the exact same engine that has been
used<00:02:04.049> since<00:02:04.320> call<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.890> duty<00:02:04.920> 4<00:02:05.180> charak<00:02:06.180> says

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
used since call of duty 4 charak says

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.670 
used since call of duty 4 charak says
that<00:02:06.540> they<00:02:06.659> use<00:02:06.869> different<00:02:07.049> engine<00:02:07.530> a

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
that they use different engine a

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.010 
that they use different engine a
different<00:02:08.459> engine<00:02:08.550> but<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.660> know<00:02:09.750> we<00:02:09.899> aren't

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
different engine but you know we aren't

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.510 
different engine but you know we aren't
stupid<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.500> game<00:02:10.649> mechanics<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.129> felt<00:02:11.400> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
stupid the game mechanics that felt the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.089 
stupid the game mechanics that felt the
same<00:02:11.760> since<00:02:11.970> called<00:02:12.239> duty<00:02:12.450> 4<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:14.069> know

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
same since called duty 4 and I you know

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:14.500 
same since called duty 4 and I you know
they

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
they

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.570 
they
will<00:02:14.569> feel<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.840> same<00:02:15.019> in<00:02:15.110> black<00:02:15.290> ops<00:02:15.470> 2<00:02:15.620> but

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
will feel the same in black ops 2 but

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.860 
will feel the same in black ops 2 but
that<00:02:16.700> could<00:02:16.849> either<00:02:16.939> be<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.180> bad<00:02:17.390> thing<00:02:17.420> or<00:02:17.810> a

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
that could either be a bad thing or a

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.660 
that could either be a bad thing or a
good<00:02:17.930> thing<00:02:18.110> depending<00:02:18.799> on<00:02:18.980> your<00:02:19.129> stance<00:02:19.489> on

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
good thing depending on your stance on

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.059 
good thing depending on your stance on
it<00:02:19.819> I<00:02:19.970> personally<00:02:20.780> have<00:02:21.260> no<00:02:21.439> problem<00:02:21.860> with<00:02:21.980> the

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
it I personally have no problem with the

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.679 
it I personally have no problem with the
game<00:02:22.250> mechanics<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:22.909> compared<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.569> other

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:23.689 
game mechanics and compared to other

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.490 
game mechanics and compared to other
multiplayer<00:02:23.989> FPS<00:02:24.290> is<00:02:24.739> it<00:02:25.280> runs<00:02:25.549> very<00:02:25.640> smoothly

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
multiplayer FPS is it runs very smoothly

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.229 
multiplayer FPS is it runs very smoothly
but<00:02:27.500> there's<00:02:27.860> just<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:28.159> level<00:02:28.489> of<00:02:28.549> repetition

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
but there's just a level of repetition

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.940 
but there's just a level of repetition
that<00:02:29.269> you<00:02:29.510> start<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:29.870> feel<00:02:30.019> you<00:02:30.620> know<00:02:30.709> from<00:02:30.890> the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
that you start to feel you know from the

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.369 
that you start to feel you know from the
look<00:02:31.099> of<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.280> game<00:02:31.459> and<00:02:31.730> how<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.090> plays<00:02:32.379> for

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
look of the game and how it plays for

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:34.839 
look of the game and how it plays for
instance<00:02:33.650> if<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:33.980> look<00:02:34.129> into<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.400> eyes<00:02:34.610> of

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
instance if you look into the eyes of

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.520 
instance if you look into the eyes of
like<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.030> Russian<00:02:35.269> enemy<00:02:35.629> that<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:35.989> would<00:02:36.290> kill

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
like a Russian enemy that you would kill

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.339 
like a Russian enemy that you would kill
Mr<00:02:36.799> 43<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.519> compare<00:02:38.239> them<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.750> bad<00:02:39.140> guys

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
Mr 43 and compare them to the bad guys

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.710 
Mr 43 and compare them to the bad guys
and<00:02:39.530> call<00:02:39.680> of<00:02:39.769> duty<00:02:39.980> 4<00:02:40.310> they<00:02:40.879> look<00:02:41.150> pretty<00:02:41.450> much

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
and call of duty 4 they look pretty much

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.899 
and call of duty 4 they look pretty much
the<00:02:41.780> same<00:02:42.019> I<00:02:42.560> personally<00:02:43.459> don't<00:02:43.549> care<00:02:43.670> about

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.490 
the same I personally don't care about
how<00:02:44.060> they<00:02:44.209> look<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.659> that<00:02:44.870> stuff<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:45.439> I

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
how they look and that stuff and I

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.710 
how they look and that stuff and I
definitely<00:02:45.950> don't<00:02:46.159> care<00:02:46.400> about<00:02:47.239> their<00:02:47.540> eyes

forward and you shoot more stuff that
will<00:02:57.109> never<00:02:57.260> change<00:02:57.379> so<00:02:57.980> I'm<00:02:58.069> just<00:02:58.220> going

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
will never change so I'm just going

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.460 
will never change so I'm just going
straight<00:02:58.849> to<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.120> multiplayer<00:02:59.690> which<00:03:00.319> has

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
straight to the multiplayer which has

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.899 
straight to the multiplayer which has
quite<00:03:00.739> a<00:03:00.769> bit<00:03:00.829> of<00:03:00.980> new<00:03:01.129> features<00:03:01.340> that

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
quite a bit of new features that

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.550 
quite a bit of new features that
hopefully<00:03:02.629> will<00:03:02.989> make<00:03:03.049> the<00:03:03.349> game<00:03:03.530> more

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
hopefully will make the game more

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:09.349 
enjoyable but even if it still feels

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:11.020 
enjoyable but even if it still feels
like<00:07:09.530> every<00:07:09.830> other<00:07:09.919> cod<00:07:10.280> and<00:07:10.580> it's<00:07:10.879> just
