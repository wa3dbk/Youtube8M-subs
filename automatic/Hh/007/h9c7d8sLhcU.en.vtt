00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
it actually gives you two zones for the

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.710 
it actually gives you two zones for the

strings in on my second upper zone so on
upper<00:00:53.649> zone<00:00:53.860> -<00:00:54.570> I'll<00:00:55.570> select<00:00:55.870> strings<00:00:56.489> and

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
upper zone - I'll select strings and

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.880 
upper zone - I'll select strings and
simply<00:00:57.910> scroll<00:00:58.269> through<00:00:58.570> my<00:00:58.899> string<00:00:59.409> Bank<00:00:59.649> to

your<00:01:03.100> strings<00:01:03.399> now<00:01:04.180> to<00:01:04.239> activate<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:05.530> second

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
your strings now to activate the second

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.130 
your strings now to activate the second
zone<00:01:06.040> I'll<00:01:06.310> need<00:01:06.430> to<00:01:06.549> turn<00:01:06.700> on<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.149> layer<00:01:07.450> that

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
zone I'll need to turn on the layer that

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:29.380 
zone I'll need to turn on the layer that
now<00:01:08.350> layers<00:01:08.680> both<00:01:09.190> of<00:01:09.369> those<00:01:09.490> zones<00:01:09.790> together

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.570 

so<00:01:29.960> now<00:01:30.110> put<00:01:30.350> down<00:01:30.470> on<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.860> strings<00:01:31.160> sounding

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
so now put down on the strings sounding

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.030 
so now put down on the strings sounding
together<00:01:31.940> I'll<00:01:32.810> now<00:01:32.990> move<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:33.380> my<00:01:33.470> lower<00:01:33.710> zones

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
together I'll now move to my lower zones

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.400 
together I'll now move to my lower zones
so<00:01:34.730> what<00:01:34.880> I'd<00:01:34.970> like<00:01:35.090> to<00:01:35.150> do<00:01:35.390> now<00:01:35.660> is<00:01:35.930> add<00:01:36.380> some

which<00:01:51.230> activates<00:01:51.460> my<00:01:52.460> lower<00:01:52.730> zone<00:01:53.000> one<00:01:53.270> button

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
which activates my lower zone one button

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:04.010 
which activates my lower zone one button
and<00:01:53.890> to<00:01:54.890> that<00:01:55.100> I'll<00:01:55.340> assign<00:01:55.730> a<00:01:56.090> ride<00:01:56.480> by<00:01:56.750> sound

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.780 

the<00:02:05.020> other<00:02:05.170> thing<00:02:05.350> that<00:02:05.380> I<00:02:05.590> can<00:02:05.800> do<00:02:05.950> also<00:02:06.160> now

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
the other thing that I can do also now

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.060 
the other thing that I can do also now
that<00:02:06.940> I<00:02:07.000> have<00:02:07.210> two<00:02:08.020> different<00:02:08.170> sounds<00:02:08.770> and<00:02:08.979> all

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
that I have two different sounds and all

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.650 
that I have two different sounds and all
the<00:02:09.160> sands<00:02:09.460> of<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.640> keyboard<00:02:10.030> I<00:02:10.180> can<00:02:10.479> also

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
the sands of the keyboard I can also

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.260 
the sands of the keyboard I can also
choose<00:02:11.080> where<00:02:11.320> the<00:02:11.440> split<00:02:11.680> point<00:02:11.890> goes<00:02:12.210> now<00:02:13.210> I

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
choose where the split point goes now I

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.790 
choose where the split point goes now I
tend<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.690> voice<00:02:13.870> my<00:02:14.110> right<00:02:14.290> hand<00:02:14.530> chords

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
tend to voice my right hand chords

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.380 
tend to voice my right hand chords
fairly<00:02:15.100> low<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:15.490> what<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:15.700> want<00:02:15.850> to<00:02:15.910> do<00:02:16.060> is<00:02:16.180> move

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
fairly low so what I want to do is move

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.670 
fairly low so what I want to do is move
the<00:02:16.600> split<00:02:16.870> from<00:02:17.110> its<00:02:17.260> default<00:02:17.620> position

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
the split from its default position

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.740 
the split from its default position
which<00:02:18.190> is<00:02:18.340> right<00:02:18.520> here<00:02:18.760> at<00:02:18.850> a<00:02:18.940> sharp<00:02:19.210> 3<00:02:19.510> I

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
which is right here at a sharp 3 I

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.710 
which is right here at a sharp 3 I
actually<00:02:20.440> want<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:20.800> move<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.190> down<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.760> inflate

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
actually want to move it down to inflate

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.630 
actually want to move it down to inflate
3<00:02:22.990> so<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.320> way<00:02:23.410> I<00:02:23.440> do<00:02:23.680> that<00:02:23.830> is<00:02:23.890> hold<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.400> split

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
3 so the way I do that is hold the split

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.480 
3 so the way I do that is hold the split
button<00:02:24.880> here<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.840> simply<00:02:26.170> play<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.440> note<00:02:26.770> and

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
button here and simply play the note and

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.250 
button here and simply play the note and
the<00:02:27.580> note<00:02:27.610> where<00:02:27.970> I've<00:02:28.060> now<00:02:28.270> place<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:29.020> split

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
the note where I've now place the split

00:02:29.260 --> 00:03:05.690 
the note where I've now place the split
is<00:02:29.350> displayed<00:02:29.770> in<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:29.980> screen

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.760 

you
