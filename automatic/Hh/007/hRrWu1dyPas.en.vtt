little<00:04:17.580> more<00:04:17.790> watery<00:04:18.299> than<00:04:18.540> like<00:04:18.660> an<00:04:18.810> actual

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
little more watery than like an actual

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.979 
little more watery than like an actual
milkshake<00:04:20.010> and<00:04:20.250> also<00:04:21.180> watermelon<00:04:21.720> is<00:04:21.840> like

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
milkshake and also watermelon is like

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.870 
milkshake and also watermelon is like
mostly<00:04:22.440> water<00:04:22.770> so<00:04:23.039> I<00:04:23.099> feel<00:04:23.280> like<00:04:23.340> that's<00:04:23.460> just

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
mostly water so I feel like that's just

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.820 
mostly water so I feel like that's just
going<00:04:24.030> to<00:04:24.090> add<00:04:24.300> to<00:04:24.750> like<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.169> water<00:04:25.380> eNOS<00:04:25.710> of

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
going to add to like the water eNOS of

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.240 
going to add to like the water eNOS of
the<00:04:25.919> milk

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
the milk

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.130 
the milk
so<00:04:26.580> if<00:04:26.790> you<00:04:27.120> don't<00:04:27.240> want<00:04:27.390> it<00:04:27.420> to<00:04:27.510> be<00:04:27.660> so<00:04:27.870> thin

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
so if you don't want it to be so thin

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.420 
so if you don't want it to be so thin
you<00:04:28.170> could<00:04:28.410> add<00:04:28.530> more<00:04:28.560> ice<00:04:28.980> cream<00:04:29.280> but

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
you could add more ice cream but

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.490 
you could add more ice cream but
honestly<00:04:29.760> this<00:04:29.940> tastes<00:04:30.510> like<00:04:30.630> a<00:04:30.780> milkshake<00:04:31.080> to

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500
