get<00:01:19.960> to<00:01:20.110> this<00:01:20.229> stage<00:01:20.500> I<00:01:20.770> thinking<00:01:21.729> and<00:01:22.000> and<00:01:22.210> in

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
get to this stage I thinking and and in

get to this stage I thinking and and in
all<00:01:22.539> sports<00:01:22.869> you<00:01:23.110> get<00:01:23.590> one<00:01:23.770> person<00:01:24.009> you<00:01:24.340> always

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
all sports you get one person you always

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.490

that<00:01:26.679> wins<00:01:26.860> more<00:01:27.100> than<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.369> rest<00:01:27.580> I<00:01:27.819> think

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
that wins more than the rest I think

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.899 
that wins more than the rest I think
that<00:01:28.179> that'll<00:01:28.720> keep<00:01:28.840> going<00:01:29.580> but<00:01:30.580> I<00:01:30.610> don't

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
that that'll keep going but I don't

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.320 
that that'll keep going but I don't
think<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:33.250> know<00:01:33.369> I've<00:01:33.580> managed<00:01:33.880> to<00:01:33.909> win<00:01:34.090> five

titles so far this season and that's

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:38.219 
titles so far this season and that's
that's<00:01:36.399> you<00:01:36.670> know<00:01:36.789> more<00:01:37.240> than<00:01:37.479> probably

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
that's you know more than probably

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.779 
that's you know more than probably
expected<00:01:38.799> because<00:01:39.069> the<00:01:39.159> games<00:01:39.340> getting<00:01:39.640> so

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
expected because the games getting so

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.749 
expected because the games getting so
tough<00:01:40.030> but<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.920> know<00:01:42.009> but<00:01:42.129> then<00:01:42.250> again<00:01:42.369> if<00:01:42.610> you

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
tough but you know but then again if you

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.190 
tough but you know but then again if you
know<00:01:42.849> if<00:01:42.940> I'm<00:01:43.060> playing<00:01:43.239> at<00:01:43.420> my<00:01:43.509> best<00:01:43.690> then<00:01:44.110> I

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
know if I'm playing at my best then I

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.380 
know if I'm playing at my best then I
expect<00:01:44.500> to<00:01:44.679> win<00:01:44.709> a<00:01:44.830> lot<00:01:45.009> of<00:01:45.039> tails<00:01:45.280> but<00:01:45.610> I<00:01:46.000> think

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
expect to win a lot of tails but I think

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
expect to win a lot of tails but I think
in<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.509> future<00:01:46.660> it's<00:01:46.869> going<00:01:47.050> to<00:01:47.110> get<00:01:47.200> harder

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
in the future it's going to get harder

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.660 
in the future it's going to get harder
and<00:01:47.530> harder<00:01:47.770> to<00:01:47.890> do<00:01:48.009> that<00:01:48.039> you're<00:01:48.610> a

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
and harder to do that you're a

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.369 
and harder to do that you're a
millionaire<00:01:48.759> now<00:01:49.179> you've<00:01:49.599> won<00:01:49.780> six<00:01:50.140> full<00:01:50.289> of

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
Andy Hicks and that's probably one of

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.520 
Andy Hicks and that's probably one of
the<00:02:27.069> best<00:02:27.849> ones<00:02:28.060> that<00:02:28.390> you've<00:02:28.480> had<00:02:28.629> yeah

always to play Steve in the final World
Championship<00:03:33.570> and<00:03:34.570> I<00:03:34.630> think<00:03:34.870> if<00:03:35.080> if<00:03:35.500> it<00:03:35.650> came

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830
