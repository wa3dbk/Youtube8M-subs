00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.830
 guilty for students i for anyone who learn something 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:11.229
 a way to finally 

00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:14.460
 finally study calmly of the city 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.460
 its application completely free and martínez 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.839
 what to take care of fal download right in the description 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:24.789
 fun 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:25.899
 today it is easy 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:28.829
 peace without studying fascinates 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.859
 quite father good 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.820
 we are going to apply 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.710
 compose the application is here and they go 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.039
 who does have a screen image management instantly 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.140
 let's open it 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.700
 see what happens 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.540
 here is to compose when the same happening 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.420
 there is nothing else 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.580
 5 tone 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.190
 four buttons 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.270
 this event and 4 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.010
 4 icons 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.380
 but it clarified static that we closed the application or cope 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.080
 if we create monochrome 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.560
 well let's put here in April presented in Latin stress 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.770
 well the classes 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.600
 they are questions 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.870
 what masters and the answer is that no 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.030
 can sustain you can erase them for example 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.760
 this was something red highlighted 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.940
 come on with hecker this 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.360
 I lembo the button for looking like it's a button 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.560
 characters this if it bites you moschén attack us 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.330
 tells us this 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.990
 we came to watch for example 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.990
 for this 1 according 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.820
 the answer evidently did not accept 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.420
 we can detect which 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.760
 are the ones that we have to know our plans here there are several boston 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.080
 tests after it is inhabited we go to the press here in nothing and lived 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.440
 this problem here is more to learn that despite the answer if you 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.990
 you have to put the question 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.420
 in litibú 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.050
 with the question and you have to put the answer inc but like the Palestinian 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.049
 if we call poncho put it in the center 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:12.609
 hockey 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:15.609
 in info for example from the east 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.790
 here does not come out 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.899
 the group 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:21.479
 East of 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:24.869
 with the question about the answer that the scientist provides 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:28.399
 what to ask 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.449
 for example 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:32.999
 group one and other 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:34.180
 this 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.180
 kind 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:41.829
 not only will there be here is the percentage of answers you have 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.189
 and here you can play 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:48.879
 this is that I have answered it more or less because normally it is not 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:49.919
 that answer 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.029
 this 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:54.029
 When you answer 5 correct, it works out well 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:57.999
 in colors of the band in mexico does not respond to any we have for 

00:02:57.999 --> 00:02:59.319
 teach them 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.529
 this 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:03.529
 mac or pc 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:07.749
 in notes for example 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:12.519
 What have you wanted? 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.189
 you can see it there 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:16.299
 p 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.339
 that is an example because a femur with 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:21.579
 against everyone 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.439
 etc 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:25.009
 well, good 

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:28.009
 let's go to sevilla 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:30.159
 celtic music and 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.719

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.079
 they have a bit of the Andes an approach on the opposite straight 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.649
 the joke the legend I want to read 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:44.439
 according to the agreed little we will continue lipsky 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:48.169
 two plus two 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.759
 I did not leave crisis also mac or pc city expose despite this 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:54.939
 thousands pass us by 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:57.409
 we can do three things 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:58.809
 percent 

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:00.529
 san carlos the question 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:02.789
 so he does not tell us either good or bad 

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:07.819
 this who win us well 3 and that if we do it well 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.389
 have a suspicion and that they do not meet these standards we could not see 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.559
 I am what I do 

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:17.709
 Basque press event every question that remains we dismantle flaws 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.249

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.090
 to make the next one different again to be a mother 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.539
 vessel 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:36.720
 alfonso 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.720

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.639
 to all this to this 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.400
 i so far 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.400
 like as the colored side in the harbor a good 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.509
 the east two plus two are four all the leaks more or less well 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:16.949
 but for example let's do this again 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.949
 to repeat this index here 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.909
 when there is a party because 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:29.239
 the system believes that already after that being the Christian faith questions five 

00:05:29.239 --> 00:05:31.839
 sometimes it looks pretty good 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:37.039
 this polygon d if here we add more I do not know percent 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.990
 p 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.339
 those that we closed 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:47.300
 asks us if we want to restrict or not 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.159
 Brussels

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.469
 more than anything 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:06:00.009
 the ceiling purchase of the 2009 act for this area that pays in Mexico 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:01.779
