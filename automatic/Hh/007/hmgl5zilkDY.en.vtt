00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:04.329
 I do not fall asleep to applaud the dream bite 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.569
 it's the mayor who wakes you up every morning with me 

00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:12.309
 his evolution 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.699
 those who accompany the soul that would arrive if work was all 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.349
 and at this very moment, it could last a long time. 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.689
 can the video board be sent the lyrics 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.630
 so be careful 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.260
 we need you to switch but he knows not 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.030
 that is, all the cameras will turn around 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.760
 but hey it's even had to find all on television 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.470
 his death 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.590
 only 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.590
 we have to go out the song is now to know 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.500

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.570
 this illness 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.570

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.610

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.840
 in shape 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.840

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.909

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:19.989

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:20.859
 blow 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.099

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.589
