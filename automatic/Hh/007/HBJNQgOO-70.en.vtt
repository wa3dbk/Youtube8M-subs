00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
for five dollars which is a really a

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.609 
for five dollars which is a really a
nice<00:00:15.870> deal<00:00:16.350> when<00:00:16.560> they're<00:00:16.710> usually<00:00:16.830> 350<00:00:17.670> each

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
nice deal when they're usually 350 each

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.700 
nice deal when they're usually 350 each
so<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:20.070> was<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.609> perk<00:00:21.270> but<00:00:22.109> also<00:00:22.260> there's<00:00:22.650> a

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
so that was a perk but also there's a

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.779 
so that was a perk but also there's a
lot<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:22.949> sense<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.220> I've<00:00:23.430> kind<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.670> been

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
smell the same when you burn it it can

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.870 
smell the same when you burn it it can
be<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> lot<00:00:30.119> more<00:00:31.189> it<00:00:32.189> can<00:00:32.309> be<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.399> lot<00:00:32.520> stronger

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.170 
be a lot more it can be a lot stronger
it<00:00:33.270> could<00:00:33.510> be<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> lot<00:00:34.190> different<00:00:35.190> than<00:00:35.760> what<00:00:36.059> it

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
it could be a lot different than what it

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.610 
it could be a lot different than what it
feels<00:00:36.390> like<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:36.719> these<00:00:36.840> were<00:00:37.050> ones<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.469> was

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
feels like so these were ones that I was

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.200 
feels like so these were ones that I was
a<00:00:37.649> little<00:00:37.800> bit<00:00:38.040> more<00:00:38.280> hesitant<00:00:38.730> about<00:00:38.940> getting

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
a little bit more hesitant about getting

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.000 
a little bit more hesitant about getting
