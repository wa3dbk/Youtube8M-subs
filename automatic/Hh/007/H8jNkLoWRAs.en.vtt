to<00:01:02.879> use<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.449> prototype<00:01:03.930> lobbies<00:01:04.439> because

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
to use it in prototype lobbies because

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.640 
to use it in prototype lobbies because
it<00:01:05.430> will<00:01:05.580> just<00:01:05.700> destroy<00:01:06.510> everything<00:01:07.140> else<00:01:07.470> in

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
it will just destroy everything else in

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.039 
it will just destroy everything else in
the<00:01:07.740> race<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.159> mean<00:01:08.189> it's<00:01:08.400> got<00:01:08.549> all<00:01:08.580> wheel<00:01:08.909> drive

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
the race I mean it's got all wheel drive

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.649 
the race I mean it's got all wheel drive
what<00:01:10.049> chance<00:01:10.350> has<00:01:10.530> anything<00:01:10.740> else<00:01:10.979> got<00:01:11.659> well

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
what chance has anything else got well

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.410 
what chance has anything else got well
you<00:01:13.100> kind<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.280> right<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.760> wrong<00:01:14.820> at<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> same

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
you kind of right and wrong at the same

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.120 
you kind of right and wrong at the same
time<00:01:15.720> because<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.200> all-wheel<00:01:16.500> drive<00:01:16.799> does

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
time because the all-wheel drive does

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.850 
time because the all-wheel drive does
definitely<00:01:17.460> make<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.090> car<00:01:18.390> really<00:01:19.320> great<00:01:19.650> to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
definitely make this car really great to

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.499 
definitely make this car really great to
drive<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.369> low<00:01:20.520> speed<00:01:20.820> handling<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.479> a

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
drive the low speed handling is a

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.050 
drive the low speed handling is a
definite<00:01:22.200> five<00:01:22.439> out<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.680> five<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
definite five out of five and the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.080 
definite five out of five and the
drivability<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:25.110> also<00:01:25.710> 5<00:01:26.009> out<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.250> 5<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:26.700> so

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
drivability is also 5 out of 5 it's so

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.469 
drivability is also 5 out of 5 it's so
easy<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.869> drive<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.740> car<00:01:29.009> even<00:01:29.850> with<00:01:30.180> no

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
prototype experience you can just jump

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.480

actually<00:01:59.130> slower<00:01:59.880> around<00:02:00.420> Monaco<00:02:01.100> than<00:02:02.100> the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
actually slower around Monaco than the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.179 
actually slower around Monaco than the
Bentley

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
Bentley

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.109 
Bentley
and<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.899> really<00:02:05.200> shocked<00:02:05.619> me<00:02:05.740> now<00:02:06.640> with<00:02:07.090> the

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
and that really shocked me now with the

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.900 
and that really shocked me now with the
different<00:02:07.329> driver<00:02:07.810> I'm<00:02:08.170> sure<00:02:08.410> you<00:02:08.890> or<00:02:09.220> someone

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
different driver I'm sure you or someone

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.580 
different driver I'm sure you or someone
else<00:02:10.090> may<00:02:10.300> be<00:02:10.330> quicker<00:02:10.780> in<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.050> Mazda<00:02:11.440> than

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
else may be quicker in the Mazda than

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.979 
else may be quicker in the Mazda than
the<00:02:11.739> Bentley<00:02:11.890> but<00:02:12.580> me<00:02:12.819> driving<00:02:13.330> both<00:02:13.480> cars

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
the Bentley but me driving both cars

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.320 
the Bentley but me driving both cars
I<00:02:14.019> was<00:02:14.260> quicker<00:02:14.590> in<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:14.920> Bentley<00:02:15.280> than<00:02:16.209> in

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
I was quicker in the Bentley than in

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.180 
I was quicker in the Bentley than in
this<00:02:16.480> car<00:02:16.690> how<00:02:17.290> weird<00:02:17.590> is<00:02:17.769> that

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
this car how weird is that

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.150 
this car how weird is that
but<00:02:18.940> yeah<00:02:19.629> still<00:02:20.019> a<00:02:20.080> great<00:02:20.290> car<00:02:20.590> so<00:02:20.830> that's<00:02:21.010> it

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
but yeah still a great car so that's it

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.820 
but yeah still a great car so that's it
for<00:02:21.280> our<00:02:21.370> city<00:02:21.670> truck<00:02:22.030> now<00:02:22.750> let's<00:02:22.989> go<00:02:23.200> to

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
for our city truck now let's go to

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.710 
for our city truck now let's go to
Ascari<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:27.370> we've<00:02:27.640> established<00:02:27.790> that<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.480> LM

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
Ascari so we've established that the LM

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.199 
Ascari so we've established that the LM
55<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:29.470> really<00:02:29.830> good<00:02:30.069> on<00:02:30.190> city<00:02:30.519> tracks<00:02:30.910> and

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
55 is really good on city tracks and

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.059 
55 is really good on city tracks and
that's<00:02:31.390> not<00:02:31.599> surprising<00:02:31.810> it's<00:02:32.379> mainly<00:02:32.560> due<00:02:32.769> to

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
that's not surprising it's mainly due to

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.979 
that's not surprising it's mainly due to
its<00:02:33.190> all-wheel-drive<00:02:33.519> it<00:02:34.480> means<00:02:34.720> that<00:02:34.900> it

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
its all-wheel-drive it means that it

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.440 
its all-wheel-drive it means that it
never<00:02:35.260> will<00:02:35.500> spends<00:02:36.099> your<00:02:36.489> power<00:02:36.760> uptake<00:02:37.269> is

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
never will spends your power uptake is

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.809 
never will spends your power uptake is
instant<00:02:38.049> and<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.590> can<00:02:38.769> really<00:02:39.040> throw<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.610> car

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
instant and you can really throw the car

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.270 
instant and you can really throw the car
around<00:02:40.180> corners<00:02:40.750> now<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.500> car<00:02:41.769> does<00:02:42.040> have<00:02:42.250> a

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
around corners now the car does have a

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.069 
around corners now the car does have a
little<00:02:42.519> bit<00:02:42.819> of<00:02:42.849> understeer<00:02:43.450> because<00:02:43.840> of<00:02:43.989> the

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
little bit of understeer because of the

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.650 
little bit of understeer because of the
oil<00:02:44.379> drive<00:02:44.620> system<00:02:45.069> but<00:02:45.670> it<00:02:45.790> still<00:02:46.150> handles

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
oil drive system but it still handles

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.319 
oil drive system but it still handles
pretty<00:02:47.200> much<00:02:47.470> perfectly<00:02:48.340> as<00:02:48.610> you'd<00:02:48.879> expect

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
pretty much perfectly as you'd expect

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.210 
pretty much perfectly as you'd expect

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
opie as you may think the power is

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.780 
opie as you may think the power is
actually<00:02:58.180> only<00:02:58.359> around<00:02:58.870> same<00:02:59.290> as<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.799> 787b

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
actually only around same as the 787b

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.479 
actually only around same as the 787b
before<00:03:01.569> it's<00:03:01.690> been<00:03:01.840> tuned<00:03:02.170> it's<00:03:02.379> around<00:03:02.590> 830

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
before it's been tuned it's around 830

before it's been tuned it's around 830
horsepower<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.480> it<00:03:05.349> actually<00:03:05.680> weighs<00:03:05.859> around

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
horsepower and it actually weighs around

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.059 
horsepower and it actually weighs around
the<00:03:06.519> same<00:03:06.700> as<00:03:06.819> the<00:03:06.940> 787b<00:03:07.630> as<00:03:07.780> well<00:03:07.959> by<00:03:08.290> 130

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
the same as the 787b as well by 130

the same as the 787b as well by 130
kilos<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:11.370> surprising<00:03:12.370> really<00:03:12.549> because<00:03:12.849> when

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
kilos so surprising really because when

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.690 
kilos so surprising really because when
you<00:03:13.450> drive<00:03:13.660> it<00:03:13.840> feels<00:03:14.170> more<00:03:14.440> like<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.620> safe<00:03:15.130> 500

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
you drive it feels more like a safe 500

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.289 
you drive it feels more like a safe 500
kilo<00:03:16.030> car<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.450> thousand<00:03:16.900> horsepower<00:03:18.299> but

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
kilo car and a thousand horsepower but

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.759 
kilo car and a thousand horsepower but
it's<00:03:19.450> a<00:03:19.510> great<00:03:19.660> car<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:19.930> drive<00:03:20.079> on<00:03:20.410> this<00:03:20.530> track

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
it's a great car to drive on this track

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.800 
it's a great car to drive on this track
as<00:03:20.919> well<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.250> be<00:03:21.340> honest<00:03:21.579> again<00:03:22.090> mid-range

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
as well to be honest again mid-range

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.520 
as well to be honest again mid-range
handling<00:03:23.290> five<00:03:23.680> out<00:03:23.889> of<00:03:23.919> five<00:03:24.209> but

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
handling five out of five but

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.289 
handling five out of five but
surprisingly<00:03:26.530> though<00:03:27.280> obviously<00:03:27.549> I'm<00:03:28.120> gonna

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
surprisingly though obviously I'm gonna

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.120 
surprisingly though obviously I'm gonna
give<00:03:28.450> it<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.569> five<00:03:28.780> out<00:03:29.079> of<00:03:29.139> five<00:03:29.260> on<00:03:29.680> this<00:03:29.829> track

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
give it a five out of five on this track

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.539 
give it a five out of five on this track
as<00:03:30.370> well<00:03:30.579> as<00:03:30.700> city<00:03:30.940> tracks<00:03:31.329> again<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:33.280> is

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
as well as city tracks again it is

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.080 
as well as city tracks again it is
slower<00:03:34.060> than<00:03:34.389> the<00:03:34.540> Bentley<00:03:35.019> and<00:03:35.340> I<00:03:36.340> really<00:03:36.910> did

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
slower than the Bentley and I really did

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.240 
slower than the Bentley and I really did
not<00:03:37.209> expect<00:03:37.269> this<00:03:37.780> uh<00:03:37.959> it<00:03:38.230> shocked<00:03:38.620> me<00:03:38.889> when<00:03:39.099> it

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
not expect this uh it shocked me when it

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.339 
not expect this uh it shocked me when it
did<00:03:39.400> it<00:03:39.430> on<00:03:39.579> Monaco<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:40.299> on<00:03:40.720> this<00:03:40.840> truck<00:03:41.169> even

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
did it on Monaco and on this truck even

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.860 
did it on Monaco and on this truck even
more<00:03:41.680> so<00:03:41.919> because<00:03:42.099> I<00:03:42.340> thought<00:03:42.730> that<00:03:43.450> this<00:03:43.569> cars

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
more so because I thought that this cars

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.530 
more so because I thought that this cars
crazy<00:03:44.470> mid-range<00:03:45.069> performance<00:03:45.299> would<00:03:46.299> just

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
crazy mid-range performance would just

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.770 
crazy mid-range performance would just
completely<00:03:47.139> dominate<00:03:47.829> this<00:03:48.010> track<00:03:48.660> but<00:03:49.660> that

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
completely dominate this track but that

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.470 
completely dominate this track but that
wasn't<00:03:50.079> the<00:03:50.139> case<00:03:50.489> like<00:03:51.489> I<00:03:51.519> said<00:03:51.849> again<00:03:52.060> the

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
wasn't the case like I said again the

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.780 
wasn't the case like I said again the
Bentley<00:03:52.900> was<00:03:53.139> the<00:03:53.470> quickest<00:03:53.950> prototype<00:03:54.519> of

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
Bentley was the quickest prototype of

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.720 
Bentley was the quickest prototype of
all<00:03:55.359> the<00:03:55.599> ones<00:03:55.750> are<00:03:55.959> tested<00:03:56.349> and<00:03:57.250> this<00:03:57.430> car

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
all the ones are tested and this car

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.020 
all the ones are tested and this car
came<00:03:58.000> in<00:03:58.030> behind<00:03:58.329> him<00:03:59.250> so<00:04:00.250> surprising

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
came in behind him so surprising

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.470 
came in behind him so surprising
but<00:04:01.690> what<00:04:01.870> about<00:04:02.139> on<00:04:02.379> high<00:04:02.709> speed<00:04:03.069> tracks<00:04:03.480> well

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
but what about on high speed tracks well

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.170 
but what about on high speed tracks well
let's<00:04:04.780> go<00:04:04.930> finally<00:04:05.410> to<00:04:05.560> Spa<00:04:05.919> and<00:04:06.370> find

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.220 

so<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.840> LM<00:04:12.200> 55<00:04:12.829> performs<00:04:13.489> really<00:04:14.269> really<00:04:14.959> well

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
so the LM 55 performs really really well

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.370 
so the LM 55 performs really really well
on<00:04:15.499> both<00:04:16.220> city<00:04:16.669> and<00:04:17.109> moderate<00:04:18.109> speed

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
on both city and moderate speed

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.370 
on both city and moderate speed
technical<00:04:18.919> tracks<00:04:19.359> so<00:04:20.359> how<00:04:20.570> does<00:04:20.630> it<00:04:20.810> do<00:04:21.139> on

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
technical tracks so how does it do on

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.189 
technical tracks so how does it do on
high<00:04:22.039> speed<00:04:22.430> trucks<00:04:22.850> well<00:04:23.180> not<00:04:23.570> surprisingly

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 
high speed trucks well not surprisingly

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.550 
high speed trucks well not surprisingly
again<00:04:24.830> it's<00:04:25.130> brilliant<00:04:26.110> now<00:04:27.110> this<00:04:27.259> is<00:04:27.410> the

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
again it's brilliant now this is the

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.310 
again it's brilliant now this is the
type<00:04:27.740> of<00:04:27.770> track<00:04:28.130> where<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.669> LM<00:04:28.940> 55<00:04:29.539> can<00:04:29.870> really

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
type of track where the LM 55 can really

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.870 
type of track where the LM 55 can really
use<00:04:30.889> all<00:04:31.220> that<00:04:31.669> top-end<00:04:32.120> performance<00:04:33.050> and

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
use all that top-end performance and

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.089 
use all that top-end performance and
that<00:04:34.880> extreme<00:04:35.690> amount<00:04:36.259> of<00:04:36.349> grip<00:04:36.680> that<00:04:36.979> it's

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:37.099 
that extreme amount of grip that it's

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:40.060 
that extreme amount of grip that it's
got<00:04:37.370> now<00:04:37.699> on<00:04:37.880> spa<00:04:38.300> it's<00:04:39.229> not<00:04:39.500> really<00:04:39.800> a<00:04:39.830> high

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
got now on spa it's not really a high

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.790 
got now on spa it's not really a high
speed<00:04:40.460> enough<00:04:41.000> track<00:04:41.750> for<00:04:42.320> this<00:04:42.380> car<00:04:42.620> to

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
speed enough track for this car to

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.550 
speed enough track for this car to
really<00:04:43.250> truly<00:04:43.610> stretch<00:04:44.090> its<00:04:44.330> legs<00:04:44.389> but<00:04:45.289> tracks

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
really truly stretch its legs but tracks

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.920 
really truly stretch its legs but tracks
such<00:04:45.830> as<00:04:45.860> the<00:04:46.130> SAR<00:04:46.460> Fay<00:04:46.729> and<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.479> Nuremberg

you<00:04:50.570> to<00:04:50.930> really<00:04:51.229> use<00:04:51.620> that<00:04:51.669> just<00:04:52.669> overwhelming

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
you to really use that just overwhelming

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.240 
you to really use that just overwhelming
a<00:04:53.750> top<00:04:53.960> speed<00:04:54.229> which<00:04:54.500> just<00:04:54.770> blows<00:04:55.009> everything

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
a top speed which just blows everything

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.700 
a top speed which just blows everything
else<00:04:55.639> or<00:04:55.849> virtually<00:04:56.300> everything<00:04:56.539> else<00:04:56.840> out<00:04:57.650> of

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
the water again high speed handling is a

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.510 
the water again high speed handling is a
strong<00:05:01.610> five<00:05:01.910> out<00:05:02.090> of<00:05:02.120> five<00:05:02.330> as<00:05:02.660> you'd<00:05:02.840> expect

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
strong five out of five as you'd expect

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.670 
strong five out of five as you'd expect
overall<00:05:04.520> on<00:05:04.849> high<00:05:05.060> speed<00:05:05.389> tracks<00:05:05.720> you<00:05:06.410> already

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
overall on high speed tracks you already

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.560 
overall on high speed tracks you already
know<00:05:06.830> it's<00:05:07.099> definitely<00:05:07.490> gonna<00:05:08.000> get<00:05:08.210> a<00:05:08.270> five

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
know it's definitely gonna get a five

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.260 
know it's definitely gonna get a five
and<00:05:08.900> for<00:05:09.530> overall<00:05:09.830> drivability<00:05:10.310> it's<00:05:10.880> still

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
and for overall drivability it's still

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.629 
and for overall drivability it's still
the<00:05:11.960> maximum<00:05:12.470> five<00:05:12.680> out<00:05:12.889> of<00:05:12.919> five<00:05:13.159> because<00:05:13.400> the

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
the maximum five out of five because the

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.529 
the maximum five out of five because the
great<00:05:13.849> thing<00:05:14.150> about<00:05:14.270> the<00:05:14.539> LM<00:05:14.810> 55<00:05:15.440> is<00:05:16.360> not<00:05:17.360> only

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
great thing about the LM 55 is not only

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:19.839 
great thing about the LM 55 is not only
is<00:05:17.840> it<00:05:17.870> as<00:05:18.080> quick<00:05:18.800> as<00:05:18.979> the<00:05:19.130> best<00:05:19.400> of<00:05:19.699> the<00:05:19.820> other

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
is it as quick as the best of the other

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.800 
is it as quick as the best of the other
lmps<00:05:20.539> but<00:05:21.409> it's<00:05:21.560> also<00:05:21.860> easier<00:05:22.639> to<00:05:22.849> drive<00:05:23.120> which

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
lmps but it's also easier to drive which

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.810 
lmps but it's also easier to drive which
makes<00:05:24.050> it<00:05:24.229> great<00:05:24.440> for<00:05:24.770> beginners<00:05:25.280> and<00:05:25.490> people

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
makes it great for beginners and people

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.520 
makes it great for beginners and people
who<00:05:25.880> have<00:05:26.030> little<00:05:26.300> or<00:05:26.570> no<00:05:26.599> experience<00:05:26.870> with

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
who have little or no experience with

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.860 
who have little or no experience with
driving<00:05:28.009> prototypes<00:05:28.639> because<00:05:29.360> some<00:05:29.570> of<00:05:29.599> them

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
driving prototypes because some of them

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.810 
driving prototypes because some of them
to<00:05:30.440> be<00:05:30.470> honest<00:05:30.800> can<00:05:31.070> be<00:05:31.280> quite<00:05:31.550> challenging

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
to be honest can be quite challenging

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.110 
to be honest can be quite challenging
for<00:05:32.330> people<00:05:32.930> who<00:05:33.349> maybe<00:05:34.070> aren't<00:05:34.370> used<00:05:34.759> to

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
for people who maybe aren't used to

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.409 
for people who maybe aren't used to
driving<00:05:35.539> prototypes<00:05:36.789> so<00:05:37.789> that's<00:05:37.970> it<00:05:38.180> for<00:05:38.360> our

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
driving prototypes so that's it for our

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.990 
driving prototypes so that's it for our
actual<00:05:38.659> truck<00:05:39.110> testing<00:05:39.650> of<00:05:39.830> the<00:05:40.039> car<00:05:40.220> so<00:05:40.789> now

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
actual truck testing of the car so now

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.550 
actual truck testing of the car so now
let's<00:05:41.180> go<00:05:41.300> back<00:05:41.509> to<00:05:41.539> the<00:05:41.810> garage<00:05:41.990> for<00:05:42.500> the

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
let's go back to the garage for the

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.370 
let's go back to the garage for the
final<00:05:42.979> roundup<00:05:43.370> of<00:05:43.520> this<00:05:44.180> cars<00:05:44.449> best<00:05:44.780> and<00:05:45.080> last

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
final roundup of this cars best and last

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:52.029 
final roundup of this cars best and last
point

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:55.249 

so<00:05:53.039> overall<00:05:53.490> you're<00:05:54.150> probably<00:05:54.509> not<00:05:55.020> that

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:55.259 
so overall you're probably not that

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:57.200 
so overall you're probably not that
surprised<00:05:55.710> that<00:05:55.979> I<00:05:56.009> gave<00:05:56.220> this<00:05:56.430> car<00:05:56.639> five<00:05:57.030> out

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
surprised that I gave this car five out

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.140 
surprised that I gave this car five out
of<00:05:57.240> five<00:05:57.539> in<00:05:57.840> every<00:05:58.440> single<00:05:59.280> aspect<00:05:59.430> of<00:05:59.970> the

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
of five in every single aspect of the

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.540 
of five in every single aspect of the
test<00:06:00.440> but<00:06:01.440> what<00:06:01.590> you<00:06:01.710> might<00:06:01.949> be<00:06:02.130> surprised

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
test but what you might be surprised

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.999 
test but what you might be surprised
about<00:06:02.759> is<00:06:03.570> that<00:06:03.840> it<00:06:03.990> wasn't<00:06:04.350> the<00:06:04.470> quickest<00:06:04.860> I

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:05.009 
about is that it wasn't the quickest I

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:07.249 
about is that it wasn't the quickest I
know<00:06:05.070> I<00:06:05.190> certainly<00:06:05.699> was<00:06:06.060> surprised<00:06:06.509> by<00:06:07.020> that

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 
know I certainly was surprised by that

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:09.320 
know I certainly was surprised by that
it<00:06:07.440> was<00:06:07.560> slower<00:06:07.860> than<00:06:08.009> the<00:06:08.250> Bentley<00:06:08.430> on<00:06:09.060> both

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
it was slower than the Bentley on both

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.260 
it was slower than the Bentley on both
Monaco<00:06:09.870> and<00:06:10.110> Ascari<00:06:10.680> and<00:06:11.130> it<00:06:11.699> was<00:06:11.820> slower<00:06:12.120> than

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.430 
Monaco and Ascari and it was slower than
both<00:06:12.570> the<00:06:12.780> Persia<00:06:13.050> 908<00:06:13.830> and<00:06:14.130> 905<00:06:14.940> on<00:06:15.360> Spa<00:06:16.139> that

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
both the Persia 908 and 905 on Spa that

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.409 
both the Persia 908 and 905 on Spa that
really<00:06:17.160> surprised<00:06:17.610> me<00:06:17.729> considering<00:06:18.300> how

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
really surprised me considering how

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:20.390 
really surprised me considering how
quick<00:06:18.750> this<00:06:18.990> car<00:06:19.289> is<00:06:19.470> in<00:06:19.590> a<00:06:19.680> straight<00:06:19.949> line

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
quick this car is in a straight line

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.540 
quick this car is in a straight line
but<00:06:21.060> there<00:06:21.539> you<00:06:21.660> go<00:06:21.720> I'm<00:06:22.500> sure<00:06:22.860> if<00:06:23.009> I<00:06:23.130> did<00:06:23.280> a<00:06:23.310> few

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
but there you go I'm sure if I did a few

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.610 
but there you go I'm sure if I did a few
extra<00:06:23.940> laps<00:06:24.120> the<00:06:24.509> lap<00:06:24.690> times<00:06:24.960> would<00:06:25.199> turn<00:06:25.410> out

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
extra laps the lap times would turn out

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.650 
extra laps the lap times would turn out
differently<00:06:26.039> but<00:06:26.340> it<00:06:26.940> was<00:06:27.090> just<00:06:27.240> basically

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 
differently but it was just basically

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.749 
differently but it was just basically
the<00:06:28.259> first<00:06:28.530> time<00:06:28.770> I'll<00:06:28.919> drive<00:06:29.099> the<00:06:29.130> car<00:06:29.460> see

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 
the first time I'll drive the car see

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:31.550 
the first time I'll drive the car see
how<00:06:29.970> it<00:06:30.120> turns<00:06:30.330> out<00:06:30.539> and<00:06:30.599> that's<00:06:31.169> how<00:06:31.320> it

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
how it turns out and that's how it

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.490 
how it turns out and that's how it
turned<00:06:31.770> out<00:06:32.180> now<00:06:33.180> the<00:06:33.479> best<00:06:33.690> point<00:06:34.050> about<00:06:34.320> the

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
turned out now the best point about the

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.969 
turned out now the best point about the

earlier on in the video it's obvious its

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
the LM 55 fast anyone can do it you

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.320 
the LM 55 fast anyone can do it you
don't<00:06:46.830> need<00:06:47.160> experience<00:06:47.729> at<00:06:48.090> driving

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
prototypes the all-wheel drive is

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.760

which<00:06:55.380> is<00:06:55.560> good<00:06:55.800> it<00:06:55.919> means<00:06:56.039> you<00:06:56.190> can<00:06:56.340> plan<00:06:56.580> for

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:56.610 
which is good it means you can plan for

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.430 
which is good it means you can plan for
corners<00:06:57.300> rather<00:06:57.570> than<00:06:57.810> having<00:06:57.960> snap

a very forgiving car to drive which is
makes<00:07:03.930> it<00:07:04.080> great<00:07:04.349> for<00:07:04.560> people<00:07:04.740> who<00:07:05.550> don't<00:07:05.820> have

much prototype prototype I should say

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.500 
much prototype prototype I should say
driving<00:07:09.750> experience<00:07:10.440> the<00:07:11.190> worst<00:07:11.430> point<00:07:11.789> and

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:12.510 
driving experience the worst point and

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.930 
driving experience the worst point and
yes<00:07:12.870> it<00:07:13.080> does<00:07:13.289> happen<00:07:13.530> I<00:07:13.830> would<00:07:13.979> say<00:07:14.190> the<00:07:14.729> worst

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 
yes it does happen I would say the worst

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:19.339 
yes it does happen I would say the worst
point<00:07:15.240> on<00:07:15.419> this<00:07:15.570> car<00:07:15.840> is<00:07:17.780> it<00:07:18.780> does<00:07:19.050> have<00:07:19.320> a

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:19.349 
point on this car is it does have a

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:20.930 
point on this car is it does have a
little<00:07:19.500> bit<00:07:19.620> of<00:07:19.770> understeer<00:07:20.220> as<00:07:20.430> I<00:07:20.729> just

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:20.940 
little bit of understeer as I just

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.460 
little bit of understeer as I just
mentioned<00:07:21.330> and<00:07:21.509> although<00:07:21.930> that's<00:07:22.080> a<00:07:22.259> good

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:22.470 
mentioned and although that's a good

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.110 
mentioned and although that's a good
thing<00:07:22.740> as<00:07:22.979> I<00:07:23.039> said<00:07:23.220> it<00:07:23.490> allows<00:07:23.669> you<00:07:23.789> to<00:07:23.880> plan

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 
thing as I said it allows you to plan

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.469 
thing as I said it allows you to plan
for<00:07:24.360> corners<00:07:24.780> better<00:07:25.400> it<00:07:26.400> is<00:07:26.639> still<00:07:27.000> kind<00:07:27.300> of<00:07:27.419> a

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 
for corners better it is still kind of a

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:28.969 
for corners better it is still kind of a
downside<00:07:27.690> it<00:07:28.169> means<00:07:28.320> that<00:07:28.500> the<00:07:28.590> handling

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:28.979 
downside it means that the handling

00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:31.430 
downside it means that the handling
isn't<00:07:29.310> necessarily<00:07:30.000> perfect<00:07:30.810> now<00:07:31.080> I've<00:07:31.199> given

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.440 
isn't necessarily perfect now I've given

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.890 
isn't necessarily perfect now I've given
it<00:07:31.530> a<00:07:31.590> 5<00:07:31.800> out<00:07:31.949> of<00:07:31.979> 5

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:32.900 
it a 5 out of 5

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.450 
it a 5 out of 5
but<00:07:33.900> I've<00:07:34.020> also<00:07:34.169> given<00:07:34.409> other<00:07:34.650> prototypes<00:07:35.039> 5

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:35.460 
but I've also given other prototypes 5

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.999 
but I've also given other prototypes 5
out<00:07:35.639> of<00:07:35.729> 5<00:07:35.909> so<00:07:36.210> by<00:07:36.870> 5<00:07:37.139> out<00:07:37.320> of<00:07:37.349> 5<00:07:37.590> I<00:07:37.650> don't

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:38.009 
out of 5 so by 5 out of 5 I don't

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:39.589 
out of 5 so by 5 out of 5 I don't
necessarily<00:07:38.159> mean<00:07:38.639> perfect

00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 
necessarily mean perfect

00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:43.189 
necessarily mean perfect
I<00:07:39.720> just<00:07:40.080> mean<00:07:40.229> very<00:07:40.770> very<00:07:41.310> good<00:07:41.699> so<00:07:42.240> know<00:07:42.810> this

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 
I just mean very very good so know this

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:44.960 
I just mean very very good so know this
car<00:07:43.470> isn't<00:07:43.680> perfect<00:07:44.280> I<00:07:44.430> don't<00:07:44.460> think<00:07:44.699> there's

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:44.970 
car isn't perfect I don't think there's

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.360 
car isn't perfect I don't think there's
a<00:07:45.060> single<00:07:45.449> car<00:07:45.690> on<00:07:45.930> any<00:07:46.349> racing<00:07:46.949> game<00:07:47.099> that<00:07:47.130> you

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:47.370 
a single car on any racing game that you

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.640 
a single car on any racing game that you
could<00:07:47.520> call<00:07:47.759> perfect<00:07:48.090> not<00:07:48.930> even<00:07:49.199> the<00:07:49.289> red<00:07:49.440> ball

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:49.650 
could call perfect not even the red ball

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:51.290 
could call perfect not even the red ball
because<00:07:50.220> the<00:07:50.340> red<00:07:50.490> balls<00:07:50.699> are<00:07:50.849> not<00:07:50.970> definitely

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.300 
because the red balls are not definitely

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.629 
because the red balls are not definitely
not<00:07:51.360> easy<00:07:51.690> to<00:07:51.930> drive<00:07:52.199> but<00:07:53.039> I<00:07:53.099> think<00:07:53.370> that<00:07:53.520> this

00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 
not easy to drive but I think that this

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:56.649 
not easy to drive but I think that this
Mazda<00:07:53.970> is<00:07:54.330> one<00:07:54.659> of<00:07:54.780> the<00:07:54.900> closest<00:07:55.560> to<00:07:56.460> being

00:07:56.649 --> 00:07:56.659 
Mazda is one of the closest to being

00:07:56.659 --> 00:07:59.689 
Mazda is one of the closest to being
perfect<00:07:57.659> that's<00:07:58.050> on<00:07:58.199> Gran<00:07:58.409> Turismo<00:07:58.590> 6<00:07:59.039> very

00:07:59.689 --> 00:07:59.699 
perfect that's on Gran Turismo 6 very

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:02.180
