when I was about 12 my father met with

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.240 
when I was about 12 my father met with
me<00:00:11.760> and<00:00:11.880> my<00:00:11.970> sister<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.600> told<00:00:12.960> me<00:00:13.230> that<00:00:13.440> my

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
me and my sister and told me that my

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.820 
me and my sister and told me that my
mother<00:00:14.520> had<00:00:14.730> kidney<00:00:15.030> failure<00:00:15.439> and<00:00:16.439> stage

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
mother had kidney failure and stage

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.550 
mother had kidney failure and stage
renal<00:00:17.100> failure<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.660> that<00:00:18.660> she<00:00:18.810> would<00:00:18.900> be

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
renal failure and that she would be

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.300 
renal failure and that she would be
starting<00:00:19.950> dialysis<00:00:20.550> very<00:00:20.790> quickly<00:00:21.950> so<00:00:22.950> it<00:00:23.189> was

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
starting dialysis very quickly so it was

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.290 
starting dialysis very quickly so it was
something<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.910> was<00:00:24.950> prepared<00:00:25.950> for<00:00:26.300> but

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
something that I was prepared for but

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
months to live on dialysis because my

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.279 
months to live on dialysis because my
body<00:01:10.500> didn't<00:01:10.799> respond<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.490> very<00:01:11.610> well<00:01:12.289> they

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:13.289 
body didn't respond to it very well they

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:15.950 
body didn't respond to it very well they
were<00:01:13.380> only<00:01:13.499> taking<00:01:13.850> kidneys<00:01:14.850> from<00:01:15.060> mothers

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
were only taking kidneys from mothers

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.200 
were only taking kidneys from mothers
fathers<00:01:16.200> sisters<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.920> brothers<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.520> since

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
fathers sisters and brothers and since

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.450 
fathers sisters and brothers and since
my<00:01:18.359> sister<00:01:18.749> has<00:01:18.899> the<00:01:19.079> same<00:01:19.259> condition<00:01:19.829> they

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
my sister has the same condition they

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.249 
my sister has the same condition they
couldn't<00:01:20.729> really<00:01:20.909> take<00:01:21.179> it<00:01:21.299> from<00:01:21.479> her<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:24.259> I'm

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
couldn't really take it from her so I'm

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.039 
couldn't really take it from her so I'm
so<00:01:26.249> my<00:01:26.399> father<00:01:26.639> ended<00:01:27.090> up<00:01:27.179> stepping<00:01:27.600> forward

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
so my father ended up stepping forward

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.850 
so my father ended up stepping forward
to<00:01:28.530> giving<00:01:28.710> me<00:01:28.950> kidney

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
to giving me kidney

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.720 
to giving me kidney
and<00:01:30.160> so<00:01:30.490> we<00:01:30.610> had<00:01:30.760> him<00:01:30.970> tested<00:01:31.180> and<00:01:32.520> he<00:01:33.520> turned

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
and so we had him tested and he turned

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.110 
and so we had him tested and he turned
out<00:01:33.850> to<00:01:34.030> be<00:01:34.150> a<00:01:34.180> match<00:01:34.570> not<00:01:34.990> a<00:01:35.020> great<00:01:35.290> match<00:01:36.120> but

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
out to be a match not a great match but

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.150 
out to be a match not a great match but
a<00:01:37.360> match<00:01:38.580> after<00:01:39.580> testing<00:01:40.330> within<00:01:41.160> three

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
a match after testing within three

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.350 
a match after testing within three
months<00:01:42.340> we<00:01:43.000> were<00:01:43.120> doing<00:01:43.330> a<00:01:43.390> transplant<00:01:45.360> so

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
months we were doing a transplant so

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.530 
months we were doing a transplant so
many<00:01:46.540> people<00:01:47.520> are<00:01:48.520> on<00:01:48.610> lists<00:01:49.090> waiting<00:01:49.390> for

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
many people are on lists waiting for

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.420 
many people are on lists waiting for
organs<00:01:49.690> and<00:01:50.170> a<00:01:50.710> lot<00:01:50.920> of<00:01:50.950> them<00:01:51.130> will<00:01:51.400> die

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
organs and a lot of them will die

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.460 
organs and a lot of them will die
waiting<00:01:52.390> when<00:01:53.460> if<00:01:54.570> more<00:01:55.570> people<00:01:55.930> came<00:01:56.080> forward

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
waiting when if more people came forward

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.600 
waiting when if more people came forward
and<00:01:56.890> realized<00:01:57.880> how<00:01:58.060> important<00:01:58.720> this<00:01:58.930> is<00:01:59.610> they

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
and realized how important this is they

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:09.090 
and realized how important this is they
could<00:02:00.820> save<00:02:01.180> so<00:02:01.900> many<00:02:02.050> lives

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.950 

I<00:02:09.190> started<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.090> experience<00:02:10.420> really<00:02:10.780> high

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
I started to experience really high

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.300 
I started to experience really high
blood<00:02:11.200> pressure<00:02:12.000> probably<00:02:13.000> in<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.300> range<00:02:13.450> of

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
blood pressure probably in the range of

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.330 
blood pressure probably in the range of
240<00:02:15.310> over<00:02:15.490> 140<00:02:16.240> for<00:02:16.840> weeks<00:02:17.020> at<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.230> time<00:02:17.340> they

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
240 over 140 for weeks at a time they

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.280 
240 over 140 for weeks at a time they
immediately<00:02:18.490> put<00:02:18.970> me<00:02:19.090> on<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.210> list<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.750> ready

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290

to<00:02:20.470> go<00:02:20.620> for<00:02:20.830> another<00:02:21.100> transplant<00:02:22.200> because<00:02:23.200> of

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
to go for another transplant because of

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.930 
to go for another transplant because of
you<00:02:23.950> know<00:02:24.070> they<00:02:24.190> knew<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:24.400> there<00:02:24.670> was<00:02:24.790> no

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
you know they knew that there was no

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.130 
you know they knew that there was no
hope<00:02:25.090> for<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:27.540> couple<00:02:28.540> of<00:02:28.660> my<00:02:28.750> family

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
hope for it and a couple of my family

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.200
