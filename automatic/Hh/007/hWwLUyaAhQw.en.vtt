00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:11.819
 in the previous tutorial we saw how to find a book in the library 

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:14.819
 using the search options 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.849
 now we will see how they found book using the sort options 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:25.009
 but the fact is that this way of finding books is also a way 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.849
 to organize our shelves if we are worth the metaphor 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:30.949
 for example 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.510
 I want to see my books in alphabetical order by title clicked on 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.250
 It is the head of Colombia 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.510
 I want to see them grouped according to the publishing house 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.170
 something that nick there 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.790
 if in my house I wanted to rearrange the shelves in this way it would take me 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.230
 all afternoon 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.230
 in the four is a matter of a second 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.460
 also 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.140
 as we saw in a previous tutorial 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.600
 if you right click on one of the column headers 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.950
 you can add expo remove fields from the window 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.790
 The most basic function is to sort by alphabetical order so 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.730
 ascendant arrived descending 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:16.880
 that is to say 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.780
 you give 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.780
 accept podés eta 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.650
 the filter by titles shows all titles without distinction 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.490
 however other filters organize a little more and can be more useful 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.359
 for example 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.170
 the author filter 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.650
 not only shows by author alphabetically ascending or descending 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.530
 but it brings together the books that an author has written under his name 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.060
 This can be very useful since it can reduce the number of 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.970
 results 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.450
 if for example I want to see all the books in my collection written by 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.240
 federico pertusi 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.890
 clicked on his name 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.670
 and I see that I have five of him 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.670
 I choose book that I want and there will be 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.630
 another very interesting example in this regard is the series filter 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:14.510
 for example if I look for the series 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.939
 Hispanic world biblical commentary 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:18.840
 I can see all the books 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.189
 from that series together 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:25.799
 from time to time these different ways of filtering the results 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.829
 will let you see misprints in the way a book has been cataloged 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.379
 in this case 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.079
 we can see that some of these comments were cataloged with the tilde 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.459
 on the biblical i 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.829
 and others do not 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.719
 I imagine that part of this is because many of those who work in the 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.029
 text processing department of wolves 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:49.959
 they do not speak spanish 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.659
 so it's more difficult for them to realize details of this kind 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.009
 Thus 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.009
 if you get to see something like that 

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:02.699
 will use to improve the database of wolves by sending a message to their 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:04.499
 technical support 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:05.360
 in fact 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.080
 as I will send a note about the rat that we are seeing in this video 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:14.129
 it is possible that if you have this series and search according to the series after seeing 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.429
 this tutorial 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:19.179
 they leave you and all together because it is sustainable with wolves 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:22.179
 you have already corrected the information 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.619
 if we each notify rats that we find 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:29.619
 resources improve for all 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.499
 finally we can combine the two ways to find books 

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:40.609
 we can use both the functions of sorting and searching in the same 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.179
 operation and maybe it is one of the easiest and most powerful ways 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:47.529
 to work with the library 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:51.249
 I have 215 authors right now in my library 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:55.879
 much easier than looking at a thousand 900 titles 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.379
 but there are still many 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.870
 if the author column was attached I can see all their names 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.099
 now if I start typing a name in the search engine let's say artusi again 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.749
 but with the author filter enabled yet 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:16.559
 eliminating authors from the list 

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:18.569
 if you click on his name 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:21.569
 I see the same five books as before 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.520
 however also from another author more 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.479
 the reason for this is that although at this moment in the library we are 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.770
 showing the results with the structure of authors 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.400
 we are not technically filtering the results according to that filter 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.910
 the fact that the wolf shows us another result means that in 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.610
 some field in the book by andré roberto 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.610
 the name federico pertusi appears 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:54.610
 It turns out that there is a review of him in the field of information about the 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.259
 resources of this book 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.259
 finally for bilingual users like me 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.110
 I've seen myself using this trick to separate my resources in English 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.050
 of misael resources in Spanish 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.790
 just click elera ng 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.629
 point that s 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:15.349
 and now everything I see in the library 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:16.229
 with nothing 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:17.999
 presentation that will be 

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:20.529
 I get it in Spanish 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:24.029
 If I want to do the same with my resources in English, I just changed 

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:25.559
 he the ice 

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:27.740
 m 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.800
 as you can see ing many ways to find books with the library 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.240
 get to practice with any of these 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.550
 because you never know when a particular 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.629
 It may be just what you were looking for
