00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.889
 and the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.309
 welcome to one happy box creativity 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.380
 as a family this month we are going to launch 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.910
 the gardening we are so eager to 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.100
 spring come we 're going to 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.140
 decorate some pots and plant some 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.869
 seeds in our box you go to 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.110
 find some scraps of fabric the 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.420
 seeds pots of two sizes papers 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.400
 to label and paper pinocho and some 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.950
 skewers to make a lovely mushroom 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.770
 to decorate the pots and at home 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:36.250
 we have to have earth scissors 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.739
 glue and a pencil the first thing that 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:43.059
 let's do is mark the fabric with the 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:46.530
 curved shape that we will need to 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.530
 then cut the pot well 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.340
 and now we cut the cloth 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.290
 this is the way you have to have 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.780
 Now what we are going to do is check 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.890
 the measurement of heights that surely 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.500
 you have to adjust it a bit 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.500
 we are going to adjust a little bit 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.640
 our fabric is already tight and now 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.240
 double we see that it is practically a 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.159
 the height 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.170
 of this bar so that when you throw 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.820
 the earth and water it well we understand 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.979
 Do not get too wet TV that is not 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.720
 spoil and now we will do the same for 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.180
 down here you have to cut more 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.360
 because we need the hole is 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.230
 free so that the water comes out that when 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.230
 let's get the plant 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.130
 Now that we have our fabric 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.539
 cropped and well adjusted the measure what 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.539
 what we are going to do is paste it 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.890
 you have to adjust 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.890
 ensuring that there are no wrinkles us 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.440
 and that's how it has to be now what 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.750
 what we are going to do is a certain 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.399
 decorative to decorate our flowerpot 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.190
 while we wait grows 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.910
 plant what we are going to need is the 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.100
 papers the pinocchio paper and the rosette and 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.110
 from home like always pencil scissors and 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.630
 glue the first thing we have to 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.940
 do is fold the red paper with the 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.650
 pencil we will give you the mushroom shape what 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.000
 We will cut with the scissors and 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.770
 we will stick leaving a small hole 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.020
 to then place the skewer 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.090
 this is how it has to be when 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.670
 you have peeled leaving this gap more 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.810
 big to place the stem that is what 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.970
 what are we going to do now 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:48.450
 taking advantage of the crease the shroud paper 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:53.700
 we're going to wrinkle a little more and 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:57.349
 we will fold this and paint our stem 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.349
 we round the ends 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.349
 we stick 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.319
 and finally we're going to do the little spots 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.110
 white we take the pinocho paper we do 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.670
 circles and we cut here I know that 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.840
 no need to double the paper 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.030
 or one side with enough paper now 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.040
 that we already have the circles cut or 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.040
 the stains are going to stick 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.930
 with a little bit of glue is more than 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.330
 enough because this great role 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.960
 phenomenal now what we are going to do is 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:37.230
 stick the stick on the skewer 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.710
 in the trunk of the mushroom is the easiest 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:44.020
 it will always be 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.020
 put the glue directly 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.829
 from the stick 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.530
 and we press a little so that it sticks 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.450
 and we have our diet now that 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.790
 we have the mushroom let's do the 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.239
 label so we know what plant 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.590
 we have in our flowerpot then what 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.400
 what we will do is catch one of these 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.220
 we doubled it but that would be the result 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.240
 a little thick then we're going to 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.569
 cut 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.080
 we put some glue here in the 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.080
 extremes 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.569
 our zeta 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.100
 i 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:42.500
 we stick 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.940
 pressing well in the area of ​​the club 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.940
 so that it does not move 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.949
 if the same 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.949
 with the tag 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.770
 and this is where you have to write then 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.840
 write for example the people who are a 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.840
 of the seeds that come in our 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.920
 box we put glue also in the 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.920
 medium and a little bit of the extremes 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.810
 And now our mushroom is leaving us in the 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.520
 back of the envelope comes a card 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.530
 so you can follow up on your 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.210
 plant the first thing that needs to be covered is 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.300
 Diaz on plants for their yes 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.910
 in February so we wrote 20 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.710
 February and after and discovering what 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.960
 that I ask you then when larreguy if the 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:34.070
 day the flower comes out and so you will have 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.070
 I remember we take the earth we press 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.490
 Y 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.490
 we throw our seeds 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:45.270
 and we put more earth on top we decorate 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:52.060
 with our mushroom 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.060
 and there is our plant 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:01.479
 comes
