00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.460
 but no 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.400
 same 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.840
 the four seasons are caused by 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.190
 that the earth revolves around the sun 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:39.130
 as illustrated in this virtual floor its 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.510
 The class's task will be to create their own 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:45.250
 virtual blackboard illustrating one of the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.260
 stations and because they think it's the most 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.250
 important 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.739
 frankie to be and cupid alan a team 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.660
 we can do the project in my house 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.760
 It sounds super refreshing and pretty 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.920
 I knew that saving every edition of 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.559
 teen spawn would be useful some 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.690
 day that is being chosen let's make 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.870
 springs the season in which everything 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.229
 it blooms and grows and love is in the 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.320
 air in the air there are also goals I am 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.300
 allergic to oars winter a time to 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.430
 the silence in the reflection if in the 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.040
 pollen we would not have flowers if in the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.740
 winter there is no snow without snow there is no 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.290
 snowy days we could choose the summer 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.509
 at least in spring you can go outside 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.759
 nothing better than a night next to the 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.940
 fireplace are you saying that winter 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.070
 it's better that spring is a fact 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.259
 we could do autumn in winter there 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.810
 sledges in spring you can catch 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.670
 butterflies scalar glacier to caritas 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.860
 snow pride rides 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.990
 both stations are great at 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.250
 way is look how beautiful this flower is 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:59.770
 Ice flower more chilling goodbye to 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.770
 my big boss promised is like 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.409
 they do not understand that there could not be 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:10.660
 Spring without winter or winter without 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.660
 spring is that 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.500
 to Cupid and I understand that without 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.600
 winter there can be no spring and 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.080
 while a station becomes 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.650
 another the most important thing is how to work 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.650
 together
