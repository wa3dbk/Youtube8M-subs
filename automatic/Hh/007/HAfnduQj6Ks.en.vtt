in<00:00:30.810> there<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.759> my<00:00:33.110> injector<00:00:34.760> and<00:00:36.290> basically

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
in there is my injector and basically

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.459 
in there is my injector and basically
this<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.160> combustion<00:00:38.520> chamber<00:00:39.469> right

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
this is the combustion chamber right

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.220 
this is the combustion chamber right
here<00:00:40.940> this<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> flame<00:00:42.450> tube<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:42.989> going<00:00:43.170> to

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
here this is a flame tube it's going to

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.880 
here this is a flame tube it's going to
hold<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.590> flame<00:00:43.940> produced<00:00:44.940> by<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:46.410> propane

arm so basically house is going to work
it's<00:00:52.140> going<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.410> cool<00:00:52.890> air<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.370> going<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.579> get

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
it's going to cool air is going to get

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.209 
it's going to cool air is going to get
sucked<00:00:53.940> through<00:00:54.120> these<00:00:54.300> fans<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.930> here<00:00:55.219> it's

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
sucked through these fans in here it's

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.939 
sucked through these fans in here it's
going<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.460> travel<00:00:56.699> through<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.090> PVC<00:00:57.859> into<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
going to travel through the PVC into the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.729 
going to travel through the PVC into the
combustion<00:00:59.309> chamber<00:01:00.199> it's<00:01:01.199> going<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.350> combust

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
combustion chamber it's going to combust

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.910 
combustion chamber it's going to combust
and<00:01:02.359> then<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.480> fans<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.989> here<00:01:04.320> I'm<00:01:04.500> going<00:01:04.860> to

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
and then the fans in here I'm going to

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.640 
and then the fans in here I'm going to
spin<00:01:05.159> out<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.430> exhaust<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.840> fans<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.409> here

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
spin out the exhaust the fans in here

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.530 
spin out the exhaust the fans in here
and<00:01:07.830> here<00:01:08.070> are<00:01:08.100> working<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.700> same<00:01:08.939> axis<00:01:09.799> so

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
and here are working on the same axis so

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.760 
and here are working on the same axis so
that's<00:01:12.540> basically<00:01:12.780> how<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.560> going<00:01:13.680> to

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
that's basically how it's going to

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.520 
that's basically how it's going to
operate<00:01:14.100> um<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.880> didn't<00:01:15.420> have<00:01:15.570> time<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.200> make<00:01:16.350> an

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
operate um I didn't have time to make an

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.020 
operate um I didn't have time to make an
oil<00:01:16.710> system<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.400> i<00:01:17.430> just<00:01:17.610> had<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.790> rig

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
oil system so i just had to rig

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.880 
oil system so i just had to rig
something<00:01:18.210> up<00:01:18.540> basically<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.650> just

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
something up basically this is just

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.980 
something up basically this is just
going<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.040> be<00:01:20.100> filled<00:01:20.340> up<00:01:20.400> with<00:01:20.490> oil<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.000> when

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
going to be filled up with oil and when

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.749 
going to be filled up with oil and when
it's<00:01:22.110> spitting<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.650> hydrostatic<00:01:23.159> bearings

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
it's spitting the hydrostatic bearings

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.969 
it's spitting the hydrostatic bearings
are<00:01:23.880> just<00:01:24.030> going<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.210> force<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.380> oil<00:01:25.710> down

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
are just going to force the oil down

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.980 
are just going to force the oil down
it's<00:01:26.369> going<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.580> come<00:01:26.700> through<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.180> collect

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
it's going to come through and collect

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.069 
it's going to come through and collect

on the internet that I looked at for

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.380 
on the internet that I looked at for
some<00:02:09.629> ideas<00:02:09.989> but<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.530> pretty<00:02:10.679> much<00:02:10.800> just

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
some ideas but this is pretty much just

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.580 
some ideas but this is pretty much just
what<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.420> thought<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:12.989> put

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
what I thought and put

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.380 
what I thought and put
together<00:02:13.860> based<00:02:14.190> on<00:02:14.459> looking<00:02:15.120> at<00:02:15.269> other

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
together based on looking at other

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.830 
together based on looking at other
peoples<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.370> last<00:02:17.580> thing<00:02:17.790> is<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.690> get

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
peoples and and the last thing is to get

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.290 
peoples and and the last thing is to get
the<00:02:18.959> turbine<00:02:19.349> spinning<00:02:20.000> somewhat<00:02:21.000> up<00:02:21.150> to

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
the turbine spinning somewhat up to

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.949 
the turbine spinning somewhat up to
speed<00:02:21.629> arm<00:02:22.819> before<00:02:23.819> it<00:02:24.120> starts<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:24.569> need<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.840> use

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
speed arm before it starts I need to use

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.890 
speed arm before it starts I need to use
the<00:02:24.989> leaf<00:02:25.349> blower<00:02:25.379> to<00:02:25.920> force<00:02:26.910> air<00:02:27.239> in<00:02:27.510> the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
the leaf blower to force air in the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.920 
the leaf blower to force air in the
inlet<00:02:28.260> arm<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:30.180> we'll<00:02:30.299> see<00:02:30.420> how<00:02:30.480> this<00:02:30.569> goes<00:02:32.930> so

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
inlet arm and we'll see how this goes so

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.720 
inlet arm and we'll see how this goes so
I'm<00:02:33.989> trying<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.319> get<00:02:34.379> my<00:02:34.440> computer<00:02:34.709> closer<00:02:35.370> I

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
I'm trying to get my computer closer I

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.869 
I'm trying to get my computer closer I
really<00:02:36.150> just<00:02:36.299> don't<00:02:36.450> want<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.720> fry<00:02:37.019> it<00:02:37.080> so

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
really just don't want to fry it so

00:02:37.879 --> 00:03:00.690 
really just don't want to fry it so
we'll<00:02:38.879> see<00:02:39.000> how<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.209> goes<00:02:39.299> real<00:02:39.569> quick

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.720 

I<00:03:01.650> just<00:03:02.650> wanted<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:02.920> get<00:03:03.010> one<00:03:03.190> more<00:03:03.310> shot<00:03:03.520> of

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
I just wanted to get one more shot of

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.369 
I just wanted to get one more shot of
this<00:03:03.790> running<00:03:04.239> try<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:04.989> move<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.260> computer

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
this running try to move the computer

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.410 
this running try to move the computer
closer<00:03:05.890> I<00:03:06.280> really<00:03:06.760> just<00:03:06.910> don't<00:03:07.030> want<00:03:07.209> to<00:03:07.239> get

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
closer I really just don't want to get

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.869 
closer I really just don't want to get
the<00:03:07.569> computer<00:03:07.900> parts<00:03:08.319> too<00:03:08.530> hot<00:03:08.769> I<00:03:09.010> mean<00:03:09.220> this

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
the computer parts too hot I mean this

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:29.590 
the computer parts too hot I mean this
gets<00:03:10.150> really<00:03:10.420> really<00:03:10.750> hot

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.760 

okay<00:03:30.600> i'm<00:03:30.750> trying<00:03:30.960> to<00:03:31.050> get<00:03:31.110> one<00:03:31.260> more<00:03:31.380> final

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
okay i'm trying to get one more final

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.250 
okay i'm trying to get one more final
shot<00:03:31.980> from<00:03:32.250> underside<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.180> see<00:03:33.390> what<00:03:34.170> the

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
shot from underside to see what the

00:03:34.260 --> 00:04:02.100 
shot from underside to see what the
flame<00:03:34.500> looks<00:03:34.650> like<00:03:34.890> from<00:03:35.100> there

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.149 

okay<00:04:03.110> so<00:04:03.170> now<00:04:03.500> we're<00:04:03.650> going<00:04:03.769> to<00:04:03.829> talk<00:04:04.010> about

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 
okay so now we're going to talk about

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.250 
okay so now we're going to talk about
how<00:04:04.400> physics<00:04:04.879> comes<00:04:05.090> into<00:04:05.299> all<00:04:05.569> of<00:04:05.599> this<00:04:05.930> and

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
how physics comes into all of this and

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.339 
how physics comes into all of this and
how<00:04:06.890> engines<00:04:07.340> like<00:04:07.549> these<00:04:07.900> create<00:04:08.900> so<00:04:09.170> much

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
how engines like these create so much

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.280 
how engines like these create so much
power<00:04:09.650> on<00:04:10.120> these<00:04:11.120> engines<00:04:11.510> basically<00:04:12.049> work

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
power on these engines basically work

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.289 
power on these engines basically work
off<00:04:12.530> of<00:04:12.560> Newton's<00:04:13.099> third<00:04:13.340> law<00:04:13.370> which<00:04:14.150> states

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
off of Newton's third law which states

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.090 
off of Newton's third law which states
that<00:04:14.599> for<00:04:14.930> every<00:04:14.989> action<00:04:15.379> there's<00:04:15.829> an<00:04:16.009> equal

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
that for every action there's an equal

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.120 
that for every action there's an equal
and<00:04:16.310> opposite<00:04:16.699> reaction<00:04:17.079> um<00:04:18.079> the<00:04:18.709> action<00:04:19.100> that

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
and opposite reaction um the action that

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.300 
and opposite reaction um the action that
occurs<00:04:19.579> is<00:04:19.910> that<00:04:20.150> air<00:04:21.049> is<00:04:21.380> sucked<00:04:21.709> through<00:04:22.100> the

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
occurs is that air is sucked through the

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.790 
occurs is that air is sucked through the
inlet<00:04:22.639> turbine<00:04:23.180> and<00:04:23.479> is<00:04:23.630> therefore<00:04:23.870> forced

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
inlet turbine and is therefore forced

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.490 
inlet turbine and is therefore forced
through<00:04:25.400> the<00:04:25.699> cool<00:04:26.120> air<00:04:26.270> intake<00:04:26.780> and<00:04:27.050> into<00:04:27.350> the

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
through the cool air intake and into the

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.590 
through the cool air intake and into the
combustion<00:04:28.039> chamber<00:04:28.220> which<00:04:28.880> then

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
combustion chamber which then

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.740 
combustion chamber which then
pressurizes<00:04:30.500> the<00:04:30.530> combustion<00:04:31.009> chamber<00:04:31.750> also

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
pressurizes the combustion chamber also

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.290 
pressurizes the combustion chamber also
at<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:32.990> same<00:04:33.020> time<00:04:33.530> fuel<00:04:34.310> is<00:04:34.520> injected<00:04:34.699> in<00:04:35.210> the

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
at the same time fuel is injected in the

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.510 
at the same time fuel is injected in the
combustion<00:04:35.660> chamber<00:04:35.810> and<00:04:36.500> is<00:04:36.650> ignited<00:04:37.250> which

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
combustion chamber and is ignited which

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.879 
combustion chamber and is ignited which
creates<00:04:38.030> even<00:04:38.690> more<00:04:38.720> pressure<00:04:39.440> from<00:04:39.740> the

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
creates even more pressure from the

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.310 
creates even more pressure from the
expanding<00:04:40.370> gas<00:04:40.580> and<00:04:40.970> all<00:04:41.630> this<00:04:41.840> pressure

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
expanding gas and all this pressure

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.219 
expanding gas and all this pressure
forces<00:04:43.010> the<00:04:43.310> exhaust<00:04:43.850> turbines<00:04:44.389> to<00:04:44.539> spin<00:04:44.930> and

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
forces the exhaust turbines to spin and

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.590 
forces the exhaust turbines to spin and
therefore<00:04:46.010> creates<00:04:46.400> thrust<00:04:46.850> which<00:04:47.210> is<00:04:47.240> the

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
therefore creates thrust which is the

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.219 
therefore creates thrust which is the
reaction<00:04:48.020> of<00:04:48.530> the<00:04:49.370> engine<00:04:49.789> and<00:04:50.030> is<00:04:50.510> used<00:04:50.900> to

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
reaction of the engine and is used to

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.800 
reaction of the engine and is used to
propel<00:04:51.830> things<00:04:52.160> such<00:04:52.520> as<00:04:52.550> airplanes<00:04:53.539> through

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
propel things such as airplanes through

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.110 
propel things such as airplanes through
the<00:04:53.930> air
