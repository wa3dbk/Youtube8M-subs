00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
here as you can see and it just wasn't

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.409 
here as you can see and it just wasn't
getting<00:06:25.949> it<00:06:26.099> wasn't<00:06:26.430> enough<00:06:26.729> you<00:06:26.969> know<00:06:27.150> the

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 
getting it wasn't enough you know the

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:29.029 
getting it wasn't enough you know the
claw<00:06:27.659> yeah<00:06:28.050> went<00:06:28.319> all<00:06:28.409> the<00:06:28.440> way<00:06:28.530> around<00:06:28.620> it<00:06:28.919> but

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 
claw yeah went all the way around it but

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:30.800 
claw yeah went all the way around it but
it<00:06:29.130> just<00:06:29.310> it<00:06:29.490> just<00:06:29.729> wasn't<00:06:30.060> enough<00:06:30.360> it<00:06:30.539> was<00:06:30.630> too

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
it just it just wasn't enough it was too

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.589 
it just it just wasn't enough it was too
big<00:06:31.020> here<00:06:31.289> so<00:06:31.529> I<00:06:31.770> think<00:06:32.190> I<00:06:32.580> if<00:06:33.270> I<00:06:33.419> recall

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 
big here so I think I if I recall

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:36.469 
big here so I think I if I recall
correctly<00:06:34.020> I<00:06:34.650> went<00:06:35.639> for<00:06:35.789> the<00:06:35.880> smaller<00:06:36.180> part

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 
correctly I went for the smaller part

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:38.540 
correctly I went for the smaller part
here<00:06:36.659> and<00:06:36.779> it<00:06:36.840> lifted<00:06:37.229> it<00:06:37.409> up<00:06:37.529> and<00:06:37.860> and<00:06:37.979> it

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
here and it lifted it up and and it

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.339 
here and it lifted it up and and it
tumbled<00:06:38.969> actually<00:06:39.330> in<00:06:39.449> that<00:06:39.690> way<00:06:39.900> and<00:06:40.169> that

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:40.349 
tumbled actually in that way and that

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:42.320 
tumbled actually in that way and that
that's<00:06:40.590> how<00:06:40.740> I<00:06:40.770> sort<00:06:41.130> of<00:06:41.250> like<00:06:41.430> had<00:06:42.000> to<00:06:42.150> wedge

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
that's how I sort of like had to wedge

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.730 
that's how I sort of like had to wedge
it<00:06:42.509> out<00:06:42.630> of<00:06:42.750> there<00:06:42.930> watch<00:06:43.349> I'm<00:06:43.529> probably

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
it out of there watch I'm probably

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.559 
it out of there watch I'm probably
totally<00:06:44.250> wrong<00:06:44.460> and<00:06:44.490> I<00:06:44.699> probably<00:06:45.210> did<00:06:45.479> the

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:45.569 
totally wrong and I probably did the

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:47.420 
totally wrong and I probably did the
exact<00:06:45.960> complete<00:06:46.440> opposite<00:06:46.919> of<00:06:46.979> what<00:06:47.039> actually

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
exact complete opposite of what actually

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.879 
exact complete opposite of what actually
happened<00:06:47.759> in<00:06:47.849> the<00:06:47.909> video<00:06:48.229> also<00:06:49.229> guys<00:06:49.590> check
