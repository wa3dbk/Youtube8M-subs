00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
if that decided so I would usually go to

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.450 
if that decided so I would usually go to
the<00:00:33.480> playbook<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.260> I'll<00:00:34.559> do<00:00:34.800> something<00:00:35.190> what

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
the playbook and I'll do something what

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.119 
the playbook and I'll do something what
I<00:00:35.489> call<00:00:35.730> remove<00:00:36.120> playbook<00:00:36.870> clutter<00:00:37.140> because

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
I call remove playbook clutter because

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.680 
I call remove playbook clutter because
if<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.430> take<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.579> look<00:00:38.700> at<00:00:38.820> drag<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.210> here<00:00:39.450> he's

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
if you take a look at drag it here he's

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.420 
if you take a look at drag it here he's
got<00:00:39.930> free<00:00:40.170> point<00:00:40.379> play<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.800> mid-range<00:00:41.100> place

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
got free point play and mid-range place

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.729 
got free point play and mid-range place
this<00:00:41.730> causes<00:00:42.180> his<00:00:42.300> playbook<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.899> be<00:00:43.050> very<00:00:43.440> very

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
this causes his playbook to be very very

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.709 
this causes his playbook to be very very
cluttered<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:44.489> like<00:00:44.640> five<00:00:44.910> pages<00:00:45.180> here<00:00:45.539> this

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
cluttered it's like five pages here this

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.110 
cluttered it's like five pages here this
is<00:00:45.809> an<00:00:45.930> allow<00:00:46.200> easy<00:00:46.440> access<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:47.489> what<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.670> do<00:00:47.820> is

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
is an allow easy access so what I do is

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.790 
is an allow easy access so what I do is
I'll<00:00:48.329> remove<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.930> free<00:00:49.079> point<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.440> place<00:00:49.590> and

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
I'll remove the free point in place and

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.260 
I'll remove the free point in place and
the<00:00:49.980> mid-range<00:00:50.280> place<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.820> can<00:00:50.940> see<00:00:51.090> now

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
the mid-range place and you can see now

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.880 
the mid-range place and you can see now
he<00:00:51.329> only<00:00:51.629> has<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.079> pick<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.350> all<00:00:52.530> had<00:00:52.649> another

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
he only has to pick it all had another

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.950 
he only has to pick it all had another
place<00:00:53.070> playbook<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.030> way<00:00:54.180> smaller<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.750> did

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
place playbook it's way smaller I did

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.900 
place playbook it's way smaller I did
the<00:00:55.020> same<00:00:55.140> thing<00:00:55.199> weight<00:00:55.770> or<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.640> there's

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
the same thing weight or this there's

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.790 
the same thing weight or this there's
less<00:00:57.120> pages<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.690> there's<00:00:57.870> quicker<00:00:58.140> access<00:00:58.410> or

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
less pages so there's quicker access or

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.060 
less pages so there's quicker access or
you<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:59.010> rotate<00:00:59.190> through<00:00:59.550> place<00:00:59.820> faster<00:01:01.070> now

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
you can rotate through place faster now

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.049 
you can rotate through place faster now
you<00:01:02.129> also<00:01:02.340> want<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.609> make<00:01:02.730> sure<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
you also want to make sure in the

earlier I didn't know any of these place

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.410 
earlier I didn't know any of these place
so<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:02.070> had<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.430> go<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.610> my<00:02:02.790> freelance<00:02:03.210> as<00:02:03.390> a

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
so I had to go to my freelance as a

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.840 
so I had to go to my freelance as a
plan-b<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.950> was<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:05.369> possession

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
plan-b and it was in this possession

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.389 
plan-b and it was in this possession
then<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.659> realized<00:02:07.200> going<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.710> freelance<00:02:08.220> in

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
then I realized going to freelance in

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.070 
then I realized going to freelance in
this<00:02:08.550> game<00:02:08.759> will<00:02:08.970> probably<00:02:09.060> yield<00:02:09.629> me<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> lot

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
this game will probably yield me a lot

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.199 
this game will probably yield me a lot
of<00:02:10.229> points<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.739> don't<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.280> pick<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.790> can<00:02:12.030> trade

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.850 
here with Bosh there was a hard hair so
I

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
I

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.490 
I
away<00:02:14.280> from<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.820> right<00:02:15.390> now<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.630> realized<00:02:16.230> he

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
away from it and right now I realized he

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.440 
away from it and right now I realized he
probably<00:02:16.740> either<00:02:17.160> has<00:02:17.400> no<00:02:17.430> settings<00:02:18.240> on<00:02:18.420> a

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
probably either has no settings on a

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.420 
probably either has no settings on a
really<00:02:18.840> weak<00:02:19.110> ones<00:02:19.380> because<00:02:19.680> train<00:02:19.980> way<00:02:20.190> was

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
really weak ones because train way was

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.880 
really weak ones because train way was
triple<00:02:20.910> team<00:02:21.090> for<00:02:21.300> no<00:02:21.480> reason<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.050> left<00:02:22.650> posh

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
triple team for no reason and left posh

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.010 
triple team for no reason and left posh
wide<00:02:23.190> open<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:23.880> mid-range<00:02:24.210> area<00:02:24.630> his<00:02:24.780> best

wide open in a mid-range area his best

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.470 
wide open in a mid-range area his best

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
shot so if you see this you realize

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.480 
shot so if you see this you realize
someone<00:02:28.020> has<00:02:28.140> no<00:02:28.500> settings<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:29.010> really<00:02:29.250> weak

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
that means no settings high picking

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
Turkish and drain way clearly did what

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.409
