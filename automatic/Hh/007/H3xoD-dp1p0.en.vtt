00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.310 
I've seen many tutorials on YouTube
about<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.640> book<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.300> be<00:00:27.420> honest<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.990> didn't

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
about this book to be honest I didn't

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.170 
about this book to be honest I didn't
think<00:00:28.470> they<00:00:28.710> where<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.430> the<00:00:29.520> potential<00:00:30.029> where

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
think they where to the potential where

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.390 
think they where to the potential where
you<00:00:30.300> understood<00:00:30.810> how<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.350> villages<00:00:31.859> work<00:00:32.070> and

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
you understood how the villages work and

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.130 
you understood how the villages work and
how<00:00:32.519> breathing<00:00:33.059> work<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.510> thought<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.870> would

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
how breathing work so I thought I would

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.290 
how breathing work so I thought I would
do<00:00:34.320> myself<00:00:34.590> now<00:00:35.070> I'm<00:00:35.670> going<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.970> start<00:00:36.180> off<00:00:36.269> by

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
do myself now I'm going to start off by

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.240 
do myself now I'm going to start off by
saying<00:00:36.720> that<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.199> number<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.530> villages<00:00:37.769> are

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
saying that the number of villages are

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.369 
saying that the number of villages are
determined<00:00:38.879> by<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.180> amount<00:00:39.659> of<00:00:39.839> all<00:00:40.019> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
determined by the amount of all the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.229 
determined by the amount of all the
buildings<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.309> world<00:00:41.519> so<00:00:41.699> you<00:00:41.790> can<00:00:41.850> see<00:00:42.150> we

according<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.979> code<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.460> Minecraft<00:00:51.089> each

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
according to the code of Minecraft each

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.960 
according to the code of Minecraft each
villager<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.290> supposed<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.799> have<00:00:53.070> three

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
villager is supposed to have three

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.450 
villager is supposed to have three
houses<00:00:54.210> or<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> matter<00:00:55.019> of<00:00:55.140> fact<00:00:55.409> three<00:00:55.920> dots<00:00:56.250> I

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
houses or a matter of fact three dots I

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.009 
houses or a matter of fact three dots I
don't<00:00:56.699> even<00:00:56.790> have<00:00:56.909> three<00:00:57.210> houses<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.809> that's

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
don't even have three houses so that's

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.079 
don't even have three houses so that's
pretty<00:00:58.260> crazy<00:00:58.559> how<00:00:59.250> they've<00:00:59.489> worked<00:00:59.729> that<00:01:00.059> out

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
pretty crazy how they've worked that out

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.689 
pretty crazy how they've worked that out
now<00:01:00.449> if<00:01:00.900> you<00:01:01.110> kill<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> villager<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.309> will<00:01:02.489> take

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
now if you kill a villager it will take

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.700 
now if you kill a villager it will take
a<00:01:02.879> little<00:01:02.970> bit<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.269> time<00:01:03.449> for<00:01:03.479> them<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.470> make

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
a little bit of time for them to make

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.899 
a little bit of time for them to make
now<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> matter<00:01:05.190> of<00:01:05.280> fact<00:01:05.489> they<00:01:05.640> won't

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
now a matter of fact they won't

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.149 
now a matter of fact they won't
necessarily<00:01:06.450> make<00:01:06.990> because<00:01:07.560> if<00:01:07.680> there's<00:01:07.860> not

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
necessarily make because if there's not

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.060 
necessarily make because if there's not
enough<00:01:08.220> houses<00:01:09.000> according<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:10.079> the<00:01:10.200> code<00:01:10.439> for

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
enough houses according to the code for

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.670 
enough houses according to the code for
villages<00:01:11.609> to<00:01:11.969> live<00:01:12.240> then<00:01:12.570> they<00:01:12.750> won't<00:01:13.020> spawn

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
villages to live then they won't spawn

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.889 
villages to live then they won't spawn
now<00:01:14.310> there's<00:01:14.640> many<00:01:14.759> tutorials<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:15.539> YouTube

bikes or villages now that isn't true
but<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.539> can<00:01:22.049> breed<00:01:22.439> if<00:01:22.469> you<00:01:22.740> place<00:01:22.950> them<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
but you can breed if you place them in a

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.010 
but you can breed if you place them in a
small<00:01:23.609> area<00:01:23.880> such<00:01:24.270> as<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.719> so<00:01:24.869> I'm<00:01:24.960> just

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
small area such as this so I'm just

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.499 
small area such as this so I'm just
going<00:01:25.289> to<00:01:25.380> show<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.590> how<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.340> works<00:01:26.609> now<00:01:26.880> main

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
going to show you how it works now main

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.419 
going to show you how it works now main
thing<00:01:27.840> about<00:01:28.049> villages<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.100> they're<00:01:29.280> all

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:29.429 
thing about villages is they're all

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:31.639 
thing about villages is they're all
determined<00:01:30.060> by<00:01:30.240> door<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:30.929> if<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.109> have<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.439> lot

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
determined by door so if you have a lot

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.980 
determined by door so if you have a lot
of<00:01:31.679> doors<00:01:32.039> in<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.399> villages<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> village

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
of doors in a villages in the village

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.029 
of doors in a villages in the village
then<00:01:34.200> you're<00:01:34.350> going<00:01:34.469> to<00:01:34.530> notice<00:01:34.649> more

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
then you're going to notice more

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.609 
then you're going to notice more
villages<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.880> around<00:01:36.149> the<00:01:36.810> location<00:01:37.469> so

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
villages in and around the location so

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.260 
villages in and around the location so
let<00:01:37.770> me<00:01:37.829> just<00:01:37.979> spawn<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> few<00:01:38.640> things<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.119> here

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
let me just spawn a few things in here

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.569 
let me just spawn a few things in here
so<00:01:39.479> if<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.960> spawn<00:01:40.350> around<00:01:40.469> about<00:01:40.799> four<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.399> they

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
so if I spawn around about four and they

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.789 
so if I spawn around about four and they
might<00:01:41.820> not<00:01:41.969> breed<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.479> all<00:01:42.749> determined<00:01:43.469> by

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
might not breed it's all determined by

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.770 
might not breed it's all determined by
look<00:01:44.249> should<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.609> say<00:01:44.850> or<00:01:44.880> all<00:01:45.240> determined<00:01:45.749> by

would<00:03:55.520> decide<00:03:55.760> to<00:03:56.000> make<00:03:56.209> up<00:03:56.330> depending<00:03:56.750> on<00:03:56.870> how

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
would decide to make up depending on how

many<00:03:57.200> doors<00:03:57.500> depending<00:03:58.430> on<00:03:58.580> how<00:03:58.760> many

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
many doors depending on how many

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.330 
many doors depending on how many
buildings<00:03:59.450> are<00:03:59.720> around<00:04:00.080> so<00:04:00.290> what<00:04:00.860> I<00:04:00.890> did<00:04:01.130> there

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
buildings are around so what I did there

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.240 
buildings are around so what I did there
that<00:04:01.370> is<00:04:01.700> classed<00:04:02.060> as<00:04:02.239> a<00:04:02.360> house<00:04:02.720> on<00:04:03.250> minecraft

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
that is classed as a house on minecraft

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.280 
that is classed as a house on minecraft
so<00:04:04.550> if<00:04:04.940> you<00:04:05.090> wanted<00:04:05.450> to<00:04:05.570> make<00:04:05.750> as<00:04:05.900> many<00:04:06.080> as

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
so if you wanted to make as many as

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.140 
so if you wanted to make as many as
possible<00:04:06.739> then<00:04:06.890> you<00:04:06.920> could<00:04:07.280> this<00:04:07.550> increases

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
possible then you could this increases

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.330 
possible then you could this increases
the<00:04:08.300> chance<00:04:08.600> of<00:04:08.870> your<00:04:09.380> villages<00:04:09.830> inbreeding

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
the chance of your villages inbreeding

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.160 
the chance of your villages inbreeding
which<00:04:10.730> I<00:04:10.850> thought<00:04:11.090> was<00:04:11.239> a<00:04:11.300> great<00:04:11.570> addition<00:04:11.840> now

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
which I thought was a great addition now

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.020 
which I thought was a great addition now
