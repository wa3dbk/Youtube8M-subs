the reason why this water can be used
this<00:06:42.560> way<00:06:42.620> is<00:06:43.130> because<00:06:44.120> the<00:06:44.420> pH<00:06:44.930> value<00:06:44.960> of<00:06:45.590> the

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
this way is because the pH value of the

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.990 
this way is because the pH value of the
water<00:06:46.100> is<00:06:46.430> 2<00:06:47.420> point<00:06:47.810> 4<00:06:48.110> or<00:06:48.380> less<00:06:48.730> which<00:06:49.730> can
