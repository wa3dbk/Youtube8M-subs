00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
long-range combat it does the job

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.550 
long-range combat it does the job
decently<00:00:17.970> well<00:00:18.240> but<00:00:18.840> for<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.050> most<00:00:19.230> part

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
decently well but for the most part

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.990 
decently well but for the most part
there<00:00:19.980> isn't<00:00:20.340> much<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.640> difference<00:00:20.910> between

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
there isn't much of a difference between

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.529 
there isn't much of a difference between
this<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.410> other<00:00:22.560> RP<00:00:23.039> k12<00:00:23.640> those<00:00:24.269> two

this and the other RP k12 those two

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.630 
this and the other RP k12 those two
comes<00:00:24.869> our<00:00:25.109> practically<00:00:25.650> identical<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.460> for

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
comes our practically identical and for

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.720 
comes our practically identical and for
the<00:00:26.699> most<00:00:26.849> part<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.539> 74m<00:00:28.230> version<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:29.039> worse

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
the most part the 74m version is worse

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.700 
the most part the 74m version is worse
across<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.269> board<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.689> has<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.869> longer<00:00:31.349> reload

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
across the board it has a longer reload

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.229 
across the board it has a longer reload
time<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.250> has<00:00:32.399> less<00:00:32.640> rounds<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.149> its

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
time and it has less rounds in its

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.090 
time and it has less rounds in its
magazine<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:34.170> does<00:00:34.380> have<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.649> benefit<00:00:34.980> that

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
magazine it does have the benefit that

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.970 
magazine it does have the benefit that
it<00:00:35.190> has<00:00:35.340> slightly<00:00:36.030> less<00:00:36.390> recoil<00:00:37.079> but<00:00:37.829> these

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
it has slightly less recoil but these

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.500 
it has slightly less recoil but these
guns<00:00:38.250> are<00:00:38.460> already<00:00:38.610> laser<00:00:39.059> beam<00:00:39.300> like

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
guns are already laser beam like

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.990 
guns are already laser beam like
accurate<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.739> dice<00:00:41.040> decided<00:00:41.610> hey<00:00:41.969> you

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
accurate and so dice decided hey you

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.180 
accurate and so dice decided hey you
know<00:00:42.210> what<00:00:42.480> maybe<00:00:42.960> we<00:00:43.500> shouldn't<00:00:43.829> have<00:00:43.980> two

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
know what maybe we shouldn't have two

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.279 
know what maybe we shouldn't have two
identical<00:00:44.579> weapons<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> game<00:00:45.420> let's<00:00:45.930> mix

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
identical weapons in the game let's mix

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.040 
identical weapons in the game let's mix
things<00:00:46.620> up<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.550> right<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.090> CTE<00:00:48.480> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
things up and so right on the CTE the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.369 
things up and so right on the CTE the
rpk-74<00:00:49.950> em<00:00:50.399> could<00:00:51.030> possibly<00:00:51.570> have<00:00:51.840> now<00:00:51.989> turned

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
rpk-74 em could possibly have now turned

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.740 
rpk-74 em could possibly have now turned
into<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.829> one<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.579> best<00:00:53.969> long-range

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
into you one of the best long-range

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.590 
into you one of the best long-range
weapons<00:00:55.739> before<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.340> support<00:00:56.760> class<00:00:56.910> hands

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
weapons before the support class hands

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.779 
weapons before the support class hands
down<00:00:58.020> what<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.770> really<00:00:58.980> comes<00:00:59.190> down<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.430> is

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
down what it really comes down to is

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.490 
down what it really comes down to is
that<00:00:59.820> they've<00:01:00.120> increased<00:01:00.449> its<00:01:00.809> damage<00:01:01.140> model

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
that they've increased its damage model

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.799 
that they've increased its damage model
across<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.609> board<00:01:02.879> instead<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.359> only<00:01:03.510> doing<00:01:03.719> a

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
across the board instead of only doing a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.960 
across the board instead of only doing a
measly<00:01:04.260> 24<00:01:04.769> damage<00:01:05.010> per<00:01:05.369> bullet<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.760> close

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
measly 24 damage per bullet in close

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.120 
measly 24 damage per bullet in close
encounter<00:01:06.360> combat<00:01:06.780> they<00:01:06.930> bumped<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.290> up<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.470> 30

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
encounter combat they bumped it up to 30

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.210 
encounter combat they bumped it up to 30
that<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.710> significant<00:01:10.710> difference<00:01:10.860> and

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
that is a significant difference and

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.920 
that is a significant difference and
then<00:01:11.460> at<00:01:11.640> long-range<00:01:11.850> combat<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.659> I'm<00:01:12.810> only

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
then at long-range combat is I'm only

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.050 
then at long-range combat is I'm only
doing<00:01:13.229> 18<00:01:13.590> damage<00:01:13.770> per<00:01:14.070> round<00:01:14.100> they<00:01:14.670> bumped<00:01:15.000> it

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
doing 18 damage per round they bumped it

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.570 
doing 18 damage per round they bumped it
up<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.479> 20<00:01:15.960> essentially<00:01:16.920> what<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.130> means<00:01:17.189> on

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580

of<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.470> changes<00:01:46.860> right<00:01:47.009> now<00:01:47.159> on<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.369> CTE<00:01:47.670> for

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
of the changes right now on the CTE for

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.660 
of the changes right now on the CTE for
the<00:01:48.119> RPK<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:48.840> been<00:01:49.020> completely<00:01:49.590> rosy<00:01:50.159> and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
the RPK have been completely rosy and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.950 
the RPK have been completely rosy and
one<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.000> biggest<00:01:51.240> ones<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.780> will

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
one of the biggest ones is that you will

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.620 
one of the biggest ones is that you will
have<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.320> deal<00:01:52.560> with<00:01:52.590> more<00:01:53.159> recoil<00:01:53.700> its<00:01:54.270> first

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
have to deal with more recoil its first

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.749 
have to deal with more recoil its first
shot<00:01:54.899> has<00:01:55.110> been<00:01:55.170> nearly<00:01:55.680> doubled<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.640> was

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
shot has been nearly doubled it was

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.490 
shot has been nearly doubled it was
almost<00:01:56.939> non-existent<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.840> begin<00:01:58.140> with<00:01:58.320> so

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
almost non-existent to begin with so

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.899 
almost non-existent to begin with so
don't<00:01:58.710> worry<00:01:58.799> too<00:01:58.950> much<00:01:59.100> about<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.460> double

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
don't worry too much about that double

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.910 
don't worry too much about that double
number<00:02:00.180> it's<00:02:00.329> still<00:02:00.659> very<00:02:00.869> manageable<00:02:01.290> but

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
number it's still very manageable but

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.230 
number it's still very manageable but
you<00:02:02.040> are<00:02:02.189> gonna<00:02:02.340> have<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.579> deal<00:02:02.790> with<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.030> little

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
you are gonna have to deal with a little

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.959 
you are gonna have to deal with a little
bit<00:02:03.390> more<00:02:03.689> horizontal<00:02:04.590> recoil<00:02:04.799> at<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.759> end<00:02:05.909> of

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
bit more horizontal recoil at the end of

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.089 
bit more horizontal recoil at the end of
the<00:02:06.030> day<00:02:06.149> though<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.840> thing<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.170> still<00:02:07.649> laser

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
the day though this thing is still laser

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.100 
the day though this thing is still laser
beam<00:02:08.429> like<00:02:08.640> accurate<00:02:09.149> hopefully<00:02:09.810> through<00:02:09.989> the

gameplay<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.709> have<00:02:10.830> noticed<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.280> this

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
gameplay you have noticed that this

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.700 
gameplay you have noticed that this
thing<00:02:11.879> is<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.270> has

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
thing is it has

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.930 
thing is it has
no<00:02:12.770> problem<00:02:13.130> taking<00:02:13.430> people<00:02:13.640> out<00:02:13.760> of<00:02:13.880> the

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
no problem taking people out of the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.640 
no problem taking people out of the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
rpk-74 em before the patch and you jump

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.430 
rpk-74 em before the patch and you jump
on<00:02:18.650> over<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.950> CTE<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.970> will<00:02:20.270> notice<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:21.020> pretty

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
on over the CTE you will notice a pretty

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.800 
on over the CTE you will notice a pretty
substantial<00:02:21.710> upgrade<00:02:22.400> in<00:02:22.880> its<00:02:23.330> at<00:02:23.480> least<00:02:23.510> its

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
substantial upgrade in its at least its

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.510 
substantial upgrade in its at least its
first<00:02:24.020> shot<00:02:24.230> recoil<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:24.770> a<00:02:24.890> little<00:02:25.250> bit<00:02:25.370> more

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
first shot recoil and a little bit more

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.100 
first shot recoil and a little bit more
kick<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.030> left<00:02:26.240> in<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.480> right

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
kick to the left in the right

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.810 
kick to the left in the right
another<00:02:27.620> nerf<00:02:27.800> that<00:02:27.950> they've<00:02:28.070> added<00:02:28.220> is<00:02:28.550> that

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
another nerf that they've added is that

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.060 
another nerf that they've added is that
it's<00:02:28.970> magazine<00:02:29.450> size<00:02:29.750> is<00:02:30.020> being<00:02:30.230> dropped<00:02:30.560> from

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
it's magazine size is being dropped from

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.800 
it's magazine size is being dropped from
46<00:02:31.790> rounds<00:02:32.270> down<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:33.230> 41<00:02:34.210> not<00:02:35.210> really<00:02:35.600> whole

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
46 rounds down to 41 not really whole

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.510 
46 rounds down to 41 not really whole
lot<00:02:36.020> of<00:02:36.170> difference<00:02:36.470> here<00:02:36.710> like<00:02:36.980> seriously

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
lot of difference here like seriously

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.250 
lot of difference here like seriously
five<00:02:37.850> rounds<00:02:38.300> isn't<00:02:38.540> gonna<00:02:38.630> be<00:02:38.780> that<00:02:39.020> much<00:02:39.230> of

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
five rounds isn't gonna be that much of

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260 
five rounds isn't gonna be that much of
a<00:02:39.440> difference<00:02:39.590> I<00:02:40.010> mean<00:02:40.280> five<00:02:40.490> rounds<00:02:41.000> could

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
a difference I mean five rounds could

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.390 
a difference I mean five rounds could
kill<00:02:41.720> someone<00:02:42.110> for<00:02:42.290> you<00:02:42.470> like<00:02:42.680> that<00:02:42.830> could<00:02:43.160> in

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
kill someone for you like that could in

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.250 
kill someone for you like that could in
some<00:02:43.730> circumstances<00:02:44.510> being<00:02:44.690> them<00:02:44.810> being<00:02:45.110> the

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
some circumstances being them being the

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.570 
some circumstances being them being the
difference<00:02:45.530> between<00:02:45.680> life<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.160> death

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
difference between life and death

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.700 
difference between life and death
but<00:02:46.850> if<00:02:46.910> you<00:02:47.000> have<00:02:47.120> 41<00:02:47.510> rounds<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.260> work<00:02:48.440> with

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
but if you have 41 rounds to work with

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.230 
but if you have 41 rounds to work with
that's<00:02:49.100> gonna<00:02:49.220> give<00:02:49.400> you<00:02:49.520> plenty<00:02:49.790> of<00:02:49.970> time<00:02:50.210> to

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
that's gonna give you plenty of time to

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.030 
that's gonna give you plenty of time to
hopefully<00:02:50.720> dispatch<00:02:51.080> up<00:02:51.290> your<00:02:51.440> enemy<00:02:51.770> take

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
hopefully dispatch up your enemy take

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.170 
hopefully dispatch up your enemy take
out<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.340> multiple<00:02:52.670> targets<00:02:52.970> that<00:02:53.030> are<00:02:53.090> in

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
out the multiple targets that are in

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.790 
out the multiple targets that are in
front<00:02:53.330> of<00:02:53.450> you<00:02:53.570> and<00:02:53.720> then<00:02:54.080> go<00:02:54.200> behind<00:02:54.350> cover

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
front of you and then go behind cover

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.010 
front of you and then go behind cover
and<00:02:54.920> reload<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:56.180> are<00:02:56.330> still<00:02:56.600> gonna<00:02:56.720> have<00:02:56.900> to

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
and reload you are still gonna have to

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.290 
and reload you are still gonna have to
deal<00:02:57.170> with<00:02:57.440> that<00:02:57.710> very<00:02:57.820> lengthy<00:02:58.820> reload

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
deal with that very lengthy reload

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.750 
deal with that very lengthy reload
animation<00:03:00.170> if<00:03:00.560> you're<00:03:00.740> not<00:03:00.920> aware<00:03:01.100> for<00:03:01.550> some

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060

especially<00:03:17.780> for<00:03:17.960> something<00:03:18.110> that<00:03:18.350> is<00:03:18.440> not

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
especially for something that is not

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.500 
especially for something that is not
belt-fed<00:03:18.920> like<00:03:19.550> this<00:03:19.760> is<00:03:19.910> not<00:03:20.060> a<00:03:20.090> belt-fed

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
belt-fed like this is not a belt-fed

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.660 
belt-fed like this is not a belt-fed
LMGs<00:03:22.570> is<00:03:23.570> just<00:03:23.750> your<00:03:23.900> standard<00:03:24.080> magazine<00:03:24.740> that

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
LMGs is just your standard magazine that

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.340 
LMGs is just your standard magazine that
is<00:03:25.880> a<00:03:25.910> long<00:03:26.210> time<00:03:26.510> to<00:03:26.630> go<00:03:26.720> through<00:03:26.930> that<00:03:27.020> reload

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
is a long time to go through that reload

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.900 
is a long time to go through that reload
animation<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.070> so<00:03:28.400> that<00:03:28.550> is<00:03:28.670> still<00:03:28.880> a

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
animation and so that is still a

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.420 
animation and so that is still a
drawback<00:03:29.450> of<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.870> rpk-74<00:03:30.770> m<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:31.370> is

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
drawback of the rpk-74 m and is

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.070 
drawback of the rpk-74 m and is
something<00:03:31.940> that<00:03:32.060> you're<00:03:32.210> gonna<00:03:32.330> have<00:03:32.510> to<00:03:32.630> work

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
something that you're gonna have to work

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.380 
something that you're gonna have to work
around<00:03:33.290> but<00:03:34.040> I<00:03:34.070> don't<00:03:34.190> think<00:03:34.760> that<00:03:34.970> dropping

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
around but I don't think that dropping

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.910 
around but I don't think that dropping
that<00:03:35.480> 5<00:03:35.720> rounds<00:03:36.200> is<00:03:36.290> going<00:03:36.410> to<00:03:36.500> be<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.710> death

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
that 5 rounds is going to be the death

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.250 
that 5 rounds is going to be the death
sentence<00:03:37.370> of<00:03:37.520> this<00:03:37.820> gun<00:03:38.120> now<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:38.930> real

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
sentence of this gun now the real

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.830 
sentence of this gun now the real
question<00:03:39.290> is<00:03:39.860> do<00:03:40.430> all<00:03:40.610> these<00:03:40.850> changes<00:03:41.120> all<00:03:41.690> of

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
question is do all these changes all of

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.840 
question is do all these changes all of
a<00:03:41.900> sudden<00:03:42.200> to<00:03:42.320> make<00:03:42.470> this<00:03:42.620> not<00:03:42.860> only<00:03:42.890> a<00:03:43.310> more

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
a sudden to make this not only a more

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.180 
a sudden to make this not only a more
viable<00:03:44.210> weapon<00:03:44.510> to<00:03:44.720> use<00:03:44.810> on<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.020> battlefield

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
viable weapon to use on the battlefield

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.130 
viable weapon to use on the battlefield
but<00:03:46.190> a<00:03:46.250> more<00:03:46.460> interesting<00:03:46.760> one<00:03:47.150> this<00:03:47.810> is<00:03:47.990> what

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
but a more interesting one this is what

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.810 
but a more interesting one this is what
dice<00:03:48.320> was<00:03:48.530> going<00:03:48.830> for<00:03:48.980> they<00:03:49.190> wanted<00:03:49.580> to<00:03:49.670> make

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
dice was going for they wanted to make

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.670 
dice was going for they wanted to make
it<00:03:49.850> feel<00:03:50.240> different<00:03:50.570> compared<00:03:51.140> to<00:03:51.230> its<00:03:51.350> RP

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
it feel different compared to its RP

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.040 
it feel different compared to its RP
cage<00:03:51.890> counterpart<00:03:52.640> and<00:03:52.790> I<00:03:53.210> would<00:03:53.450> say<00:03:53.660> that

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
cage counterpart and I would say that

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
cage counterpart and I would say that
they<00:03:54.260> nailed<00:03:54.590> it

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
they nailed it

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.190 
they nailed it
it<00:03:55.400> really<00:03:55.700> just<00:03:55.910> comes<00:03:56.060> down<00:03:56.240> to<00:03:56.390> that<00:03:56.780> damage

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
it really just comes down to that damage

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.900 
it really just comes down to that damage
and<00:03:57.380> that<00:03:57.770> increase<00:03:58.130> in<00:03:58.250> its<00:03:58.370> recoil<00:03:58.670> and<00:03:58.820> they

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
and that increase in its recoil and they

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.580 
and that increase in its recoil and they
also<00:03:59.030> increase<00:03:59.480> its<00:03:59.750> bullet<00:04:00.020> spread<00:04:00.260> a<00:04:00.350> little

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
also increase its bullet spread a little

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.900 
also increase its bullet spread a little
bit<00:04:00.710> I<00:04:00.800> should<00:04:01.070> have<00:04:01.160> mentioned<00:04:01.310> that<00:04:01.580> and

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
bit I should have mentioned that and

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.060 
bit I should have mentioned that and
right<00:04:02.420> now<00:04:02.600> when<00:04:02.810> you<00:04:02.900> switch<00:04:03.110> on<00:04:03.200> over<00:04:03.440> to<00:04:03.650> the

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
right now when you switch on over to the

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.790 
right now when you switch on over to the
RPK<00:04:04.460> 12<00:04:04.940> it<00:04:05.240> doesn't<00:04:05.750> feel<00:04:05.870> like<00:04:05.990> the<00:04:06.140> 74m

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
RPK 12 it doesn't feel like the 74m

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.220 
RPK 12 it doesn't feel like the 74m
whatsoever<00:04:07.700> they're<00:04:08.210> still<00:04:08.450> very<00:04:08.660> accurate

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
whatsoever they're still very accurate

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.220 
whatsoever they're still very accurate
but<00:04:09.410> that<00:04:09.590> damage<00:04:10.040> increase<00:04:10.580> really<00:04:11.390> does<00:04:11.690> set

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
but that damage increase really does set

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.350 
but that damage increase really does set
the<00:04:12.410> weapons<00:04:12.740> apart<00:04:13.100> some<00:04:14.000> of<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:14.180> might<00:04:14.330> be

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
the weapons apart some of you might be

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.970 
the weapons apart some of you might be
thinking<00:04:14.450> now<00:04:14.840> well<00:04:15.230> why<00:04:15.500> would<00:04:15.710> I<00:04:15.740> ever<00:04:15.800> want

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
thinking now well why would I ever want

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.220 
thinking now well why would I ever want
to<00:04:16.190> use<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:16.670> RPK<00:04:17.030> 12<00:04:17.480> now<00:04:17.720> if<00:04:17.960> they<00:04:18.170> were

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
to use the RPK 12 now if they were

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.650 
to use the RPK 12 now if they were
pretty<00:04:18.680> much<00:04:18.859> identical<00:04:19.190> to<00:04:19.310> pass<00:04:19.580> the<00:04:20.000> 74<00:04:20.420> mm

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
pretty much identical to pass the 74 mm

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.960 
pretty much identical to pass the 74 mm
got<00:04:20.900> a<00:04:20.930> huge<00:04:21.320> upgrade<00:04:21.620> or<00:04:22.010> it's<00:04:22.160> now<00:04:22.340> seeing<00:04:22.850> a

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
got a huge upgrade or it's now seeing a

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.180 
got a huge upgrade or it's now seeing a
lot<00:04:23.150> of<00:04:23.180> significant<00:04:23.750> changes<00:04:24.230> why<00:04:24.860> would<00:04:25.160> I

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
lot of significant changes why would I

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.900 
lot of significant changes why would I
ever<00:04:25.280> want<00:04:25.610> to<00:04:25.640> go

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
ever want to go

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.150 
ever want to go
I can<00:04:26.120> use<00:04:26.330> this<00:04:26.540> gun<00:04:26.810> well<00:04:27.440> it<00:04:27.530> still<00:04:27.770> has<00:04:28.010> the

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
I can use this gun well it still has the

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.130 
I can use this gun well it still has the
amazing<00:04:28.310> fact<00:04:28.700> that's<00:04:28.880> got<00:04:29.030> 60<00:04:29.480> rounds<00:04:29.720> in<00:04:30.020> its

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
amazing fact that's got 60 rounds in its

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.020 
amazing fact that's got 60 rounds in its
magazine<00:04:30.350> but<00:04:31.100> what<00:04:31.250> they've<00:04:31.370> also<00:04:31.520> done<00:04:31.880> to

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
magazine but what they've also done to

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.150 
magazine but what they've also done to
it<00:04:32.150> is<00:04:32.300> that<00:04:32.600> they've<00:04:33.020> made<00:04:33.320> it<00:04:33.470> even<00:04:33.680> more

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
it is that they've made it even more

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.040 
it is that they've made it even more
accurate<00:04:34.400> than<00:04:34.730> it<00:04:34.880> was<00:04:35.060> not<00:04:35.690> only<00:04:35.900> are<00:04:35.960> gonna

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
accurate than it was not only are gonna

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.200 
accurate than it was not only are gonna
have<00:04:36.260> to<00:04:36.350> deal<00:04:36.500> with<00:04:36.560> less<00:04:37.160> recoil<00:04:37.460> but<00:04:38.120> they

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
have to deal with less recoil but they

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.730 
have to deal with less recoil but they
have<00:04:38.330> reduced<00:04:38.660> its<00:04:38.930> bullet<00:04:39.200> spread<00:04:39.350> as<00:04:39.560> well

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
have reduced its bullet spread as well

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.530 
have reduced its bullet spread as well
this<00:04:40.220> thing<00:04:40.520> is<00:04:40.700> going<00:04:40.910> to<00:04:41.000> be<00:04:41.120> this<00:04:41.270> sniper

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
this thing is going to be this sniper

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.200 
this thing is going to be this sniper
weapon<00:04:42.020> of<00:04:42.200> the<00:04:42.560> support<00:04:43.010> class<00:04:43.250> and<00:04:43.550> so<00:04:44.000> for

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
weapon of the support class and so for

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.180 
weapon of the support class and so for
those<00:04:44.330> really<00:04:44.600> really<00:04:44.870> long-range<00:04:45.530> shots<00:04:45.920> and

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
those really really long-range shots and

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.400 
those really really long-range shots and
for<00:04:46.340> that<00:04:46.460> pin<00:04:46.640> point<00:04:46.850> like<00:04:47.000> accuracy<00:04:47.600> the<00:04:48.050> RPK

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
for that pin point like accuracy the RPK

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.530 
for that pin point like accuracy the RPK
12<00:04:48.830> is<00:04:49.130> going<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.610> be<00:04:49.730> the<00:04:50.000> better<00:04:50.180> of<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.510> two

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
12 is going to be the better of the two

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.180 
12 is going to be the better of the two
but<00:04:51.200> if<00:04:51.290> you're<00:04:51.410> looking<00:04:51.650> for<00:04:51.830> a<00:04:51.860> gun<00:04:52.010> that's

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
but if you're looking for a gun that's

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.340 
but if you're looking for a gun that's
gonna<00:04:52.280> be<00:04:52.430> more<00:04:52.610> more<00:04:53.180> viable<00:04:53.480> in<00:04:53.840> not<00:04:54.080> only

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
gonna be more more viable in not only

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.290

alive and kicking you you could lose a
firefight<00:05:26.450> after<00:05:27.110> putting<00:05:27.320> those<00:05:27.470> two<00:05:27.680> rounds

directly<00:05:28.550> into<00:05:28.670> his<00:05:28.760> face<00:05:29.060> simply<00:05:29.750> because<00:05:30.050> it

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
directly into his face simply because it

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.590 
directly into his face simply because it
didn't<00:05:30.560> do<00:05:30.650> enough<00:05:30.770> damage<00:05:30.920> it<00:05:31.640> seems<00:05:32.180> like

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
didn't do enough damage it seems like

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.840 
didn't do enough damage it seems like
dice<00:05:32.990> also<00:05:33.590> thought<00:05:33.860> this<00:05:34.040> is<00:05:34.160> a<00:05:34.190> little<00:05:34.460> weird

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
dice also thought this is a little weird

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.490 
dice also thought this is a little weird
and<00:05:34.970> so<00:05:35.330> they<00:05:35.450> bumped<00:05:35.810> up<00:05:35.960> that<00:05:36.260> headshot

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
and so they bumped up that headshot

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.800 
and so they bumped up that headshot
multiplier<00:05:36.890> for<00:05:37.700> pretty<00:05:38.000> much<00:05:38.090> every<00:05:38.600> single

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
multiplier for pretty much every single

these changes if you already get

these changes if you already get
headshots<00:05:46.010> back-to-back<00:05:46.610> well<00:05:46.940> this<00:05:47.210> makes

headshots back-to-back well this makes

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
gonna do more damage with this headshot

multiplier<00:05:50.919> what<00:05:51.919> it<00:05:52.010> also<00:05:52.160> means<00:05:52.340> though<00:05:52.730> is

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
multiplier what it also means though is

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.970 
multiplier what it also means though is
that<00:05:53.090> weapons<00:05:53.450> like<00:05:53.810> the<00:05:53.960> RPK<00:05:54.380> or<00:05:54.740> anything

that has very little recoil and bullet

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.950 
that has very little recoil and bullet
spread<00:05:57.830> they<00:05:58.550> are<00:05:58.610> now<00:05:58.940> going<00:05:59.240> to<00:05:59.390> be<00:05:59.570> a<00:05:59.600> more

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
spread they are now going to be a more

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.380 
spread they are now going to be a more
viable<00:06:00.350> pick<00:06:00.770> simply<00:06:01.550> because<00:06:01.940> if<00:06:02.240> you're

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.390 
viable pick simply because if you're

enemy all Weaver bullets are gonna land
right<00:06:06.410> there<00:06:06.440> and<00:06:06.830> you're<00:06:07.010> gonna<00:06:07.100> be<00:06:07.280> able<00:06:07.460> to

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
right there and you're gonna be able to

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.730 
right there and you're gonna be able to
drop<00:06:07.730> them<00:06:07.940> faster<00:06:08.570> it<00:06:09.169> is<00:06:09.200> gonna<00:06:09.590> be

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
drop them faster it is gonna be

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.100 
drop them faster it is gonna be
interesting<00:06:09.980> to<00:06:10.220> see<00:06:10.400> how<00:06:10.850> people<00:06:11.390> react<00:06:12.020> to

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
interesting to see how people react to

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.810 
interesting to see how people react to
these<00:06:12.260> changes<00:06:12.919> because<00:06:13.310> I<00:06:13.490> think<00:06:13.610> it's

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
these changes because I think it's

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.250 
these changes because I think it's
without<00:06:14.060> saying<00:06:14.360> that<00:06:14.630> the<00:06:14.720> skill<00:06:14.960> gap<00:06:15.169> is

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
without saying that the skill gap is

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.810 
without saying that the skill gap is
gonna<00:06:15.410> increase<00:06:15.830> the<00:06:16.100> people<00:06:16.580> that<00:06:16.730> are

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
gonna increase the people that are

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.190 
gonna increase the people that are

people that go and rely on headshots

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.940 
people that go and rely on headshots
well<00:06:20.750> they're<00:06:21.020> of<00:06:21.140> course<00:06:21.350> gonna<00:06:21.590> do<00:06:21.770> better
