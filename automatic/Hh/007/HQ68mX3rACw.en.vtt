00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
happened to some cts we were really

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.090 
happened to some cts we were really
close<00:00:36.329> games<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.989> then<00:00:37.110> there<00:00:37.559> was<00:00:37.620> something

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
close games and then there was something

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.619 
close games and then there was something
lucky<00:00:38.340> would<00:00:38.460> happen<00:00:38.700> they<00:00:38.879> would<00:00:39.030> get<00:00:39.420> flag

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
lucky would happen they would get flag

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.950 
lucky would happen they would get flag
we<00:00:39.840> win<00:00:39.989> but<00:00:40.620> that's<00:00:40.920> quite<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> guess<00:00:41.840> yeah<00:00:42.840> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
we win but that's quite a guess yeah the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.190 
we win but that's quite a guess yeah the
game<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.260> really<00:00:43.410> 5050<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.309> be<00:00:44.430> honest<00:00:44.700> but

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
game is really 5050 to be honest but

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.990 
game is really 5050 to be honest but
every<00:00:46.200> crucial<00:00:46.440> point<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> game<00:00:47.160> they

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
every crucial point in the game they

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.619 
every crucial point in the game they
just<00:00:48.210> took<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.140> really<00:00:49.559> yeah<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.360> think<00:00:51.510> it

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
just took it really yeah do you think it

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.779 
just took it really yeah do you think it
was<00:00:51.750> anyone<00:00:51.930> sitting<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.129> team<00:00:53.280> was<00:00:53.489> just

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
was anyone sitting on the team was just

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.209 
was anyone sitting on the team was just
the<00:00:53.910> general<00:00:54.120> team<00:00:54.800> team<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:56.010> weren't<00:00:56.100> good

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
the general team team just weren't good

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.619 
the general team team just weren't good
enough<00:00:56.280> at<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.550> time<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.910> think<00:00:57.270> anyone<00:00:57.480> played

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
enough at the time I think anyone played

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.689 
enough at the time I think anyone played
bad<00:00:57.809> literally<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.530> case<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.859> fingers<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.579> go

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
bad literally a case of fingers in go

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.880 
bad literally a case of fingers in go
away<00:00:59.879> at<00:00:59.940> time<00:01:00.239> that's<00:01:00.510> right

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
away at time that's right

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.439 
away at time that's right
yeah<00:01:02.890> literally<00:01:03.309> is<00:01:03.460> just<00:01:03.640> like<00:01:03.789> one<00:01:04.000> kill<00:01:04.299> one

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
yeah literally is just like one kill one

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.749 
yeah literally is just like one kill one
snd<00:01:04.869> like<00:01:05.229> one<00:01:05.470> stunning<00:01:05.920> TTFN<00:01:06.400> and<00:01:06.580> they<00:01:06.670> were

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
snd like one stunning TTFN and they were

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:08.219 
snd like one stunning TTFN and they were
the<00:01:06.850> differences<00:01:07.360> between<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.750> team<00:01:07.960> so

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
the differences between the team so

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.190 
the differences between the team so
maybe<00:01:09.070> they'd<00:01:09.430> go<00:01:09.610> our<00:01:09.970> way<00:01:10.150> another<00:01:10.390> day<00:01:10.630> not

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
maybe they'd go our way another day not

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.660 
maybe they'd go our way another day not
today<00:01:11.350> what<00:01:12.159> was<00:01:12.250> it<00:01:12.340> like<00:01:12.400> playing<00:01:12.549> the

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
today what was it like playing the

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.870 
today what was it like playing the
Americans<00:01:13.979> won't<00:01:14.979> I<00:01:15.190> don't<00:01:15.369> fit<00:01:15.490> no<00:01:15.580> as<00:01:15.729> good

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
Americans won't I don't fit no as good

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.039 
Americans won't I don't fit no as good
as<00:01:15.970> the<00:01:16.060> armor<00:01:16.299> because<00:01:16.420> we<00:01:16.540> played<00:01:16.720> I<00:01:16.750> just

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
as the armor because we played I just

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.080 
as the armor because we played I just
think<00:01:17.229> there<00:01:17.890> were<00:01:18.009> there<00:01:18.399> pretty<00:01:18.580> good<00:01:18.759> S&amp;T<00:01:19.060> I

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
think there were there pretty good S&amp;T I

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.600 
think there were there pretty good S&amp;T I
guess<00:01:19.299> but<00:01:19.450> we<00:01:19.780> took<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:20.020> SD<00:01:20.259> gets<00:01:20.500> them<00:01:20.740> I

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
guess but we took the SD gets them I

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.090 
guess but we took the SD gets them I
think<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.840> only<00:01:22.960> reason<00:01:23.110> they<00:01:23.320> be<00:01:23.500> as<00:01:23.619> what<00:01:23.920> as

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
think the only reason they be as what as

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.430 
think the only reason they be as what as
badly<00:01:24.700> as<00:01:24.880> they<00:01:25.030> did<00:01:25.210> I<00:01:25.450> had<00:01:25.869> so<00:01:26.020> quite<00:01:26.229> down

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
badly as they did I had so quite down

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.680 
badly as they did I had so quite down
we're<00:01:27.190> quite<00:01:27.369> tired<00:01:27.610> and<00:01:28.030> all<00:01:28.149> matches<00:01:28.450> a<00:01:28.539> row

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
we're quite tired and all matches a row

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.180 
we're quite tired and all matches a row
and<00:01:28.960> I<00:01:29.200> think<00:01:29.500> he<00:01:29.560> wouldn't<00:01:29.799> win<00:01:29.890> it<00:01:29.979> back<00:01:30.039> and

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
and I think he wouldn't win it back and

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.219 
and I think he wouldn't win it back and
we<00:01:30.250> paid<00:01:30.399> a<00:01:30.430> medicament<00:01:30.700> bear<00:01:31.090> match<00:01:31.299> but<00:01:31.539> yeah

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
we paid a medicament bear match but yeah

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.389 
we paid a medicament bear match but yeah
I<00:01:32.259> guess<00:01:32.590> they<00:01:32.740> were<00:01:32.830> good<00:01:32.950> but<00:01:33.130> not<00:01:33.280> as<00:01:33.310> good

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
I guess they were good but not as good

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.120 
I guess they were good but not as good
as<00:01:33.580> fear<00:01:33.729> an<00:01:33.820> octave<00:01:34.090> or<00:01:34.119> anything<00:01:34.830> I'm<00:01:35.830> I

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
as fear an octave or anything I'm I

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.990 
as fear an octave or anything I'm I
don't<00:01:36.310> think<00:01:36.460> they're<00:01:36.580> better<00:01:36.729> than<00:01:36.820> us

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
don't think they're better than us

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.419 
don't think they're better than us
individually<00:01:37.720> it's<00:01:37.869> just<00:01:38.110> it<00:01:38.950> seemed<00:01:39.250> like

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
individually it's just it seemed like

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.550 
individually it's just it seemed like
they<00:01:40.000> want<00:01:40.240> to<00:01:40.330> add<00:01:40.659> to<00:01:40.840> play<00:01:40.990> guns<00:01:41.200> but<00:01:41.440> then

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
they want to add to play guns but then

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.020 
they want to add to play guns but then
when<00:01:41.800> you<00:01:41.890> look<00:01:42.009> at<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.190> school<00:01:42.429> board<00:01:42.580> rule

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
when you look at the school board rule

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.910 
when you look at the school board rule
sudden<00:01:43.300> you're<00:01:43.420> like<00:01:43.479> losing<00:01:44.080> so<00:01:44.319> there's<00:01:44.830> a

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
sudden you're like losing so there's a

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.320 
sudden you're like losing so there's a
better<00:01:45.280> confusing<00:01:45.819> one<00:01:46.000> but<00:01:46.179> they're

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
better confusing one but they're

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.999 
better confusing one but they're
obviously<00:01:46.780> a<00:01:46.869> good<00:01:46.960> team<00:01:47.229> but<00:01:47.440> I<00:01:47.500> still<00:01:47.830> want

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
obviously a good team but I still want

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.190 
obviously a good team but I still want
broth<00:01:48.220> to<00:01:48.460> win<00:01:48.610> in<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.000> farm<00:01:49.210> would<00:01:49.960> you<00:01:50.050> say

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
broth to win in the farm would you say

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.600 
broth to win in the farm would you say
that<00:01:50.229> one<00:01:50.470> of<00:01:50.500> your<00:01:50.649> main<00:01:50.770> faults<00:01:51.159> as<00:01:51.340> a<00:01:51.369> team

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
that one of your main faults as a team

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.160 
that one of your main faults as a team
is<00:01:51.819> that<00:01:51.970> you're<00:01:52.090> a<00:01:52.119> motivational<00:01:52.750> team<00:01:52.990> and

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
is that you're a motivational team and

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.290 
is that you're a motivational team and
obviously<00:01:53.920> losing<00:01:54.250> a<00:01:54.310> prof<00:01:54.550> you<00:01:55.000> didn't<00:01:55.179> want

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
obviously losing a prof you didn't want

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.760 
obviously losing a prof you didn't want
that<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:55.659> going<00:01:56.080> down<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:56.259> the<00:01:56.380> loser<00:01:56.590> bracket

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
that and going down to the loser bracket

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.859 
that and going down to the loser bracket
do<00:01:57.399> you<00:01:57.490> think<00:01:57.640> if<00:01:57.729> you<00:01:57.819> doubt<00:01:57.970> a<00:01:58.000> bit<00:01:58.210> if<00:01:58.450> your

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
do you think if you doubt a bit if your

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.029 
do you think if you doubt a bit if your
mindset<00:01:59.319> was<00:01:59.409> different<00:01:59.770> than<00:01:59.860> it<00:01:59.920> would<00:02:00.009> have

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
mindset was different than it would have

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.580 
mindset was different than it would have
been<00:02:00.159> different<00:02:00.340> yeah<00:02:01.299> I<00:02:01.690> would<00:02:01.899> say<00:02:02.080> so<00:02:02.110> a<00:02:02.289> lot

disappeared against collapse and it

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.960 
disappeared against collapse and it
doesn't<00:02:05.619> just<00:02:05.649> happen<00:02:05.890> is<00:02:06.489> something<00:02:06.849> to<00:02:06.910> do

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
work on I'm yeah I do you think a lot of

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.040 
work on I'm yeah I do you think a lot of
the<00:02:11.319> time<00:02:11.530> our<00:02:11.830> heads<00:02:12.040> go<00:02:12.160> down<00:02:12.400> if<00:02:12.640> we<00:02:12.790> lose

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
the time our heads go down if we lose

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.720 
the time our heads go down if we lose
especially<00:02:14.050> in<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:14.890> manner<00:02:15.069> which<00:02:15.310> we<00:02:15.459> did<00:02:15.610> if

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
especially in the manner which we did if

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.520 
especially in the manner which we did if
we<00:02:15.849> get<00:02:16.030> like<00:02:16.510> completely<00:02:16.690> destroyed<00:02:17.319> them

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
we get like completely destroyed them

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.470 
we get like completely destroyed them
fair<00:02:17.709> enough<00:02:17.950> but<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.610> way<00:02:18.730> we<00:02:18.910> lost<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.270> prof

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
fair enough but the way we lost the prof

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.790 
fair enough but the way we lost the prof
was<00:02:19.660> just<00:02:19.870> so<00:02:19.989> close<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.500> could<00:02:20.620> have<00:02:20.709> gone

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
was just so close and could have gone

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.350 
was just so close and could have gone
either<00:02:20.830> way<00:02:21.040> we're<00:02:21.400> just<00:02:21.550> so<00:02:21.730> disappointed

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
either way we're just so disappointed

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.970 
either way we're just so disappointed
and<00:02:22.450> then<00:02:22.599> we<00:02:23.200> just<00:02:23.379> went<00:02:23.560> straight<00:02:23.680> in

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
and then we just went straight in

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.580 
and then we just went straight in
against<00:02:24.430> collapse<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:24.970> yeah<00:02:25.810> they<00:02:25.989> they<00:02:26.230> were

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
against collapse and yeah they they were

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.650 
against collapse and yeah they they were
all<00:02:26.770> over<00:02:26.830> us<00:02:27.010> upon<00:02:27.280> us<00:02:27.400> so<00:02:28.300> I<00:02:28.330> guess<00:02:28.510> the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
all over us upon us so I guess the

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.210 
all over us upon us so I guess the
booths<00:02:28.810> didn't<00:02:29.080> have<00:02:29.170> as<00:02:29.319> much<00:02:29.349> advantage<00:02:29.920> as

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
booths didn't have as much advantage as

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.360 
booths didn't have as much advantage as
a<00:02:30.250> i<00:02:30.640> was<00:02:31.030> saying<00:02:31.239> i<00:02:31.590> don't<00:02:32.590> know<00:02:32.800> i<00:02:32.830> guess<00:02:32.980> i

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
a i was saying i don't know i guess i

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.220 
a i was saying i don't know i guess i
guess<00:02:33.519> we've<00:02:33.819> been<00:02:34.030> there<00:02:34.269> we<00:02:34.720> would<00:02:34.840> have

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
guess we've been there we would have

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.509 
guess we've been there we would have
been<00:02:35.349> gone<00:02:35.530> for<00:02:35.709> our<00:02:35.830> advanced<00:02:36.129> trip<00:02:36.370> we<00:02:36.489> had

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
been gone for our advanced trip we had

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.130 
been gone for our advanced trip we had
diverting<00:02:37.150> right<00:02:37.300> in<00:02:37.360> front<00:02:37.510> of<00:02:37.599> us<00:02:37.690> but<00:02:37.750> i

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
diverting right in front of us but i

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.360 
diverting right in front of us but i
think<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:38.560> made<00:02:38.650> much<00:02:38.860> different<00:02:39.160> people

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
think it made much different people

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.760 
think it made much different people
centered

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
centered

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.410 
centered
yeah<00:02:41.460> just<00:02:41.700> like<00:02:41.820> I<00:02:41.880> said<00:02:42.120> in<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.210> previous

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
yeah just like I said in the previous

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.240 
yeah just like I said in the previous
into<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:42.900> don't<00:02:43.170> think<00:02:43.410> we<00:02:43.680> get<00:02:43.860> an<00:02:43.950> advantage

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
into I don't think we get an advantage

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.110 
into I don't think we get an advantage
and<00:02:44.760> this<00:02:45.150> was<00:02:45.330> one<00:02:45.870> of<00:02:45.930> those<00:02:46.080> things<00:02:47.090> one<00:02:48.090> of

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
and this was one of those things one of

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.250 
and this was one of those things one of
the<00:02:48.210> two<00:02:48.330> side<00:02:48.510> management<00:02:48.750> said<00:02:48.990> about<00:02:49.140> the

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
the two side management said about the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.760 
the two side management said about the
score<00:02:49.880> I'm<00:02:50.880> not<00:02:51.270> sure<00:02:51.330> but<00:02:51.510> I<00:02:51.720> don't<00:02:51.870> think<00:02:51.990> I

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
score I'm not sure but I don't think I

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.860 
score I'm not sure but I don't think I
fit<00:02:53.190> in<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.460> disappoint<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.360> guess<00:02:54.510> top<00:02:54.720> three

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
fit in to disappoint I guess top three

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.490 
fit in to disappoint I guess top three
is<00:02:54.930> good<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:55.410> oh<00:02:55.650> well<00:02:56.600> yeah<00:02:57.600> realistically<00:02:58.260> we

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
is good so oh well yeah realistically we

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.930 
is good so oh well yeah realistically we
want<00:02:58.710> to<00:02:58.830> be<00:02:58.920> placing<00:02:59.280> around<00:02:59.490> the<00:02:59.550> top<00:02:59.730> free

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
want to be placing around the top free

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.390 
want to be placing around the top free
every<00:03:00.180> event<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.960> think<00:03:01.710> once<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.100> get<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.250> this

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
every event I think once you get to this

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.550 
every event I think once you get to this
level<00:03:02.580> is<00:03:02.910> kind<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.330> this<00:03:03.570> so<00:03:03.840> little<00:03:04.260> between

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
level is kind of this so little between

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.230 
level is kind of this so little between
each<00:03:04.710> team<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.400> just<00:03:05.490> comes<00:03:05.730> down<00:03:05.820> to<00:03:05.970> the

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
each team that just comes down to the

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.000 
each team that just comes down to the
little<00:03:06.390> clutch<00:03:06.630> moments<00:03:07.050> in<00:03:07.140> each<00:03:07.290> game<00:03:07.500> so<00:03:07.800> I

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
little clutch moments in each game so I

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.550 
little clutch moments in each game so I
was<00:03:08.550> hope<00:03:08.730> in<00:03:08.940> one<00:03:09.270> of<00:03:09.300> these<00:03:09.540> events<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.470> will

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
was hope in one of these events it will

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.070 
was hope in one of these events it will
be<00:03:10.680> I'll<00:03:10.950> tend<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.400> like<00:03:11.670> win<00:03:12.000> as<00:03:12.600> opposed<00:03:12.930> to

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
be I'll tend to like win as opposed to

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.230 
be I'll tend to like win as opposed to
just<00:03:13.110> miss<00:03:13.530> out<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.740> bit<00:03:13.980> um<00:03:14.130> do<00:03:14.820> you<00:03:14.880> think<00:03:14.970> yeah

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
just miss out a bit um do you think yeah

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.570 
just miss out a bit um do you think yeah
you<00:03:15.300> see<00:03:16.080> you<00:03:16.230> tend<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.560> like<00:03:16.770> get<00:03:16.980> towards<00:03:17.490> the

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
you see you tend to like get towards the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.970 
you see you tend to like get towards the
end<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:17.880> then<00:03:18.000> sort<00:03:18.690> of<00:03:18.810> almost<00:03:19.170> choked<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.830> I

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
end and then sort of almost choked it I

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.730 
end and then sort of almost choked it I
mean<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.520> that<00:03:20.760> is<00:03:21.360> that<00:03:21.630> as<00:03:22.050> a<00:03:22.200> common<00:03:22.530> theme

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
mean is that is that as a common theme

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.900 
mean is that is that as a common theme
with<00:03:22.770> your<00:03:23.040> team<00:03:23.280> why<00:03:23.550> do<00:03:23.610> you<00:03:23.670> think<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:23.820> is

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
with your team why do you think that is

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.990 
with your team why do you think that is
I<00:03:24.290> don't<00:03:25.290> know<00:03:25.490> it's<00:03:26.490> what<00:03:26.580> every<00:03:26.790> event

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
I don't know it's what every event

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.190 
I don't know it's what every event
happens<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.660> you<00:03:27.780> think<00:03:27.960> it's<00:03:28.050> going<00:03:28.140> to

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
happens and you think it's going to

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.690 
happens and you think it's going to
change<00:03:28.290> like<00:03:28.650> those<00:03:29.070> this<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.430> first<00:03:29.580> time

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
change like those this the first time

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.860 
change like those this the first time
where<00:03:29.850> because<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.150> winds<00:03:30.300> back<00:03:30.420> at<00:03:30.540> final

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
where because the winds back at final

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.050 
where because the winds back at final
and<00:03:30.990> we<00:03:31.320> did<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:31.770> guess<00:03:31.950> that's<00:03:32.190> progress<00:03:32.730> it

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
and we did it I guess that's progress it

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.010 
and we did it I guess that's progress it
gets<00:03:33.210> next<00:03:33.360> day<00:03:33.510> when<00:03:33.630> she<00:03:33.690> had<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.870> take<00:03:33.960> a

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
gets next day when she had to take a

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.890 
gets next day when she had to take a
step<00:03:34.260> further<00:03:34.880> yeah<00:03:35.880> I<00:03:35.910> have<00:03:36.300> literally<00:03:36.690> no
