00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:06.230 

replace<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.350> plate<00:02:04.640> screw<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.700> 10<00:02:05.970> screws

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
replace the plate screw the 10 screws

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.719 
replace the plate screw the 10 screws
that<00:02:06.570> secures<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.930> plate<00:02:07.229> back<00:02:07.409> in<00:02:07.590> place<00:02:07.799> all

right<00:02:09.080> connect<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.170> yellow<00:02:10.289> connector<00:02:12.230> and

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
right connect the yellow connector and

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.210 
right connect the yellow connector and
then<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.900> long<00:02:16.080> white<00:02:16.319> connector<00:02:16.739> which<00:02:17.190> is

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
then the long white connector which is

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.670 
then the long white connector which is
which<00:02:17.940> leads<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.450> charging<00:02:18.810> port<00:02:19.019> over

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
which leads to the charging port over

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.300 
which leads to the charging port over
here

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310
