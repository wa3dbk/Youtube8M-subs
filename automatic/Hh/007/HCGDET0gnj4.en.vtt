00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
cardboard skid you see here and be able

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.860 
cardboard skid you see here and be able
to<00:01:58.479> put<00:01:58.720> it<00:01:58.840> in<00:01:59.080> a<00:01:59.830> flatbed<00:02:00.340> like<00:02:00.760> this<00:02:01.060> so<00:02:01.720> then

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.210 
and then I taped all over all the pieces
because<00:02:25.090> they're<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:26.200> glue<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:26.710> paint<00:02:26.980> better

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
because they're to glue and paint better

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.800 
because they're to glue and paint better
it's<00:02:27.670> better<00:02:27.760> if<00:02:28.000> they<00:02:28.120> have<00:02:28.240> some<00:02:28.390> masking

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
it's better if they have some masking

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.810 
it's better if they have some masking
tape<00:02:28.840> want<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.350> get<00:02:29.470> that<00:02:29.650> pink<00:02:29.860> to<00:02:30.100> stick

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
tape want to get that pink to stick

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.390 
tape want to get that pink to stick
better<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.330> then<00:02:32.050> because<00:02:32.740> of<00:02:32.770> this<00:02:32.950> inhaler

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
better and then because of this inhaler

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.880 
better and then because of this inhaler
has<00:02:33.760> an<00:02:34.060> indented<00:02:34.660> Center<00:02:35.080> on<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.350> bottom<00:02:35.740> I

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
has an indented Center on the bottom I

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.620 
has an indented Center on the bottom I
put<00:02:36.550> a<00:02:36.580> little<00:02:36.790> hole<00:02:36.940> so<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.240> glue<00:02:37.420> could

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
put a little hole so the glue could

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.370 
put a little hole so the glue could
drive<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:38.020> little<00:02:38.290> bit<00:02:38.410> better<00:02:38.560> in<00:02:38.800> there<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:41.140> I

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
drive a little bit better in there and I

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.260 
drive a little bit better in there and I
made<00:02:41.560> this<00:02:41.830> little<00:02:42.100> funnel<00:02:43.090> with<00:02:43.420> more<00:02:44.380> tape

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
made this little funnel with more tape

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.640 
made this little funnel with more tape
so<00:02:46.270> let<00:02:46.450> me<00:02:46.570> paint<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:47.050> and<00:02:47.230> then<00:02:47.380> we'll<00:02:47.530> be

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
so let me paint it and then we'll be
