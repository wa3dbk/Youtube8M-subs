restringing a nylon string guitar is a

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.839 
restringing a nylon string guitar is a
little<00:00:07.379> trickier<00:00:07.830> than<00:00:07.890> some<00:00:08.250> other<00:00:08.429> guitars

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
little trickier than some other guitars

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.330 
little trickier than some other guitars
because<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:10.080> hardware<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.620> this<00:00:10.950> kind<00:00:11.250> of

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
because the hardware of this kind of

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.480 
because the hardware of this kind of
guitar<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.540> little<00:00:13.049> different<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:13.769> start

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
guitar is a little different you start

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.150 
guitar is a little different you start
by<00:00:14.670> removing<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.210> old<00:00:15.420> string<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.980> is

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
by removing the old string and that is

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.340 
by removing the old string and that is
done<00:00:17.430> by<00:00:17.820> moving<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.359> machine<00:00:18.779> head<00:00:19.080> to

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
done by moving the machine head to

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.349 
done by moving the machine head to
loosen<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.859> string<00:00:20.189> until<00:00:20.460> it's<00:00:21.119> loose

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
loosen the string until it's loose

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.740 
loosen the string until it's loose
enough<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.720> come<00:00:22.020> off<00:00:22.789> now<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.820> have<00:00:24.180> taken<00:00:24.390> off

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
enough to come off now I have taken off

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.720 
enough to come off now I have taken off
a<00:00:24.779> couple<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.470> other<00:00:25.619> strings<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.699> that

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
a couple of the other strings so that

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.640 
a couple of the other strings so that
they're<00:00:27.119> not<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.599> way<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.410> you

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
they're not in the way and so that you

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.400 
they're not in the way and so that you
can<00:00:28.830> see<00:00:29.250> what's<00:00:29.970> happening<00:00:30.570> on<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.109> post

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410

can see what's happening on the post
that<00:00:31.800> we're<00:00:31.980> working<00:00:32.250> with<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:33.079> these

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
that we're working with and these

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.380 
that we're working with and these
machines<00:00:34.559> move<00:00:35.010> kind<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.460> slowly<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:36.180> it'll

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
machines move kind of slowly so it'll

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.260 
machines move kind of slowly so it'll
take<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.660> while<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.200> get<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.770> string<00:00:38.309> loose

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
take a while to get that string loose

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.119 
take a while to get that string loose
enough<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.719> come<00:00:39.960> off<00:00:42.320> okay<00:00:43.320> now<00:00:43.530> I've<00:00:43.800> got<00:00:43.829> it

enough to come off okay now I've got it
all<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.399> way<00:00:44.520> loose<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.469> free<00:00:46.469> from<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.980> post

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
all the way loose and free from the post

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.090 
all the way loose and free from the post
now<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> string<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:48.899> loose<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.590> can<00:00:49.710> see

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
now that the string is loose you can see

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.660 
now that the string is loose you can see
it's<00:00:50.250> very<00:00:50.340> simple<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:52.430> disengage<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.460> from

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
it's very simple to disengage it from

the<00:00:53.879> other<00:00:54.120> end<00:00:55.250> you<00:00:56.250> just<00:00:57.020> loosen<00:00:58.020> up<00:00:58.140> that

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
the other end you just loosen up that

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.970 
the other end you just loosen up that
string<00:01:00.449> there<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.020> pull<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.739> through<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
string there and pull it through the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.539 
string there and pull it through the
hole<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.660> off<00:01:03.930> now<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:04.949> time<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.220> put

on the new string and you can see that

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.600 
on the new string and you can see that
this<00:01:07.920> string<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:09.080> plain<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.110> both<00:01:10.560> ends<00:01:11.159> some

one end
these<00:01:15.479> have<00:01:15.750> got<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.960> plain<00:01:16.350> end<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:16.860> both<00:01:17.250> ends

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
you bring this short end underneath the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.030 
you bring this short end underneath the
long<00:01:34.680> end<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.159> string<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:36.740> then<00:01:37.740> up

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
machine head from the front side and now

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.120 
machine head from the front side and now
you<00:02:25.180> bring<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.989> end<00:02:26.200> that's<00:02:26.530> in<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:26.890> back

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
you bring the end that's in the back

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.120 
you bring the end that's in the back
over<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.269> through<00:02:28.930> from<00:02:29.410> this<00:02:29.620> side

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.160 

underneath<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:34.030> main<00:02:34.269> part<00:02:34.599> of<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.810> string

and<00:02:36.390> then<00:02:37.390> back<00:02:37.660> up<00:02:37.959> to<00:02:38.230> form<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:39.040> little<00:02:39.239> u<00:02:41.550> and

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
and then back up to form a little u and

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:51.180 
and then back up to form a little u and
now<00:02:47.489> inside<00:02:48.489> that<00:02:48.880> short<00:02:49.600> section<00:02:50.230> you<00:02:50.920> loop

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
now inside that short section you loop

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.620 
now inside that short section you loop
it<00:02:51.310> around<00:02:51.610> itself<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:53.670> couple<00:02:54.670> of<00:02:54.790> times<00:02:55.030> under

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
and over under and over and now you pull

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.860 
and over under and over and now you pull
on<00:03:01.989> both<00:03:02.019> sides<00:03:02.670> until<00:03:03.670> everything<00:03:04.420> tightens

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
on both sides until everything tightens

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.280 
on both sides until everything tightens
up<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.970> can<00:03:07.150> pull<00:03:07.360> on<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.660> from<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.049> other

secure to the post you keep some tension

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.910 
secure to the post you keep some tension
on<00:03:15.459> it<00:03:15.489> and<00:03:15.850> now<00:03:16.359> we<00:03:16.420> start<00:03:16.810> tuning<00:03:17.109> it<00:03:17.350> up<00:03:17.500> by

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
on it and now we start tuning it up by

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.160 
on it and now we start tuning it up by
moving<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.489> machine<00:03:18.850> head<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.660> tighten<00:03:20.049> the

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
moving the machine head to tighten the

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.069 
moving the machine head to tighten the
string<00:03:20.500> now<00:03:21.370> one<00:03:21.609> thing<00:03:21.880> here<00:03:22.239> is<00:03:22.420> that<00:03:22.450> you

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
string now one thing here is that you

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.250 
string now one thing here is that you
allow<00:03:23.829> the<00:03:23.859> windings<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.910> proceed<00:03:25.780> towards

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
allow the windings to proceed towards

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.710 
allow the windings to proceed towards
the<00:03:26.320> outside<00:03:26.890> edge<00:03:27.280> of<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:27.640> guitar<00:03:27.970> rather

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
the outside edge of the guitar rather

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.680 
the outside edge of the guitar rather
than<00:03:29.019> the<00:03:29.140> inside<00:03:29.819> just<00:03:30.819> a<00:03:31.000> few<00:03:31.209> times<00:03:31.480> around

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
than the inside just a few times around

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.410 
than the inside just a few times around
this<00:03:31.959> post<00:03:32.370> would<00:03:33.370> be<00:03:33.549> the<00:03:33.700> correct<00:03:34.030> amount

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
this post would be the correct amount

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.729 
this post would be the correct amount
and<00:03:34.690> now<00:03:35.680> as<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.340> string<00:03:36.609> gets<00:03:36.790> tight<00:03:37.060> enough

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
and now as the string gets tight enough

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.059 
and now as the string gets tight enough
to<00:03:38.739> start<00:03:39.010> sounding<00:03:39.430> a<00:03:39.549> pitch<00:03:39.819> you<00:03:40.859> strike<00:03:41.859> the

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
to start sounding a pitch you strike the

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.690 
to start sounding a pitch you strike the
string<00:03:42.400> while<00:03:42.819> you<00:03:43.090> tighten<00:03:43.359> it<00:03:44.250> until<00:03:45.250> you

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
string while you tighten it until you

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.339 
string while you tighten it until you
hear<00:03:45.910> it<00:03:46.030> come<00:03:46.269> up<00:03:46.450> to<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.690> pitch

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
hear it come up to the pitch

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.720 
hear it come up to the pitch
that<00:03:48.980> you're<00:03:49.189> looking<00:03:49.489> for<00:03:51.159> now<00:03:52.159> at<00:03:52.519> this

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
that you're looking for now at this

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.080 
that you're looking for now at this
point<00:03:53.060> let<00:03:53.209> me<00:03:53.239> say<00:03:53.629> on<00:03:54.340> i'll<00:03:55.340> on<00:03:55.579> string<00:03:55.909> will

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
point let me say on i'll on string will

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.989 
point let me say on i'll on string will
stretch<00:03:56.480> for<00:03:56.780> a<00:03:56.810> long<00:03:57.170> long<00:03:57.530> time<00:03:57.790> it'll<00:03:58.790> take

00:03:58.989 --> 00:03:58.999 
stretch for a long long time it'll take

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:00.970 
stretch for a long long time it'll take
a<00:03:59.030> while<00:03:59.359> for<00:03:59.420> it<00:03:59.749> to<00:03:59.810> get<00:04:00.079> to<00:04:00.260> the<00:04:00.379> pitch<00:04:00.620> you

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
a while for it to get to the pitch you

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.240 
a while for it to get to the pitch you
want<00:04:01.219> in<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.519> first<00:04:01.760> place

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.679 

and<00:04:07.540> then<00:04:08.540> after<00:04:09.109> it<00:04:09.200> gets<00:04:09.439> there<00:04:09.769> it<00:04:10.689> will

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:11.689 
and then after it gets there it will

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:13.690 
and then after it gets there it will
just<00:04:11.989> stretch<00:04:12.349> itself<00:04:12.739> and<00:04:13.069> go<00:04:13.189> a<00:04:13.219> little<00:04:13.459> bit

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
just stretch itself and go a little bit

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.150 
just stretch itself and go a little bit
flat<00:04:14.090> and<00:04:15.430> you'll<00:04:16.430> have<00:04:16.579> to<00:04:16.699> retune<00:04:17.150> it<00:04:17.389> and

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
flat and you'll have to retune it and

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.890 
flat and you'll have to retune it and
even<00:04:19.160> a<00:04:19.250> day<00:04:19.489> later<00:04:19.880> it<00:04:20.269> still<00:04:20.720> might<00:04:20.870> be

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
even a day later it still might be

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.749 
even a day later it still might be
stretching<00:04:21.470> a<00:04:21.530> little<00:04:21.769> bit<00:04:21.949> but<00:04:22.160> after<00:04:22.340> that

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:22.759 
stretching a little bit but after that

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:26.439 
stretching a little bit but after that
period<00:04:23.720> of<00:04:23.780> time<00:04:23.870> it'll<00:04:24.710> become<00:04:24.860> stable<00:04:25.580> now

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 
period of time it'll become stable now

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:27.999 
period of time it'll become stable now
you<00:04:26.509> want<00:04:26.780> to<00:04:26.840> take<00:04:27.020> some<00:04:27.289> of<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.500> stretch<00:04:27.800> out

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:28.009 
you want to take some of the stretch out

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.550 
you want to take some of the stretch out
of<00:04:28.190> this<00:04:28.310> string<00:04:28.669> so<00:04:28.940> here's<00:04:29.660> how<00:04:29.840> I<00:04:29.870> do<00:04:30.050> it

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
of this string so here's how I do it

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.950 
of this string so here's how I do it
I<00:04:30.590> grab<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.580> string<00:04:32.030> with<00:04:32.150> my<00:04:32.180> fingertips

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
I grab the string with my fingertips

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.560 
I grab the string with my fingertips
from<00:04:33.289> one<00:04:33.680> side<00:04:33.979> and<00:04:34.370> push<00:04:34.910> with<00:04:35.120> my<00:04:35.300> thumb

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
from one side and push with my thumb

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.779 
from one side and push with my thumb
from<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.810> other<00:04:35.990> side<00:04:36.320> and<00:04:36.680> just<00:04:37.370> give<00:04:37.610> it<00:04:37.639> a

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
from the other side and just give it a

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.150 
from the other side and just give it a
good<00:04:37.940> tug<00:04:38.270> at<00:04:38.810> several<00:04:39.380> places<00:04:39.620> along<00:04:40.099> the

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
good tug at several places along the

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.900 
good tug at several places along the
length<00:04:40.520> of<00:04:40.729> the<00:04:40.820> string<00:04:41.150> and<00:04:41.979> now<00:04:42.979> I've<00:04:43.580> made

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
length of the string and now I've made

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.830 
length of the string and now I've made
it<00:04:43.970> go<00:04:44.210> flat<00:04:46.120> you<00:04:47.120> bring<00:04:47.330> it<00:04:47.419> up<00:04:47.509> to<00:04:47.630> pitch

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
it go flat you bring it up to pitch

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.110 
it go flat you bring it up to pitch
again<00:04:48.229> you<00:04:49.009> stretch<00:04:49.370> it<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.639> same<00:04:49.910> way<00:04:50.210> again

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
again you stretch it the same way again

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.909 
again you stretch it the same way again
do<00:04:53.120> this<00:04:53.240> a<00:04:53.300> few<00:04:53.419> times<00:04:53.630> until<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:54.650> string

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919
