ymo<00:01:36.180> oh<00:01:38.420> this<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:39.630> wasn't<00:01:39.840> quite<00:01:40.049> as<00:01:40.439> easy<00:01:40.650> to

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
ymo oh this one wasn't quite as easy to

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.580 
ymo oh this one wasn't quite as easy to
insert<00:01:41.549> but<00:01:41.850> once<00:01:42.060> she<00:01:42.270> gets<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.659> right<00:01:42.840> or<00:01:43.229> she

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
insert but once she gets it right or she

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.819 
insert but once she gets it right or she
doesn't<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.520> ovipositor<00:01:45.420> can<00:01:46.020> go<00:01:46.200> through<00:01:46.500> a

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
doesn't that ovipositor can go through a

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.030 
doesn't that ovipositor can go through a
three<00:01:47.220> quarter<00:01:48.000> inch<00:01:48.030> thick<00:01:48.840> piece<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.530> wood

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
three quarter inch thick piece of wood

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.999 
three quarter inch thick piece of wood
it's<00:01:50.909> almost<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.540> wood<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.680> right

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
it's almost like that wood to the right

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.010 
it's almost like that wood to the right
of<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.430> actually<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.030> 3/4<00:01:54.659> inch<00:01:54.689> but

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
of it that actually is a 3/4 inch but

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.410 
of it that actually is a 3/4 inch but
it's<00:01:55.140> caught<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.649> cut<00:01:55.920> on<00:01:55.950> bevel<00:01:56.420> but

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
it's caught on that cut on bevel but

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.420 
it's caught on that cut on bevel but
that's<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.229> heck<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.439> an<00:01:58.619> ovipositor<00:01:59.719> so<00:02:01.430> these

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
that's a heck of an ovipositor so these

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.429 
that's a heck of an ovipositor so these
guys<00:02:02.729> are<00:02:02.909> very<00:02:02.939> destructive<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.719> mason<00:02:04.259> bees

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
guys are very destructive to mason bees

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.440 
guys are very destructive to mason bees
and<00:02:04.770> leaf<00:02:05.369> cutter<00:02:05.640> bees<00:02:07.819> and<00:02:08.819> I'm<00:02:09.090> sure<00:02:09.300> they

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
and leaf cutter bees and I'm sure they

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.479 
and leaf cutter bees and I'm sure they
kill<00:02:09.780> zillions<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.590> them<00:02:10.649> every<00:02:11.160> year<00:02:11.310> but

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
kill zillions of them every year but

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.920 
kill zillions of them every year but
they're<00:02:11.640> very<00:02:11.760> hard<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:12.209> control<00:02:12.390> luckily

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
they're very hard to control luckily

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.910 
they're very hard to control luckily
this<00:02:13.080> one

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
this one

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.089 
this one
is<00:02:13.980> not<00:02:14.160> all<00:02:14.459> that<00:02:14.490> common<00:02:15.560> I'm<00:02:16.560> on<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.920> East

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
is not all that common I'm on the East

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.100 
is not all that common I'm on the East
Coast<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:17.700> don't<00:02:18.360> see<00:02:18.599> too<00:02:18.810> many<00:02:18.989> of<00:02:19.230> them<00:02:19.319> I

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
Coast so don't see too many of them I

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:29.449 
Coast so don't see too many of them I
thought<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:22.349> was<00:02:22.470> pretty<00:02:22.709> cool<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:28.459> course

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
thought that was pretty cool of course

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.380 
thought that was pretty cool of course
come<00:02:29.880> next<00:02:30.090> spring<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.920> then<00:02:32.040> these<00:02:32.390> beasts

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
come next spring and then these beasts

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.860 
come next spring and then these beasts
emerge<00:02:34.290> from<00:02:34.590> this<00:02:34.770> tube<00:02:35.660> obviously<00:02:36.660> there

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
emerge from this tube obviously there

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.710 
emerge from this tube obviously there
will<00:02:37.020> also<00:02:37.260> be<00:02:37.610> some<00:02:38.610> wasps<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.390> will<00:02:39.569> be

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
will also be some wasps that will be

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.120 
will also be some wasps that will be
emerging<00:02:40.850> because<00:02:41.850> these<00:02:42.470> cells<00:02:43.470> are<00:02:43.680> divided

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
emerging because these cells are divided

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.440 
emerging because these cells are divided
by<00:02:44.250> pretty<00:02:44.580> thick<00:02:44.819> plugs<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.360> mud<00:02:47.209> they<00:02:48.209> have

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
by pretty thick plugs of mud they have

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.400 
by pretty thick plugs of mud they have
to<00:02:48.600> chew<00:02:48.810> through<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.110> mud<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.500> get<00:02:49.650> out<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:54.410> be

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
to chew through the mud to get out so be

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.110 
to chew through the mud to get out so be
certainly<00:02:55.739> one<00:02:56.010> less<00:02:56.250> she<00:02:56.400> only<00:02:56.519> lays<00:02:56.819> one<00:02:57.060> egg

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
certainly one less she only lays one egg

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.309 
certainly one less she only lays one egg
in<00:02:57.840> each<00:03:00.110> cocoons<00:03:02.030> so<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.569> could<00:03:04.019> be<00:03:04.049> worse

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
in each cocoons so it could be worse

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.059 
in each cocoons so it could be worse
some<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.489> child<00:03:05.760> swaps<00:03:06.120> late<00:03:06.890> dozens<00:03:07.890> of

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
some of the child swaps late dozens of

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.590 
some of the child swaps late dozens of
eggs<00:03:08.220> in<00:03:08.549> each<00:03:08.790> one<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.120> they're<00:03:09.420> very

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
eggs in each one and they're very

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.120 
eggs in each one and they're very
destructive<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:11.569> there<00:03:12.569> she<00:03:12.959> is<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.950> all<00:03:14.130> her

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
destructive so there she is and all her

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.250 
destructive so there she is and all her
don't<00:03:17.130> even<00:03:17.190> say<00:03:17.459> glory<00:03:17.819> but<00:03:18.690> it<00:03:18.810> is<00:03:18.959> kind<00:03:19.200> of

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
don't even say glory but it is kind of

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.500 
don't even say glory but it is kind of
cool
