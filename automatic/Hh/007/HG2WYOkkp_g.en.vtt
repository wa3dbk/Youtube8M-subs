00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
require keyboard input but anyway let's

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.479 
require keyboard input but anyway let's
let's<00:00:39.390> just<00:00:39.570> see<00:00:39.690> how<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.840> works<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.379> we'll<00:00:41.250> try

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
let's just see how it works so we'll try

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.869 
let's just see how it works so we'll try
spank<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.480> monkey<00:00:43.760> that's<00:00:44.760> an<00:00:44.940> old<00:00:45.090> one<00:00:45.620> and

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
spank the monkey that's an old one and

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.410 
spank the monkey that's an old one and
there<00:00:47.879> goes<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.149> loads<00:00:48.329> pretty<00:00:48.570> fast<00:00:50.270> you<00:00:51.270> can

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
there goes the loads pretty fast you can

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.380 
there goes the loads pretty fast you can
actually<00:00:52.129> if<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.250> double<00:00:53.579> click<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.090> it

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
actually if you double click on it it

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.040 
actually if you double click on it it
goes<00:00:54.570> full<00:00:54.870> screen<00:00:56.090> but<00:00:57.090> yeah<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.270> just<00:00:57.570> move

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
goes full screen but yeah you just move

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.360 
goes full screen but yeah you just move
your<00:00:58.170> finger<00:00:58.500> like<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:59.160> would<00:00:59.340> your<00:00:59.370> mouse

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
your finger like you would your mouse

well it's here yeah there we go 179
miles<00:01:06.360> an<00:01:06.540> hour<00:01:06.630> see<00:01:07.320> if<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:07.650> go<00:01:07.830> faster

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
miles an hour see if I can go faster

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.380 
miles an hour see if I can go faster
than<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:11.869> nice<00:01:13.580> and<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.670> just<00:01:14.790> drag<00:01:15.090> down
