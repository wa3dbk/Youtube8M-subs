stronger and we're just spending more

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.290 
stronger and we're just spending more

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
time playing what's that team direction

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.180 
time playing what's that team direction
oh<00:00:38.149> that's<00:00:39.149> hard<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.480> say<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:40.140> we<00:00:40.350> we<00:00:40.829> first

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
oh that's hard to say like we we first

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.110 
oh that's hard to say like we we first
started<00:00:41.550> we<00:00:41.579> first<00:00:42.059> started<00:00:42.420> yet<00:00:42.570> upper<00:00:43.530> one

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
started we first started yet upper one

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.760 
started we first started yet upper one
we<00:00:45.120> first<00:00:45.329> started<00:00:45.629> just<00:00:45.840> thinking<00:00:46.140> like<00:00:46.289> we

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
we first started just thinking like we

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.440 
we first started just thinking like we
just<00:00:46.920> need<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.070> play<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.309> piece<00:00:47.520> because<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
just need to play that piece because the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.310 
just need to play that piece because the
best<00:00:48.629> teams<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.930> world<00:00:48.989> they<00:00:49.200> played

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
best teams in the world they played

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.220 
best teams in the world they played
opie's<00:00:49.620> just<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:50.039> be<00:00:50.129> like<00:00:50.219> at<00:00:50.370> Korea<00:00:50.550> SKT<00:00:51.180> t1

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
opie's just to be like at Korea SKT t1

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.240 
opie's just to be like at Korea SKT t1
they're<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.379> dominant<00:00:52.710> because<00:00:52.920> they<00:00:53.070> just

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
they're so dominant because they just

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.830 
they're so dominant because they just
play<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.520> strongest<00:00:53.820> thing<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.270> we<00:00:54.660> looked

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
play the strongest thing and we looked

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.299 
play the strongest thing and we looked
at<00:00:54.930> cloud<00:00:55.110> 9's<00:00:55.440> dominant<00:00:55.890> season<00:00:56.160> they're

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
at cloud 9's dominant season they're

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.380 
at cloud 9's dominant season they're
like<00:00:56.399> oh<00:00:56.550> they<00:00:56.670> only<00:00:56.820> play<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.120> strongest

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
like oh they only play the strongest

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.970 
like oh they only play the strongest
thing<00:00:57.629> maybe<00:00:58.170> we<00:00:58.379> should<00:00:58.530> just<00:00:58.559> start<00:00:58.859> doing

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
thing maybe we should just start doing

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.139 
thing maybe we should just start doing
that<00:00:59.160> instead<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.489> trying<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.670> play<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.120> know

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
that instead of trying to play you know

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.700 
that instead of trying to play you know
random<00:01:00.390> stuff<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.930> just<00:01:01.199> play<00:01:01.350> what<00:01:01.469> we<00:01:01.530> like

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
random stuff and just play what we like

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.979 
random stuff and just play what we like
so<00:01:02.250> we<00:01:02.940> first<00:01:03.210> did<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.690> now<00:01:03.719> we're<00:01:03.960> just

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
so we first did that and now we're just

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.329 
so we first did that and now we're just
kind<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.320> ranching<00:01:04.619> out<00:01:04.710> trying<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.040> be<00:01:05.100> more

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
kind of ranching out trying to be more

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.310 
kind of ranching out trying to be more
unique<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.880> having<00:01:06.119> her<00:01:06.180> own<00:01:06.270> style<00:01:06.540> well<00:01:07.290> I

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
unique and having her own style well I

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.020 
unique and having her own style well I
guess<00:01:07.560> focusing<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.490> North<00:01:08.670> American

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
guess focusing on the North American

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.030 
guess focusing on the North American

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
scene there's a new support in the game

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
matchup Oh against xeg uh they might be

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.640 
matchup Oh against xeg uh they might be
a<00:01:36.630> little<00:01:37.310> a<00:01:38.310> little<00:01:39.210> bit<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.140> threat<00:01:40.380> yeah

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
a little a little bit of a threat yeah

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.200 
a little a little bit of a threat yeah
cuz<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.250> put<00:01:41.400> these<00:01:41.490> back<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> jungle<00:01:41.970> and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
cuz we put these back in the jungle and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.249 
cuz we put these back in the jungle and
I<00:01:42.270> really<00:01:42.479> think<00:01:42.630> Smith<00:01:42.869> these<00:01:42.990> one<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
I really think Smith these one of the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.830 
I really think Smith these one of the
top<00:01:43.439> junglers<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.100> na<00:01:44.280> as<00:01:44.460> well<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.540> might

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
top junglers and na as well and it might

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.450 
top junglers and na as well and it might
be<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:46.049> little<00:01:46.200> scary<00:01:46.470> because<00:01:46.649> his<00:01:47.040> presence

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
be a little scary because his presence

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.520 
be a little scary because his presence
is<00:01:47.670> really<00:01:48.240> good<00:01:48.420> when<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.810> played<00:01:49.170> with<00:01:49.259> him<00:01:49.409> on

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
is really good when I played with him on

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.380 
is really good when I played with him on
fear<00:01:49.740> before<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.250> was<00:01:50.340> really<00:01:50.579> good<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.119> then

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
fear before it was really good and then

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.600 
fear before it was really good and then
the<00:01:52.079> only<00:01:52.409> downside<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.159> they<00:01:53.430> have<00:01:53.579> a

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
the only downside is that they have a

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.520 
the only downside is that they have a
new<00:01:53.850> bottom<00:01:54.119> Lane<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.780> synergy<00:01:55.170> might<00:01:55.380> not

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
new bottom Lane so the synergy might not

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.560 
new bottom Lane so the synergy might not
be<00:01:55.680> there<00:01:55.860> at<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.070> start<00:01:56.130> but<00:01:56.549> hopefully<00:01:57.450> they

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
be there at the start but hopefully they

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.850 
be there at the start but hopefully they
can<00:01:57.630> pull<00:01:57.899> through<00:01:58.110> together<00:01:58.229> later<00:01:58.710> than

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
can pull through together later than

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.740 
can pull through together later than
soon<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.430> if<00:01:59.729> you're<00:01:59.909> facing<00:02:00.149> something<00:02:00.479> like

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
soon so if you're facing something like

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.260 
soon so if you're facing something like
that<00:02:00.930> maybe<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.259> new<00:02:01.619> bottom<00:02:01.950> Lane<00:02:02.159> but<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.700> scary

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
that maybe a new bottom Lane but a scary

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.870 
that maybe a new bottom Lane but a scary
jungle<00:02:03.630> ER<00:02:03.840> would<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.530> guys<00:02:04.710> put<00:02:05.130> more<00:02:05.490> effort

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
jungle ER would you guys put more effort

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.999 
jungle ER would you guys put more effort
into<00:02:06.060> Ward's<00:02:06.810> or<00:02:06.960> vision<00:02:07.350> control<00:02:07.530> just<00:02:07.860> so

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
into Ward's or vision control just so

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.229 
into Ward's or vision control just so
you<00:02:08.069> don't<00:02:08.340> have<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.610> worry<00:02:08.789> about<00:02:08.910> anyone

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
you don't have to worry about anyone

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.960 
you don't have to worry about anyone
messing<00:02:09.750> up<00:02:09.869> your<00:02:10.050> tubers<00:02:10.770> 2<00:02:10.950> i'm<00:02:11.730> pretty

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
messing up your tubers 2 i'm pretty

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
messing up your tubers 2 i'm pretty
confident<00:02:12.330> in<00:02:12.450> our<00:02:12.540> vision

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
confident in our vision

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.540 
confident in our vision
right<00:02:13.170> now<00:02:13.290> that<00:02:13.590> we<00:02:13.890> will<00:02:14.070> be<00:02:14.280> able<00:02:14.310> to

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
right now that we will be able to

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.730 
right now that we will be able to
counteract<00:02:15.150> what<00:02:15.420> smithy<00:02:15.810> does<00:02:15.960> for<00:02:16.200> sure<00:02:16.230> but

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
counteract what smithy does for sure but

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.730 
counteract what smithy does for sure but
i<00:02:17.430> can<00:02:17.910> probably<00:02:18.120> rely<00:02:18.780> on<00:02:18.930> dexter<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.470> shut

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
i can probably rely on dexter to shut

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.040 
i can probably rely on dexter to shut
basically<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:20.640> we<00:02:21.000> should<00:02:21.030> be<00:02:21.240> okay<00:02:21.450> now<00:02:21.660> you

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
basically so we should be okay now you

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
bottom line is doing much more then

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.120 
bottom line is doing much more then
lastly<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.080> split<00:02:46.320> before<00:02:46.470> definitely

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
lastly and the split before definitely

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.390 
lastly and the split before definitely
probably<00:02:47.490> because<00:02:48.210> I<00:02:48.600> enjoy<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.920> new<00:02:50.070> support

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
probably because I enjoy the new support

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.790 
probably because I enjoy the new support
changes<00:02:50.730> much<00:02:50.910> more<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.660> can<00:02:51.870> really<00:02:52.110> put

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
changes much more and I can really put

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.530 
changes much more and I can really put
out<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.010> damage<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.430> that's<00:02:53.610> more<00:02:54.000> fun<00:02:54.210> for

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
out the damage and that's more fun for

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.110 
out the damage and that's more fun for
me<00:02:54.600> but<00:02:55.320> in<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:56.340> NA<00:02:56.550> scene<00:02:56.760> right<00:02:56.940> now<00:02:56.970> the

me but in the NA scene right now the
bottom<00:02:57.330> lanes<00:02:57.600> is<00:02:57.810> probably<00:02:58.880> for<00:02:59.880> bottom

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
bottom lanes is probably for bottom
