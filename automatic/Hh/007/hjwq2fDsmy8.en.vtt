right now it's worth about 260 life I

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.240 
right now it's worth about 260 life I
would<00:02:28.880> say<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.900> what<00:02:30.020> do<00:02:30.080> y'all<00:02:30.260> want<00:02:30.290> we<00:02:31.220> owe

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
would say and what do y'all want we owe

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.960 
would say and what do y'all want we owe
to<00:02:31.490> 85<00:02:32.330> also<00:02:33.020> you're<00:02:33.140> pretty<00:02:33.320> close<00:02:33.620> okay<00:02:34.520> and

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
to 85 also you're pretty close okay and

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.630 
to 85 also you're pretty close okay and
is<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.480> underwater<00:02:36.020> due<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.860> just<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.370> shift

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
is the underwater due to just the shift

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.640 
is the underwater due to just the shift
in<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:37.880> economy<00:02:38.030> or<00:02:38.630> was<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.320> due<00:02:39.500> to

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
in the economy or was it due to

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.380 
in the economy or was it due to
something<00:02:39.920> particular<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.670> that<00:02:40.850> condo

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
something particular to that condo

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.640 
something particular to that condo
project<00:02:41.840> or<00:02:41.960> area<00:02:42.290> I<00:02:43.180> think<00:02:44.530> generally<00:02:45.530> this

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
project or area I think generally this

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.650 
project or area I think generally this
carry<00:02:46.040> that<00:02:46.190> we<00:02:46.310> live<00:02:46.490> in<00:02:46.520> holds<00:02:47.120> have<00:02:47.510> been

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
carry that we live in holds have been

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.390 
carry that we live in holds have been
holding<00:02:47.960> its<00:02:48.110> value<00:02:48.200> well<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:48.980> I<00:02:49.040> think<00:02:49.250> it's

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
holding its value well and I think it's

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.190 
holding its value well and I think it's
generally<00:02:49.670> just<00:02:50.060> because<00:02:50.390> of<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.630> economy

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
generally just because of the economy

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.930 
generally just because of the economy
okay<00:02:51.500> so<00:02:51.680> it's<00:02:51.920> recovering<00:02:52.430> then<00:02:52.670> pretty

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
okay so it's recovering then pretty

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.970 
okay so it's recovering then pretty
quickly<00:02:53.030> you're<00:02:53.660> starting<00:02:53.990> to<00:02:54.110> see<00:02:54.260> it

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
quickly you're starting to see it

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.530 
quickly you're starting to see it
probably<00:02:55.340> dropped<00:02:55.580> further<00:02:55.910> than<00:02:56.210> this<00:02:56.330> and

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
probably dropped further than this and

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.940 
probably dropped further than this and
you've<00:02:56.630> already<00:02:56.780> recovered<00:02:57.410> a<00:02:57.470> lot<00:02:57.680> of<00:02:57.800> your

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
you've already recovered a lot of your

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.970 
you've already recovered a lot of your
value<00:02:58.340> right<00:02:59.020> yes<00:03:00.020> so<00:03:00.440> how<00:03:00.560> long<00:03:00.710> do<00:03:00.830> you<00:03:00.890> think

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
value right yes so how long do you think

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.770 
value right yes so how long do you think
before<00:03:01.130> it's<00:03:01.460> right<00:03:01.640> side<00:03:01.820> up<00:03:04.270> it's<00:03:05.270> hard<00:03:05.630> to

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
before it's right side up it's hard to

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.150 
before it's right side up it's hard to
tell<00:03:05.960> get<00:03:06.200> maybe<00:03:06.470> five<00:03:06.830> years<00:03:06.860> oh<00:03:07.460> no<00:03:08.740> no<00:03:09.740> way

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
tell get maybe five years oh no no way

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.550 
tell get maybe five years oh no no way
I<00:03:10.190> mean<00:03:10.580> it's<00:03:11.090> come<00:03:11.330> back<00:03:11.360> a<00:03:11.540> whole<00:03:11.840> lot<00:03:12.080> in<00:03:12.410> the

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
I mean it's come back a whole lot in the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.660 
I mean it's come back a whole lot in the
last<00:03:12.740> 18<00:03:13.160> months<00:03:13.960> well<00:03:14.960> I<00:03:15.110> I<00:03:15.410> guess<00:03:15.860> that's<00:03:16.280> why

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
last 18 months well I I guess that's why

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.900 
last 18 months well I I guess that's why
I<00:03:16.700> yield<00:03:17.120> to<00:03:17.330> you<00:03:17.480> I<00:03:17.510> don't<00:03:18.050> I<00:03:18.490> would<00:03:19.490> that<00:03:19.730> was

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
you owe on the land a hundred and twenty

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.530 
you owe on the land a hundred and twenty
and<00:06:24.960> what<00:06:25.740> is<00:06:25.830> it<00:06:25.950> on<00:06:26.040> the<00:06:26.130> market<00:06:26.430> for<00:06:27.980> 40,000

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.540 
and what is it on the market for 40,000

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.850 
and what is it on the market for 40,000
40,000<00:06:30.540> yes<00:06:31.350> what<00:06:31.919> happened<00:06:32.870> that's<00:06:33.870> is<00:06:34.350> is

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
40,000 yes what happened that's is is

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.420 
40,000 yes what happened that's is is
the<00:06:35.130> area<00:06:35.520> that<00:06:36.140> the<00:06:37.140> land<00:06:37.410> is<00:06:37.590> in

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
the area that the land is in

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.930 
the area that the land is in
and<00:06:38.550> I<00:06:39.050> suppose<00:06:40.070> these<00:06:41.070> banks<00:06:41.580> the<00:06:41.790> banks

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
and I suppose these banks the banks

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.710 
and I suppose these banks the banks
aren't<00:06:42.360> offering<00:06:43.230> loans<00:06:43.710> anymore<00:06:44.400> for<00:06:45.000> land

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 
aren't offering loans anymore for land

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.700 
aren't offering loans anymore for land
so<00:06:46.530> people<00:06:47.040> are<00:06:47.190> having<00:06:47.220> to<00:06:47.930> come<00:06:48.930> full<00:06:49.470> out

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:49.710 
so people are having to come full out

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.670 
so people are having to come full out
either<00:06:50.100> with<00:06:50.370> cash<00:06:50.670> or<00:06:51.060> a<00:06:51.600> significant<00:06:52.470> amount

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 
either with cash or a significant amount

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.470 
either with cash or a significant amount
of<00:06:52.860> cash<00:06:53.100> to<00:06:53.370> be<00:06:53.490> able<00:06:53.580> to<00:06:53.760> put<00:06:54.000> down<00:06:54.240> on<00:06:54.450> a

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:54.480 
of cash to be able to put down on a

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.600 
of cash to be able to put down on a
piece<00:06:54.690> of<00:06:54.720> land<00:06:54.990> so<00:06:55.650> on<00:06:55.980> that<00:06:56.190> supposition

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:56.610 
piece of land so on that supposition

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.550 
piece of land so on that supposition
what<00:06:57.090> your<00:06:57.300> what<00:06:57.510> your<00:06:57.690> theory<00:06:57.900> is<00:06:58.200> is<00:06:58.410> that

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 
what your what your theory is is that

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.800 
what your what your theory is is that
all<00:06:58.800> land<00:06:59.130> in<00:06:59.280> America<00:06:59.790> has<00:07:00.000> dropped<00:07:00.270> 80

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810 
all land in America has dropped 80

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.900 
all land in America has dropped 80
percent<00:07:01.350> in<00:07:01.440> value<00:07:01.490> and<00:07:02.490> that's<00:07:02.670> absolutely

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:02.910 
percent in value and that's absolutely

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:04.160 
percent in value and that's absolutely
ludicrous

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.170 
ludicrous

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.590 
ludicrous
no<00:07:04.620> no<00:07:04.830> that's<00:07:05.070> that<00:07:05.490> I<00:07:05.790> wasn't<00:07:06.030> saying<00:07:06.420> that

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 
no no that's that I wasn't saying that

loans for dry land for all and have

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.890 
loans for dry land for all and have
dried<00:07:17.310> up<00:07:17.340> somewhat<00:07:17.970> it's<00:07:18.150> very<00:07:18.360> difficult<00:07:18.750> to

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:18.900 
dried up somewhat it's very difficult to

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.480 
dried up somewhat it's very difficult to
get<00:07:19.020> a<00:07:19.050> loan<00:07:19.230> I<00:07:19.440> agree<00:07:19.680> with<00:07:19.830> you<00:07:19.950> on<00:07:20.010> that<00:07:20.070> but

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.490 
get a loan I agree with you on that but

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:21.830 
get a loan I agree with you on that but
that's<00:07:20.610> not<00:07:20.820> what<00:07:20.970> caused<00:07:21.150> this<00:07:21.390> value<00:07:21.720> to

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 
that's not what caused this value to

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.250 
that's not what caused this value to
drop<00:07:22.020> this<00:07:22.230> far<00:07:22.550> well<00:07:23.550> then<00:07:24.150> that's<00:07:24.780> the<00:07:25.020> only

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:25.260 
drop this far well then that's the only

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.740 
drop this far well then that's the only
thing<00:07:25.470> that<00:07:25.590> I<00:07:25.620> thought<00:07:25.920> of<00:07:26.130> and<00:07:26.540> so<00:07:27.540> there's

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:27.750 
thing that I thought of and so there's

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.360 
thing that I thought of and so there's
something<00:07:28.050> structurally<00:07:28.890> wrong<00:07:29.040> with<00:07:29.250> that

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:29.370 
something structurally wrong with that

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.770 
something structurally wrong with that
particular<00:07:29.820> neighborhood<00:07:30.060> if<00:07:30.480> that's<00:07:30.630> all

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:30.780 
particular neighborhood if that's all

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.840 
particular neighborhood if that's all
