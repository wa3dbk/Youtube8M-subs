00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
notice one last thing there's like no

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.370 
notice one last thing there's like no
liquid<00:02:26.930> pooling<00:02:27.580> here<00:02:28.580> see<00:02:29.300> that<00:02:29.480> liquid

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
liquid pooling here see that liquid

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.360 
liquid pooling here see that liquid
liquid<00:02:30.890> no<00:02:31.430> liquid<00:02:31.790> so<00:02:32.480> number<00:02:32.870> one<00:02:33.220> it<00:02:34.220> got

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
liquid no liquid so number one it got

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.199 
liquid no liquid so number one it got
dried<00:02:34.610> out<00:02:34.790> faster<00:02:35.239> and<00:02:35.590> thus<00:02:36.590> s<00:02:36.860> is

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
dried out faster and thus s is

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.440 
dried out faster and thus s is
completely<00:02:38.209> opposite<00:02:38.600> number<00:02:39.320> two<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:41.120> juice

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
completely opposite number two the juice

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.210 
completely opposite number two the juice
is<00:02:41.660> maintained<00:02:42.170> inside<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.620> meat<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:43.040> this

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
is maintained inside the meat and this

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.729 
is maintained inside the meat and this
test<00:02:43.459> is<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:43.670> success<00:02:44.200> so<00:02:45.200> let's<00:02:45.380> give<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.650> try

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
test is a success so let's give it a try

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.210 
test is a success so let's give it a try

putting ice water in that burger made it

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.509 
putting ice water in that burger made it
more<00:03:57.239> moist<00:03:57.439> but<00:03:58.439> the<00:03:58.709> flip<00:03:58.980> these<00:03:59.189> are<00:03:59.400> more

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
more moist but the flip these are more

flavorful<00:04:00.060> that<00:04:00.720> add<00:04:00.900> more<00:04:01.079> moisture<00:04:01.609> who

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
flavorful that add more moisture who

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:03.800 
flavorful that add more moisture who
would<00:04:02.700> have<00:04:02.790> thought<00:04:02.879> that<00:04:02.939> I<00:04:03.389> didn't<00:04:03.689> see

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
would have thought that I didn't see

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:04.569 
would have thought that I didn't see
that<00:04:03.840> coming

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
that coming

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:08.599 
that coming
all<00:04:05.579> right<00:04:06.169> that's<00:04:07.169> more<00:04:07.530> moist<00:04:07.799> it<00:04:08.129> does<00:04:08.310> work

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
all right that's more moist it does work

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.719 
all right that's more moist it does work
but<00:04:09.389> it<00:04:09.479> doesn't<00:04:09.629> many<00:04:09.870> flavor<00:04:10.079> so<00:04:10.549> realize<00:04:11.549> I

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:11.729 
but it doesn't many flavor so realize I

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:13.280 
but it doesn't many flavor so realize I
didn't<00:04:11.909> put<00:04:12.030> anything<00:04:12.209> in<00:04:12.329> the<00:04:12.449> meat<00:04:12.629> I<00:04:12.930> just

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
didn't put anything in the meat I just

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.420 
didn't put anything in the meat I just
put<00:04:13.379> a<00:04:13.409> little<00:04:13.470> seasoning<00:04:13.919> on<00:04:13.979> the<00:04:14.069> outside

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
put a little seasoning on the outside

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.939 
put a little seasoning on the outside

meat you may put onions and you mean all

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.469 
meat you may put onions and you mean all
that<00:04:19.109> stuff<00:04:19.349> so<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:20.280> test<00:04:20.519> does<00:04:20.729> work<00:04:21.030> the

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
that stuff so the test does work the

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.570 
that stuff so the test does work the
patty<00:04:21.840> does<00:04:22.229> get<00:04:22.470> more<00:04:22.620> moist<00:04:22.919> if<00:04:23.159> you<00:04:23.220> put<00:04:23.400> ice

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
patty does get more moist if you put ice

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.719 
patty does get more moist if you put ice
water<00:04:23.880> in<00:04:24.060> it<00:04:24.210> just<00:04:24.900> like<00:04:25.169> like<00:04:25.919> it's<00:04:26.340> like<00:04:26.430> two

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
water in it just like like it's like two

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.420 
water in it just like like it's like two
tablespoons<00:04:27.389> I<00:04:27.510> think<00:04:27.750> per<00:04:27.960> pound<00:04:28.320> is<00:04:28.650> all<00:04:29.280> you

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
tablespoons I think per pound is all you

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.189 
tablespoons I think per pound is all you
need<00:04:29.669> so<00:04:29.880> if<00:04:29.940> you're<00:04:30.060> mixing<00:04:30.360> it<00:04:30.479> up<00:04:30.630> throw<00:04:31.080> the

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
need so if you're mixing it up throw the
