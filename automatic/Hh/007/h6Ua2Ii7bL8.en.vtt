00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.830
 and 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.129
 hello to all today a little 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.320
 video to present you the art book or 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.199
 sketchbook doom berthod ramos titled 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.660
 soberly humberto ramos presents my 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.839
 bad volume 1 so what is that 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.519
 it's edited by brand studio and 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.790
 his outings on the occasion of the comic-con 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:56.579
 of san diego 2013 we have fifty six 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.530
 color pages showing sketches 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.350
 preparatory work of the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.080
 commissions or covers 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.610
 combertault ramos could do at marvel 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.310
 so already on the front page it's signed 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.170
 by the artist what is not nothing 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.150
 is going to have a lot of spider man in a 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.070
 first time since he has a lot 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.780
 worked on spider man these last 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.030
 time if you bought the monthly 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.409
 at panini comics there are things that 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.030
 you will find so it is rather 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.070
 nice because there the format is good 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.200
 bigger so there is black and white 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.430
 there is suddenly their ca for example you 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.590
 know it was a cover on 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.689
 at panini comics the spiderman 700 a 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.469
 little black and white spider men 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:41.189
 besides the carnage of the sketches 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:42.749
 preparatory and then then of course 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.619
 we have other things there you see we 

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:47.490
 went from both poles a bit wrong so 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.649
 there are still a lot of things 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.689
 it looks nice 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.420
 there are a lot of big palissy and the 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.170
 gambia t sneijder Romanian hulk and 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.789
 Wolverine 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.130
 so I really like the characters 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:04.460
 in full page on a white background a captain 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.889
 america on one side black hat on the other 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.690
 we have the commissions it's very nice 

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:13.290
 to have put all the commissions nahd 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.400
 very successful trunk there too we share 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:22.080
 still sure of the commission I guess 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:25.709
 the little emma frost a phoenix date paul 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.290
 and his friends so there is still no 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.000
 bad things there is diversity 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.910
 it's very well drawn it allows to 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.590
 see a little the talent of the artist the 56 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.080
 pages so obviously it spoils very 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.230
 quick 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.140
 the price is 35 euros because it is 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.820
 actually signed on pulse art on 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.580
 internet you can search on amazon 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.610
 so it may sound a little expensive but 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.410
 if you are fans of the dark artist because 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.360
 it's worth it there will probably be a 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.040
 volume 2 since mark evolves so 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.900
 maybe next year maybe 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.140
 before it's a good product 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.940
 for sure it's a bit expensive but 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.500
 it's reserved for true liberto fans 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.450
 ramos there are still beautiful 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.810
 boards and then nothing but the format the 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.580
 hard deliver it's a quality book 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.530
 it's a beautiful book so we'll say that if 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.700
 you're interested in seeing this at the pub 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.680
 darts and 35 euros 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.780
 and this is the new stadium look us 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.500
 berthod ramos here we meet again for 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.150
