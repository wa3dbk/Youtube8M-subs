explain how I go from a lychee where I
just<00:00:26.210> have<00:00:26.450> a<00:00:26.480> melody<00:00:26.990> and<00:00:27.200> chord<00:00:28.160> symbols<00:00:28.550> and

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
just have a melody and chord symbols and

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.170 
just have a melody and chord symbols and
go<00:00:29.689> to<00:00:29.750> an<00:00:30.619> arrangement<00:00:31.040> where<00:00:31.400> I've<00:00:31.759> got

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
go to an arrangement where I've got

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.100 
go to an arrangement where I've got
nicely<00:00:33.010> voiced<00:00:34.010> chords<00:00:34.550> how<00:00:35.270> what<00:00:35.810> are<00:00:35.930> some

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
nicely voiced chords how what are some

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.060 
nicely voiced chords how what are some
of<00:00:36.200> the<00:00:36.290> things<00:00:36.500> that<00:00:36.590> I'm<00:00:36.740> thinking<00:00:36.890> about

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
of the things that I'm thinking about

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.830 
of the things that I'm thinking about
what<00:00:37.370> I'm<00:00:37.490> doing<00:00:37.820> that<00:00:37.850> and<00:00:38.180> whenever<00:00:38.660> I<00:00:38.720> have

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
what I'm doing that and whenever I have

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.050 
what I'm doing that and whenever I have
a<00:00:38.870> dominant<00:00:39.290> chord<00:00:39.470> I<00:00:39.650> always<00:00:40.190> automatically

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.060 
a dominant chord I always automatically

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.690 
a dominant chord I always automatically
think<00:00:41.300> of<00:00:41.390> upper<00:00:41.660> structure<00:00:41.930> triads<00:00:42.700> upper

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
think of upper structure triads upper

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.000 
think of upper structure triads upper
structure<00:00:43.940> triads<00:00:44.420> are<00:00:44.780> triads<00:00:45.290> that<00:00:45.380> have<00:00:45.680> at

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
structure triads are triads that have at

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.790 
structure triads are triads that have at
least<00:00:46.070> one<00:00:47.050> tension<00:00:48.050> in<00:00:48.260> them

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
least one tension in them

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.979 
least one tension in them
usually<00:00:49.579> over<00:00:49.879> a<00:00:50.030> dominant<00:00:50.539> chord<00:00:50.660> they<00:00:50.809> don't

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
usually over a dominant chord they don't

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:52.360 
usually over a dominant chord they don't
always<00:00:51.289> have<00:00:51.559> to<00:00:51.649> be<00:00:51.739> used<00:00:51.890> over<00:00:52.190> a<00:00:52.219> done

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
always have to be used over a done

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.779 
always have to be used over a done
record<00:00:52.789> but<00:00:53.750> they<00:00:54.140> usually<00:00:54.559> are<00:00:54.980> used<00:00:55.430> over<00:00:55.670> a

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
record but they usually are used over a

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.069 
record but they usually are used over a
dominant<00:00:56.120> chord<00:00:56.239> they<00:00:56.420> work<00:00:56.570> best<00:00:56.840> or

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
dominant chord they work best or

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.250 
dominant chord they work best or
dominant<00:00:57.530> chords<00:00:57.789> there's<00:00:58.789> five<00:00:59.329> standard

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260

into<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:04.820> tune<00:01:05.089> I<00:01:05.480> played<00:01:06.380> it<00:01:07.240> Roboto

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
into the tune I played it Roboto

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.640 
into the tune I played it Roboto
without<00:01:08.690> out<00:01:09.110> of<00:01:09.320> time<00:01:09.680> and<00:01:11.350> with<00:01:12.350> that<00:01:12.530> in

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
without out of time and with that in

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.230 
without out of time and with that in
mind<00:01:12.680> I<00:01:14.320> wanted<00:01:15.320> to<00:01:15.560> keep<00:01:15.740> it<00:01:16.210> light<00:01:17.210> for

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
mind I wanted to keep it light for

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.499 
mind I wanted to keep it light for
voicings<00:01:17.869> light<00:01:18.110> so<00:01:18.259> I<00:01:18.350> mostly<00:01:19.180> voiced<00:01:20.180> these

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
voicings light so I mostly voiced these

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.569 
voicings light so I mostly voiced these
chords<00:01:20.960> with<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.650> rootless<00:01:21.950> voicings<00:01:22.400> you

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
chords with the rootless voicings you

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:24.069 
chords with the rootless voicings you
see<00:01:22.759> here<00:01:23.030> I<00:01:23.060> go<00:01:23.270> to<00:01:23.329> room<00:01:23.479> this<00:01:23.600> voicing<00:01:23.990> in

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
see here I go to room this voicing in

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.249 
see here I go to room this voicing in

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
remember how walking bassline works it's

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.649 
remember how walking bassline works it's
kind<00:01:33.350> of<00:01:33.409> like<00:01:33.560> improv<00:01:34.009> in<00:01:34.310> that<00:01:35.060> we<00:01:35.210> want<00:01:35.329> core

it's<00:01:53.830> very<00:01:54.040> nice<00:01:54.280> to<00:01:54.520> get<00:01:54.670> this<00:01:55.470> chromatic

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
it's very nice to get this chromatic

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.670 
it's very nice to get this chromatic

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
do chromatic approaches and that's

the arrangement and then try to use some

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.920 
the arrangement and then try to use some
of<00:02:24.310> these<00:02:24.370> techniques<00:02:24.580> in<00:02:25.030> your<00:02:25.209> own<00:02:25.390> climbing

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
of these techniques in your own climbing

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.140 
of these techniques in your own climbing
in<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.050> practice<00:02:26.410> sessions<00:02:26.709> I've

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
in the practice sessions I've

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.370 
in the practice sessions I've
demonstrated<00:02:28.150> how<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:28.720> use<00:02:28.870> some<00:02:29.170> of<00:02:29.260> these

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
demonstrated how to use some of these

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.040 
demonstrated how to use some of these
over<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.400> different<00:02:30.700> tune<00:02:31.030> which<00:02:31.300> you<00:02:31.480> can<00:02:31.630> you

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
over a different tune which you can you

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.400 
over a different tune which you can you
can<00:02:33.060> take<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.090> look<00:02:34.239> at<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.660> play<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:35.020> one<00:02:35.230> as

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
can take a look at and play that one as

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.240 
can take a look at and play that one as
well<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:36.010> then<00:02:36.190> take<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:37.170> try<00:02:38.170> at<00:02:38.530> using<00:02:39.010> these

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
well and then take a try at using these

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.510 
well and then take a try at using these
techniques<00:02:39.670> over<00:02:40.150> a<00:02:40.180> tune<00:02:40.480> of<00:02:40.600> your<00:02:40.630> choice<00:02:41.520> so

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
techniques over a tune of your choice so

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.900 
techniques over a tune of your choice so
have<00:02:42.670> fun<00:02:42.940> playing<00:02:43.239> this<00:02:43.390> arrangement
