00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.359
 hello to all so today I'm going 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.820
 show you how the cvo skates 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.540
 correctly so as you see it 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.630
 here I have both skates in 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.590
 lace and the other which just waiting for 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.590
 my explications 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.099
 so I'll I'll start soon 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.779
 the boot finally I explained you 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.960
 so so you see very well so that 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.450
 these crusaders so for the c for 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.270
 already start to have your dough your 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.460
 feet be well maintained 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.710
 you have to be very careful about maintaining 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.079
 of the boot not what I call to 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.760
 vote in this little this party but 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.969
 especially the foot not the coward name 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.760
 finally the foot so under fact 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.770
 be careful that the laces one is not 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.870
 not too relaxed should it be good 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.329
 tight but not as far as that 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.760
 it completely crushes the foot so 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.350
 so that's game so far normally he 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.960
 there are not too many problems 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.210
 it is at the level of everything that is 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.540
 hook there all we see that it gets 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.689
 spoiled 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.360
 so yes so that's it I specify it is 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.549
 skates are a little more in quotation marks 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.320
 experienced second that offers you 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.590
 I usually propose them 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.590
 rinks 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:27.330
 but that does not prevent me from 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.020
 perfectly forget his hooks 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.110
 do not wear them out 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.720
 what am I going to do besides so 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:38.090
 let's start after having tight 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:42.979
 your boots you make a knot 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.970
 as is if you then shoot 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.670
 it is surely the most 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.009
 important in the skate wise one does not 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.009
 never have her skates so 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:02:02.180
 so we're never tired of basic up 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:06.800
 but from top to bottom and with fine curls 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.540
 so that's something to know 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:14.430
 batum we do not know it in consciousness 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:18.120
 now roussel so hop the knot of 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.800
 as low have made the same loop here 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.210
 tech 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:29.310
 So we meet we always pours in 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:32.400
 up and down we cross again and that's it for 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.000
 that you have you arrive at the top this 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.150
 that I advise you to do is to 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.320
 never do the last hook 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.610
 just because it's going to be 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.460
 far too tight at the 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.990
 ankle and that's it so you'll have 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.340
 you start to have pain in your feet 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.340
 so I advise you not to 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.780
 do you do a knot and if you 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.020
 stay here it's instead of wrapping them up 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:03:01.500
 around you always go down again from 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:03.290
 up and down like this to stop you 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.260
 you want me I'm leaving was back to 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:11.670
 second one makes a knot and then 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.989
 you just do a loop here I 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.380
 advise you to do a double not this 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:22.290
 that I do lyon because like that 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.489
 it's just about being secure 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.080
 did not squeeze it too much because after that it's 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.850
 really very hard to remove it and 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.500
 especially a golden rule if I can 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.080
 call it like that never knows it 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.690
 your skates with gloves because you 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.239
 have no hold of the laces and this 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.580
 will finally be it will be terrible 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.160
 you will be able to pass correctly 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.250
 here is I hope this video has you 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.080
 ouve to help you and 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.370
 not sick, please let me know if 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.170
 you have any questions 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.170
 thank you very much goodbye
