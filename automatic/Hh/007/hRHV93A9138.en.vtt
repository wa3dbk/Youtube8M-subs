look at the Terra Nova ultra Cruiser now

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.270 
look at the Terra Nova ultra Cruiser now
worth<00:00:12.599> noting<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.170> very<00:00:13.410> similar<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.799> the

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
worth noting this is very similar to the

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.790 
worth noting this is very similar to the
turnover<00:00:14.639> quasar<00:00:15.299> except<00:00:15.870> it's<00:00:16.080> extremely

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
turnover quasar except it's extremely

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.590 
turnover quasar except it's extremely
light<00:00:16.980> weight<00:00:17.010> as<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> different<00:00:18.000> poll<00:00:18.180> system

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
light weight as a different poll system

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.179 
light weight as a different poll system
and<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:18.990> can<00:00:19.080> see<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.260> structure<00:00:19.650> etc<00:00:19.740> is

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
and you can see the structure etc is

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.529 
and you can see the structure etc is
exactly<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.670> same<00:00:20.820> it's<00:00:21.029> just<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.300> lot<00:00:21.510> more

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
exactly the same it's just a lot more

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.029 
exactly the same it's just a lot more
lightweight<00:00:22.050> so<00:00:22.260> obviously<00:00:22.529> if<00:00:22.920> you're

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
looking to do quite a bit of tracking

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.910 
looking to do quite a bit of tracking
obviously<00:00:25.109> don't<00:00:25.199> want<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.500> extra<00:00:25.619> weight

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
obviously don't want that extra weight

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
it little dome ceiling there just to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.080 
it little dome ceiling there just to
make<00:01:04.769> sure<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.949> get<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> utmost<00:01:05.309> size<00:01:05.909> when

you're<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> inside<00:01:06.479> 105<00:01:07.260> centimeters<00:01:07.560> in

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
you're on the inside 105 centimeters in

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.740 
you're on the inside 105 centimeters in
there<00:01:08.100> there<00:01:08.700> were<00:01:08.760> two<00:01:08.790> or<00:01:09.000> three<00:01:09.119> L<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.540> is

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
there there were two or three L it is

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.109 
there there were two or three L it is
nice<00:01:09.960> durable<00:01:10.470> tough<00:01:10.979> nylon<00:01:11.250> it's<00:01:11.820> waterproof

nice durable tough nylon it's waterproof
up<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.360> six<00:01:12.750> thousand<00:01:13.320> millimeters<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:13.979> it

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
up to six thousand millimeters so it

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.899 
up to six thousand millimeters so it
doesn't<00:01:14.220> matter<00:01:14.340> obvious<00:01:14.549> issue<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.850> quite

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
doesn't matter obvious issue and quite

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.070 
doesn't matter obvious issue and quite
wet<00:01:15.150> conditions<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.750> will<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:15.900> able<00:01:15.960> to

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
wet conditions it will be able to

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.899 
wet conditions it will be able to
withstand<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:17.040> fire<00:01:17.310> retardant<00:01:17.820> which

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
withstand it it's fire retardant which

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.340 
withstand it it's fire retardant which
obviously<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> great<00:01:18.420> safety<00:01:18.689> feature<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
obviously a great safety feature and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.350 
obviously a great safety feature and
it's<00:01:19.470> got<00:01:19.710> tape<00:01:19.950> scenes<00:01:20.310> throughout<00:01:20.670> what<00:01:21.270> it
