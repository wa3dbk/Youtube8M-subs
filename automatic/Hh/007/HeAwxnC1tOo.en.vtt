00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
up from Villa to a portal I don't really

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.260 
up from Villa to a portal I don't really
know<00:01:37.470> why<00:01:37.590> Porter<00:01:38.009> would<00:01:38.250> take<00:01:38.490> him<00:01:38.729> when<00:01:39.180> he

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
know why Porter would take him when he

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.969 
know why Porter would take him when he
wasn't<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.869> incredible<00:01:40.079> for<00:01:40.590> Villa<00:01:40.799> last

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
wasn't that incredible for Villa last

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.620 
wasn't that incredible for Villa last
season<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.340> know<00:01:41.369> he<00:01:41.640> was<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.820> Liverpool<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
season I know he was a Liverpool the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.090 
season I know he was a Liverpool the
year<00:01:42.750> before<00:01:42.869> but<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:43.530> seems<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.860> little<00:01:43.890> bit

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
year before but just seems a little bit

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.380 
year before but just seems a little bit
peculiar<00:01:44.430> i'm<00:01:44.549> not<00:01:44.729> sure<00:01:44.909> why<00:01:45.060> but<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.329> a

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
peculiar i'm not sure why but it's a

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.450 
peculiar i'm not sure why but it's a
loan<00:01:45.570> deal<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.990> guess<00:01:46.740> why<00:01:46.920> those<00:01:47.070> transfers

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
loan deal I guess why those transfers

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.130 
loan deal I guess why those transfers
that<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.759> guess<00:01:48.030> can't<00:01:48.329> really<00:01:48.479> go<00:01:48.630> wrong<00:01:48.659> for

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
that I guess can't really go wrong for

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.440 
that I guess can't really go wrong for
Porto<00:01:49.530> why<00:01:50.310> not<00:01:50.460> get<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.640> player<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:50.880> loan<00:01:51.149> if<00:01:51.329> he

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
Porto why not get a player on loan if he

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.760 
Porto why not get a player on loan if he
turns<00:01:51.689> out<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.840> be<00:01:51.930> amazing<00:01:52.200> like<00:01:52.470> almost

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
turns out to be amazing like almost

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.219 
turns out to be amazing like almost
every<00:01:53.159> Porto<00:01:53.490> player<00:01:53.759> does<00:01:54.030> then<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.810> guess<00:01:55.049> all

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
every Porto player does then I guess all

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.289 
every Porto player does then I guess all
good<00:01:55.409> for<00:01:55.530> them<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.680> then<00:01:55.979> boys<00:01:56.219> we<00:01:56.939> have<00:01:57.149> the

but he's made a free million move to
Bournemouth<00:04:23.440> if<00:04:23.590> it's<00:04:23.800> a<00:04:23.830> top<00:04:24.070> signing<00:04:24.370> for

Bournemouth if it's a top signing for

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.010 
Bournemouth if it's a top signing for
form<00:04:24.669> of<00:04:24.820> every<00:04:25.360> time<00:04:25.510> I<00:04:25.570> do<00:04:25.630> one<00:04:25.750> of<00:04:25.900> these

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
form of every time I do one of these

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.510 
form of every time I do one of these
episodes<00:04:26.289> I<00:04:26.530> seem<00:04:26.710> to<00:04:26.860> say<00:04:27.070> boom

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
episodes I seem to say boom

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.890 
episodes I seem to say boom
have<00:04:27.699> done<00:04:27.879> really<00:04:28.150> well<00:04:28.300> with<00:04:28.539> one<00:04:28.690> of<00:04:28.780> their

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
have done really well with one of their

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.969 
have done really well with one of their
sign<00:04:29.080> is<00:04:29.229> and<00:04:29.349> I<00:04:29.379> think<00:04:29.560> they<00:04:29.650> really<00:04:29.949> have

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
sign is and I think they really have

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.040 
sign is and I think they really have
again<00:04:30.789> right<00:04:31.000> here<00:04:31.120> with<00:04:31.300> Tomlin<00:04:31.660> good<00:04:31.900> for

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
again right here with Tomlin good for

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.719 
again right here with Tomlin good for
them<00:04:32.169> is<00:04:32.500> a<00:04:32.560> good<00:04:32.770> sign<00:04:33.009> in<00:04:33.160> it<00:04:33.340> could<00:04:33.520> be<00:04:33.610> one

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
them is a good sign in it could be one

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.189 
them is a good sign in it could be one
of<00:04:33.759> those<00:04:33.879> players<00:04:34.060> as<00:04:34.360> I<00:04:34.660> always<00:04:34.810> say<00:04:34.930> that

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
of those players as I always say that

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.450 
of those players as I always say that
can<00:04:35.379> keep<00:04:35.500> them<00:04:35.680> up<00:04:35.800> they've<00:04:35.979> put<00:04:36.250> a<00:04:36.280> lot<00:04:36.340> of

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
can keep them up they've put a lot of

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.070 
can keep them up they've put a lot of
money<00:04:36.550> in<00:04:36.819> they've<00:04:37.150> got<00:04:37.270> max<00:04:37.479> gradel<00:04:37.750> as<00:04:37.900> well

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
money in they've got max gradel as well

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.770 
money in they've got max gradel as well
I<00:04:38.110> think<00:04:38.229> great<00:04:38.770> great<00:04:39.069> deals<00:04:39.340> indeed<00:04:39.690> next<00:04:40.690> up

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
I think great great deals indeed next up

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.180 
I think great great deals indeed next up
we<00:04:40.870> have<00:04:40.900> big<00:04:41.139> Bobby's<00:04:41.530> and<00:04:41.710> more<00:04:41.860> and<00:04:42.069> last

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
we have big Bobby's and more and last

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.469 
we have big Bobby's and more and last
but<00:04:42.370> my<00:04:42.520> certainly<00:04:42.819> not<00:04:42.940> least<00:04:43.090> as<00:04:43.300> well<00:04:43.330> I

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
but my certainly not least as well I

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.149 
but my certainly not least as well I
think<00:04:43.569> it's<00:04:43.810> a<00:04:43.840> great<00:04:43.960> sign<00:04:44.289> in<00:04:44.470> summary<00:04:44.949> used

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:45.159 
think it's a great sign in summary used

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.290 
think it's a great sign in summary used
to<00:04:45.220> play<00:04:45.370> for<00:04:45.430> bright<00:04:45.699> and<00:04:45.849> right<00:04:45.909> I'm<00:04:46.090> pretty

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
to play for bright and right I'm pretty

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.119 
to play for bright and right I'm pretty
sure<00:04:46.449> he<00:04:46.539> did<00:04:46.720> but<00:04:46.870> it's<00:04:47.470> going<00:04:47.680> back<00:04:47.860> there

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:48.129 
sure he did but it's going back there

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:49.770 
sure he did but it's going back there
they<00:04:48.430> need<00:04:48.639> players<00:04:48.879> like<00:04:49.120> some<00:04:49.300> more<00:04:49.449> I<00:04:49.479> think

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
they need players like some more I think

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.270 
they need players like some more I think
it<00:04:49.870> could<00:04:49.960> be<00:04:50.050> very<00:04:50.080> good<00:04:50.470> signing<00:04:50.800> for<00:04:50.830> them<00:04:51.099> I

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
it could be very good signing for them I

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.249 
it could be very good signing for them I
really<00:04:51.729> do<00:04:51.879> racism<00:04:52.150> or<00:04:52.389> I<00:04:52.449> don't<00:04:52.659> know<00:04:52.720> why<00:04:52.960> but

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
really do racism or I don't know why but

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:54.480 
really do racism or I don't know why but
I<00:04:53.530> just<00:04:53.620> kind<00:04:53.979> of<00:04:54.039> do<00:04:54.220> and<00:04:54.430> I<00:04:54.460> think

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
I just kind of do and I think

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.189 
I just kind of do and I think
championship<00:04:55.180> level<00:04:55.330> at<00:04:55.690> somewhere<00:04:56.050> like

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
championship level at somewhere like

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.230 
championship level at somewhere like
Brighton<00:04:56.470> he<00:04:56.800> should<00:04:57.099> do<00:04:57.400> absolutely

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
Brighton he should do absolutely

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.580 
Brighton he should do absolutely
fantastically<00:04:58.780> so<00:04:58.960> ice<00:04:59.080> players<00:04:59.379> that<00:04:59.560> I

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
fantastically so ice players that I

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.290 
fantastically so ice players that I
really<00:04:59.860> do<00:05:00.009> think<00:05:00.190> he's<00:05:00.639> a<00:05:00.669> top<00:05:00.940> talent<00:05:01.240> but

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
really do think he's a top talent but

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.790 
really do think he's a top talent but
nonetheless<00:05:01.509> boys<00:05:01.900> does<00:05:02.409> he<00:05:02.560> end<00:05:02.680> of<00:05:02.740> this

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
nonetheless boys does he end of this

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.020

episode<00:05:02.919> it<00:05:03.220> was<00:05:03.250> quite<00:05:03.490> a<00:05:03.520> short<00:05:03.849> one<00:05:03.940> in

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030

terms<00:05:04.240> of<00:05:04.360> transfers<00:05:04.750> I<00:05:04.870> think<00:05:05.050> we<00:05:05.139> only<00:05:05.229> had

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
terms of transfers I think we only had

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.439 
terms of transfers I think we only had
nine<00:05:05.590> or<00:05:05.770> so<00:05:05.800> but<00:05:06.490> there<00:05:06.909> was<00:05:07.000> some<00:05:07.150> big<00:05:07.270> ones

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449 
nine or so but there was some big ones
