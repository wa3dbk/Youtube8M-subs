is<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> penalty<00:00:48.020> I'm<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.469> belief<00:00:49.559> that

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
is a penalty I'm of the belief that

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.990 
is a penalty I'm of the belief that
Wolford<00:00:51.480> bony<00:00:51.719> was<00:00:52.170> taken<00:00:53.010> down<00:00:53.190> very<00:00:53.219> easy<00:00:53.789> it

Wolford bony was taken down very easy it
feels<00:00:54.270> like<00:00:54.420> he<00:00:54.870> was<00:00:54.899> playing<00:00:55.379> for<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> Penta

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
feels like he was playing for the Penta

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.939 
feels like he was playing for the Penta
penalty<00:00:56.640> as<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.910> like<00:00:57.120> he<00:00:57.899> was<00:00:57.930> backing<00:00:58.500> up<00:00:58.649> and

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
penalty as in like he was backing up and

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.729 
penalty as in like he was backing up and
really<00:00:59.609> once<00:00:59.850> he<00:00:59.969> felt<00:01:00.210> contacted<00:01:00.989> he<00:01:01.530> fell

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
really once he felt contacted he fell

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.630 
really once he felt contacted he fell
down<00:01:01.920> rather<00:01:02.609> easily<00:01:03.439> and<00:01:04.439> that's<00:01:05.070> that's<00:01:05.460> I

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
down rather easily and that's that's I

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.980 
down rather easily and that's that's I
think<00:01:05.790> that's<00:01:05.970> something<00:01:06.210> filled<00:01:06.570> out<00:01:06.720> really

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
think that's something filled out really

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.780 
think that's something filled out really
noticed<00:01:07.350> uh<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.950> don't<00:01:08.130> get<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.430> very<00:01:08.700> good

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
noticed uh you don't get a very good

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.170 
noticed uh you don't get a very good
shot<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.860> if<00:01:10.860> he's<00:01:11.159> no<00:01:11.580> let's<00:01:11.820> say<00:01:11.939> was

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
shot of it and if he's no let's say was

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.990 
shot of it and if he's no let's say was
he<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.600> few<00:01:12.960> ten<00:01:13.439> yards<00:01:13.860> away<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.340> got<00:01:14.820> good

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
he a few ten yards away and got good

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.880 
he a few ten yards away and got good
view<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.390> then<00:01:15.509> he<00:01:15.540> probably<00:01:15.960> agrees<00:01:16.350> with

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
view of it then he probably agrees with

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.440 
view of it then he probably agrees with
what<00:01:17.040> I'm<00:01:17.159> saying<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.640> well<00:01:17.939> four-point<00:01:18.240> big

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450
