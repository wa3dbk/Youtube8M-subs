Oh<00:00:00.800> YouTube<00:00:01.800> so<00:00:02.669> when<00:00:03.149> I'm<00:00:03.240> making<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.629> music

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
Oh YouTube so when I'm making a music

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.099 
Oh YouTube so when I'm making a music
sometimes<00:00:04.620> I<00:00:04.740> like<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.370> use<00:00:05.520> Ableton<00:00:05.819> Live<00:00:06.180> and

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
sometimes I like to use Ableton Live and

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.250 
sometimes I like to use Ableton Live and
I<00:00:07.170> when<00:00:07.319> Ableton<00:00:07.649> Live<00:00:07.910> you<00:00:08.910> can<00:00:09.230> chop<00:00:10.230> up

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
I when Ableton Live you can chop up

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.009 
I when Ableton Live you can chop up
loops<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:11.059> pitch<00:00:12.059> those<00:00:12.300> individual<00:00:12.750> slices

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
loops and pitch those individual slices

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.480 
loops and pitch those individual slices
up<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.410> down<00:00:14.059> just<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.210> fit<00:00:15.450> just<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.960> fit<00:00:16.139> the

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
up and down just to fit just to fit the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.130 
up and down just to fit just to fit the
to<00:00:17.490> fit<00:00:17.699> those<00:00:17.850> sounds<00:00:18.270> into<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.630> into<00:00:19.050> the

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
to fit those sounds into the into the

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.849 
to fit those sounds into the into the
kick<00:00:19.350> into<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.590> track<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.130> back<00:00:20.359> now<00:00:21.859> if

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
kick into the track of it back now if

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.529 
kick into the track of it back now if
you're<00:00:23.010> using<00:00:23.039> logic<00:00:23.670> that's<00:00:24.060> maybe<00:00:24.240> not<00:00:24.330> as

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
you're using logic that's maybe not as

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.310 
you're using logic that's maybe not as
easy<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.869> do<00:00:26.480> unless<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.660> slice<00:00:27.869> up<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.170> loop

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
easy to do unless you slice up the loop

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.620 
easy to do unless you slice up the loop
and<00:00:28.439> put<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.890> exs24<00:00:29.369> then<00:00:30.000> it's<00:00:30.449> quite

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
and put it to the exs24 then it's quite

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.780 
and put it to the exs24 then it's quite
easy<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.990> do<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.289> way<00:00:31.529> but<00:00:32.460> if<00:00:32.640> you're

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
easy to do it that way but if you're

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.590 
easy to do it that way but if you're
just<00:00:33.030> using<00:00:33.239> raw<00:00:33.899> audio<00:00:35.180> what<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.480> do

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
just using raw audio what you have to do

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.180 
just using raw audio what you have to do
is<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.170> convert<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.710> raw<00:00:38.160> audio

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
is you have to convert the raw audio

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.630 
is you have to convert the raw audio
loop<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.120> an<00:00:39.420> apple<00:00:39.750> loop<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.170> then<00:00:41.070> then<00:00:41.520> you

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
loop to an apple loop and then then you

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.000 
loop to an apple loop and then then you
can<00:00:41.670> slice<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.780> Apple<00:00:42.989> loop<00:00:43.110> up<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.469> get

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
can slice the the Apple loop up and get

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.250 
can slice the the Apple loop up and get
you<00:00:44.160> up<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.340> down<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.520> keyboard<00:00:45.020> so<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.140> all

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
you up and down the keyboard so it all

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.290 
you up and down the keyboard so it all
fit<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.860> mix<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.129> bit<00:00:47.250> better<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.640> what<00:00:48.180> I'm

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
fit in the mix a bit better so what I'm

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.580 
fit in the mix a bit better so what I'm
going<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.450> do<00:00:48.600> they<00:00:49.020> want<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.200> show<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.410> how<00:00:49.530> to

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
going to do they want to show you how to

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.029 
going to do they want to show you how to
use<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.430> Apple<00:00:50.820> loops<00:00:50.910> utility<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:52.379> open<00:00:52.590> up<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
use the Apple loops utility to open up a

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.540 
use the Apple loops utility to open up a
loop<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:54.680> we're<00:00:55.680> going<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.949> put<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> custom

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
loop and we're going to put a custom

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.080 
loop and we're going to put a custom
folder<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.300> our<00:00:57.390> loops<00:00:57.719> library<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.199> logic<00:00:59.090> so

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
folder in our loops library and logic so

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.720 
folder in our loops library and logic so
we<00:01:00.180> can<00:01:00.300> use<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.870> as<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> user<00:01:02.039> at<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.280> later<00:01:02.520> date

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
we can use it as a user at a later date

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.329 
we can use it as a user at a later date
so<00:01:03.170> first<00:01:04.170> what<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.439> need<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.650> do<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.920> open<00:01:05.280> up

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
so first what we need to do is open up

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.830 
so first what we need to do is open up
the<00:01:05.400> loops<00:01:05.850> utility<00:01:08.090> open<00:01:09.090> up<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.299> loop<00:01:10.790> and

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
the loops utility open up a loop and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.910 
the loops utility open up a loop and
what<00:01:12.840> we<00:01:12.930> need<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.110> do<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.439> we<00:01:13.560> need<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.740> make

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
what we need to do is we need to make

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.719 
what we need to do is we need to make
the<00:01:14.070> loop<00:01:14.189> loop<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:14.939> obviously<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:16.610> listen<00:01:17.610> to

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
the loop loop in obviously and listen to

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:27.320 
the loop loop in obviously and listen to
it<00:01:24.170> so<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.200> need<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.530> go<00:01:25.680> here<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.790> here<00:01:27.060> it's

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
it so I need to go here and in here it's

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.910 
it so I need to go here and in here it's
obviously<00:01:27.630> it's<00:01:27.720> got<00:01:27.840> no<00:01:27.960> key<00:01:30.680> you<00:01:31.680> could<00:01:31.799> put

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
obviously it's got no key you could put

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.980 
obviously it's got no key you could put
your<00:01:31.979> name<00:01:32.189> there<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.790> could<00:01:32.970> copyright<00:01:33.750> it

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
your name there you could copyright it

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.710 
your name there you could copyright it
any<00:01:34.530> comments<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.100> want<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.340> put<00:01:35.720> if

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
any comments that you want to put if

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.940 
any comments that you want to put if
you're<00:01:36.900> making<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.200> loop<00:01:37.380> library<00:01:37.829> for

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
you're making a loop library for

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.920 
you're making a loop library for
somebody<00:01:38.250> or<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:39.090> know<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.270> selling<00:01:39.659> model

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
somebody or you know you selling model

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.149 
somebody or you know you selling model
you<00:01:40.049> could<00:01:40.200> put<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.409> collection<00:01:40.590> now<00:01:41.100> you

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
you could put a collection now you

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:48.020 
you could put a collection now you
promote<00:01:41.880> yourself<00:01:44.930> here<00:01:46.040> any<00:01:47.040> add<00:01:47.610> support<00:01:47.970> of

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
promote yourself here any add support of

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.950 
promote yourself here any add support of
the<00:01:48.090> generator<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.630> genre<00:01:49.820> and<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.420> just<00:01:51.659> tag

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
the generator and genre and you just tag

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.280 
the generator and genre and you just tag
that<00:01:52.229> loop<00:01:52.500> as<00:01:52.890> drums<00:01:53.340> drum<00:01:54.299> kit<00:01:54.600> I'm<00:01:54.840> here

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
that loop as drums drum kit I'm here

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.289 
that loop as drums drum kit I'm here
we've<00:01:55.649> just<00:01:55.680> got<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.100> strip<00:01:56.369> descriptors<00:01:57.060> so

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
we've just got the strip descriptors so

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.870 
we've just got the strip descriptors so
in<00:01:57.420> logic<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.930> can<00:01:58.110> search<00:01:58.530> for<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.850> can

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
in logic you can search for you can

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.880 
in logic you can search for you can
search<00:02:00.210> for<00:02:00.360> each<00:02:00.509> one<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.810> these<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
search for each one of these and the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.980 
search for each one of these and the
loop<00:02:02.070> will<00:02:02.219> come<00:02:02.399> up<00:02:02.719> depending<00:02:03.719> on<00:02:03.869> what

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
loop will come up depending on what

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.980 
loop will come up depending on what
you've<00:02:04.170> categorized<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.340> as<00:02:05.369> so

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
you've categorized it as so

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:14.160 
you've categorized it as so
we'll<00:02:07.990> put<00:02:08.700> processed<00:02:11.280> grooving<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:13.750> what<00:02:14.080> we

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
we'll put processed grooving so what we

we'll put processed grooving so what we
need<00:02:14.320> to<00:02:14.410> do<00:02:14.500> now<00:02:14.680> is<00:02:14.740> you<00:02:14.920> just<00:02:15.040> need<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.280> go<00:02:15.400> up

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
need to do now is you just need to go up

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.520 
I've made are in there so as I don't
want<00:03:26.800> it<00:03:26.860> on<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.010> desktop<00:03:27.780> I'll<00:03:28.780> move<00:03:29.290> it<00:03:29.410> to

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
want it on the desktop I'll move it to

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.800 
want it on the desktop I'll move it to
the<00:03:29.620> loops<00:03:29.800> folder<00:03:30.480> so<00:03:31.480> there's<00:03:31.630> only<00:03:31.690> one

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
the loops folder so there's only one

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.870 
the loops folder so there's only one
loop<00:03:32.110> in<00:03:32.230> there<00:03:32.470> so<00:03:33.340> it<00:03:33.430> shouldn't<00:03:33.640> take<00:03:33.850> too

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
loop in there so it shouldn't take too

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.290 
loop in there so it shouldn't take too
long

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
long

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.979

so<00:03:35.140> if<00:03:35.410> I<00:03:35.500> click<00:03:35.739> on<00:03:35.860> the<00:03:35.980> View<00:03:36.160> button<00:03:36.370> again

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
so if I click on the View button again

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.010 
so if I click on the View button again
hopefully<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:39.220> should<00:03:39.340> work<00:03:39.570> click<00:03:40.570> on<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.840> my

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
a few times of drug loops in like this

a few times of drug loops in like this
and<00:04:13.340> if<00:04:13.430> this<00:04:14.420> is<00:04:14.600> what<00:04:14.630> seems<00:04:15.020> to<00:04:15.110> happen<00:04:15.320> I

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:39.800 

have<00:04:21.320> no<00:04:21.590> idea<00:04:21.860> why<00:04:22.070> that's<00:04:22.310> happening

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.560 

I<00:04:40.520> mean<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:41.610> can<00:04:41.760> clearly<00:04:42.000> hear<00:04:42.120> the<00:04:42.420> little

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
I mean you can clearly hear the little

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.910 
I mean you can clearly hear the little
air<00:04:42.840> in<00:04:42.930> there<00:04:43.110> so<00:04:43.350> we're<00:04:43.470> against<00:04:43.740> the

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
air in there so we're against the

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:50.960 
air in there so we're against the
arrangement<00:04:44.370> view<00:04:44.510> ya<00:04:45.510> know<00:04:49.310> what<00:04:50.310> I<00:04:50.340> could<00:04:50.730> do

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
arrangement view ya know what I could do

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:59.020 
arrangement view ya know what I could do
is<00:04:54.500> bounce<00:04:55.500> in<00:04:55.770> place<00:04:57.290> bounce<00:04:58.290> this<00:04:58.530> in<00:04:58.680> place

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
is bounce in place bounce this in place

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.680 
is bounce in place bounce this in place
there<00:05:00.030> we<00:05:00.150> go

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
there we go

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.230 
there we go
but<00:05:01.470> now<00:05:01.650> it's<00:05:01.950> not<00:05:02.100> an<00:05:02.220> audience<00:05:02.370> it's<00:05:02.970> not<00:05:03.180> an

but now it's not an audience it's not an

audio<00:05:06.060> file<00:05:06.330> so<00:05:06.570> what<00:05:07.350> we<00:05:07.470> can<00:05:07.680> do<00:05:07.889> is<00:05:08.160> we<00:05:08.280> can

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
audio file so what we can do is we can

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.900 
audio file so what we can do is we can
alter<00:05:08.700> audio<00:05:09.590> we<00:05:10.590> could<00:05:10.770> open<00:05:11.100> up<00:05:11.370> in<00:05:11.580> Apple

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
alter audio we could open up in Apple

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:22.130 
alter audio we could open up in Apple
loops<00:05:12.060> utility<00:05:18.050> or<00:05:19.050> we<00:05:19.860> could<00:05:20.630> utter<00:05:21.630> loops

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
loops utility or we could utter loops

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.280 
loops utility or we could utter loops
library<00:05:22.700> which<00:05:23.700> would<00:05:23.940> wouldn't<00:05:24.840> put<00:05:25.080> it<00:05:25.110> into

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
library which would wouldn't put it into

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.250 
library which would wouldn't put it into
the<00:05:25.380> folder<00:05:26.030> we'll<00:05:27.030> try<00:05:27.330> adding<00:05:27.840> to<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.080> loops

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
the folder we'll try adding to the loops

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.010 
the folder we'll try adding to the loops
library<00:05:28.740> see<00:05:29.220> it's<00:05:29.460> cooler<00:05:29.760> with<00:05:29.970> a<00:05:30.020> another

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
library see it's cooler with a another

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.620 
library see it's cooler with a another
basic<00:05:31.470> tagging<00:05:31.979> system<00:05:34.970> we'll<00:05:35.970> just<00:05:36.120> click<00:05:36.390> on

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
basic tagging system we'll just click on

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:44.469 
basic tagging system we'll just click on
quickly<00:05:39.169> loop<00:05:40.169> in<00:05:40.380> yeah

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:52.659 

so<00:05:45.169> just<00:05:45.559> create<00:05:46.340> that

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:54.429 

so<00:05:53.240> said<00:05:53.539> there's<00:05:53.719> two<00:05:53.870> ways<00:05:54.050> you<00:05:54.199> can<00:05:54.319> add

00:05:54.429 --> 00:05:54.439 
so said there's two ways you can add

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:55.899 
so said there's two ways you can add
loops<00:05:54.680> to<00:05:54.830> the<00:05:54.860> light<00:05:55.069> but<00:05:55.280> you<00:05:55.310> could<00:05:55.550> use<00:05:55.729> it

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:55.909 
loops to the light but you could use it

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:58.510 
loops to the light but you could use it
you<00:05:56.150> using<00:05:56.539> the<00:05:56.629> Apple<00:05:56.870> loops<00:05:56.960> utility<00:05:57.560> you

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
you using the Apple loops utility you

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.950 
you using the Apple loops utility you
could<00:05:58.699> open<00:05:58.969> the<00:05:59.060> upper<00:05:59.240> loops<00:05:59.419> utility

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
could open the upper loops utility

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.770 
could open the upper loops utility
within<00:06:00.319> logic<00:06:00.590> or<00:06:01.069> you<00:06:01.460> can<00:06:01.639> add<00:06:01.759> loops<00:06:02.030> just

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
within logic or you can add loops just

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.969 
within logic or you can add loops just
by<00:06:03.080> doing<00:06:04.960> by<00:06:05.960> right<00:06:06.169> by<00:06:06.469> going<00:06:06.770> up<00:06:06.860> to<00:06:06.889> the

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 
by doing by right by going up to the

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:09.490 
by doing by right by going up to the
region's<00:06:07.340> menu<00:06:07.669> and<00:06:07.939> saying<00:06:08.360> add<00:06:09.050> loops<00:06:09.349> the

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
region's menu and saying add loops the

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:23.120 
region's menu and saying add loops the
library<00:06:11.080> let's<00:06:12.080> see<00:06:12.289> if<00:06:12.379> that's

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.130 

back<00:06:24.130> in<00:06:24.310> cuc<00:06:25.120> there's<00:06:25.330> an<00:06:25.510> apple<00:06:25.810> loop<00:06:25.930> now

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.140 
back in cuc there's an apple loop now

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.470 
back in cuc there's an apple loop now
and<00:06:26.380> for<00:06:26.470> some<00:06:26.620> reason<00:06:26.950> the<00:06:27.460> the<00:06:28.000> waveforms

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.480 
and for some reason the the waveforms

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.730 
and for some reason the the waveforms
showing<00:06:28.780> up<00:06:28.900> so<00:06:29.140> I<00:06:29.170> don't<00:06:29.440> know<00:06:29.560> whether

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
showing up so I don't know whether

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.470 
showing up so I don't know whether
that's<00:06:29.920> a<00:06:30.130> book<00:06:30.340> with<00:06:30.520> a<00:06:30.850> Z<00:06:31.120> don't<00:06:31.300> know<00:06:31.360> where

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480 
that's a book with a Z don't know where

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.840 
that's a book with a Z don't know where
that's<00:06:31.600> a<00:06:31.690> book<00:06:31.870> with<00:06:32.080> the<00:06:32.230> loops<00:06:33.100> utility<00:06:33.670> or

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:33.850 
that's a book with the loops utility or

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.090 
that's a book with the loops utility or
what<00:06:34.030> so<00:06:34.840> anyway<00:06:35.170> I'll<00:06:35.410> carry<00:06:35.650> on<00:06:35.800> with<00:06:35.920> what<00:06:36.070> I

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100 
what so anyway I'll carry on with what I

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.270 
what so anyway I'll carry on with what I
was<00:06:36.250> gonna<00:06:36.370> do<00:06:36.580> urgently<00:06:36.970> which<00:06:37.720> was<00:06:37.960> to<00:06:38.350> slice

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
was gonna do urgently which was to slice

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.940 
was gonna do urgently which was to slice
this<00:06:39.460> up<00:06:39.670> and<00:06:39.880> pitch<00:06:40.410> individual<00:06:41.410> slices<00:06:41.680> up

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:41.950 
this up and pitch individual slices up

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.270 
this up and pitch individual slices up
and<00:06:42.100> down<00:06:42.250> the<00:06:42.400> keyboard<00:06:43.740> so<00:06:44.740> if<00:06:44.890> we<00:06:45.040> get<00:06:45.160> our

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
and down the keyboard so if we get our

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:53.700 
and down the keyboard so if we get our
scissors<00:06:45.490> tool<00:06:45.880> and<00:06:46.690> quickly<00:06:47.530> just<00:06:52.500> do<00:06:53.500> that

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 
scissors tool and quickly just do that

00:06:53.710 --> 00:07:02.340 
scissors tool and quickly just do that
so<00:06:54.010> you<00:06:54.610> can<00:06:54.730> see<00:06:54.880> now<00:06:55.300> that<00:06:55.330> we've<00:06:55.690> got<00:07:01.350> four

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:02.350 
so you can see now that we've got four

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.920 
so you can see now that we've got four
regions<00:07:02.710> s<00:07:02.920> so<00:07:03.100> we<00:07:03.220> can<00:07:03.400> click<00:07:03.940> on<00:07:04.090> each<00:07:04.450> region

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
regions s so we can click on each region

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.990 
regions s so we can click on each region
we<00:07:05.500> can<00:07:05.650> come<00:07:05.830> here<00:07:05.860> to<00:07:06.190> the<00:07:06.280> inspector<00:07:06.700> and<00:07:06.850> we

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 
we can come here to the inspector and we

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.560 
we can come here to the inspector and we
can<00:07:07.180> just<00:07:07.410> drag<00:07:08.410> up<00:07:08.940> so<00:07:09.940> what<00:07:10.180> we<00:07:10.330> want

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:10.570 
can just drag up so what we want

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.980 
can just drag up so what we want
basically<00:07:11.940> and<00:07:12.940> as<00:07:13.060> I<00:07:13.180> said<00:07:13.240> that<00:07:13.540> would<00:07:13.720> maybe

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:13.990 
basically and as I said that would maybe

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.760 
basically and as I said that would maybe
I<00:07:15.060> would<00:07:16.060> just<00:07:16.090> do<00:07:16.360> this<00:07:16.540> maybe<00:07:16.960> to<00:07:16.990> sit<00:07:17.530> things

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:17.770 
I would just do this maybe to sit things

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.320 
I would just do this maybe to sit things
better<00:07:17.980> in<00:07:18.130> the<00:07:18.160> mix<00:07:18.400> I've<00:07:18.580> got<00:07:18.850> a<00:07:18.880> loop<00:07:19.060> and

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:19.330 
better in the mix I've got a loop and

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.300 
better in the mix I've got a loop and
it's<00:07:19.870> maybe<00:07:20.290> not<00:07:20.380> sitting<00:07:20.770> in<00:07:20.800> the<00:07:20.890> mix<00:07:21.070> a<00:07:21.160> bit

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:21.310 
it's maybe not sitting in the mix a bit

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.790 
it's maybe not sitting in the mix a bit
maybe<00:07:21.550> you<00:07:21.730> know<00:07:21.850> in<00:07:22.350> certain<00:07:23.350> element

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:23.800 
maybe you know in certain element

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.680 
maybe you know in certain element
elements<00:07:24.160> of<00:07:24.220> it<00:07:24.340> maybe<00:07:25.090> need<00:07:25.300> to<00:07:25.330> go<00:07:25.510> up<00:07:25.570> and

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:25.690 
elements of it maybe need to go up and

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.900 
elements of it maybe need to go up and
down<00:07:25.750> it<00:07:25.900> down<00:07:26.380> just<00:07:26.890> maybe<00:07:27.190> for<00:07:27.520> it<00:07:27.610> to<00:07:27.700> sit

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:27.910 
down it down just maybe for it to sit

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.020 
down it down just maybe for it to sit
better<00:07:28.120> in<00:07:28.240> the<00:07:28.300> mix<00:07:28.480> I<00:07:29.160> mean<00:07:30.160> this<00:07:30.490> poses<00:07:30.700> easy

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:31.030 
better in the mix I mean this poses easy

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.120 
better in the mix I mean this poses easy
ways<00:07:31.300> you<00:07:31.510> could<00:07:31.660> just<00:07:31.870> you<00:07:32.080> know<00:07:32.110> slice<00:07:32.980> it

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:33.130 
ways you could just you know slice it

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.670 
ways you could just you know slice it
open<00:07:33.160> put<00:07:33.430> into<00:07:33.580> the<00:07:33.670> XS<00:07:33.970> 24<00:07:34.450> but<00:07:34.660> you<00:07:35.530> know

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 
open put into the XS 24 but you know

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.140 
open put into the XS 24 but you know
sometimes<00:07:36.570> doing<00:07:37.570> different<00:07:38.020> things<00:07:39.150> sparks

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:40.150 
sometimes doing different things sparks

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.580 
sometimes doing different things sparks
you<00:07:40.720> know<00:07:40.840> other<00:07:41.050> creativity<00:07:41.740> so<00:07:42.070> I<00:07:43.500> hope<00:07:44.500> you

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:44.590 
you know other creativity so I hope you

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.230 
you know other creativity so I hope you
got<00:07:44.740> something<00:07:44.950> out<00:07:45.130> of<00:07:45.190> that<00:07:45.340> anyway<00:07:45.670> I

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 
got something out of that anyway I
