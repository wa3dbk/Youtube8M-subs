alike and I actually sucked him because

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.630 
alike and I actually sucked him because
his<00:01:10.080> game<00:01:10.350> plays<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> very<00:01:10.950> entertaining<00:01:11.520> to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
his game plays a very entertaining to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.609 
his game plays a very entertaining to
watch<00:01:11.729> his<00:01:12.510> commentaries<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.049> not<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.439> up

to<00:01:13.799> par<00:01:14.100> but<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.700> think<00:01:15.000> he<00:01:15.180> will<00:01:15.330> improve<00:01:15.720> over

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
to par but I think he will improve over

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.830 
to par but I think he will improve over
time<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.619> i<00:01:17.040> did<00:01:17.400> over<00:01:17.520> time<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.150> dumb<00:01:18.659> he

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
time like i did over time and dumb he

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.210
