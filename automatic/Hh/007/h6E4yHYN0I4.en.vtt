00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 the scientists are now looking for one 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.839
 emergency brake an idea moves into the 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.840
 foreground which until now as a figment of the imagination 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.500
 has a kind of sunscreen for 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.710
 the earth 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.280
 high up in the atmosphere 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.859
 science editor hanna away 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.359
 explains the earth can not be easy 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.670
 put in the shadows if they 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.779
 the sun is burning tirelessly 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.310
 down on her 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.890
 so how could you give her cooling 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.990
 provide, for example, with innumerable 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.929
 tiny particles like little ones 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.080
 play high up in the atmosphere 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.180
 flying around 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.670
 they would turn the sunlight back on 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.100
 thomas says back into the universe 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:49.230
 peter atmospheres chemists at the eth 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:51.660
 Zurich and that this idea is called 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.579
 solaris geo engineering and that you 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.430
 one could know how to work from 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.440
 volcanic eruptions whose ejection can be high 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.030
 up in the atmosphere as sunbathe 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.930
 blogger works and the earth clearly 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.449
 cool 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.010
 maybe that could be imitated 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.570
 by getting out of a plane 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.570
 sunscreen particles in the atmosphere 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.000
 into it would be blowing 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.500
 delicate because the sunscreen could also 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.570
 Access to undesirable results 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.030
 lead to floods and 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.880
 for example many 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.710
 professionals and environmental organizations 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.060
 are the trio engineering therefore very 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.950
 sceptical towards 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.780
 But global warming is always 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.970
 more dramatic and so speak up 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.070
 recently more researchers from the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.840
 sun protection for the earth seriously too 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.600
 investigate for example the 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.390
 IPCC and also the powerful ones 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.829
 National Academy of Sciences of the USA in 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.610
 a new report of the straight 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.799
 has appeared 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.740
 this will make the topic socially acceptable 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.140
 says ken caldeira from university 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:55.829
 Stanford in California on the report 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:57.149
 wrote and that was good too 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.159
 so says the researcher 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.170
 you have to know more about the engineering 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.590
 because it could be highly dangerous 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.600
 his 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.210
 therefore it needs binding 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.770
 international rules and more research 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.940
 The topic is the national academy 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.129
 of sciences 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.280
 she does not just think about simulations in the 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.380
 computer but also shuts down 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.660
 Do not go out in the open air 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.970
 well possible that somewhere soon 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.250
 plane smallest amounts are said to be bloggers 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.430
 into the atmosphere on behalf of the 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.430
 research
