because<00:02:28.159> the<00:02:28.489> lorac<00:02:28.760> Pro<00:02:29.000> palette<00:02:29.030> has

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
because the lorac Pro palette has

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.839 
because the lorac Pro palette has
basically<00:02:29.930> really<00:02:30.590> similar<00:02:31.069> colors<00:02:31.519> to<00:02:31.730> this

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.910 
basically really similar colors to this
one<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:32.420> not<00:02:32.900> only<00:02:33.079> does<00:02:33.319> it<00:02:33.379> have<00:02:33.500> similar

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.920 
one and not only does it have similar
colors<00:02:34.189> but<00:02:34.489> it<00:02:34.579> actually<00:02:34.970> is<00:02:35.060> more<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.659> lorac

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
colors but it actually is more the lorac

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
Pro palette has 60 colors whereas this

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.960

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
one has this one only has 12 colors so

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.550

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
think that just getting the pallets and

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.680 
think that just getting the pallets and
making<00:04:29.520> an<00:04:29.580> investment<00:04:29.940> is<00:04:30.120> worth<00:04:30.330> it<00:04:30.510> because

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
making an investment is worth it because

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.170 
making an investment is worth it because
you<00:04:31.080> use<00:04:31.560> so<00:04:31.830> little<00:04:32.070> de<00:04:32.340> product<00:04:32.700> you<00:04:32.850> get<00:04:32.970> so

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
much color then it's actually worth it

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.580 
much color then it's actually worth it
