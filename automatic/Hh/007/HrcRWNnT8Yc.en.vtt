 Kitten 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.880
 Do you know what day it is today? 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:06.700
 Do not know, right? 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.300
 Why can not you tell the days? 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.740
 You just eat and sleep. 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.380
 IT'S LUBA FAIR! (laughs) 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.640

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.200
 Ooooh, class! All right? I'm Luba ... 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.620

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.620
 Get ready because this is going to be a video ...

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.560
 (gasping not to laugh) (laughs) 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.060
 And how are we walking? 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.360
 towards the end of October 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.680
 I decided to do one more 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.020
 FAVORITES OF THE MONTH! 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.420
 Obviously, one of my favorite things of the month 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.460
 it was this Pikachu fantasy 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.960
 that I won from my birthday friend 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.020
 and it's my birthday in May 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.820
 but she asked for it right, in China, and it takes time 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.900
 so she gave me only this month 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.520
 She's just like that, huh ... it's ... HEAT 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.360
 but it's a lot of fun, gang! 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.160
 Do you want to see if I do this? 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.520
 I'll show you some things now. 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.680
 that I won in my mailbox 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.200

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.520

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.220
 very very much, thank you for all the gifts 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.300

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.660
 I won this wonderful Ash cap 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.300
 that I've been using it during the whole event 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.580
 practically afterwards. 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.520
 I won this little bump here 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.720

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.680
 I got that Pikachu cap 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.760
 riled up 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.820
 There's a bite in here! 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.380
 How sweet! 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.720
 I'm going to do a strip here, class 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.180
 Because it's hot, it's fucking good! 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.360
 (taking off all the clothes ungainly) 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.740
 I won a Charmander Bonnet 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.580
 that he comes with his tail here, class 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.660
 catching fire, oh 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.360
 (TSSSS) 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.320
 I also won umbreon ears 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.840
 I do not know how I'm going to use it. 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.680
 along with them I got a tail 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.780
 of Umbreon too, class, oh 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.620
 Can you stick your pants? 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.080
 Why not?! 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.220
 And I also bought some things on Animextreme 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.940
 as... 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.400
 how about 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.760
 A Charizard Cap 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.000
 Let me see, here 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.500
 Oh, he has. 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.960
 He has the ears 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.500
 And his grin, class 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.000
 And of course he has 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.120
 the tail on fire, oh! 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.400
 (TSSS) 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.120
 Class, this is a lot of the time! 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.200
 But I do not know if you can compete with ... 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.100
 ... a Haunter cap! 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.880
 Class, this one is very amazing! 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.320
 I'm going to spend my money all over 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.180
 in these beanies 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.760
 during my whole life, class 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.940
 Write a review! 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.340
 I bought this Pikachu T-Shirt that makes 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.680
 a parody, I think 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.300
 to the man 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.760

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.780

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.760
 You have no concept! 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.300
 A StormTrooper, Angry Birds Version 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.040
 I've won a lot like this but this one is my favorite! 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.780
 I won two colorful manga from High School of the Dead 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.400
 And High School of the Dead is the only anime 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.480
 that I got to watch the whole after 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.820
 Dragon Ball Z and Pokemon when I was little 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.820
 And just to be 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.380
 IT'S COLORFUL! 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.480
 And it smells good too! 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.920
 (GEM OF PLEASURE) 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.300
 Starting now for the most AMAZING drawings: 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.640
 me and the turmênica Mila, dresses of Pokemon 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.740
 Hey class, how cute! 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:46.600
 the Rogéria 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.140
 ah, and I forgot to mention that the drawing of Rogéria 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.320
 was made by Sofia 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.800
 to Clementine, me, and Pikachu, class 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.700
 designed by Patty 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.160
 It's there in the corner. 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.500
 There is more of this design done here by Julie. 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.780
 There is more of this one drawn by Tom 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.840
 who has me, an Umbreon, and a Pikachu in the corner 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.600
 Tom was the same one that made me the tail. 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.120
 and the ears of Umbreon 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.240
 Now the last gift I have to show you 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.880
 that I won in my mailbox is ... 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.240
 Classy guy 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.740
 What is this one, class? 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.060
 I won from Leonardo, from the house Geek 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.320
 This is to imitate that picture that Youtubers win 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.180
 when they reach 100 thousand subscribers 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.960
 that has a Youtube silver plate 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.340
 but this one says the following: 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.760
 "I could be playing, going to the movies, or watching a TV series ... 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.140
 ... but I'm here, making videos for the internet. " 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.520
 So it's a little money card for people 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.880
 donate money to the Youtubers, class! 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.800
 I found it very creative! 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.560
 And he already gave me $ 5.00, which I do not have the courage to get out of here! 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.400
 Leonardo, I'm sorry, man, but I'm not going to get you out of here! 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.800
 Oh, and just to show the logo "Your Money" 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.120
 and even have the link to share, here 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.420
 I'll share my favorite Iphone cover too 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.480
 that just to warn, it's Squirtle 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.020
 the most beautiful in the world 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.040
 His name is... 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.800
 Flavio! 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.180
 It was the first name that came into my head 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.480
 I just baptized him! 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.500
 I will share with you also my favorite music album of the month 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.700
 Sweet Talker by Jessie J 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.820
 Class, I'm a fan, I'm a fan, Jessie J 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.380
 And Jessie J always has very lively songs 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.700
 which at the same time has very, very, beautiful and meaningful lyrics 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.240
 And my favorite YouTube channel of the month 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.060
 It's from Flavia Calina, class 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.540
 I had seen a video of Flavia for a long, long time, class 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 Then I found out she indicated me in a video of her 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.340
 and I was like, kind of 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.020

 (FAN GIRL HISTÉRICA) 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.260
 If charisma and sympathy took on a human form 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.200
 it would be Flavia Calina! 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.140
 Vlogers should learn more from her, class 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.440
 Not to mention that Baby V is the most beautiful baby EVER! 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.240
 There, i said it! 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.760
 So if you like watching daily vlogs (daily vlogs) 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.740
 Flavia Calina has the best of them all! 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.480
 Only! 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.880
 And last but not least 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.820

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.940
