2004<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.810> he<00:00:25.350> did<00:00:25.590> confirm<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.369> was

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
2004 and he did confirm that that was

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.150 
2004 and he did confirm that that was
not<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.760> typo<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.599> basically<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.529> was<00:00:28.800> back

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
not a typo I basically that was back

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.130 
not a typo I basically that was back
then<00:00:29.490> but<00:00:29.880> they<00:00:30.000> just<00:00:30.210> basically<00:00:30.330> upgraded<00:00:31.050> to

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
then but they just basically upgraded to

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.260 
then but they just basically upgraded to
direct<00:00:31.560> x<00:00:31.800> 9<00:00:32.070> which<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.460> probably<00:00:32.700> just<00:00:33.090> a

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
direct x 9 which is probably just a

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.080 
direct x 9 which is probably just a
bunch<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.899> graphic<00:00:34.410> graphic<00:00:34.620> stuff<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.880> all

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
beast which is true because pc just is

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.170 
beast which is true because pc just is

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
says that's why no screenshot it looks

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.800 
says that's why no screenshot it looks
the<00:01:07.979> same<00:01:08.310> but<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.180> also<00:01:09.360> good<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.659> we

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
the same but it is also good that we

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.510 
the same but it is also good that we
have<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.049> feature<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.650> someone<00:01:11.159> did<00:01:11.280> ask

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
have that feature and someone did ask

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.149 
have that feature and someone did ask
him<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.390> will<00:01:12.600> we<00:01:12.750> be<00:01:12.900> able<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.290> add<00:01:13.560> shader

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
him so will we be able to add shader

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.800 
him so will we be able to add shader
packs<00:01:14.580> which<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> good<00:01:15.210> question<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.720> he

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
packs which is a good question and he

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.480 
packs which is a good question and he
replied<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.380> saying<00:01:16.799> you'll<00:01:17.250> probably

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
replied to that saying you'll probably

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.880 
replied to that saying you'll probably
be<00:01:17.700> able<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:18.119> tamper<00:01:18.750> with<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.320> material

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
be able to tamper with the material

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.609 
be able to tamper with the material
files<00:01:20.130> but<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.850> will<00:01:21.150> kill<00:01:21.900> your<00:01:22.110> frames<00:01:22.380> per

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
files but it will kill your frames per

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.249 
files but it will kill your frames per
second<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.189> it's<00:01:24.119> almost<00:01:24.420> like<00:01:24.720> going<00:01:24.960> hand<00:01:25.200> in

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
second so it's almost like going hand in

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.960 
second so it's almost like going hand in
hand<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.530> may<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:25.890> be<00:01:25.950> better<00:01:26.250> off<00:01:26.460> just

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
hand you may just be better off just

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.819 
hand you may just be better off just
sticking<00:01:27.360> with<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.630> regular<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.350> not<00:01:28.799> even

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
sticking with it regular and not even

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.130 
sticking with it regular and not even
like<00:01:29.400> maybe<00:01:29.820> adding<00:01:30.420> shader<00:01:30.689> packs<00:01:30.930> because

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
like maybe adding shader packs because

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.990 
like maybe adding shader packs because
once<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.829> do<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:31.979> you're<00:01:32.280> not<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.759> may<00:01:32.850> not

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
once you do that you're not you may not

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.149 
once you do that you're not you may not
even<00:01:33.060> be<00:01:33.270> able<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:34.200> load<00:01:34.380> up<00:01:34.560> anything<00:01:34.799> or

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
even be able to to load up anything or

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.770 
even be able to to load up anything or
something<00:01:35.340> crazy<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.000> but<00:01:36.390> yeah<00:01:36.540> a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780
