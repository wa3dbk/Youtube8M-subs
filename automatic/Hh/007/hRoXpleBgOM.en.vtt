roberta adultery of system logistics he
told<00:00:57.570> us<00:00:57.660> about<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.960> machine<00:00:58.320> called<00:00:58.590> four

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
told us about a machine called four

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.459 
told us about a machine called four
phases<00:00:59.370> since<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> process<00:01:00.449> consists<00:01:01.320> of

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
phases since the process consists of

phases since the process consists of
four<00:01:02.309> phases<00:01:02.820> let's<00:01:03.780> see<00:01:03.930> how<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.199> works<00:01:04.350> for

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
four phases let's see how it works for
