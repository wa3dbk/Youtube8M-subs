00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.430
 The website is that you have to do it state Wednesday let you know it finally state 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.360
 pay for the mistakes of the opponent and make north holland 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.360
 just relax a bit nicer against Anderlecht 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.880
 the referendum was the result 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.720
 the team of coach was from atsma 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.380
 it is really full of medicines 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.570
 at a club got there so much that I have to take medication that I am there 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.400
 no more room at all 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.340
 started with small pieces of running that became bigger and bigger 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.520
 larger premises return the balls to the pulmonologist 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.150
 with the story that I had not taken any medicine 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.760
 and that I could believe the ball two 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.630
 green that was stunned 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.150
 they come from just as many only to look at the x-ray camera how that 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.420
 your lungs look like 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.930
 after three rounds were perfectly clean 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.450
 without training to take the rates and since then I have never been names like paul de 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.630
 wander in flames 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.990
 this experience inspired an arian van gelder to end up every two years 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.090
 suffered training until they were unable to follow 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.090
 and now he has his own clinic 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.740
 among young people with somatic complaints they find themselves 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.090
 they are people to have with 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.430
 disorder a bipolar select group the drug addict I have it 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.570
 sit by 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.920
 people with heart problems the neighborhood very diverse, it is of course very wide 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.380
 variety of 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.380
 after a soft landing 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.920
 because the roads are what we actually do 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.960
 we could only release dust in your brain 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.070
 but you feel beautiful 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.390
 so your stress level will decrease 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.720
 and besides 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.270
 An additional factor is that you can move and have physical complaints 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.700
 to reduce 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.460
 I was not depressed in number of depressive symptoms 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.650
 on caused by a major operation last year and I just had to go back on 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.370
 it was moving and I just wanted it because your device is feeling off 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.239
 the feeling of having no more energy and I believe the key lay 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.239
 just move and not sit on the couch 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:18.829
 and I did that and it appears to work 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.139
 This form of therapy is being taken more seriously in the Netherlands 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.870
 so the number of GPs and health insurers that this method is growing 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:27.199
 supports 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:30.199
 and psychologists and physical therapists also get to work 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.350
 the most important driver is for me 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.940
 purely to give people a better life 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.299
 someone who leaves me 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.609
 after those twelve weeks, say or read the training 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.560
 that a better person there prevents those people from becoming even more aware of them 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:48.869
 let's be body conscious of the mind 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:52.839
 and that actually that they work the doctor themselves is actually a person himself 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.149
 the pharmacists are correct 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:56.079
 your body artist write on you 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.299
 if you only drink enough 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.299
 will ever walk 

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:03.949
 god is the guard 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:05.989
 well that was the embassy 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.170
 the surrounding streets
