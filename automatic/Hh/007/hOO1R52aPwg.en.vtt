in<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.449> face<00:00:21.630> working<00:00:22.020> really<00:00:22.260> well<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.769> spots

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
in the face working really well in spots

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.589 
in the face working really well in spots
I'd<00:00:25.500> like<00:00:25.710> seem<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> little<00:00:26.250> more<00:00:26.430> consistent

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.380 

just<00:00:30.599> just<00:00:31.529> get<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.740> hang<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.099> now<00:00:32.239> was<00:00:33.239> the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
just just get the hang of it now was the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.970 
just just get the hang of it now was the
the<00:00:33.690> early<00:00:33.930> rounds<00:00:34.170> look<00:00:34.320> like<00:00:34.469> railroads

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the early rounds look like railroads

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.590 
the early rounds look like railroads
movement<00:00:35.309> was<00:00:35.430> pretty<00:00:35.610> good<00:00:35.850> well<00:00:36.450> pretty

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
movement was pretty good well pretty

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.490 
movement was pretty good well pretty
much<00:00:36.719> throughout<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.079> fight<00:00:37.230> but<00:00:37.350> especially

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
much throughout the fight but especially

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.369 
much throughout the fight but especially
in<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.860> early<00:00:38.070> rounds<00:00:38.250> was<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.820> due<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.379> him

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
in the early rounds was that due to him

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.720 
in the early rounds was that due to him
just<00:00:40.500> being<00:00:40.680> an<00:00:40.800> old<00:00:40.920> pro<00:00:41.129> or<00:00:41.370> was<00:00:41.489> many<00:00:41.670> a

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
just being an old pro or was many a

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.670 
just being an old pro or was many a
little<00:00:41.940> lethargic<00:00:42.059> early<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.899> think<00:00:43.530> maybe

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
little lethargic early on I think maybe

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.520 
little lethargic early on I think maybe
certainly<00:00:44.160> was<00:00:44.340> though<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:45.000> would<00:00:45.780> like<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.320> see

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
certainly was though I would like to see

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.520 
certainly was though I would like to see
me<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.829> little<00:00:47.219> bit<00:00:47.370> faster

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
me a little bit faster

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.990 
me a little bit faster
I<00:00:50.079> wonder<00:00:51.079> hidden<00:00:51.739> remember<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:52.550> last<00:00:52.730> night

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
I wonder hidden remember the last night

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.939 
I wonder hidden remember the last night
right<00:00:53.180> away<00:00:53.449> with<00:00:53.989> a<00:00:54.019> little<00:00:54.260> pressure<00:00:54.500> I

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
right away with a little pressure I

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.799 
right away with a little pressure I
think<00:00:55.250> it's<00:00:55.550> a<00:00:55.730> little<00:00:55.940> bit<00:00:56.090> like<00:00:56.329> said<00:00:56.600> that

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
think it's a little bit like said that

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.720 
think it's a little bit like said that
his<00:00:57.019> burger<00:00:57.290> just<00:00:58.040> kind<00:00:58.219> of<00:00:58.250> leaned<00:00:58.430> back<00:00:58.699> in

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
his burger just kind of leaned back in

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.630 
his burger just kind of leaned back in
beating<00:00:59.449> counter-puncher<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:00.230> so<00:01:01.219> they<00:01:01.399> have

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
beating counter-puncher and so they have

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.530 
beating counter-puncher and so they have
no<00:01:03.369> meaning<00:01:04.369> letter<00:01:04.909> fighting<00:01:05.180> in<00:01:05.239> his<00:01:05.300> face

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
no meaning letter fighting in his face

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:13.030 
no meaning letter fighting in his face
from<00:01:05.720> it<00:01:05.869> for<00:01:06.050> a<00:01:06.080> little<00:01:06.259> bother<00:01:06.409> then<00:01:06.710> I<00:01:12.040> went

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
from it for a little bother then I went

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.660
