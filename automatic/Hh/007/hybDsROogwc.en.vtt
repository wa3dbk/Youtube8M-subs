00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.240
 the goal to the society in a strict way to caritas in veritate 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:13.839
 good the encyclical caritas in veritate 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:17.590
 corresponds to what we might call in the tradition of the church at 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.509
 social encyclicals 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.659
 and what it is therefore is felt that you associate injury to the mind of 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:26.579
 Benedict 16 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.189
 some principles 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.499
 general among them is in the subsidiarity 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:33.690
 the one of the fight integral roll 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.160
 in the common good 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.600
 that serve to guide solutions to social problems 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.820
 and economic that society has 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.740
 this encyclical also contributes 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.270
 a very deep knowledge of what is 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.760
 right now 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.830
 inflamed social inti because the crisis has occurred 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.530
 and the injustices that exist and therefore I think it's a lie that comes 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.890
 very tale 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.500
 so that all those who have to work in the world 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.660
 of economic and social relations and have responsibilities 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.539
 deepen their principles and that they do not apply 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:13.539
 to the concrete problems that they have 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.670
 benedit to 16 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.010
 on this site k project a market economy happens 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.030
 in the principles of reciprocal trust solidarity 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.930
 as possible this in a society 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.500
 dominated by economic power 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.950
 good what it says Benedict 16 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.130
 the judge clear 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.610
 is that 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.820
 the human being 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.820
 not only is he an economic being 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.820
 not only is he a being who has to manage 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.120
 commutative justice is to say 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.230
 that's why the exchange of equivalent things 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.360
 but it also has the transcendent dimension and that dimension is the 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.000
 dimension of the telethon gift 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.360
 and that gift is precisely the fall 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.900
 i the truth that is 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.009
 what we have seen so far 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.299
 is that the economy based solely 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:10.059
 in justice 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:12.019
 active comuto d 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.010
 exchange of equivalent goods leads among other things to 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.229
 unfair social inequalities 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:21.430
 that in the long run the market will also be inefficient 

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:22.579
 economy 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:23.839
 so 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.669
 to have a complete confession 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:27.599
 a 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.069
 a scheme 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.109
 avn prevented 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:35.659
 what does it admit all the dimensions of the human being this cessation yesterday introduce 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.819
 in that with its comuto constitution activates distributive justice 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:41.890
 and within it the quality the gift 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.409
 that is to say 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.409
 It helps remove unexpected things 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:49.810
 trying today business sector 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.130
 that they should rescue them from this union 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.260
 I do not think that one of the main things that 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.959
 they come off this encyclical 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.559
 the principality 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:03.359
 the main function 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.059
 d businessmen 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:08.399
 to create opportunities 

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:10.079
 for access to work 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.320
 of people 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.179
 and keep working 

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:16.469
 and that is precisely the greatest good they can do 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.000
 and therefore the function of the company 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 ceases to have as exclusive purpose the economic benefit 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.150
 to take into account the common good among them that of the people who 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.109
 they are working in the company and also those who could work 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.549
 The employer's obligation from this point of view is the creation of new 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.469
 jobs and the maintenance of those who have 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:41.489
 and also 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.859
 that their decisions have to be guided by the common good 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.829
 not only for the particular good of one of the aid yew trees of the 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.359
 participants of the company 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:51.769
 but together 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.569
 by all those who contribute any to the company including employees by 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.379
 course the shareholders 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.349
 customers suppliers 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.689
 the community even 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:04.970
 physical pace 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.889
 in what we call the sustainable economy 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.380
 has dealt with the issue of the crisis 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.200
 in that sense as counselors that has changed the role of the school of 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.209
 business 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.639
 of administration 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:18.620
 today 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.120
 but I believe that business schools 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.699
 they have realized unfortunately late 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.960
 and precisely for not reading other encyclicals 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.960
 not only social but also of theological type 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.939
 that his teachings that were incomplete 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:38.289
 that the technical training that they gave scared me to see their 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.259
 the drink to ross 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:45.000
 the porra 2 was an incomplete formation because it did not take into account the 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.110
 moral aspects 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.090
 in fact we already know in the last promotion of the mb ace leave sea 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.789
 they have made a promise or oath 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.309
 of being written in your future 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:57.770
 and stop a 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.800
 responsible behavior 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.129
 so that 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:05.849
 finally business schools hope it's not a fad 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:08.729
 they have realized that comprehensive training that is much more important 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.749
 that technical training is more 

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:15.679
 that technical training without a humanistic training without training 

00:05:15.679 --> 00:05:16.810
 ethics 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.450
 it ends up being
