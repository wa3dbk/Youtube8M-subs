 At the time of about three-year university 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:16.320
 I have been in that snowbo circle 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.850
 I did a little bit of Zwolle 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.710
 Wow it worked! 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.710

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:45.210
 There is too much color in any kind of three-dimensionalization, and after all it's better to be phone ninja than ever before 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:48.110
 Not only the design has become rich in variations, but the functionality is also quite good 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.090
 That snow began to not enter 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.270
 I was impressed by something 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:59.119
 Tax alone or that binding 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:04.759
 Since the lure was also very high to buy after boots what I think they want and preferences 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:08.310
 I think that something will be found, so I hope you come by all means.
