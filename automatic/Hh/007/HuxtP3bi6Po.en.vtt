says<00:04:39.900> Skyblock<00:04:40.900> 2.1

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
says Skyblock 2.1

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.830 
says Skyblock 2.1
that's<00:04:42.340> because<00:04:42.670> when<00:04:42.820> you<00:04:42.940> download<00:04:43.300> normal

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
that's because when you download normal

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.730 
that's because when you download normal
and<00:04:44.340> Skyblock<00:04:45.340> for<00:04:45.550> vanilla<00:04:45.850> minecraft<00:04:46.060> it's

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
and Skyblock for vanilla minecraft it's

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.440 
and Skyblock for vanilla minecraft it's
2.1<00:04:47.740> and<00:04:47.890> that's<00:04:48.040> the<00:04:48.760> version<00:04:48.910> you<00:04:49.090> based<00:04:49.300> it

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
2.1 and that's the version you based it

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.690 
2.1 and that's the version you based it
off<00:04:49.600> and<00:04:50.200> he<00:04:50.650> hasn't<00:04:50.770> changed<00:04:50.920> the<00:04:51.250> world<00:04:51.490> name

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
off and he hasn't changed the world name

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.140 
off and he hasn't changed the world name
when<00:04:52.000> I<00:04:52.030> downloaded<00:04:52.540> it<00:04:52.750> and<00:04:53.940> I<00:04:54.940> had<00:04:55.060> to

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
when I downloaded it and I had to

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.300 
when I downloaded it and I had to
manually<00:04:55.450> add<00:04:55.570> in<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:55.930> updates<00:04:56.260> from<00:04:56.470> the<00:04:56.560> 1.3

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
manually add in the updates from the 1.3

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.690 
manually add in the updates from the 1.3
so<00:04:58.410> so<00:04:59.410> that's<00:04:59.530> how<00:04:59.680> you<00:04:59.740> install<00:04:59.860> Tekkit

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
so so that's how you install Tekkit

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.240 
so so that's how you install Tekkit
Skyblock<00:05:01.240> and<00:05:01.570> and<00:05:02.320> then<00:05:02.590> you<00:05:02.860> can<00:05:03.070> get

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
Skyblock and and then you can get

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.460 
Skyblock and and then you can get
started<00:05:03.990> with<00:05:04.990> some<00:05:05.380> of<00:05:05.500> your<00:05:05.650> amazing

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
started with some of your amazing

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.670 
started with some of your amazing
Skyblock<00:05:08.470> maps<00:05:08.740> just<00:05:09.370> like<00:05:09.640> mine<00:05:10.230> so<00:05:11.230> if<00:05:11.350> I<00:05:11.440> log

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
Skyblock maps just like mine so if I log

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.890 
Skyblock maps just like mine so if I log
in<00:05:11.890> here<00:05:12.210> right<00:05:13.210> so<00:05:13.450> now<00:05:13.630> we're<00:05:13.810> in<00:05:13.960> and<00:05:15.870> well<00:05:16.870> I

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
in here right so now we're in and well I

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.660 
in here right so now we're in and well I
didn't<00:05:17.170> realize<00:05:17.410> that<00:05:17.440> fraps<00:05:17.860> and<00:05:18.100> dxtory

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
didn't realize that fraps and dxtory

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.700 
didn't realize that fraps and dxtory
again<00:05:18.940> at<00:05:19.030> the<00:05:19.120> same<00:05:19.270> time

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
again at the same time

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.760 
again at the same time
that's<00:05:21.190> the<00:05:21.400> dxtory<00:05:21.910> counter<00:05:22.530> my<00:05:23.530> fraps

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
that's the dxtory counter my fraps

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.230 
that's the dxtory counter my fraps
counter<00:05:24.130> is<00:05:24.220> in<00:05:24.340> the<00:05:24.400> top<00:05:24.580> left<00:05:24.610> if<00:05:25.090> it's

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
counter is in the top left if it's

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.810 
counter is in the top left if it's
malfunctioned<00:05:25.900> if<00:05:26.140> it<00:05:26.260> hasn't<00:05:26.530> then<00:05:26.920> you

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
malfunctioned if it hasn't then you

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.390 
malfunctioned if it hasn't then you
won't<00:05:28.000> be<00:05:28.060> able<00:05:28.210> to<00:05:28.270> see<00:05:28.570> it<00:05:28.690> and<00:05:29.220> so<00:05:30.220> this<00:05:30.340> is

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
won't be able to see it and so this is

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.890 
won't be able to see it and so this is
what<00:05:30.750> it<00:05:31.750> should<00:05:31.990> look<00:05:32.020> like<00:05:33.600> this<00:05:34.600> is<00:05:34.750> this

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
what it should look like this is this

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.450 
what it should look like this is this
faxed<00:05:35.260> a<00:05:35.350> pack<00:05:35.650> I'll<00:05:35.860> probably<00:05:36.250> do<00:05:36.430> another

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
faxed a pack I'll probably do another

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.760 
faxed a pack I'll probably do another
