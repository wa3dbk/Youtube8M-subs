00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello to all of you i hope you 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.319
 go well because I'm in shape 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.540
 today and I'm in shape because 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.049
 that I'm going to make a video for you 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.970
 so this video is how to make a 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.960
 tripod for an iphone or ipod touch 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.840
 so a tripod what is it 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.090
 first a tripod is not necessarily 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.420
 the representation in the feet of 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.279
 chair 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.750
 but it's something that allows 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.669
 when you put your iphone or ipod 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.230
 it is stable and does not move 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.920
 speaking to take a picture or a 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.260
 video 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.200
 so something that is him 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.980
 allows to be stable so to have a 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:48.930
 video quality very well so so we go 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.960
 start with if you want to create a 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.719
 tripod with the means of the edge without 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.910
 spend too much money to buy 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.129
 really very special things I'm going 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.090
 you have you asked 20 you 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.449
 take books 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.360
 here you are piling them up 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.890
 take more or less depending on the thing that 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.130
 you want movie is so if you want 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.880
 to shoot something very low very high 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.470
 you take more or less books for 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:21.750
 that's it to show you so we see the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.490
 arranged like that then we go 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.400
 take for example I do not know if 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.810
 you know that it's an antenna that 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.270
 is usually provided with radios 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.960
 Wake hi fi systems for TVs 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:38.070
 with a lot of stuff you do not you 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.170
 put in water like that 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.810
 knowing that unfortunately I did 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.159
 that an ipod touch I do not have a second 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.390
 to show you so I'm going to show you 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.510
 with my cellphone 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.780
 so we have a cell phone we will 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.119
 position there but it's exactly 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.810
 same I tested that it's the same 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:01.290
 with an iphone or an ipod so you 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.570
 arranged here look well between 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.570
 two normally it calms down alone 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.289
 there is still a little forced but 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.289
 it does not damage your device 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:22.770
 so that's because to see so here 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.410
 there he is stalled he is well he is ready 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.320
 we can take videos 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.260
 after you here if I had 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.690
 unfortunately you do not have that or 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.540
 then you want is not filmed from 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.250
 good but you want movie is like that 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.590
 vertically and will you take 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.549
 I did not like to drink a glass of water 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.040
 goblet like wanted a glass glass 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:53.690
 this bottleneck and you position everything 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:58.079
 simply your iphone or ipod in 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.740
 and you can you all here you are 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.630
 can access your keys 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.730
 all this on the other hand if ever there is a 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.010
 counterpoint you can add by 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.870
 pencils I added you do with the 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.590
 means of the board to make counterweight and 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.270
 for easter that's rocking that's it 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.610
 starts rocking page and this is my case 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.770
 also that the hull is too much 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.060
 great so here you can everything 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:25.880
 just do like this so is 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.770
 tuba here the video ends like that 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.290
 here I explained to you roughly 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.980
 how to make an iphone tripod or 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.900
 ipod 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.140
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.410
