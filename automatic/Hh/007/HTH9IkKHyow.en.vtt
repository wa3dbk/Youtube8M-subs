seem<00:03:20.860> to<00:03:20.890> be<00:03:21.040> much<00:03:21.100> better<00:03:21.459> this<00:03:22.090> is<00:03:22.209> called

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
seem to be much better this is called

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.780 
seem to be much better this is called
u-turn<00:03:22.840> but<00:03:23.620> it's<00:03:23.770> not<00:03:23.890> really<00:03:23.980> a<00:03:24.100> u-turn<00:03:24.490> it's

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
u-turn but it's not really a u-turn it's

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.390 
u-turn but it's not really a u-turn it's
just<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.300> load<00:03:25.600> in<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.590> middle<00:03:26.860> of<00:03:27.010> a<00:03:27.160> burning

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
just a load in the middle of a burning

oil field as damaged vehicles everywhere

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.060 
oil field as damaged vehicles everywhere
which<00:03:30.400> is<00:03:30.610> my<00:03:30.940> favorite<00:03:31.510> type<00:03:31.690> of<00:03:31.720> obstacle

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
which is my favorite type of obstacle

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.810 
which is my favorite type of obstacle
especially<00:03:33.070> as<00:03:33.130> you<00:03:33.220> can't<00:03:33.430> really<00:03:33.580> climb

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
especially as you can't really climb

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.380 
especially as you can't really climb
over<00:03:34.090> them<00:03:34.350> there's<00:03:35.350> four<00:03:35.560> vertical<00:03:36.100> lanes

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390

minimal overhead cover increases threat
of<00:03:39.370> aerial<00:03:39.790> killstreaks<00:03:40.300> so<00:03:40.660> make<00:03:40.870> sure<00:03:40.900> you

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
of aerial killstreaks so make sure you

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.890

slap on blind eye this founded clutter

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.330 
slap on blind eye this founded clutter
makes<00:03:44.200> detection<00:03:44.739> much<00:03:44.890> more<00:03:45.100> difficult

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
makes detection much more difficult

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.880 
makes detection much more difficult
though<00:03:45.820> keep<00:03:46.660> a<00:03:46.750> low<00:03:46.900> profile<00:03:47.320> sweep<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.800> area

ever-present threat so it seems to be a

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
the house are talking about seems to be

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.510 
the house are talking about seems to be
in<00:04:29.540> the<00:04:29.660> bottom<00:04:29.870> area<00:04:30.380> of<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:30.830> map<00:04:30.980> there<00:04:31.310> and

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
in the bottom area of the map there and

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.030 
in the bottom area of the map there and
people<00:04:32.180> will<00:04:32.750> most<00:04:33.080> likely<00:04:33.320> camp<00:04:33.620> it<00:04:33.740> out<00:04:33.860> and

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
people will most likely camp it out and

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.650 
people will most likely camp it out and
there<00:04:34.160> because<00:04:34.400> that<00:04:34.490> seems<00:04:34.700> to<00:04:34.880> be<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.240> best

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
there because that seems to be the best

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.780 
there because that seems to be the best
area<00:04:36.230> of<00:04:36.320> defense<00:04:36.680> so<00:04:37.310> you're<00:04:37.460> probably<00:04:37.550> gonna

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
area of defense so you're probably gonna

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.370 
area of defense so you're probably gonna
be<00:04:37.910> running<00:04:38.210> in<00:04:38.330> from<00:04:38.510> the<00:04:38.600> other<00:04:38.690> side<00:04:38.780> trying

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
be running in from the other side trying

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.170 
be running in from the other side trying
to<00:04:39.440> pick<00:04:39.560> them<00:04:39.680> off<00:04:39.770> from<00:04:39.890> the<00:04:40.010> hill<00:04:40.190> I<00:04:40.400> don't

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
to pick them off from the hill I don't

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.970 
to pick them off from the hill I don't
know<00:04:41.270> this<00:04:41.450> looks<00:04:41.690> like<00:04:41.930> the<00:04:42.110> best<00:04:42.470> of<00:04:42.800> the

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
know this looks like the best of the

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.980 
know this looks like the best of the
maps<00:04:43.190> but<00:04:43.700> of<00:04:43.850> course<00:04:44.090> I'd<00:04:44.270> have<00:04:44.450> to<00:04:44.600> play<00:04:44.810> it

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
maps but of course I'd have to play it

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.840 
maps but of course I'd have to play it
and<00:04:45.140> just<00:04:45.980> looks<00:04:46.190> a<00:04:46.280> bit<00:04:46.400> more<00:04:46.550> interesting

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
and just looks a bit more interesting

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.110 
and just looks a bit more interesting
especially<00:04:47.300> if<00:04:47.660> that<00:04:47.780> volcano<00:04:48.410> I<00:04:49.030> don't<00:04:50.030> know

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
especially if that volcano I don't know

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.360 
especially if that volcano I don't know
what<00:04:50.240> I<00:04:50.300> said<00:04:50.570> that<00:04:50.750> so<00:04:50.960> I<00:04:51.010> especially<00:04:52.010> if<00:04:52.250> that

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
what I said that so I especially if that

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.710 
what I said that so I especially if that
tornado<00:04:52.730> is<00:04:53.060> going<00:04:53.300> on<00:04:53.360> in<00:04:53.510> the<00:04:53.570> background

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
tornado is going on in the background

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.440 
tornado is going on in the background
that<00:04:54.620> would<00:04:54.770> be<00:04:54.860> you<00:04:55.580> know<00:04:55.700> quite<00:04:55.910> interesting

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
that would be you know quite interesting

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.450 
that would be you know quite interesting
to<00:04:56.600> look<00:04:56.900> and<00:04:57.080> watch<00:04:57.200> I<00:04:57.500> know<00:04:57.860> the<00:04:58.130> other<00:04:58.280> ones

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
to look and watch I know the other ones

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.220 
to look and watch I know the other ones
got<00:04:58.700> all<00:04:58.730> those<00:04:58.970> fires<00:04:59.360> from<00:04:59.600> the<00:04:59.750> oil<00:04:59.900> field

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
got all those fires from the oil field

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.680 
got all those fires from the oil field
but<00:05:00.500> really<00:05:00.770> that<00:05:00.919> map<00:05:01.130> looked<00:05:01.460> horrible<00:05:01.820> so

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
haven't really been enjoying face off as

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.080 
haven't really been enjoying face off as
much<00:05:08.870> as<00:05:09.110> the<00:05:09.260> normal<00:05:09.620> multiplayer<00:05:10.100> so<00:05:10.790> I'm

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
much as the normal multiplayer so I'm

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.850 
much as the normal multiplayer so I'm
not<00:05:11.300> sure<00:05:11.540> if<00:05:11.750> these<00:05:11.900> are<00:05:12.080> going<00:05:12.140> to<00:05:12.230> be<00:05:12.320> a<00:05:12.590> big

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
not sure if these are going to be a big

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.380 
not sure if these are going to be a big
thing<00:05:12.890> for<00:05:13.160> me<00:05:13.430> or<00:05:13.580> not<00:05:13.669> this<00:05:13.970> seems<00:05:14.180> like<00:05:14.270> a

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
thing for me or not this seems like a

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.510 
thing for me or not this seems like a
bit<00:05:14.570> of<00:05:14.600> a<00:05:14.690> wasted<00:05:15.110> month<00:05:15.320> i'll<00:05:15.860> play<00:05:16.130> the<00:05:16.160> spec

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
bit of a wasted month i'll play the spec

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.340 
bit of a wasted month i'll play the spec
ops<00:05:16.730> really<00:05:16.970> i<00:05:17.780> was<00:05:18.020> going<00:05:18.260> to<00:05:18.290> say

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
ops really i was going to say

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.040 
ops really i was going to say
achievements<00:05:18.890> there<00:05:19.040> but<00:05:19.250> trophies<00:05:20.050> and

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
achievements there but trophies and

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.260 
achievements there but trophies and
otherwise<00:05:21.710> I<00:05:22.160> don't<00:05:22.400> know<00:05:22.610> this<00:05:22.790> seems<00:05:23.000> like<00:05:23.150> a

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
otherwise I don't know this seems like a

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.500 
otherwise I don't know this seems like a
sort<00:05:23.510> of<00:05:23.540> mediocre<00:05:24.070> drop<00:05:25.070> to<00:05:25.280> me<00:05:25.430> and<00:05:26.210> the<00:05:26.330> last

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
sort of mediocre drop to me and the last

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.030 
sort of mediocre drop to me and the last
thing<00:05:26.690> to<00:05:26.810> address<00:05:27.080> is<00:05:27.320> when<00:05:27.530> this<00:05:27.650> is<00:05:27.800> coming

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
thing to address is when this is coming
