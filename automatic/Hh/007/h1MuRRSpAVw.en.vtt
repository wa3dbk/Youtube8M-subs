today I'm going to teach you a little
bell<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.629> little<00:00:07.080> bit<00:00:07.170> about<00:00:07.379> where<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:08.010> start

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
bell a little bit about where to start

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.990 
bell a little bit about where to start
on<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.639> board<00:00:09.980> as<00:00:10.980> you<00:00:11.070> can<00:00:11.370> see<00:00:11.519> here<00:00:11.730> up<00:00:11.820> set

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
on the board as you can see here up set

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.379 
on the board as you can see here up set
up<00:00:12.090> three<00:00:12.360> examples<00:00:13.460> each<00:00:14.460> example<00:00:15.150> is

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
up three examples each example is

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.220 
up three examples each example is
surrounding<00:00:15.870> nine<00:00:16.260> points<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.710> territory<00:00:19.760> so

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
surrounding nine points of territory so

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.960 
surrounding nine points of territory so
if<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.439> count<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.859> intersections<00:00:23.580> it's<00:00:23.789> like

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
if you count the intersections it's like

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.730 
if you count the intersections it's like
the<00:00:24.090> surrounding<00:00:24.630> you'll<00:00:24.869> see<00:00:25.080> there's<00:00:25.500> not<00:00:25.680> a

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
the surrounding you'll see there's not a

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.920 
the surrounding you'll see there's not a
point<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.070> each<00:00:26.240> you<00:00:27.240> can<00:00:27.359> count<00:00:27.539> yourself<00:00:27.630> if

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
point in each you can count yourself if

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.370 
point in each you can count yourself if
you<00:00:28.050> want<00:00:28.289> but<00:00:28.970> I<00:00:29.970> want<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.810> look<00:00:30.929> at<00:00:31.109> how

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
you want but I want you to look at how

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.040 
you want but I want you to look at how
many<00:00:31.529> moves<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:32.219> takes<00:00:32.550> us<00:00:32.700> around<00:00:32.969> each<00:00:33.329> piece

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
many moves it takes us around each piece

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.610 
many moves it takes us around each piece
each<00:00:34.440> nine<00:00:35.010> points<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.780> the<00:00:36.780> corner<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.350> only

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
each nine points and the corner it only

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.860 
each nine points and the corner it only
takes<00:00:37.890> about<00:00:37.980> six<00:00:38.399> moves<00:00:41.000> on<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.239> side<00:00:42.510> it

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
takes about six moves on the side it

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.069 
takes about six moves on the side it
takes<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.649> little<00:00:43.770> bit<00:00:43.860> more<00:00:44.510> nine<00:00:45.510> minutes<00:00:45.870> in

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
takes a little bit more nine minutes in

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.029 
takes a little bit more nine minutes in
the<00:00:46.590> center<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.129> takes<00:00:47.489> twelve<00:00:48.500> so<00:00:49.500> with<00:00:49.920> this

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
the center it takes twelve so with this

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.680 
the center it takes twelve so with this
example<00:00:50.250> we<00:00:50.760> can<00:00:50.910> see<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.120> we<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:51.660> make

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
example we can see that we can make

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.880 
example we can see that we can make
territory<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.860> fastest<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.760> corners<00:00:54.390> and

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
territory the fastest in the corners and

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.889 
territory the fastest in the corners and
then<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.129> send<00:00:56.460> along<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.789> sides<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
then we send along the sides and the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.380 
then we send along the sides and the
sinners<00:00:58.289> are<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:58.710> usually<00:00:59.160> used<00:00:59.370> for<00:00:59.760> points

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
sinners are not usually used for points

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.110 
sinners are not usually used for points
or<00:01:00.809> anything<00:01:01.649> like<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:01.949> we<00:01:02.370> usually<00:01:02.789> use<00:01:02.969> it

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
or anything like that we usually use it

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.620 
or anything like that we usually use it
for<00:01:03.329> fighting<00:01:03.780> or<00:01:05.030> positional<00:01:06.030> strength<00:01:06.270> or

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
for fighting or positional strength or

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.200 
for fighting or positional strength or
something<00:01:06.900> like<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.460> usually<00:01:08.640> do<00:01:09.030> not

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
something like that so we usually do not

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.420 
something like that so we usually do not
go<00:01:09.420> for<00:01:09.600> point<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.260> center<00:01:10.560> we<00:01:10.799> just<00:01:11.250> stick

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
go for point in the center we just stick

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.249 
go for point in the center we just stick
with<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.640> corners<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.090> then<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> side<00:01:13.939> in

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
with the corners and then the side in

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.630 
with the corners and then the side in
this<00:01:16.259> example<00:01:16.680> I'll<00:01:17.070> show<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
this example I'll show you the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.350 
this example I'll show you the
territorial<00:01:18.299> lines<00:01:19.189> here<00:01:20.189> black<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.119> on<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
territorial lines here black is on the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.859 
territorial lines here black is on the
third<00:01:21.570> line<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:23.180> good<00:01:24.180> for<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.450> solid

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
third line this is good for a solid

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.830 
third line this is good for a solid
territory<00:01:25.580> but<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:27.210> can<00:01:27.330> do<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> little<00:01:27.659> bit

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
territory but you can do a little bit

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.590 
territory but you can do a little bit
better<00:01:27.960> third<00:01:28.890> line<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.610> territorial<00:01:30.360> line

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
better third line is a territorial line

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.660 
better third line is a territorial line
we<00:01:31.380> consider<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.130> line<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.549> has

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
we consider that the line that has

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.200 
we consider that the line that has
secured<00:01:33.060> territory<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.350> secure<00:01:34.680> position

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
secured territory and a secure position

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.300 
secured territory and a secure position
now<00:01:36.210> if<00:01:36.570> we<00:01:36.750> look<00:01:36.869> at<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.229> one<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:38.040> can<00:01:38.159> see

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
now if we look at this one we can see

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.760 
now if we look at this one we can see
its<00:01:38.490> third<00:01:38.670> line<00:01:38.880> fourth<00:01:39.180> line<00:01:39.390> third<00:01:39.659> line

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
its third line fourth line third line

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.499 
its third line fourth line third line
this<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.130> better<00:01:41.460> idea<00:01:41.850> for<00:01:41.909> territory

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
this is the better idea for territory

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.899 
this is the better idea for territory
third<00:01:43.229> line<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.680> each<00:01:43.890> side<00:01:44.159> for<00:01:44.520> secured

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
third line on each side for secured

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.270 
third line on each side for secured
position<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.720> fourth<00:01:46.079> line<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.560> have<00:01:47.040> some

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
position and fourth line to have some

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.340 
position and fourth line to have some
effect<00:01:47.399> on<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.390> rest<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.750> board<00:01:48.990> if

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
effect on the rest of the board if

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.170 
effect on the rest of the board if
you're<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.369> third<00:01:50.610> line<00:01:50.850> all<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.149> time

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
you're on the third line all the time

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.030 
you're on the third line all the time
then<00:01:51.899> you're<00:01:52.020> not<00:01:52.079> gonna<00:01:52.200> have<00:01:52.409> any<00:01:52.590> effect<00:01:52.649> of

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
then you're not gonna have any effect of

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.530 
then you're not gonna have any effect of
ours<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> board<00:01:53.670> or<00:01:53.790> any<00:01:53.909> fights<00:01:54.270> or

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
ours to the board or any fights or

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.380 
ours to the board or any fights or
anything<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:56.490> fourth<00:01:56.790> line<00:01:57.060> is

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
anything like that the fourth line is

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.030 
anything like that the fourth line is
the<00:01:57.630> line<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.810> has<00:01:58.049> effect<00:01:58.380> on<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.619> center

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
the line that has effect on the center

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.270 
the line that has effect on the center
and<00:01:59.310> any<00:01:59.759> fights<00:02:00.420> or<00:02:00.810> anything<00:02:00.869> like<00:02:01.380> anything

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
and any fights or anything like anything

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.389 
and any fights or anything like anything
of<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.610> sort<00:02:03.110> so<00:02:04.110> what<00:02:04.590> we<00:02:04.710> want<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.009> do<00:02:05.159> is

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
of the sort so what we want to do is

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.310 
of the sort so what we want to do is

have the third line and fourth line

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.150 
have the third line and fourth line
stone

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.520

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
same with the third line we don't want

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.500 
same with the third line we don't want
just<00:02:13.620> fourth<00:02:14.010> line<00:02:14.250> stones<00:02:14.610> because<00:02:15.390> the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
just fourth line stones because the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.760 
just fourth line stones because the
flight<00:02:15.750> gets<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.020> stone<00:02:16.230> around<00:02:16.380> either

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
flight gets the stone around either

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.690 
flight gets the stone around either
decide<00:02:17.690> then<00:02:18.690> Y<00:02:19.650> can<00:02:19.830> just<00:02:19.980> play<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.190> stone<00:02:20.490> and

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
decide then Y can just play a stone and

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.480 
decide then Y can just play a stone and
come<00:02:20.970> under<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.420> territorial<00:02:21.960> line<00:02:22.490> now

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
come under the territorial line now

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.250 
come under the territorial line now

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
the walls and these four points will

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.450 
the walls and these four points will
help<00:03:36.420> you<00:03:36.600> develop<00:03:36.840> territory<00:03:37.830> quickly<00:03:38.250> in

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
help you develop territory quickly in

the corner some good corner shapes
remember<00:03:42.240> is<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:43.890> Shamari<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:45.450> shamaya

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
remember is the Shamari the shamaya

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.050 
remember is the Shamari the shamaya
works<00:03:46.140> with<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.440> three<00:03:46.680> four<00:03:46.920> point<00:03:47.250> you<00:03:47.910> make

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
works with the three four point you make

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.960 
works with the three four point you make
a<00:03:48.090> nice<00:03:48.420> foot<00:03:48.690> from<00:03:49.020> the<00:03:49.140> three<00:03:49.320> four<00:03:49.560> point

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
a nice foot from the three four point

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.300 
a nice foot from the three four point
like<00:03:50.970> so<00:03:51.410> well<00:03:52.410> we<00:03:52.500> call<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:52.709> a<00:03:52.890> nice<00:03:53.070> thing

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
like so well we call it a nice thing

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.350 
like so well we call it a nice thing
because<00:03:53.580> like<00:03:53.970> in<00:03:54.090> chess<00:03:54.270> because<00:03:54.420> one<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:55.080> one

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
because like in chess because one to one

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.690 
because like in chess because one to one
so<00:03:57.360> so<00:03:58.140> once<00:03:58.410> you<00:03:58.530> want<00:03:58.800> you<00:03:59.100> make<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.280> Shamari

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
so so once you want you make a Shamari

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.470 
so so once you want you make a Shamari
all<00:04:00.180> right<00:04:00.330> and<00:04:01.100> this<00:04:02.100> tamari<00:04:02.520> is<00:04:02.850> usually<00:04:03.450> a

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
all right and this tamari is usually a

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.390 
all right and this tamari is usually a
very<00:04:03.780> powerful<00:04:04.080> shape<00:04:04.560> in<00:04:04.770> the<00:04:04.920> early<00:04:05.190> game

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
very powerful shape in the early game

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.580 
very powerful shape in the early game
because<00:04:05.910> it<00:04:06.060> immediately<00:04:06.420> surrounds<00:04:07.200> ten

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
because it immediately surrounds ten

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.130 
because it immediately surrounds ten
points<00:04:08.040> in<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.610> corner<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.209> it<00:04:09.600> have<00:04:09.840> a

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
points in the corner and it have a

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.510 
points in the corner and it have a
strong<00:04:10.500> influence<00:04:10.860> on<00:04:11.100> the<00:04:11.160> rest<00:04:11.340> of<00:04:11.459> the

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
strong influence on the rest of the

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.510 
strong influence on the rest of the
board<00:04:11.780> up<00:04:12.780> here<00:04:12.840> is<00:04:13.410> also<00:04:13.800> a<00:04:13.830> Shamar

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:08.409 

in<00:05:05.729> this<00:05:05.969> example<00:05:06.449> we<00:05:06.809> played<00:05:07.109> out<00:05:07.259> nearly<00:05:07.589> all

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
in this example we played out nearly all

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.199 
in this example we played out nearly all
of<00:05:09.419> the<00:05:09.779> opening

there's<00:05:12.209> still<00:05:12.389> a<00:05:12.479> few<00:05:12.509> unfinished<00:05:13.229> points

there's still a few unfinished points

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:16.399 
there's still a few unfinished points
but<00:05:14.249> look<00:05:15.179> at<00:05:15.299> how<00:05:15.449> white<00:05:15.719> and<00:05:15.869> black<00:05:16.049> are

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:16.409 
but look at how white and black are

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:18.349 
but look at how white and black are
consciously<00:05:17.339> staying<00:05:17.699> on<00:05:17.909> the<00:05:18.029> third<00:05:18.239> or
