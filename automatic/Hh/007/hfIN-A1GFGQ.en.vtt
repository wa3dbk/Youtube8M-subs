suggested by Roman echo PSN saying that
it's<00:00:27.539> underused<00:00:28.109> but<00:00:28.320> deadly<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.099> right

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
it's underused but deadly in the right

it's underused but deadly in the right
hands<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.090> agree<00:00:30.330> with<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.539> though<00:00:31.140> it

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
hands and I agree with that though it

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.590 
hands and I agree with that though it
does<00:00:31.500> make<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:32.009> lot<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.219> people<00:00:32.520> freak<00:00:32.910> out<00:00:33.090> low

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
does make a lot of people freak out low

fire rate small magazine and a rather
long<00:00:35.880> reload<00:00:36.239> time<00:00:36.540> make<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.110> seem<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.500> be

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
long reload time make it seem to be

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.220 
long reload time make it seem to be
clunky<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.910> let's<00:00:39.390> say<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:40.170> is

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
clunky and that is let's say it is

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.470 
clunky and that is let's say it is
somehow<00:00:40.620> true<00:00:40.980> but<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.610> really<00:00:41.820> makes<00:00:42.090> up<00:00:42.300> for

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
somehow true but it really makes up for

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.690 
somehow true but it really makes up for
that<00:00:42.510> with<00:00:42.719> its<00:00:42.899> outstanding<00:00:43.320> 34<00:00:44.160> hit<00:00:44.340> points

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
that with its outstanding 34 hit points

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.459 
that with its outstanding 34 hit points
at<00:00:44.820> close<00:00:45.030> range<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.600> excellent<00:00:46.200> killing

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
at close range and excellent killing

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.889 
at close range and excellent killing
times<00:00:46.680> all<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.550> basically<00:00:48.030> means<00:00:48.149> this

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
times all of this basically means this

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.260 
times all of this basically means this
is<00:00:49.020> not<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.350> running<00:00:49.950> gun<00:00:50.100> weapon<00:00:50.340> it's<00:00:51.000> going

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
is not a running gun weapon it's going

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.240 
is not a running gun weapon it's going
to<00:00:51.329> force<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.899> actually<00:00:52.230> aim<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.890> make

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
to force you to actually aim and make

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.040 
to force you to actually aim and make
sure<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.760> will<00:00:53.850> hit<00:00:54.059> your<00:00:54.210> target<00:00:54.690> so

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
sure that you will hit your target so

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.560 
sure that you will hit your target so
even<00:00:55.260> if<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.469> don't<00:00:55.739> usually<00:00:56.039> use<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.640> g3<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
even if you don't usually use the g3 the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.630 
even if you don't usually use the g3 the
positive<00:00:58.109> effects<00:00:58.469> from<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.100> forest<00:00:59.430> play

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
positive effects from the forest play

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.610 
positive effects from the forest play
style<00:00:59.940> will<00:01:00.180> still<00:01:00.420> remain<00:01:00.719> making<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.530> an

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
style will still remain making it an

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.070 
style will still remain making it an
excellent<00:01:01.949> gun<00:01:02.280> for<00:01:02.520> practice<00:01:03.000> but<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:03.899> I

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
excellent gun for practice but like I

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.140 
excellent gun for practice but like I
said<00:01:04.110> many<00:01:04.769> people<00:01:05.189> are<00:01:05.339> freaked<00:01:05.700> out<00:01:05.850> by<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
said many people are freaked out by the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.359 
said many people are freaked out by the
downsides<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.110> gun<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.710> let<00:01:07.860> me<00:01:07.890> help<00:01:08.130> out

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
downsides of this gun so let me help out

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.270 
downsides of this gun so let me help out
some<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.820> those<00:01:08.970> people<00:01:09.210> as<00:01:09.710> you<00:01:10.710> can<00:01:10.860> see<00:01:11.070> we

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
some of those people as you can see we

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.969 
some of those people as you can see we
have<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.460> really<00:01:11.760> high<00:01:12.260> 0.45<00:01:13.260> upwards<00:01:13.799> recoil

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
have a really high 0.45 upwards recoil

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.850 
have a really high 0.45 upwards recoil
but<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.790> sideways<00:01:15.150> recall<00:01:15.570> only<00:01:15.780> being<00:01:16.140> 0.2

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
but the sideways recall only being 0.2

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.340 
but the sideways recall only being 0.2
it<00:01:17.220> will<00:01:17.490> be<00:01:17.610> very<00:01:17.790> predictable<00:01:18.540> firing<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.320> 3

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
it will be very predictable firing in 3

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.249 
it will be very predictable firing in 3
2<00:01:19.590> 4<00:01:19.950> round<00:01:20.400> burst<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:21.030> ideal<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.720> medium<00:01:22.080> to

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
2 4 round burst is ideal a medium to

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.530 
2 4 round burst is ideal a medium to
long<00:01:22.439> range<00:01:22.549> so<00:01:23.549> let<00:01:23.729> me<00:01:23.759> show<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.060> how<00:01:24.240> it's

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
long range so let me show you how it's

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.399 
long range so let me show you how it's
done<00:01:27.890> okay<00:01:29.119> well<00:01:30.119> basically<00:01:30.570> what<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.259> need

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
done okay well basically what you need

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.660 
done okay well basically what you need
to<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.549> go<00:01:33.710> well<00:01:34.710> I'm<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:35.460> going<00:01:35.610> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
to do is to go well I'm just going to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.080 
to do is to go well I'm just going to
show<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.990> first<00:01:36.990> we<00:01:37.170> want<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.380> see<00:01:38.130> how<00:01:38.880> it

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
show you first we want to see how it

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.780 
show you first we want to see how it
actually<00:01:39.270> works<00:01:42.799> so<00:01:43.799> basically<00:01:44.159> over<00:01:44.610> this

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
actually works so basically over this

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.289 
actually works so basically over this
time<00:01:45.090> period<00:01:45.619> we<00:01:46.619> went<00:01:46.860> from<00:01:47.009> here<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.520> here

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
time period we went from here to here

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.440 
time period we went from here to here
and<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:49.500> barely<00:01:49.829> moved<00:01:50.189> anything<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:51.060> decide

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
and it barely moved anything to decide

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.980 
and it barely moved anything to decide
because<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.710> really<00:01:53.270> got<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:55.640> let's<00:01:56.640> say<00:01:56.990> good

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
because it's really got a let's say good

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.069 
because it's really got a let's say good
side-to-side<00:01:58.409> recoil<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.250> balanced<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.689> in

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
side-to-side recoil and balanced so in

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.020 
side-to-side recoil and balanced so in
that<00:02:01.590> time<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.250> shoots<00:02:02.520> we<00:02:02.700> basically

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
that time that it shoots we basically

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.780 
that time that it shoots we basically
want<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.479> reach<00:02:03.630> from<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.439> point<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:05.040> this

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
want to reach from this point to this

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.900 
want to reach from this point to this
point<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.920> really<00:02:08.099> needs<00:02:08.429> some<00:02:08.700> practice

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
point and it really needs some practice

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.390 
point and it really needs some practice
with<00:02:09.390> your<00:02:09.690> muscle<00:02:10.050> memory<00:02:10.200> but<00:02:11.009> basically

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
with your muscle memory but basically

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.050 
with your muscle memory but basically
this<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.879> how<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.120> should<00:02:12.239> look<00:02:12.300> like

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.360 

as<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.329> can<00:02:17.450> see<00:02:17.659> it's<00:02:17.810> pretty<00:02:17.959> precise<00:02:18.500> and

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
as you can see it's pretty precise and

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.050 
as you can see it's pretty precise and
can<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.209> imagine<00:02:20.470> 34<00:02:21.470> points<00:02:22.400> per<00:02:22.549> damage<00:02:22.879> per

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
can you imagine 34 points per damage per

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.330 
can you imagine 34 points per damage per

part the attachments are somewhat
difficult<00:02:41.269> to<00:02:41.689> choose<00:02:41.959> because<00:02:42.470> of<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:42.859> low

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
difficult to choose because of the low

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.520 
difficult to choose because of the low
side-to-side<00:02:43.489> recoil<00:02:43.909> and<00:02:44.390> high<00:02:44.599> penalty<00:02:45.109> the

side-to-side recoil and high penalty the
foregrip<00:02:45.889> is<00:02:46.069> not<00:02:46.340> recommended<00:02:46.970> so<00:02:47.329> take<00:02:47.540> a

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
foregrip is not recommended so take a

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.780 
foregrip is not recommended so take a
bipod<00:02:48.109> instead<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:49.069> heavy<00:02:49.220> barrel<00:02:49.430> should

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
bipod instead the heavy barrel should

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.210 
bipod instead the heavy barrel should
also<00:02:50.030> always<00:02:50.420> be<00:02:51.049> equipped<00:02:51.440> to<00:02:51.769> get<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.040> most

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
also always be equipped to get the most

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.460 
also always be equipped to get the most

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.410 
accuracy out of it lastly the sights
really<00:02:55.129> vary<00:02:55.370> between<00:02:55.579> your<00:02:55.940> play<00:02:56.180> style
