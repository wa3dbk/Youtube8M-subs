eating<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.060> we'd<00:01:52.049> been<00:01:52.229> doing<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:52.740> for

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
eating and we'd been doing this just for

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.219 
eating and we'd been doing this just for
a<00:01:52.950> couple<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.280> days<00:01:53.460> for<00:01:53.790> about<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.970> week<00:01:54.229> and

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
a couple of days for about a week and

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.410 
a couple of days for about a week and
he's<00:01:55.409> such<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.590> different<00:01:55.979> dog<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:56.969> promise

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
he's such a different dog and I promise

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.510 
he's such a different dog and I promise
you<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:58.290> know<00:01:58.409> he<00:01:58.649> has<00:01:58.920> been<00:01:59.130> he<00:01:59.369> was

growling when he came near he's already
changed<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.270> eventually<00:02:03.719> what<00:02:03.869> we'll<00:02:03.990> do<00:02:04.140> is

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
changed and eventually what we'll do is

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.050 
changed and eventually what we'll do is
we'll<00:02:04.860> sort<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.159> get<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.430> stage<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.939> can

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
we'll sort of get in the stage you can

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.639 
we'll sort of get in the stage you can
seize<00:02:06.240> happy<00:02:06.600> he's<00:02:06.719> fairly<00:02:07.020> happy<00:02:07.290> with<00:02:07.500> me

you eventually what you'd be able to do

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.520 
you eventually what you'd be able to do
is<00:02:13.030> you've<00:02:13.330> got<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.570> bring<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.960> handful<00:02:14.320> of<00:02:14.350> food

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
is you've got to bring a handful of food

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.900 
is you've got to bring a handful of food
over<00:02:14.740> and<00:02:14.890> just<00:02:15.010> say<00:02:15.160> to<00:02:15.190> him<00:02:15.370> do<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.520> sit<00:02:15.760> or

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
over and just say to him do a sit or

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.820 
over and just say to him do a sit or
something<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:16.510> drop<00:02:16.840> food<00:02:17.050> in<00:02:17.290> and

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
something and drop food in and

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.280 
something and drop food in and
eventually<00:02:18.340> you'll<00:02:18.940> get<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.240> stage<00:02:19.510> where

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
eventually you'll get the stage where

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.630 
eventually you'll get the stage where
you<00:02:20.380> can<00:02:20.530> just<00:02:20.680> push<00:02:20.830> them<00:02:21.010> off<00:02:21.130> once<00:02:21.370> they<00:02:21.460> get

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
you can just push them off once they get

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.530 
you can just push them off once they get
moved<00:02:22.120> away

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
moved away

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.860 
moved away
put<00:02:22.870> some<00:02:23.020> more<00:02:23.080> food<00:02:23.320> and<00:02:23.470> bring<00:02:24.160> it<00:02:24.250> down<00:02:24.870> but

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
put some more food and bring it down but

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.050 
put some more food and bring it down but
don't<00:02:26.020> rush<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.470> it's<00:02:27.160> worth<00:02:27.460> putting<00:02:27.820> this

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
don't rush it it's worth putting this

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.760 
don't rush it it's worth putting this
into<00:02:28.270> practice<00:02:28.510> if<00:02:28.840> you've<00:02:28.959> got<00:02:29.140> a<00:02:29.170> puppy<00:02:29.560> if

very<00:02:33.220> very<00:02:33.520> careful<00:02:33.760> I<00:02:34.090> would<00:02:34.300> not<00:02:34.570> try<00:02:34.930> this

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
very very careful I would not try this

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
adults but if you're wanting to know

adults but if you're wanting to know
what<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:42.910> can<00:02:42.940> do<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.570> help<00:02:43.810> develop<00:02:44.260> that

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
what you can do to help develop that

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.650 
what you can do to help develop that
sort<00:02:44.530> of<00:02:44.620> Tolerance<00:02:45.160> around<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.209> food<00:02:46.420> bowl

sort of Tolerance around the food bowl

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.110 
sort of Tolerance around the food bowl
that's<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.380> technique<00:02:47.739> that<00:02:48.010> I<00:02:48.040> would<00:02:48.340> or<00:02:48.850> one

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
that's the technique that I would or one

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
that's the technique that I would or one
of<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.300> techniques<00:02:49.660> that<00:02:49.720> I'd<00:02:49.870> be<00:02:49.959> putting

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
of the techniques that I'd be putting

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.170 
of the techniques that I'd be putting
into<00:02:50.350> practice<00:02:50.830> because<00:02:51.459> you<00:02:51.730> can<00:02:51.970> already

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
into practice because you can already

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.870 
into practice because you can already
see<00:02:52.480> he's<00:02:52.720> pretty<00:02:52.989> happy<00:02:53.400> with<00:02:54.400> us<00:02:54.580> coming

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
see he's pretty happy with us coming

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.970 
see he's pretty happy with us coming
close<00:02:55.090> because<00:02:55.330> he's<00:02:55.450> associated<00:02:55.810> my<00:02:56.680> hand

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
close because he's associated my hand

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.740 
close because he's associated my hand
and<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.250> ball<00:02:57.400> was<00:02:57.850> me<00:02:57.970> putting<00:02:58.300> food<00:02:58.510> in

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
and the ball was me putting food in

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.199 
and the ball was me putting food in
don't<00:02:59.620> like<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.400> said<00:03:00.550> just<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.820> reiterate

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
don't like I said just the reiterate

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.840 
don't like I said just the reiterate
don't<00:03:01.570> be<00:03:01.840> stupid<00:03:02.170> don't<00:03:03.130> start<00:03:03.550> trying<00:03:03.760> to

don't be stupid don't start trying to

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.180 
don't be stupid don't start trying to
pull<00:03:04.090> food<00:03:04.390> out<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:04.989> expect<00:03:05.470> him<00:03:05.709> to<00:03:05.770> be<00:03:06.010> happy

pull food out and expect him to be happy

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.310 
pull food out and expect him to be happy
about<00:03:06.400> that<00:03:06.580> he<00:03:06.880> won't<00:03:07.150> he<00:03:07.720> needs<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:08.050> make<00:03:08.200> the

about that he won't he needs to make the

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.260 
about that he won't he needs to make the
opposite<00:03:08.620> Association<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.670> association

opposite Association the association

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.720 
opposite Association the association
that<00:03:10.360> you<00:03:10.420> put<00:03:11.230> food<00:03:11.500> into<00:03:11.830> his<00:03:12.160> power<00:03:12.400> and

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
that you put food into his power and

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.479 
that you put food into his power and
then<00:03:13.600> it's<00:03:14.260> kind<00:03:14.500> of<00:03:14.560> almost<00:03:15.100> reverse

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
then it's kind of almost reverse

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.039 
then it's kind of almost reverse
psychology<00:03:16.120> when<00:03:16.239> he's<00:03:16.330> very<00:03:16.600> happy<00:03:16.930> with

psychology when he's very happy with
your<00:03:17.170> hand<00:03:17.410> being<00:03:17.590> near<00:03:17.769> the<00:03:17.890> bowl<00:03:18.040> then<00:03:18.580> you

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
your hand being near the bowl then you

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.340 
your hand being near the bowl then you
can<00:03:18.850> start<00:03:19.090> taking<00:03:19.269> it<00:03:19.540> away<00:03:19.630> putting<00:03:19.989> food<00:03:20.170> in

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
can start taking it away putting food in

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.590
