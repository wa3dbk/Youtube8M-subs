00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
anyone over it because they of all

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.179 
anyone over it because they of all
people<00:01:21.330> should<00:01:21.689> know<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.560> lawful<00:01:22.770> and

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
it's not really something they should be

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.570 
it's not really something they should be
hassling<00:01:24.810> people<00:01:25.200> over<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.250> think<00:01:26.490> they

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
hassling people over and I think they

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.100 
hassling people over and I think they
even<00:01:26.700> got<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.939> mandate<00:01:27.360> from<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.960> know<00:01:28.080> I

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
even got a mandate from the you know I

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.510 
even got a mandate from the you know I
think<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.560> Mayor<00:01:28.740> was<00:01:28.890> kind<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.220> even

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
think the Mayor was kind of even

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.960 
think the Mayor was kind of even
questioning<00:01:30.560> questioning<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.799> Manchester<00:01:32.790> PD

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
questioning questioning a Manchester PD

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.640 
questioning questioning a Manchester PD
about<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.689> thought<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.930> memo<00:01:34.259> went<00:01:34.500> out

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
about that and I thought a memo went out

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.780 
about that and I thought a memo went out
I<00:01:34.680> thought<00:01:34.950> they<00:01:35.100> weren't<00:01:35.250> doing<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.579> sort

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
I thought they weren't doing that sort

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.819 
I thought they weren't doing that sort
of<00:01:35.909> thing<00:01:36.000> anymore<00:01:36.530> maybe<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.650> was<00:01:37.740> because

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
of thing anymore maybe it was because

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:38.990 
of thing anymore maybe it was because
they<00:01:38.070> haven't<00:01:38.220> seen<00:01:38.430> these<00:01:38.579> young<00:01:38.820> men<00:01:38.970> and

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
they haven't seen these young men and

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.499 
they haven't seen these young men and
because<00:01:39.329> they<00:01:39.600> were<00:01:39.630> young<00:01:39.990> but<00:01:40.470> anyway<00:01:40.799> um

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
because they were young but anyway um
