00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.220
 we are in the summer and the economist priest borges of today brings a refreshing tip 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.219
 tasty in the current 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:35.319
 dessert is the boss for the whole year to start now 

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:39.939
 who is going to teach us is sure to do pf assume he also said that it is a 

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:42.440
 little different from traditional 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.600
 it's different first because we do not change the milk 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.649
 as main ingredient 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:48.340
 huh 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.810
 and we will use then amanda want to beat the regional ingredient 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.310
 is an ingredient in this way 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.500
 typically 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.590
 the heat 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.920
 and we will still present our revenue using a touch 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.110
 in this debate 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.550
 bangcoc 10 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.180
 It hurts 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.660
 not 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.820
 5 then write down the dessert ingredients a couple of times in each 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.180
 time the Indians chew sugar in August 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.700
 first we will go get the penta 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.810
 when you pass a cup of sugar a cup of water 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.140
 we take to the people by the time the sugar dissolves 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.439
 and turning me on with a macau pregnancy syrup I turn off 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.730
 and if need be we go cattle here 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.650
 and returned to playing the blender together with four mandates 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.990
 cut into cubes 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.010
 Let's put it here as the man 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.620
 Thank God she's a poor thing 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.779
 the fish is very interesting because it is bar 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:11.779
 but of course we do not use 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:15.009
 another type of ingredient 

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.369
 to give 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:20.139
 to awaken consciousness to him he is enough 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:24.069
 quite natural ' 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.679
 I will not use 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:28.969
 we have to face this now I'm going to put 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:32.400
 put the butter I will put the Arab wine 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:36.139
 he even interests me to be rejected 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:38.379
 December 12 put 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.379

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.789
 I put on August 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:51.689
 as I like the balance chant arrangements I'll put 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:53.809
 a spoon 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:55.279
 more or less 

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:58.629

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:59.989

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.629
 I discard nothing 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.629
 we can not let it in 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:09.789
 core security cardozo 

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:12.789
 liquefy 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.239
 ef 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.559
 hammer for three minutes 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:23.429
 until it forms a homogeneous mixture we now enter 

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:25.399
 we are going to put 

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:28.709
 To freeze, let's put some glasses 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.029
 look at setting up a dormitory 

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:34.109
 yes the absolute natural mind 'look how beautiful 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:40.109
 We can already put 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.499
 in individual letters that looks very beautiful 

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:48.869
 I'm going to put it in a big container case. I really like it. 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:51.269
 individual' 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.319
 now we will put 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.869
 in the freezer to stay in the consistency of ice cream moved 

00:03:57.869 --> 00:04:00.209
 need to generate for six hours 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.069
 spend a few hours 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.159
 enough time then 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.159
 for him as a jaguar 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.039
