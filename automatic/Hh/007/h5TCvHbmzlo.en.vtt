00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.400
 or not 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.840
 I do not know if to load or 'aces' but in 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.580
 the previous video I started making a 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.559
 series of tops about my games the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.269
 childhood and at the end of the video I had a 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.920
 small mishap either because of my 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.230
 nostalgia or on the merits of the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.480
 game I decided to make the number one 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.699
 become a habit and special is 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.930
 a previous mythical view and you do not know very 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.640
 well what you're doing here 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.250
 do not worry here I leave a link 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.090
 so that 's fine having said that 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.090
 let's start 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.860
 san andreas the game of my childhood by 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.899
 excellence where you could be repeating 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.910
 the same actions a thousand times and it was a 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:40.930
 world so organic and alive that you never 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.059
 he seemed to be living the same 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.210
 experience I will not talk about the story mode 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.760
 because surely you will all remember them 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.770
 no that nobody took to pass the game 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.170
 I am the only one that I know that only 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.360
 has finished and this has a simple 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.739
 explanation I will not define with just one 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.739
 word freedom 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.460
 not without freedom there was but look also 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.890
 three years after launch 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.990
 of grand theft auto ' 3 protest the put 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.360
 the app on the table and showed who the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.830
 had more fat got wet and developed a 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.530
 big top car in all 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.700
 aspects broke its own rules and it 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.649
 marked some new keys that 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.299
 they returned to throw to the success obtaining 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.490
 a great acceptance among the fans and not 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.020
 so fans in the big tunitas auto san 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.270
 Andreas is the game that best in sales 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.009
 of playstation 2 in addition to beating several 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.680
 records that appear in the guinness book 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.509
 of the records everything starts when Carl 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.729
 Johnson the protagonist of the game returns 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.170
 from his liberty city exile five years ago 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.610
 years that had already abandoned the saints 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.860
 to escape his life offender 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.659
 little mountain something interrupted his retirement 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.170
 because a rival band to his has killed 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.789
 to his mother 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.130
 cj which is what they call it colloquially 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.649
 his friends decides to go back then and he 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.060
 finds that everything has changed 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.890
 drugs are passing bills of their 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.539
 best childhood friends especially 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.280
 as a result of being hung all day 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.400
 by the angel dust and his family 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.470
 is dismembering completely 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.210
 we must embody the skin of cj for 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.280
 unify again the glow street 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.930
 families winning again the respect that 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.790
 had lost during his absence and 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.570
 doing little jobs for his ancients 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.570
 colleagues from the neighborhood 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.730
 but eye the story not only 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.260
 will develop in the neighborhoods of 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.300
 saints a city based on angels 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.590
 but our story will go 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.230
 developing by the state of san 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.880
 andreas inspired by california going on 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.590
 by San fiero and the adventures 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.810
 Inspired by San Francisco and Las Vegas 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.160
 respectively after a few 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.160
 unexpected plot twists 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.470
 oh god viguÃ©s multi riders have been 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.320
 gone to the side of the valleys and tempe ni 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:51.270
 oh sweet fuck and my colleagues are heading 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:53.160
 a trap fuck sweet you have been given no 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.050
 after a few unexpected turns in 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.390
 the cj script you've sent very subtly 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.640
 to the area of fierce sant there will be seen 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.370
 involved in Chinese Mexican magic as well 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.960
 that sir I do not want to focus more on the 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.730
 plot but there are very good turns 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.850
 arguments full of treason and 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.440
 difficult decisions 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.880
 as in any good crime story 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.620
 organized and bands will have a great 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.540
 number of characters that will contribute 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.280
 to the development of the plot each person 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.810
 that he had a personality marked from 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.370
 their first appearance with their respective 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.290
 reproductions 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.790
 the first characters that we 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.349
 we will cross in our way will be with 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.970
 two corrupt policemen who blamed us 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.640
 of a murder of a policeman that they 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.769
 themselves provoked frank in penny and eddie 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.659
 pulaski folded by samuel l.jackson and 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.610
 crispin our big brother suite 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:37.159
 obsessed with keeping the 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.690
 frikismo families and root of some young 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.790
 gangster marked with drugs 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.159
 as you see is a plot that tries 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.780
 pretend to be tough 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:46.909
 that affected in the 90's 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.769
 topics such as gang warfare or 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:51.890
 rivalries between the west coast and the 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:54.319
 east coast hip hop prostitution or 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.910
 the game obviously san andreas is not a 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.590
 rpg role play but they managed 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.780
 combine some aspects of the genre 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.340
 with the sandbox such as a catalog of 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.829
 overwhelming clothes body modifications 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.629
 hairstyles tuning practically 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.980
 any movie talking to our 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.840
 character will feel hungry and we should 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.640
 make him eat if we can also 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.470
 lose weight or get fat depending on what 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.209
 that we eat or increase our mass 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.870
 muscle in the gyms of the state of 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.489
 San Andreas 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.810
 the game has received numerous accolades 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.340
 for its technical achievements and its 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.229
 revolutionary style gameplay 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.300
 free but obviously social criticism 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:27.419
 was primed with this work by elements such as 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.310
 the drug mafia prostitution and the 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.479
 murder without counting a minigame 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.160
 secret in which you could keep 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.660
 sex with female skinny 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.280
 harshly censored and that could 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.290
 unlock using a mod in the 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.670
 versions of pc called hot coffee or 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.440
 hot coffee translated into spanish 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.570
 one of the great virtues of highlighting 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.980
 its network value and gap soundtrack between 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.510
 a large amplitude of radio stations 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.980
 we have to choose rock star 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.710
 selected the best of the music of 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.210
 the 80s the beginning of the 90s and we 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.920
 provided what for many is the best 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.470
 soundtrack of the room as a curiosity 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.360
 grandes auto san andreas has 156 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.860
 licensed songs that sound more 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.990
 of 10 stations throughout the game 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.849
 nothing more comforting than uploading to your 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.069
 ranchera and put that rose all 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:09.110
 volume while you go rumba 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:11.030
 Nowhere 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.410
 a topic to emphasize enough that 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.150
 becomes the greatest pastime for 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.480
 many of the inveterate players of 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.830
 gta were his revolutionary tricks 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.290
 with them you could practically do 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.180
 anything from changing your dough 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.360
 body to fly with any 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.580
 four wheel vehicle 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.469
 shifting the analysis to an opinion 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.569
 more personal the game despite having 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:34.030
 some books faults and important errors 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:35.500
 no player seems to care they were 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.240
 mistakes of the most friendly to me 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.710
 seem when we talk about books the 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.389
 first thing that comes to mind is the 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.219
 hole of the ceiling of the ignacio de antÃ³n 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.139
 which was to do the trick of 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:46.180
 jetpack and sneak into a small access 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.400
 from the roof to enter the underworld and 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.139
 from there see areas of the game or 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.950
 blocked or limited by the 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.600
 player 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.220
 the logic 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.630
 agree a few years of playing 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.310
 the saga on playstation with my cousin 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.600
 in players' module we discovered that 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.400
 a great community of fans of san 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.020
 andreas as we had developed 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.400
 a powerful massive multiplayer for the 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.620
 fish platform with which we 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.690
 they offered a complete summer of the center 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.160
 this game has enough chicha and 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.600
 anecdotes my head to write 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.669
 a book talking explicitly about 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.930
 but a video the more you try 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:18.669
 is not able to cover all my 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.010
 experiences and my experience with this 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:23.410
 title why I end with my 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.699
 first top 5 and my first reboot I hope 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:29.490
 that you have enjoyed with my company 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:29.490
 see you then taken care of and see you soon 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:34.199
 and
