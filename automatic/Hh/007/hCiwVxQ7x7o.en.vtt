sensational
I<00:00:40.800> just<00:00:41.219> think<00:00:41.340> sit<00:00:41.550> sit<00:00:41.730> because<00:00:41.850> they'll

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
I just think sit sit because they'll

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.180 
I just think sit sit because they'll
create<00:00:42.629> more<00:00:42.780> chances<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.350> win<00:00:43.500> more<00:00:43.680> points

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190

it<00:00:44.550> will<00:00:44.789> mean<00:00:44.940> agüero<00:00:45.360> basically<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.230> think

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
it will mean agüero basically I think

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.990 
it will mean agüero basically I think
overtaking<00:00:47.039> at<00:00:47.129> some<00:00:47.340> point<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:47.789> I'm<00:00:47.879> not

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
overtaking at some point but I'm not

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.060 
overtaking at some point but I'm not
sure<00:00:48.180> about<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.600> let's<00:00:49.530> hear<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.770> case<00:00:49.920> from

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
sure about that let's hear the case from

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.470 
sure about that let's hear the case from
Kerrigan<00:00:50.520> for<00:00:50.640> Suarez<00:00:50.969> by<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.180> sound<00:00:51.420> of

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
Kerrigan for Suarez by the sound of

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.910 
Kerrigan for Suarez by the sound of
things<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:51.989> if<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.140> look<00:00:52.260> at<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.410> think<00:00:52.530> Suarez

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
things but if you look at I think Suarez

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.560 
things but if you look at I think Suarez
is<00:00:53.010> top<00:00:53.160> scorer<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.550> know<00:00:53.670> how<00:00:54.059> many<00:00:54.149> games<00:00:54.360> he

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
is top scorer to know how many games he

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.910 
is top scorer to know how many games he
missed<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.899> start<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.320> season<00:00:55.500> if<00:00:55.860> we

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
missed the start of the season if we

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.770 
missed the start of the season if we
doing<00:00:56.129> games<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.520> goals<00:00:56.730> most<00:00:57.059> goals<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.629> mean

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
doing games the goals most goals I mean

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.569 
doing games the goals most goals I mean
if<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.620> ball<00:00:58.770> plays<00:00:58.980> through<00:00:59.219> ahead<00:00:59.430> at<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
if the ball plays through ahead at the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.139 
if the ball plays through ahead at the
moment<00:00:59.850> nobody

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
moment nobody

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.459 
moment nobody
I<00:01:00.329> think<00:01:00.570> he's<00:01:00.660> played<00:01:00.840> five<00:01:01.050> or<00:01:01.170> six<00:01:01.320> less

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
I think he's played five or six less

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.319 
I think he's played five or six less
games<00:01:01.680> he<00:01:01.859> was<00:01:02.160> badly<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.850> only<00:01:03.000> worry<00:01:03.180> was

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
games he was badly the only worry was

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.030 
games he was badly the only worry was
Luis<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.809> sort<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.199> stupid<00:01:04.409> bite<00:01:04.710> someone

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
Luis is sort of stupid bite someone

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.100 
Luis is sort of stupid bite someone
again<00:01:05.220> he<00:01:05.339> misses<00:01:05.640> ten<00:01:05.970> games<00:01:06.210> actually<00:01:06.450> if

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
again he misses ten games actually if

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.380 
again he misses ten games actually if
he's<00:01:07.320> if<00:01:08.130> he<00:01:08.250> behaves<00:01:08.400> himself<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:09.090> think<00:01:09.150> he'll

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
he's if he behaves himself I think he'll

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.570 
he's if he behaves himself I think he'll
be<00:01:09.510> he'll<00:01:09.630> be<00:01:09.750> top<00:01:09.900> scorer<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.350> he's<00:01:11.040> right<00:01:11.340> up

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
be he'll be top scorer and he's right up

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.160 
be he'll be top scorer and he's right up

what's<00:02:18.490> happened<00:02:18.700> with<00:02:18.760> Monaco<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.180> am<00:02:19.360> at<00:02:19.480> the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
what's happened with Monaco I am at the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.910 
what's happened with Monaco I am at the
moment<00:02:19.600> with<00:02:19.990> Chelsea<00:02:20.410> I'd<00:02:20.500> like<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:20.770> think

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
moment with Chelsea I'd like to think

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.250 
moment with Chelsea I'd like to think
that<00:02:21.160> maybe<00:02:21.790> he<00:02:21.970> will<00:02:22.210> come<00:02:22.270> eventually<00:02:22.690> but<00:02:23.050> I

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
that maybe he will come eventually but I

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.530 
that maybe he will come eventually but I
think<00:02:23.770> Suarez<00:02:24.100> is<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.460> sensational<00:02:25.090> statistic

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
think Suarez is a sensational statistic

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.910 
think Suarez is a sensational statistic
that<00:02:25.570> and<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:25.960> the<00:02:26.440> biggest<00:02:26.740> thing<00:02:26.830> about

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
that and that the biggest thing about

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.710 
that and that the biggest thing about
that<00:02:27.160> is<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.310> when<00:02:27.610> he<00:02:27.700> first<00:02:27.820> came<00:02:28.150> he

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
that is that when he first came he

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.150 
that is that when he first came he
wasn't<00:02:29.020> a<00:02:29.050> prolific<00:02:29.350> goalscorer<00:02:29.890> at

said<00:03:23.980> Suarez<00:03:24.489> I<00:03:24.580> thought<00:03:24.760> that<00:03:24.910> Liverpool<00:03:25.090> if

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720

said Suarez I thought that Liverpool if
they<00:03:25.870> lost<00:03:26.080> Suarez

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
they lost Suarez

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.860 
they lost Suarez
I<00:03:26.830> wondered<00:03:27.519> how<00:03:27.549> they<00:03:27.790> would<00:03:27.880> get<00:03:28.209> a<00:03:28.480> track

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
I wondered how they would get a track

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.210 
I wondered how they would get a track
it's<00:03:29.080> a<00:03:29.110> quite<00:03:29.320> a<00:03:29.350> player<00:03:29.650> of<00:03:29.830> that<00:03:29.860> quality

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
it's a quite a player of that quality

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.340 
it's a quite a player of that quality
absolutely<00:03:31.120> you<00:03:31.570> know<00:03:31.660> what<00:03:31.930> he's<00:03:32.049> doing<00:03:32.200> now

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
me see bail good Suarez become one of

the entire Liverpool greats

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.729 
the entire Liverpool greats
I<00:03:41.440> think<00:03:42.130> he<00:03:42.220> could<00:03:42.430> I<00:03:42.750> think<00:03:43.750> in<00:03:44.049> terms<00:03:44.530> of

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
I think he could I think in terms of

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.770 
I think he could I think in terms of
ability<00:03:45.190> as<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.310> player<00:03:45.670> I<00:03:45.970> think<00:03:46.480> he<00:03:46.540> could<00:03:46.750> be

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
ability as a player I think he could be

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.210 
ability as a player I think he could be
the<00:03:46.900> best<00:03:46.989> player<00:03:47.230> feel<00:03:47.620> of<00:03:47.680> a<00:03:47.739> building<00:03:47.980> teams

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
the best player feel of a building teams

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.800 
the best player feel of a building teams
of<00:03:48.370> there's<00:03:48.730> natural<00:03:49.150> ability<00:03:49.510> what<00:03:49.690> was

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
of there's natural ability what was

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.039 
of there's natural ability what was

seeing week in week out but I think to

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.470 
seeing week in week out but I think to
