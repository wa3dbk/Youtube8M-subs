basketball<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.309> ball<00:00:38.489> where<00:00:38.730> you're<00:00:39.120> on

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
basketball in that ball where you're on

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.340

around looking to put it into a basket

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.700 
around looking to put it into a basket
but<00:00:42.450> it's<00:00:42.690> significantly<00:00:43.200> different<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.649> that

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
but it's significantly different in that

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.130 
but it's significantly different in that
it<00:00:44.280> places<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.820> greater<00:00:45.059> emphasis<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.690> skill

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
it places a greater emphasis on skill

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.279 
it places a greater emphasis on skill
and<00:00:46.350> agility<00:00:46.590> over<00:00:47.579> height<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:47.940> strength<00:00:48.289> and

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
and agility over height and strength and

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.450 
and agility over height and strength and
a<00:00:49.350> particular<00:00:49.800> thing<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.070> you'd<00:00:50.160> notice

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
a particular thing that you'd notice

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.680 
a particular thing that you'd notice
straightaway<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.390> different<00:00:51.539> from

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
straightaway that is different from

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.900 
straightaway that is different from
other<00:00:51.930> sports<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.649> mixed<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.070> on<00:00:53.789> each

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
other sports as it's mixed and on each

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.729 
other sports as it's mixed and on each
team<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.239> four<00:00:54.420> guys<00:00:54.600> four<00:00:54.870> girls<00:00:55.079> who<00:00:55.649> were

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
team is four guys four girls who were

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.200 
team is four guys four girls who were
competing<00:00:56.190> against<00:00:56.460> four<00:00:56.640> guys<00:00:56.789> four<00:00:57.030> girls

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
competing against four guys four girls

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.000 
competing against four guys four girls
how<00:00:57.420> does<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.600> work<00:00:57.870> cuz<00:00:58.140> i've<00:00:58.260> been<00:00:58.890> in

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
how does that work cuz i've been in

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.410 
how does that work cuz i've been in
mixed<00:00:59.250> scenes<00:00:59.430> before<00:00:59.609> i<00:00:59.760> never<00:01:00.059> get<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.270> ball

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
mixed scenes before i never get the ball

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.939 
mixed scenes before i never get the ball
well<00:01:00.899> that's<00:01:01.320> probably<00:01:01.500> because<00:01:01.739> you're

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
well that's probably because you're

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.349 
well that's probably because you're
playing<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.309> game<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.000> hadn't<00:01:03.270> been

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
playing a game that hadn't been

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.329 
playing a game that hadn't been
specifically<00:01:03.870> designed<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.619> be<00:01:04.860> mixed<00:01:05.100> and

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
specifically designed to be mixed and

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.370 
specifically designed to be mixed and
the<00:01:06.270> sport<00:01:06.479> was<00:01:06.600> invented<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.990> hundred<00:01:07.229> years

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
the sport was invented a hundred years

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.929 
the sport was invented a hundred years
ago<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.680> by<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> Dutch<00:01:08.070> schoolteacher<00:01:08.520> but<00:01:08.820> what

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
ago is by a Dutch schoolteacher but what

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.550 
ago is by a Dutch schoolteacher but what
kind<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.450> leagues<00:01:09.750> are<00:01:10.110> there<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.530> world

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
kind of leagues are there in the world

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.010 
kind of leagues are there in the world
and<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.580> case<00:01:11.760> well<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.510> UK<00:01:12.810> we've

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
and in this case well in the UK we've

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.780 
and in this case well in the UK we've
got<00:01:13.140> three<00:01:13.350> national<00:01:13.770> leagues<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.549> think

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
got three national leagues and I think

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.700 
got three national leagues and I think
was<00:01:14.909> probably<00:01:15.060> about<00:01:15.600> 10<00:01:15.960> regional<00:01:16.500> leagues

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
was probably about 10 regional leagues

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.990 
was probably about 10 regional leagues
all<00:01:16.890> around<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.159> country<00:01:17.280> from<00:01:17.640> from

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
all around the country from from

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.670 
all around the country from from
Manchester<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.630> Norwich<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.140> Wales<00:01:19.380> to

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
Manchester to Norwich to Wales to

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.170 
Manchester to Norwich to Wales to
Scotland<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.340> how<00:01:20.520> come<00:01:20.670> no<00:01:20.790> one<00:01:20.909> knows<00:01:21.030> about

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
Scotland so how come no one knows about

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.719 
Scotland so how come no one knows about
okay<00:01:21.570> well<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.619> not<00:01:22.890> something<00:01:23.490> that

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
okay well it's not something that

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.429 
okay well it's not something that
generally<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.360> press<00:01:24.630> tend<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.930> get<00:01:25.020> hold<00:01:25.259> of

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
generally the press tend to get hold of

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.969 
generally the press tend to get hold of
because<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.430> not<00:01:26.549> football<00:01:27.290> and<00:01:28.290> with<00:01:28.799> was

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979

ladies<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.310> hauls<00:01:29.579> out<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.210> way<00:01:30.329> we're

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
ladies and hauls out of the way we're

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.210 
ladies and hauls out of the way we're
nobody<00:01:30.780> turns<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.200> see<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.530> but<00:01:31.799> when<00:01:31.950> people

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
nobody turns to see it but when people
