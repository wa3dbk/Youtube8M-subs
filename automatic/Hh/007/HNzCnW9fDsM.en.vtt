blur<00:02:50.640> level<00:02:50.970> 2<00:02:51.569> 25<00:02:51.989> so<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.260> could<00:02:52.440> then<00:02:52.590> identify

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
blur level 2 25 so I could then identify

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.130 
blur level 2 25 so I could then identify
runners<00:02:53.579> and<00:02:53.790> then<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.239> decided<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.900> was<00:02:54.989> time

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
runners and then I decided it was time

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.229 
runners and then I decided it was time
to<00:02:55.200> start<00:02:55.470> making<00:02:55.560> back<00:02:56.010> with<00:02:56.280> units<00:02:56.670> at<00:02:57.090> the

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
they were about 300 GP each so i could

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.319 
they were about 300 GP each so i could
