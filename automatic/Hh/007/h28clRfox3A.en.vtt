00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
 ah 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.580
 and now we're not going with our segment of 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.119
 lifestyle the toyota fan tutte ' 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.790
 drive 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.250
 thanks to toyota are not just excursions 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.280
 in the interior of the country in charge of a lot 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.190
 mendoza the father of the national road and 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.830
 of Luis will see or also now offer us 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.980
 tips in good driving and in this case 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:52.089
 we will have the previous one to roads of the inka 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:55.540
 the Peruvian race is already going to meet 50 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:58.030
 years is all the preparation of the 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.400
 toyota team to face this mythical 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.610
 Peruvian test that runs for seven 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.350
 days the main points of the country 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.080
 We visited a lot of Mendoza from his 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.560
 operation center in the spa of 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.560
 san bartolo 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.040
 critical part in the preparation of the car 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.470
 for English roads the burden of 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.030
 fuel in this case we're going to use a 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.920
 tank that was used in the dakar is also 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.470
 I have placed a pipe here behind a 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.420
 film 6 of 40 gallons and that will give us 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.920
 an autonomy of plus or minus 500 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.259
 kilometers because we use the tank 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.289
 original too and we will load with 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.090
 all the luggage full more or less 50 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.340
 gallons of fuel to be able 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.860
 finish the long stages without having to 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.329
 stop to restock in career in this 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.409
 case of roads of the inka is going to have a 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.479
 series of links that will allow us 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.920
 charge a little more quietly but 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.539
 basically what you need to have 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.030
 a good autonomy that allows you 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.429
 run long stages without stopping to 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.409
 change to refuel because every 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.470
 load involve between 4 and 5 minutes 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.380
 lost against your time part of 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.599
 the fun of this Inca road and 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.000
 of the above is also to share 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:08.250
 with all of you that's why we have 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.229
 these little camera was bought this car is going to 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.120
 bring three cameras in this edition one 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.920
 looking back one inside the 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.740
 cabin and one more in the bumper 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.420
 forward to be able to transmit 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.380
 all the emotions of the great train of 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.380
 Inca road where is 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.210
 key part of this whole adventure are 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.910
 the shoes that we go to the cj crisis 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.310
 in the tires in this case we have two 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.860
 types of tires the twitter the magazine 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.680
 on winner atte for all sections of 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.930
 earth is a tire that many people use 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.150
 of you in your 4x4 every day is 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.010
 a practically street tire that goes 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.260
 to be subjected to terrible stress 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.720
 for many kilometers of gravel from 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.420
 stones of trail ways how many 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.550
 tires we use basically we change a 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.260
 face of a game every day is to say yes no 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.360
 we had no puncture any 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.750
 no problem of high would be used 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.910
 four tires each stage and they are three 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.550
 stages of land with what we have a 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.650
 total of 12 dirt tires to use 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.240
 on an inka roads taking into account 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.910
 that things go perfectly well 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.040
 we usually arrive between 16 and 18 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.709
 so many to be able to have a good respect 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.020
 and these friends here are the tires 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.820
 that are used in asphalt if you see the 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.580
 profile of the tire the distance there 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.920
 between the rim and the rim and in this case 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.769
 it is much less there is no antar or 20 this 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.760
 is through the 16 but they maintain almost 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.560
 the same shot 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.930
 that is the total circumference of the 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.129
 rim is almost the same with which the 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.110
 transmission ratio can be 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.269
 keep in this case by having a profile 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.040
 more chatito what it allows is to fold 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.840
 much better the adherence that has 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.090
 about missing much better really not 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.780
 they spend so much we use in all roads 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.260
 of the inka that has more or less 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.170
 of 300 thousand 400 kilometers of asphalt 6 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.400
 tires if I had no problem 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.569
 we're practically going to use the four 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.709
 that are set and we should not 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.810
 change not one more 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.550
 this is already has an Inca road and it 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.020
 they go for their second line also with 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.560
 the quality of vision of always of the 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.560
 videos h 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.629
 in another member of the team besides 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.159
 the other race is at least one car 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:28.349
 of assistance in this case the toyota 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:30.300
 Hylux is the perfect car to do 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:31.620
 this mission is very robust has a 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.940
 good load capacity can go 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.159
 four people comfortably seated 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.810
 inside it's really going to go three nothing 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:38.789
 plus our team is five people 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.190
 and it can take all the things that 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:42.840
 we need for car assistance 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.729
 in the days of attendance and for the 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.889
 replenishment of the race car in the 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.360
 long stages where will you have to 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.159
 return to fuel during each 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.810
 stage maybe have some rim 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:54.090
 spare extra some assistance 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.650
 fast we can have thanks to lucho 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.840
 for sharing the information for 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.080
 next week a special report with 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:04.289
 the tests of the fjd toyota here in 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.800
 phantom drive and good luck on roads 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.800
 of the inka
