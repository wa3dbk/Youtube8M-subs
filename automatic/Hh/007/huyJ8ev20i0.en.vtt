00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
is we hire arborists and the arborist do

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.069 
is we hire arborists and the arborist do
come<00:02:29.440> out<00:02:29.590> they<00:02:29.799> do<00:02:29.860> an<00:02:30.040> inspection<00:02:30.250> of<00:02:30.640> trees

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
come out they do an inspection of trees

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.110 
come out they do an inspection of trees
generally<00:02:32.079> only<00:02:32.530> cut<00:02:32.860> trees<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.640> are<00:02:33.670> in<00:02:33.910> bad

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
generally only cut trees that are in bad

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.270 
generally only cut trees that are in bad
shape<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.959> not<00:02:35.170> doing<00:02:35.440> well<00:02:35.590> there<00:02:36.130> were

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
shape and not doing well there were

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.180 
shape and not doing well there were
dozens<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.329> dozens<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.870> trees<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:38.410> this<00:02:38.890> park

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
dozens and dozens of trees and this park

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.880 
dozens and dozens of trees and this park
alone<00:02:39.459> that<00:02:40.150> we're<00:02:40.510> not<00:02:40.840> doing<00:02:41.140> well<00:02:41.320> they

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
alone that we're not doing well they

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.770 
alone that we're not doing well they
were<00:02:41.950> dead<00:02:42.310> they<00:02:42.340> had<00:02:42.670> dead<00:02:42.910> limbs<00:02:43.180> so<00:02:43.450> we<00:02:43.570> take

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
were dead they had dead limbs so we take

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.330 
were dead they had dead limbs so we take
those<00:02:44.019> out<00:02:44.290> because<00:02:44.590> we<00:02:44.739> don't<00:02:44.920> want<00:02:45.100> a<00:02:45.190> dead

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
those out because we don't want a dead

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.100 
those out because we don't want a dead
tree<00:02:45.579> to<00:02:45.700> fall<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:46.150> all<00:02:46.390> these<00:02:46.720> kids<00:02:46.870> who<00:02:47.079> are

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
tree to fall and all these kids who are

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.590 
tree to fall and all these kids who are
finding<00:02:47.530> or<00:02:47.650> adults<00:02:47.829> or<00:02:48.070> whoever<00:02:48.280> else<00:02:48.600> the

finding or adults or whoever else the

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.660 
finding or adults or whoever else the
way<00:02:49.780> we<00:02:49.989> install<00:02:50.440> our<00:02:50.620> system<00:02:51.100> is<00:02:51.340> really

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
way we install our system is really

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.150 
way we install our system is really
unique<00:02:52.030> we<00:02:52.600> actually<00:02:52.930> use<00:02:53.049> no<00:02:53.260> machines<00:02:53.620> but

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
unique we actually use no machines but

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.530 
unique we actually use no machines but
we<00:02:54.340> wedge<00:02:54.670> all<00:02:55.030> our<00:02:55.450> platforms<00:02:56.290> in<00:02:56.500> so

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
we wedge all our platforms in so

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.080 
we wedge all our platforms in so
literally<00:02:58.540> some<00:02:59.260> of<00:02:59.410> our<00:02:59.530> guys<00:02:59.769> our<00:03:00.250> build

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
literally some of our guys our build

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.920 
literally some of our guys our build
crew<00:03:01.360> will<00:03:01.870> climb<00:03:02.290> up<00:03:02.560> there<00:03:03.060> with<00:03:04.060> harnesses

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
crew will climb up there with harnesses

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.789 
crew will climb up there with harnesses
and<00:03:05.200> ropes<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.799> they<00:03:06.370> will<00:03:06.549> pull<00:03:06.970> their

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
and ropes and they will pull their

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.080 
and ropes and they will pull their
platforms<00:03:08.799> up<00:03:09.010> any<00:03:09.310> of<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.519> material<00:03:09.970> they

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
platforms up any of the material they

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.060 
platforms up any of the material they
need<00:03:10.269> to<00:03:10.359> build<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.690> platforms<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.440> they

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
need to build the platforms and they

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.250 
need to build the platforms and they
build<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:12.549> while<00:03:12.790> they're<00:03:13.000> in<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.209> air<00:03:13.359> the

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
build it while they're in the air the

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.470 
build it while they're in the air the
trees<00:03:14.620> are<00:03:14.650> not<00:03:15.130> harmed<00:03:15.459> we<00:03:15.579> don't<00:03:15.760> drill<00:03:16.180> into

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
trees are not harmed we don't drill into

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.449 
trees are not harmed we don't drill into
trees<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:17.110> old<00:03:17.290> style<00:03:17.590> was<00:03:17.920> these<00:03:18.129> to<00:03:18.280> put

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
trees the old style was these to put

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:19.990 
trees the old style was these to put
these<00:03:18.610> big<00:03:18.849> bolts<00:03:19.269> in<00:03:19.420> so

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
these big bolts in so

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.970 
these big bolts in so
one<00:03:20.120> when<00:03:20.690> you<00:03:20.780> do<00:03:20.930> some<00:03:21.110> close-up<00:03:21.500> shots<00:03:21.740> you

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
one when you do some close-up shots you

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.770 
one when you do some close-up shots you
will<00:03:22.100> see<00:03:22.340> that<00:03:22.580> we<00:03:22.790> are<00:03:22.820> wrapping<00:03:23.450> around<00:03:23.540> the

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
will see that we are wrapping around the

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.930 
will see that we are wrapping around the
tree<00:03:23.990> and<00:03:24.170> we<00:03:24.680> use<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:25.010> tension<00:03:25.550> to<00:03:25.640> keep<00:03:25.790> it

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
tree and we use the tension to keep it

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.690 
tree and we use the tension to keep it
up<00:03:26.060> there<00:03:26.270> it<00:03:26.960> also<00:03:27.110> allows<00:03:27.560> us<00:03:27.830> each<00:03:28.040> year<00:03:28.460> or

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
up there it also allows us each year or

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.610 
up there it also allows us each year or
every<00:03:29.210> six<00:03:29.570> months<00:03:29.840> or<00:03:29.930> so<00:03:29.990> when<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.380> trees

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
every six months or so when the trees

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.520 
every six months or so when the trees
grow<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.790> adjust<00:03:32.360> our<00:03:32.540> platforms<00:03:33.170> for<00:03:33.410> the

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
grow to adjust our platforms for the

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.620 
grow to adjust our platforms for the
growth<00:03:33.740> of<00:03:33.770> the<00:03:34.010> tree<00:03:34.160> so<00:03:34.970> it<00:03:35.090> helps<00:03:35.450> maintain

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
growth of the tree so it helps maintain

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.070 
growth of the tree so it helps maintain
its<00:03:36.050> health<00:03:36.310> we<00:03:37.310> have<00:03:37.400> parks<00:03:37.700> open<00:03:37.910> this<00:03:38.240> is<00:03:38.450> in

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
its health we have parks open this is in

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.080 
its health we have parks open this is in
United<00:03:39.650> States<00:03:39.709> ready<00:03:40.070> for<00:03:40.250> 67<00:03:40.730> years<00:03:40.880> the

United States ready for 67 years the

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.660 
United States ready for 67 years the
trees<00:03:41.300> are<00:03:41.450> doing<00:03:41.630> great<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:42.140> also<00:03:43.130> this<00:03:43.520> is<00:03:43.640> a

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
trees are doing great and also this is a

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.210 
trees are doing great and also this is a
very<00:03:43.940> big<00:03:44.180> thing<00:03:44.450> in<00:03:44.660> Europe<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:45.110> they<00:03:45.770> built

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
very big thing in Europe and they built

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.520 
very big thing in Europe and they built
a<00:03:46.310> lot<00:03:46.459> of<00:03:46.580> ways<00:03:46.820> this<00:03:47.120> like<00:03:47.450> this<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:47.959> it<00:03:48.380> does

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
a lot of ways this like this and it does

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.740 
a lot of ways this like this and it does
very<00:03:48.740> well<00:03:48.860> we<00:03:49.760> found<00:03:49.940> out<00:03:50.180> from<00:03:50.390> Park

do is we bring together people from
different<00:04:05.120> backgrounds<00:04:05.270> people<00:04:05.900> of<00:04:05.959> climbing

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
different backgrounds people of climbing

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.100 
different backgrounds people of climbing
backgrounds<00:04:06.980> people<00:04:07.280> who<00:04:07.430> have<00:04:07.610> been<00:04:07.640> in<00:04:08.110> all

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
backgrounds people who have been in all

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.990

kinds<00:04:09.170> of<00:04:09.530> different<00:04:09.590> fields<00:04:10.040> before<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:10.790> we

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
kinds of different fields before and we

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.690 
kinds of different fields before and we
give<00:04:11.150> them<00:04:11.300> an<00:04:11.540> idea<00:04:11.840> of<00:04:12.220> what<00:04:13.220> it's<00:04:13.370> like<00:04:13.520> to

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
give them an idea of what it's like to

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.820 
give them an idea of what it's like to
be<00:04:13.790> a<00:04:13.820> monitor<00:04:14.270> so<00:04:14.780> basically<00:04:15.320> what<00:04:15.440> monitors
