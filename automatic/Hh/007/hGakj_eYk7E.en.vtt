comes<00:02:34.660> in<00:02:34.810> very<00:02:34.990> handy<00:02:39.900> solder<00:02:40.900> gun<00:02:41.020> if<00:02:41.800> you

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
comes in very handy solder gun if you

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.280 
comes in very handy solder gun if you
have<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.220> soldering<00:02:42.550> iron<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:43.240> probably<00:02:44.140> use

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
have the soldering iron you probably use

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.930 
have the soldering iron you probably use
that<00:02:44.320> instead

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.860 

staple<00:02:48.940> gun<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:51.640> can<00:02:51.820> use<00:02:51.850> this<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.390> secure

some<00:02:53.080> of<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.260> wires<00:02:53.470> within<00:02:53.800> there

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
some of the wires within there

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.790 
some of the wires within there
it's<00:02:55.480> really<00:02:55.720> good<00:02:55.930> if<00:02:56.050> your<00:02:56.200> staple<00:02:56.530> gun<00:02:56.650> will

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
it's really good if your staple gun will

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.540 
it's really good if your staple gun will
take<00:02:57.630> staples<00:02:58.630> for<00:02:59.230> wires<00:02:59.740> specifically

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
take staples for wires specifically

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.600 
take staples for wires specifically
they've<00:03:00.700> got<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:00.910> rounded<00:03:01.500> side<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.770> them<00:03:02.950> so

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
they've got a rounded side to them so

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.470 
they've got a rounded side to them so
that<00:03:03.640> they<00:03:03.760> don't<00:03:03.910> cut<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.959> wires<00:03:09.360> you<00:03:10.360> can

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
that they don't cut the wires you can

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.810 
that they don't cut the wires you can
use<00:03:10.690> a<00:03:10.720> circular<00:03:11.020> saw

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
use a circular saw

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.290
