00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.779 
the idea here is that you're playing a
hot<00:00:24.230> pursuit<00:00:24.409> event<00:00:24.919> you<00:00:25.159> get<00:00:25.279> to<00:00:25.400> chase<00:00:25.609> down

down the race before the racers cross
the<00:00:30.109> finish<00:00:30.409> line<00:00:30.439> so<00:00:30.829> that<00:00:31.009> involves<00:00:31.699> you

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
the finish line so that involves you

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.090 
the finish line so that involves you

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
racers and it's also great drifting a

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.480 
racers and it's also great drifting a
great<00:01:08.630> way<00:01:08.810> of<00:01:08.840> making<00:01:09.140> dark<00:01:09.650> horse<00:01:09.920> easier

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
and getting a faster time is to use

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.170 
and getting a faster time is to use
boost<00:01:12.800> as<00:01:13.100> often<00:01:13.400> as<00:01:13.550> possible<00:01:13.730> and

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
boost as often as possible and

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.910 
boost as often as possible and
definitely<00:01:14.900> use<00:01:15.140> boost<00:01:15.440> when<00:01:15.590> you're<00:01:15.710> about

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920
