these different organisms okay and the
first<00:00:42.930> before<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.260> do<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.440> I'm<00:00:43.800> gonna<00:00:43.950> explain

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
first before I do that I'm gonna explain

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.279 
first before I do that I'm gonna explain
to<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.820> viruses<00:00:45.629> are<00:00:46.100> neither

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
to you that viruses are neither

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:51.470 
to you that viruses are neither
prokaryotic<00:00:49.289> or<00:00:49.649> eukaryotic<00:00:50.010> viruses<00:00:50.489> are<00:00:51.149> in

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
prokaryotic or eukaryotic viruses are in

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.479 
prokaryotic or eukaryotic viruses are in
their<00:00:51.600> own<00:00:51.629> sub<00:00:52.199> system<00:00:53.039> they're<00:00:53.250> their<00:00:53.399> own

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
their own sub system they're their own

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.790 
their own sub system they're their own
species<00:00:54.170> viruses<00:00:55.170> are<00:00:55.289> not<00:00:55.320> actually<00:00:55.770> a

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
species viruses are not actually a

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.760 
species viruses are not actually a
living<00:00:56.190> virus<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.789> actually<00:00:57.149> dead<00:00:57.620> one<00:00:58.620> thing

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
living virus is actually dead one thing

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.229 
living virus is actually dead one thing
that's<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.430> want<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.699> tell<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.940> guys<00:01:00.090> about

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
that's I want to tell you guys about

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.420 
that's I want to tell you guys about
viruses<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.050> they<00:01:01.559> their<00:01:02.070> mode<00:01:02.399> of

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
viruses that they their mode of

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.929 
viruses that they their mode of
replication<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.710> can<00:01:04.710> be<00:01:04.949> very<00:01:04.979> very

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
replication is can be very very

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.399 
replication is can be very very
interesting<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.600> because<00:01:06.869> they<00:01:07.020> can<00:01:07.260> either

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
interesting it's because they can either

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.280 
interesting it's because they can either
do<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.770> through<00:01:07.890> DNA<00:01:08.820> or<00:01:09.180> any<00:01:09.390> replication

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.670 

viruses<00:01:13.290> are<00:01:13.640> have<00:01:14.640> been<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.150> lot<00:01:15.509> around<00:01:15.689> since

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
viruses are have been a lot around since

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.179 
viruses are have been a lot around since
the<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.549> guess<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.509> dawn<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.900> creation<00:01:19.380> you

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
the I guess the dawn of creation you

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.359 
the I guess the dawn of creation you
could<00:01:20.369> say<00:01:21.140> there<00:01:22.140> they<00:01:22.500> mode<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.040> mode<00:01:23.220> of

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
could say there they mode the mode of

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.030 
could say there they mode the mode of
replication<00:01:24.299> for<00:01:24.479> them<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.780> by<00:01:25.020> invading<00:01:25.590> a

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
replication for them is by invading a

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.390 
replication for them is by invading a
host<00:01:26.790> cell<00:01:27.180> either<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.630> be<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.840> bacteria<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.799> you

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
host cell either it be a bacteria a you

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.690 
host cell either it be a bacteria a you
bacteria<00:01:29.970> or<00:01:30.479> eukaryote<00:01:32.390> okay<00:01:33.390> so

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
bacteria or eukaryote okay so

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.389 
bacteria or eukaryote okay so
and<00:01:34.789> just<00:01:35.210> know<00:01:35.329> that<00:01:35.360> okay<00:01:35.719> and<00:01:36.399> bacteria

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
and just know that okay and bacteria

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.029 
and just know that okay and bacteria
itself<00:01:37.789> is<00:01:38.060> a<00:01:38.090> prokaryote<00:01:38.689> meaning<00:01:39.170> that<00:01:39.380> it

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
itself is a prokaryote meaning that it

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.209 
itself is a prokaryote meaning that it
is<00:01:40.450> one<00:01:41.450> celled<00:01:41.750> organism<00:01:42.200> or<00:01:42.530> very<00:01:42.829> simple

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:43.219 
is one celled organism or very simple

organism and fungi and protozoa ailments

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.080 
organism and fungi and protozoa ailments
are<00:01:48.619> eukaryotes<00:01:49.369> meaning<00:01:49.820> they<00:01:49.939> have

are eukaryotes meaning they have

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.929 
are eukaryotes meaning they have
multiple<00:01:50.329> cells<00:01:50.860> and<00:01:51.860> are<00:01:52.130> far<00:01:52.399> more<00:01:52.429> complex

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
multiple cells and are far more complex

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.029 
multiple cells and are far more complex
in<00:01:53.679> development<00:01:54.679> and<00:01:55.780> interior<00:01:56.780> design<00:01:57.140> where

in development and interior design where

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.880 
in development and interior design where
do<00:01:58.130> they<00:01:58.250> go<00:01:58.579> chaotic<00:01:59.030> bacteria<00:01:59.630> so<00:02:00.469> I'm<00:02:00.649> going

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
do they go chaotic bacteria so I'm going

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.940 
do they go chaotic bacteria so I'm going
to<00:02:00.920> tell<00:02:01.159> you<00:02:01.250> guys<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:03.170> different<00:02:03.469> aspects

okay so first let's begin with cells in

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.630 
okay so first let's begin with cells in
viruses<00:02:20.810> we<00:02:21.019> have<00:02:21.230> we<00:02:21.470> see<00:02:21.650> no<00:02:21.890> cells<00:02:22.160> in<00:02:22.459> the

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
viruses we have we see no cells in the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.930 
viruses we have we see no cells in the
bacteria<00:02:23.030> we<00:02:23.180> do<00:02:23.480> see<00:02:23.690> cells<00:02:23.930> in<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.799> fungi<00:02:25.250> we

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
bacteria we do see cells in the fungi we

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.180 
bacteria we do see cells in the fungi we
do<00:02:26.120> see<00:02:26.299> cells<00:02:26.569> and<00:02:26.840> Britta's<00:02:27.500> oh<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:27.799> hummons

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
do see cells and Britta's oh and hummons

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.759 
do see cells and Britta's oh and hummons
which<00:02:28.430> are<00:02:28.610> eukaryotes<00:02:29.180> yes<00:02:30.049> we<00:02:30.260> do<00:02:30.380> see<00:02:30.530> cells

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
which are eukaryotes yes we do see cells

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.289 
which are eukaryotes yes we do see cells
and<00:02:31.099> the<00:02:31.519> approximate<00:02:32.180> diameter<00:02:33.280> in<00:02:34.280> p.m.<00:02:35.120> s

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
and the approximate diameter in p.m. s

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.440 
and the approximate diameter in p.m. s
the<00:02:35.870> viruses<00:02:36.319> are<00:02:36.530> within<00:02:37.390> 0.02<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.870> 0.2<00:02:39.560> p.m.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
the viruses are within 0.02 to 0.2 p.m.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.990 
the viruses are within 0.02 to 0.2 p.m.
bacteria<00:02:41.450> is<00:02:41.600> 1:00<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:42.079> 5:00<00:02:42.260> p.m.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
bacteria is 1:00 to 5:00 p.m.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.020 
bacteria is 1:00 to 5:00 p.m.
fungi<00:02:44.000> is<00:02:44.650> about<00:02:45.650> maybe<00:02:45.859> 3<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.340> 10<00:02:46.519> p.m.<00:02:46.850> which

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
fungi is about maybe 3 to 10 p.m. which

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.729 
fungi is about maybe 3 to 10 p.m. which
is<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.180> lot<00:02:47.420> larger<00:02:47.660> if<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:47.930> notice<00:02:48.260> that<00:02:49.569> it's

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
is a lot larger if you notice that it's

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.250 
is a lot larger if you notice that it's
compared<00:02:51.739> to<00:02:51.889> the<00:02:52.130> bacteria<00:02:52.579> it's<00:02:52.700> 3<00:02:53.329> 3<00:02:53.989> 10

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
compared to the bacteria it's 3 3 10

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.740 
compared to the bacteria it's 3 3 10
times<00:02:54.530> larger<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:56.030> producer<00:02:56.329> hummons

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
times larger and the producer hummons

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.319 
times larger and the producer hummons
such<00:02:57.139> a<00:02:57.230> great<00:02:57.380> example<00:02:57.769> of<00:02:57.799> eukaryote<00:02:58.329> is

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
such a great example of eukaryote is

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.809 
such a great example of eukaryote is
from<00:02:59.690> 1525<00:03:00.530> PMS

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
from 1525 PMS

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.970 
from 1525 PMS
a<00:03:01.879> lot<00:03:02.480> larger<00:03:02.659> she<00:03:02.900> noticed<00:03:03.319> that<00:03:03.349> past<00:03:03.680> them

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
a lot larger she noticed that past them

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.879 
a lot larger she noticed that past them
the<00:03:04.670> largest<00:03:04.969> organism<00:03:05.569> gets<00:03:05.719> the<00:03:06.560> more

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
the largest organism gets the more

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:11.129 
the largest organism gets the more
complex<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:07.849> the<00:03:07.999> more<00:03:09.189> eukaryotic<00:03:10.189> it<00:03:10.400> is

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
complex and the more eukaryotic it is

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.500 
complex and the more eukaryotic it is
nucleic<00:03:12.139> acid<00:03:12.620> okay<00:03:13.099> so<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.909> viruses<00:03:14.329> they

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
nucleic acid okay so the viruses they

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.039 
nucleic acid okay so the viruses they
either<00:03:14.810> have<00:03:15.260> DNA<00:03:15.650> or<00:03:15.950> RNA<00:03:16.269> but<00:03:17.269> for<00:03:17.569> bacteria

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
either have DNA or RNA but for bacteria

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.369 
either have DNA or RNA but for bacteria
fungi<00:03:18.620> or<00:03:18.980> protozoan<00:03:19.700> hummons<00:03:20.030> they<00:03:20.870> all<00:03:21.109> have

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 
fungi or protozoan hummons they all have

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.819 
fungi or protozoan hummons they all have
both<00:03:21.650> DNA<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:22.519> RNA<00:03:22.959> so<00:03:23.959> a<00:03:24.019> type<00:03:24.319> of<00:03:24.349> nucleus

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
both DNA and RNA so a type of nucleus

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.459 
both DNA and RNA so a type of nucleus
the<00:03:25.010> viruses<00:03:25.430> they<00:03:25.549> don't<00:03:25.730> have<00:03:25.909> any<00:03:26.060> nucleus

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:26.469 
the viruses they don't have any nucleus

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:30.129 
the viruses they don't have any nucleus
bacteria<00:03:27.469> it<00:03:27.950> is<00:03:28.010> a<00:03:28.129> prokaryotic<00:03:28.939> nucleus<00:03:29.480> for

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
bacteria it is a prokaryotic nucleus for

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.739 
bacteria it is a prokaryotic nucleus for
fungi<00:03:30.590> it's<00:03:30.889> a<00:03:31.010> eukaryotic<00:03:31.489> nucleus<00:03:32.060> for

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
into the into the eukaryotic asphere so

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.590 
into the into the eukaryotic asphere so
we<00:05:25.230> are<00:05:25.380> relatives<00:05:26.370> so<00:05:26.640> to<00:05:26.700> say<00:05:26.940> of<00:05:27.030> the<00:05:27.120> fungi

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
we are relatives so to say of the fungi

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.440 
we are relatives so to say of the fungi
and<00:05:27.900> the<00:05:28.370> protozoan<00:05:29.370> Hellmann's<00:05:29.730> we<00:05:29.970> evolved

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
and the protozoan Hellmann's we evolved

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.440 
and the protozoan Hellmann's we evolved
from<00:05:30.480> those<00:05:30.780> organism<00:05:31.380> sexually<00:05:32.450> so

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
from those organism sexually so

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.620 
from those organism sexually so
basically<00:05:33.840> this<00:05:34.350> is<00:05:34.410> this<00:05:35.010> is<00:05:35.220> a<00:05:35.270> nice<00:05:36.270> chart

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
basically this is this is a nice chart

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.740 
basically this is this is a nice chart
and<00:05:36.840> I<00:05:37.440> will<00:05:37.940> expound<00:05:38.940> more<00:05:39.390> on<00:05:39.570> later
