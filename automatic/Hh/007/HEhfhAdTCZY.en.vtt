00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.970
 hello my dear pokemon friends and 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.250
 Welcome to an announcement 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:13.080
 from a new project together with the 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.969
 present indeed what is at stake here it comes 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.369
 a leak project and that is so 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.900
 called calling talent on pokémon red 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.220
 and blue 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.300
 for some of you should solling 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.769
 maybe already a concept will be 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.570
 for example, king happy or shaping 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.189
 Queen knows is not so complicated 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.779
 how to think at the beginning that it is quasi 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.910
 a new challenge, for example 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.740
 China is supposed to be challenge or the age 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.140
 change what is not all there is the kaelin 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.760
 Challenge no idea in any case 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.110
 we will worry and make change 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.780
 present will be yours now 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.239
 So say first before we go to the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.680
 When will this come about? 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.460
 project come how exactly is that 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.430
 run 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.829
 and that is directly on monday at 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.610
 Wednesdays and on Fridays always a party 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.860
 project come 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.559
 the first patch is coming tomorrow 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.320
 and then comes the second part 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.449
 me on my channel and the third part 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.100
 at razer on his channel that's it 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.100
 is now just this first part at 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.979
 us both tomorrow and then it always is 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.600
 again alternately exactly good 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.490
 I would say then we will come too 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.140
 it will be his direction regularly 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.299
 I'm probably interested in what exactly 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.650
 is leased at the soli I had 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.759
 first regulate the standard dimensions 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.740
 of course, also in the picture 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.509
 Sonic is contained and that is the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.070
 folk it is at each new place only the 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.320
 first pokémon which you meet 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.880
 then be caught a pokémon which 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.710
 music will have to be released and 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.030
 you must try one 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.479
 Nicknames give the standard 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.430
 that will also be less 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.310
 come to the souligen of it there is 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.070
 a total of five pieces first at each 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.189
 new place will be the first pokémon which 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.170
 tv which team and which one in turn 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.880
 meet with each other 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:54.600
 that means I meet in azua city and if 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.850
 you and timo arrive at a user 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.969
 knightland exactly and the two are 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.040
 then a couple 1 owling couple 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.990
 are connected with each other 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.329
 just as closely connected to them 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.829
 they stay together until they are 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.119
 then that's the die too 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.090
 next rule 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.970
 If one of these partners dies dies 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.940
 his counterpart is his partner 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.959
 the other side also means that 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.860
 We definitely have to be nice here 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.810
 cooperate 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.879
 because if I have a pokémon necessarily 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.200
 but Timo wants to die 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.870
 then that is a little silly for 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.299
 Then we would be exactly right 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.459
 and that's exactly how it feels when I am now 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.629
 transfer my pokémon on the box 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.640
 just because I do not have it anymore 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.200
 I want to have a team in my team 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.549
 also transfer to the box 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.650
 that means the same with him too 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.900
 be made if speak then 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.609
 presents, for example, that it awakens 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.989
 and then rather do it purely 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.670
 would I have to solling then 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.459
 partner together with the team 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.930
 just like that and now again 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.790
 important to this whole soling thing 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.470
 only when a player is namely 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.180
 does not create the first pokémon in one 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.560
 to catch new territory for second 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.510
 player on the same route also no 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.250
 Start poken that is called so soon 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.250
 a new route comes and the first one 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.890
 Pokemon are automatically soulmates 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.420
 I say no and that is already a 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.620
 very important thing that is if you 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.510
 just have not manage to catch it 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.109
 yes then I have no counter what 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.400
 it is a pity 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.099
 Now we come to the last rule 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.349
 a bit more complicated when i go to 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.630
 example, have a blue rat and it has 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.660
 no one is allowed to fire the primary bus anymore 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.609
 in his teams so in his zolling 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.530
 couple have another pokémon 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:30.709
 which the second type is the primary type 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.079
 Fire means that I have enough 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.459
 which flight is so for example 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.989
 no ak never have more 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.040
 just so little that I then one 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.919
 plant pokémon if he has this 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.199
 floor has but if there is a pokémon 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.459
 which has the secondary types fire me 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.760
 For example, where numbers even if it 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.859
 not only since yes but as an example 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.690
 he may use it but of course 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.459
 if we have such a left which 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.900
 already set and we have 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.190
 the type already represented in ours 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.209
 Of course , we can do it on teams as well 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.150
 to deposit the box 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.169
 if an animal dies that is 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.940
 not that we'll release them then 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.680
 So the only problem we have to do 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.840
 would be if you like me 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.609
 a beetle pokémon off and that should be in 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.680
 pokémon also a beetle contestant then 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.329
 will bring us almost nothing 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.100
 that is exactly what we do then 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.590
 Just let's get up again 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.770
 catch a new pokémon on the same route 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.289
 yes because that would be otherwise so strange yes 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.850
 that's okay, they 're so left 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.229
 settle if anything else a bit 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.580
 too complicated was it also can not 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.770
 sometimes the video description look there 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.110
 stand again all rules or simply 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.699
 Let us ask in the comments then 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.430
 we can explain this to you in more detail 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.919
 Exactly yes and then come tomorrow 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.350
 first video on our two channels 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.090
 So definitely over if and on 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.070
 monday it will be on wednesday 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.139
 with me on friday with the pressing and so 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.330
 It can get longer but so 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.650
 between 30 and 50 minutes are so accurate 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.440
 we do not know it depending on where 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.259
 we are just and there we will be 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.680
 set spontaneously on it 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:03.419
 really good that's it when you're up 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.759
 every case had on this project 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:09.720
 since we as well as we remain extremely so me 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:10.830
 I am very happy then I would be over 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.660
 looking forward a positive evaluation 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.070
 probably also and looks at everyone 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.979
 fall at october over us really 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.750

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.490
 are very good and yes link to it is too 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:24.180
 and a video description of what you do 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.080
 from the video 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.639
 See you next time 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.639
