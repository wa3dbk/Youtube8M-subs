00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
painting it like a darker brown but I

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.930 
painting it like a darker brown but I
was<00:00:51.989> first<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.620> wanted<00:00:52.920> right<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.370> I'm<00:00:53.520> now<00:00:53.789> I'm

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
was first I wanted right but I'm now I'm

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.689 
was first I wanted right but I'm now I'm
considering<00:00:54.300> brown<00:00:55.250> it's<00:00:56.250> got<00:00:56.399> some<00:00:56.550> rust

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
considering brown it's got some rust

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.500 
considering brown it's got some rust
along<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.090> tail<00:00:57.300> side<00:00:57.570> too<00:00:58.850> no<00:00:59.850> license<00:01:00.300> plate

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
along the tail side too no license plate

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
along the tail side too no license plate
so<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.690> means<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.170> not<00:01:01.260> legal<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:02.640> course<00:01:03.000> I

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
so that means it's not legal of course I

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.320 
so that means it's not legal of course I
got<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.830> car<00:01:06.770> around<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.060> just<00:01:09.060> past

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
transmission fluid in it because I tried

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.960 
transmission fluid in it because I tried
to<00:03:17.660> start<00:03:17.900> it<00:03:18.110> three<00:03:19.070> days<00:03:19.220> ago<00:03:19.460> and<00:03:19.880> it

wouldn't move I tried to put it in
reverse<00:03:21.890> and<00:03:22.370> then<00:03:22.460> drive<00:03:22.730> it<00:03:22.760> wouldn't<00:03:23.150> move

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
reverse and then drive it wouldn't move

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.270

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
so and then that's when I figured out I

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.600 
so and then that's when I figured out I
needed<00:03:26.120> some<00:03:27.460> transmission<00:03:28.460> fluid<00:03:29.530> okay

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
needed some transmission fluid okay

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.070
