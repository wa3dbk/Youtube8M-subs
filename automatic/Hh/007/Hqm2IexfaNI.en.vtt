00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.959
 when the hot season comes 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.940
 person who works outdoors and is 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:14.000
 exposed to the hot sun rays 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.700
 must pay close attention to measures 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.369
 basic security to protect your 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.680
 health to the heat problem is something very 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.630
 relevant in the state of california by 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.849
 example right now we are here located 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.980
 in davis and it's the temperature outside is 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.599
 more than 100 degrees and I know that in other 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.840
 communities are other peoples in 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.839
 california for example the valley area 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.180
 central is a little hotter and is very 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:39.770
 important to give the information 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.039
 adequate for the worker 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.469
 Farmer knows how to prevent and take care 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.120
 of a heat attack in the last three 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.940
 years have registered the temperatures 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.850
 highest in the recent history of the 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.000
 USA with tragic consequences 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.020
 california peking the past that have 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.840
 been five years there have been more than 20 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.660
 deaths due to the problem of 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.250
 Heat illnesses and they always happen 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.900
 with farm workers or 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.050
 workers under construction with 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.110
 people who work outside and it's very 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.760
 important that there are programs like 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.710
 we callagher berlin and others 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.710
 agencies that work together to 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.470
 collaborate and present that information to 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.690
 agricultural workers california 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.640
 implemented in 2006 one of the 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.380
 first laws in the nation 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.840
 to protect the workers that 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.810
 they elaborate exposed to the sun the law 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.630
 requires, among other things, to always have 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.090
 available and accessible drinking water for 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.950
 workers remember the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.410
 workers who drink water with 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.200
 Frequently maintain places with shadow 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.320
 to rest give time for 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.259
 acclimatize to new workers 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.670
 know what to do in case of emergency 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.270
 one of the main recommendations 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.729
 is to drink water frequently when 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.690
 is working outdoors 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.430
 recommendations that we make here in each 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.759
 would say these workers 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.530
 agricultural is to avoid taking 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.370
 fresh 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.110
 and juices especially the men who 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.510
 they drink alcoholic beverages like 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.590
 beer when they are working in the 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.300
 field should no longer drink water because the 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.650
 water what it does is that it keeps it 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.680
 hydrated and what the others do 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.050
 liquid drinks is that they help the 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.510
 body gets dehydrated faster 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.600
 Recommend not to wait to feel thirsty 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.660
 because thirst is a sign that it is already 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.010
 Dehydrated pay attention to other 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.110
 danger signs 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.420
 for example one of the diseases of 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.750
 heat is exhaustion in exhaustion 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.860
 a person may feel nauseous with 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.989
 headache with dizziness and also other 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.790
 another type of illness sunstroke and 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.130
 What happens in heat stroke is that the 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.830
 body is already at a very level 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.890
 dehydrated the skin has become 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.100
 dry and the body goes up a temperature 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.160
 very high and that 's when it gets to the 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.959
 body enters an attack state of 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.130
 heat and that can also bring 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.870
 inclusive mind to death 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.690
 I want to remind all of you 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.610
 agricultural workers that there are laws that 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.160
 they can protect them out there 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.160
 be afraid to report a problem 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.730
 or any regularity that exists in the 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.090
 where you work and also 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.620
 remind them that the lagarde clinic 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.990
 We provide resources to all 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.760
