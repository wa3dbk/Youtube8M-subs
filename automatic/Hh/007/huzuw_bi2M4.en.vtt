CAMERON: What's up, guys? This is Cameron
with DS2DIO 360 and today we're gonna be looking

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.230
at some of the most iconic dance looks of
all time by doing one of my favorite things:

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.430
Dress up! I am not going to fall into one
of those common traps of saddling every look

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.430
with the word sexy. Sexy Mary Poppins? Seriously?
Is nothing sacred? Good day, sir. Instead,

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:33.370
we are going to focus on five of my favorite
iconic looks. Now, what makes something iconic?

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.370
By definition, it has to be unforgettable.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.100
And what's more unforgettable than Michael

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.100
Flatley's ode to Liberace and Elvis? 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.100
Sweet belt: check. Headband: check. One earring:

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:11.400
check. Celtic, religious, glitter blazer:
Oh, check. Nana made the blazer. Is this image

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.390
not seared into your memory for all time?
At number four: Who could forget Beyonce's

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:25.390
look from her "Single Ladies" video? But who
remembers Sasha Fierce's crazy arm hardware?

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.939
Uh, nobody. Because it wasn't that cool. And
the weird thing is that I think she was trying

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.200
to have an iconic look by doing that and it
was the elegant look from the video that ended

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:44.200
up rocking it. Takeaway? Don't try so hard.
Just be yourself. And to prove my point,

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:55.000
number three on the list: This guy. Sixteen-year-old
Ton Do-Nguyen meticulously recreated Beyonce's

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:08.939
"Countdown" video in a snuggie! That is amazing!
Even Beyonce said it was brilliant. And she

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:15.939
was right. Can I keep this one guys? At number
two I have a time capsule from an era when

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.459
hair bands weren't just an accessory. Whereas
most hair bands were putting girls in skimpy little

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:30.200
skirts, White Snake put Tawny Kitaen in a
flowing white dress. Remember, always play

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.200
against type if you want to be iconic on the
dance floor. 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.569
And my number one: Now in this

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.819
one, it only took one prop and some movie
magic. Fun fact: DS2DIO's own Harry Shum, Jr.

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.000
actually pioneered this look and it was
his first professional gig. Play.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Harry! What are you doing here?
HARRY SHUM JR: I literally have no idea.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.800
