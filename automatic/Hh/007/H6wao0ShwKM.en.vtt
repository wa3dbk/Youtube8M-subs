became<00:01:02.910> more<00:01:03.239> denser<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.040> I<00:01:05.040> also<00:01:05.309> believe

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
became more denser and I also believe

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.210 
became more denser and I also believe
that<00:01:06.570> they've<00:01:07.110> gotten<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.680> little<00:01:07.799> bit<00:01:08.040> more

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
that they've gotten a little bit more

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.109 
that they've gotten a little bit more
longer<00:01:09.020> I<00:01:10.310> would<00:01:11.310> say<00:01:11.430> they<00:01:11.580> might<00:01:11.729> have<00:01:11.880> grown

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
longer I would say they might have grown
