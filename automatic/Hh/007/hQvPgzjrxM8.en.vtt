00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
the test now I'm just gonna let it

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:36.530 
the test now I'm just gonna let it
through<00:00:28.460> um<00:00:29.460> run<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.990> do<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.349> saying<00:00:35.390> gonna<00:00:36.390> be

that's the - - benchmark test and then

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:32.949 
that's the - - benchmark test and then
we<00:03:12.000> have<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.209> total<00:03:12.420> score<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:12.930> over<00:03:13.819> 25,000

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.449 

this<00:03:53.239> is<00:03:53.450> all<00:03:53.720> we<00:03:54.110> have<00:03:54.290> tested<00:03:54.980> right<00:03:55.099> here<00:03:55.159> to

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
this is all we have tested right here to

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.089 
this is all we have tested right here to

here<00:04:28.700> we<00:04:28.790> have<00:04:28.910> another<00:04:29.060> galaxy<00:04:29.660> s4<00:04:30.140> which<00:04:30.380> is

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
here we have another galaxy s4 which is

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.200 
here we have another galaxy s4 which is
quite<00:04:30.680> funny<00:04:31.030> unfortunately<00:04:32.030> it<00:04:32.090> doesn't

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
quite funny unfortunately it doesn't

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.740 
quite funny unfortunately it doesn't
tell<00:04:32.510> us<00:04:32.540> which<00:04:33.140> one<00:04:33.380> it<00:04:33.530> is<00:04:34.570> but<00:04:35.570> the

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
tell us which one it is but the

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.470 
tell us which one it is but the
Snapdragon<00:04:36.470> is<00:04:36.650> a<00:04:37.010> little<00:04:37.430> slower<00:04:37.850> actually

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
Snapdragon is a little slower actually

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.060 
Snapdragon is a little slower actually
done<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:38.810> X<00:04:39.050> in<00:04:39.260> the<00:04:39.350> house<00:04:39.500> so<00:04:39.710> I<00:04:39.740> can't

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
done the X in the house so I can't

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:49.210 
done the X in the house so I can't
believe<00:04:40.160> that<00:04:40.550> ds4<00:04:41.060> is<00:04:41.150> X<00:04:41.420> nos<00:04:47.740> no<00:04:48.740> that's

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
believe that ds4 is X nos no that's

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.900 
believe that ds4 is X nos no that's
pretty<00:04:49.460> much<00:04:49.610> it<00:04:49.850> that's<00:04:51.100> our<00:04:52.100> benchmark<00:04:52.610> test

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
pretty much it that's our benchmark test
