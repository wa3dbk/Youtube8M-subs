hello and welcome back to another video

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.530 
hello and welcome back to another video
today<00:00:06.090> I'm<00:00:06.450> going<00:00:06.689> to<00:00:06.779> teach<00:00:06.990> you<00:00:07.229> how<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.439> use

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
today I'm going to teach you how to use

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.409 
today I'm going to teach you how to use
conveyor<00:00:09.540> belts<00:00:09.930> and<00:00:10.080> arm<00:00:10.679> BOTS<00:00:11.009> and<00:00:11.419> encoders

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:12.419 
conveyor belts and arm BOTS and encoders

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.020 
conveyor belts and arm BOTS and encoders
if<00:00:12.690> you<00:00:12.809> count<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.200> in<00:00:13.639> first<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.759> all<00:00:14.849> you

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
if you count that in first of all you

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.540 
if you count that in first of all you
will<00:00:15.209> need<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.389> source<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.809> power<00:00:16.049> but<00:00:16.470> for<00:00:17.070> the

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
will need a source of power but for the

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.700 
will need a source of power but for the
use<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.850> demonstration<00:00:18.630> I'm<00:00:19.140> just<00:00:19.230> going<00:00:19.470> to

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
use of demonstration I'm just going to

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.769 
use of demonstration I'm just going to
use<00:00:19.800> an<00:00:19.949> infinite<00:00:20.400> battery<00:00:20.760> notice<00:00:21.539> they

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
use an infinite battery notice they

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.990 
use an infinite battery notice they
cannot<00:00:22.109> be<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:23.390> these<00:00:24.390> cannot<00:00:24.779> capture<00:00:26.000> that

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
cannot be and these cannot capture that

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.890 
cannot be and these cannot capture that
they<00:00:27.300> can't<00:00:27.539> be<00:00:27.869> crafted<00:00:28.410> or<00:00:28.650> used<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.900> in

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
they can't be crafted or used in in

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.710 
they can't be crafted or used in in
survival<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.009> don't<00:00:32.669> bother<00:00:32.970> trying<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.540> make

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
survival so don't bother trying to make

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.600 
survival so don't bother trying to make
one<00:00:34.700> the<00:00:35.700> most<00:00:36.890> tutorials<00:00:37.890> say<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.430> need

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
one the most tutorials say that you need

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.360 
one the most tutorials say that you need
to<00:00:38.820> power<00:00:39.450> all<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.140> conveyor<00:00:40.530> belt<00:00:40.560> well<00:00:41.340> I

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
to power all of the conveyor belt well I

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.460 
to power all of the conveyor belt well I
realize<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.360> wrong<00:00:42.600> all<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.170> need

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
realize that this is wrong all you need

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.800 
realize that this is wrong all you need
to<00:00:43.620> do<00:00:45.230> is<00:00:46.400> lift<00:00:47.400> down<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.090> conveyor<00:00:48.360> box<00:00:48.570> like

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
to do is lift down the conveyor box like

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.470 
to do is lift down the conveyor box like
that<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.380> it<00:00:49.980> should<00:00:50.190> start<00:00:50.430> powering<00:00:50.790> you

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
that and it should start powering you

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.950 
that and it should start powering you
can<00:00:51.600> see<00:00:51.810> it's<00:00:52.310> pretty<00:00:53.310> full<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.110> so<00:00:56.090> we<00:00:57.090> so

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
can see it's pretty full and so we so

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.390 
can see it's pretty full and so we so
you<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.170> go<00:00:58.320> along<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.250> can

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
you can go along like that and you can

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.110 
you can go along like that and you can
chuck<00:01:00.360> items<00:01:00.720> on<00:01:00.900> and<00:01:01.110> they<00:01:01.230> go<00:01:01.380> along<00:01:01.470> as<00:01:01.740> well

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
chuck items on and they go along as well

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.200 
chuck items on and they go along as well
they<00:01:03.120> may<00:01:03.330> think<00:01:03.600> that's<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.559> bit<00:01:04.739> boring<00:01:05.210> well

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
they may think that's a bit boring well

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.020 
they may think that's a bit boring well
that's<00:01:06.479> what<00:01:06.750> well<00:01:07.259> that's<00:01:07.789> that's<00:01:08.789> what

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
that's what well that's that's what

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.819 
that's what well that's that's what
we're<00:01:09.179> going<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.359> use<00:01:09.509> our<00:01:09.780> box<00:01:10.020> for<00:01:10.259> first

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 
we're going to use our box for first

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:13.130 
we're going to use our box for first
thing<00:01:10.979> you'll<00:01:11.130> need<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.310> an<00:01:11.579> encoder<00:01:12.000> which<00:01:12.899> is

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
thing you'll need is an encoder which is

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.819 
thing you'll need is an encoder which is
crafted<00:01:13.770> like<00:01:14.219> this<00:01:14.759> stealing<00:01:15.719> its<00:01:15.929> advanced

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:16.829 
crafted like this stealing its advanced

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:26.060 
crafted like this stealing its advanced
circuits<00:01:18.619> that<00:01:19.999> second<00:01:22.729> good<00:01:23.729> good<00:01:24.119> good<00:01:25.070> and

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
circuits that second good good good and

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.849 
circuits that second good good good and
the<00:01:26.820> conveyor<00:01:27.390> belts<00:01:27.689> itself<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.469> just

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:28.859 
the conveyor belts itself is just

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:31.370 
the conveyor belts itself is just
stealing<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:29.729> any<00:01:30.359> type<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.719> wood<00:01:31.109> in<00:01:31.289> a

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
stealing it's any type of wood in a

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.219 
stealing it's any type of wood in a
motor<00:01:31.619> which<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:33.109> this<00:01:34.819> deal<00:01:35.819> and<00:01:36.299> iron<00:01:38.210> and

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
motor which is this deal and iron and

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.569 
motor which is this deal and iron and
and<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.409> what<00:01:40.469> you<00:01:40.560> do<00:01:40.679> is<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.069> place<00:01:41.340> down

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
and so what you do is just place down

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.149 
and so what you do is just place down
the<00:01:41.729> encoder<00:01:42.119> anywhere<00:01:42.539> and<00:01:43.079> put<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> disc<00:01:43.979> in

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
the encoder anywhere and put a disc in

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.760 
the encoder anywhere and put a disc in
it<00:01:44.249> which<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.579> crafted<00:01:45.569> with<00:01:45.600> imprints<00:01:46.499> and<00:01:46.679> in

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
it which is crafted with imprints and in

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.340 
it which is crafted with imprints and in
advanced<00:01:47.130> circuits<00:01:47.840> imprints<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.200> like

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
advanced circuits imprints so just like

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.739 
advanced circuits imprints so just like
that<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:51.210> disc

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:51.749 
that and a disc

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:54.469 
that and a disc
I<00:01:51.929> mean<00:01:52.319> advanced<00:01:52.859> circuit<00:01:53.299> centers<00:01:54.299> that

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
I mean advanced circuit centers that

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.929 
I mean advanced circuit centers that
which<00:01:54.929> is<00:01:55.170> used<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.619> make<00:01:55.950> hoop<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.670> motion

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
which is used to make hoop that motion

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.899 
which is used to make hoop that motion
to<00:01:57.359> make<00:01:58.639> it<00:01:59.639> anyway<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.329> put<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.170> disc<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.530> and

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
to make it anyway so put the disc in and

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.059 
to make it anyway so put the disc in and
you<00:02:03.079> think<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> command<00:02:04.530> light<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.009> this

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
you think of a command light in this

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.120 
you think of a command light in this
case<00:02:05.340> I'm<00:02:06.299> going<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.810> tell<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.139> to<00:02:07.170> grab<00:02:07.679> the

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
case I'm going to tell it to grab the

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.500 
case I'm going to tell it to grab the
item<00:02:08.580> or<00:02:08.729> entity<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.509> then

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
item or entity and then

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.590 
item or entity and then
rotate<00:02:12.510> its<00:02:12.750> which<00:02:13.140> is<00:02:13.350> 90<00:02:13.709> degrees<00:02:14.040> clockwise

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
rotate its which is 90 degrees clockwise

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.250 
rotate its which is 90 degrees clockwise
and<00:02:15.600> then<00:02:16.100> rotates<00:02:17.100> again<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:19.020> then<00:02:19.140> I'm

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
and then rotates again and then I'm

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:30.020 
and then rotates again and then I'm
going<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.590> tell<00:02:19.770> it<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:20.660> drop<00:02:25.069> was<00:02:26.069> it<00:02:28.250> really<00:02:29.250> a

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
going to tell it to drop was it really a

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.880 
going to tell it to drop was it really a
return<00:02:30.450> which<00:02:30.780> returns<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:31.500> original

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
return which returns it to the original

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.020 
return which returns it to the original
person<00:02:32.040> pet<00:02:32.640> person<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:34.250> /<00:02:35.250> position<00:02:35.790> and

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
person pet person and / position and

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.170 
person pet person and / position and
then<00:02:36.690> repeat<00:02:37.350> which<00:02:38.340> will<00:02:38.550> repeat<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:39.000> again

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
then repeat which will repeat it again

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.020 
then repeat which will repeat it again
so<00:02:39.510> once<00:02:39.690> you've<00:02:39.810> got<00:02:39.989> that<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:41.459> take<00:02:41.819> it<00:02:41.910> out

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
so once you've got that you take it out

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.670 
so once you've got that you take it out
and<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.880> best<00:02:45.000> thing<00:02:45.269> to<00:02:45.300> do<00:02:45.570> is<00:02:45.959> before<00:02:46.320> you

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
and the best thing to do is before you

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.740 
and the best thing to do is before you
even<00:02:46.890> start<00:02:47.700> doing<00:02:50.480> fiddling<00:02:51.480> around<00:02:51.540> with

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
even start doing fiddling around with

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.630 
even start doing fiddling around with
this<00:02:51.959> is<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.590> place<00:02:52.830> down<00:02:53.070> your<00:02:53.100> arm<00:02:53.430> ball

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
this is to place down your arm ball

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.229 
this is to place down your arm ball
first<00:02:53.970> because<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:54.840> don't<00:02:55.080> know<00:02:55.260> which<00:02:55.470> way

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
first because you don't know which way

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.280 
first because you don't know which way
their<00:02:57.239> handles<00:02:57.690> going<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:57.930> go<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.170> that's

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
their handles going to go and that's

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.890 
their handles going to go and that's
what<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.500> should<00:02:58.769> have<00:02:58.860> done<00:02:59.010> before<00:02:59.459> but

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
what I should have done before but

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.190 
what I should have done before but
obviously<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:01.350> did<00:03:01.620> not<00:03:01.830> so<00:03:02.360> in<00:03:03.360> this<00:03:03.510> case<00:03:03.810> I'm

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
obviously I did not so in this case I'm

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.500 
obviously I did not so in this case I'm
just<00:03:04.260> going<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.769> do<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.220> like<00:03:05.489> that<00:03:05.519> so<00:03:06.450> I'll

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
just going to do it like that so I'll

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.500 
just going to do it like that so I'll
pick<00:03:06.660> up<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:07.140> things<00:03:07.380> here<00:03:08.269> turn<00:03:09.269> them

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
pick up the things here turn them

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.949 
pick up the things here turn them
clockwise<00:03:10.170> this<00:03:11.040> way<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.880> then<00:03:12.540> dropped<00:03:12.840> it

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
clockwise this way and then dropped it

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.830 
clockwise this way and then dropped it
down<00:03:13.080> here<00:03:13.470> so<00:03:13.739> again<00:03:14.430> I'm<00:03:15.329> going<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.630> build

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
down here so again I'm going to build

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:25.580 
down here so again I'm going to build
another<00:03:16.019> conveyor<00:03:16.440> belts<00:03:20.690> and<00:03:24.320> I'll<00:03:25.320> make<00:03:25.560> a

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
another conveyor belts and I'll make a

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.360 
another conveyor belts and I'll make a
cheap<00:03:25.980> corner<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:27.110> see<00:03:28.110> ya<00:03:28.709> since<00:03:29.070> this

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
cheap corner and see ya since this

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.190 
cheap corner and see ya since this
conveyor<00:03:29.730> belt<00:03:29.940> is<00:03:30.000> connected<00:03:30.420> up<00:03:30.540> with<00:03:30.570> the

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
conveyor belt is connected up with the

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.020 
conveyor belt is connected up with the
running<00:03:32.040> conveyor<00:03:32.370> belt<00:03:32.640> they're<00:03:32.850> all

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
running conveyor belt they're all

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.060 
running conveyor belt they're all
running<00:03:33.329> now<00:03:33.450> see<00:03:33.930> it's<00:03:34.079> just<00:03:34.260> by<00:03:34.500> one<00:03:34.799> little

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
running now see it's just by one little

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.470 
running now see it's just by one little
piece<00:03:35.250> being<00:03:35.489> powered<00:03:35.880> they're<00:03:36.000> all<00:03:36.150> running

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
piece being powered they're all running

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.770 
piece being powered they're all running
so<00:03:37.280> yep<00:03:38.280> what<00:03:39.000> you<00:03:39.060> need<00:03:39.239> to<00:03:39.299> do<00:03:39.360> is<00:03:39.480> you<00:03:39.630> need

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
so yep what you need to do is you need

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.050 
so yep what you need to do is you need
to<00:03:39.840> right-click<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.950> arm<00:03:41.190> bot<00:03:41.430> with<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.850> disc

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
to right-click the arm bot with the disc

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.479 
to right-click the arm bot with the disc
and<00:03:42.420> it<00:03:42.870> sucks<00:03:43.290> it<00:03:43.470> up<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:43.799> then<00:03:44.100> after<00:03:44.370> that

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
and it sucks it up and then after that

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.590 
and it sucks it up and then after that
you<00:03:44.730> can<00:03:44.760> basically<00:03:45.320> chuck<00:03:46.320> down<00:03:46.530> any<00:03:46.799> block

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
you can basically chuck down any block

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.210 
you can basically chuck down any block
or<00:03:48.600> entity<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:49.620> all<00:03:49.859> rotate<00:03:50.310> yeah<00:03:51.380> and<00:03:52.380> then

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
or entity and all rotate yeah and then

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.580 
or entity and all rotate yeah and then
it<00:03:53.340> will<00:03:53.519> rotate<00:03:53.940> again<00:03:55.670> we'll<00:03:56.670> drop<00:03:56.910> it

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
it will rotate again we'll drop it

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.370 
it will rotate again we'll drop it
return<00:03:59.329> and<00:04:00.329> that<00:04:00.359> will<00:04:00.540> go<00:04:00.690> around<00:04:00.959> again<00:04:01.049> and

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
return and that will go around again and

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.130 
return and that will go around again and
then<00:04:01.920> it<00:04:02.010> will<00:04:02.130> repeat<00:04:02.750> now<00:04:03.750> there<00:04:03.989> is<00:04:04.109> a

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
then it will repeat now there is a

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.920 
then it will repeat now there is a
little<00:04:04.590> bit<00:04:04.739> of<00:04:04.829> a<00:04:04.920> problem<00:04:05.160> where<00:04:05.780> see<00:04:06.780> if

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
little bit of a problem where see if

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.599 
little bit of a problem where see if
it's<00:04:07.140> got<00:04:07.350> one<00:04:07.590> item<00:04:07.709> in<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.160> you<00:04:08.220> try<00:04:08.370> check

it's got one item in and you try check
another<00:04:08.880> one<00:04:09.060> in<00:04:09.209> it<00:04:09.630> will<00:04:11.329> like
