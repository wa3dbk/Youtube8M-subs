00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.950
 his engine because I never had to 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.659
 read the title 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.549

 this one vsamedi smith and this song 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.599

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.159

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.859

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.859
 killer month 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.280

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:29.370
 know that I'm very boring access that 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.989
 I think we have them to text so 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:38.290
 consulted my with this movie is so this is 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:42.280
 m83 the tissues waits is that they saw 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:46.349
 the film goes out or what passage is it and 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.349
 why am I crying that he 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.629
 never be what they are 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.720
 but I know I'm a pastor it's a 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.280
 little bit 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.280
 I am and the alarms 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.240
 I have before 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.280
 the last how to divide the houses 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.199
 that make me cry even furnishing without 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.840
 nothing I was super good mood you me 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:27.690
 messages become fountain as much 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.150
 come on be 2 and so that's saying so 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.650
 it's back those twilight music so 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.360
 here are some of the reasons 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.240
 for which it seems to me and this is the 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.520
 two bodies worse 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.470
 so that's when I'll try to 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.479
 know how to read because apparently I do not 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:51.259
 do not know my dad this Friday this fact 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:51.259
 all these niches not putting themselves so 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:04.070
 I start to believe if I spend with 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:04.070
 she will still consume what 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.550
 like cry 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.880

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.100

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.860
