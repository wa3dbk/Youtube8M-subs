little increments to lip chamber inside
turns<00:01:46.359> and<00:01:46.780> then<00:01:47.380> once<00:01:47.590> it<00:01:47.740> turns<00:01:48.100> freely<00:01:48.600> you

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
turns and then once it turns freely you

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.599 
turns and then once it turns freely you
want<00:01:49.780> to<00:01:49.869> go<00:01:49.960> ahead<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:50.140> do<00:01:50.380> it<00:01:50.500> in<00:01:50.590> a<00:01:50.679> 360

want to go ahead and do it in a 360

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:55.649 
want to go ahead and do it in a 360
degrees<00:01:52.000> one<00:01:52.689> way<00:01:53.820> 360<00:01:54.820> degrees<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.630> other

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
degrees one way 360 degrees the other

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.169 
degrees one way 360 degrees the other
way<00:01:55.899> and<00:01:56.469> that's<00:01:57.429> going<00:01:57.700> to<00:01:57.820> free<00:01:57.969> that

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
way and that's going to free that

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.560 
way and that's going to free that
disposal<00:01:58.810> up<00:01:59.399> now<00:02:00.399> if<00:02:00.850> you've<00:02:01.119> actually<00:02:01.299> got

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
disposal up now if you've actually got

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.599 
disposal up now if you've actually got
something<00:02:01.780> stuck<00:02:02.170> on<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.499> inside<00:02:02.619> freeing<00:02:03.429> it

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:03.609 
something stuck on the inside freeing it

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:05.279 
something stuck on the inside freeing it
up<00:02:03.729> is<00:02:03.820> not<00:02:03.850> going<00:02:04.179> to<00:02:04.240> help<00:02:04.390> until<00:02:04.990> you<00:02:05.109> get

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
up is not going to help until you get

up is not going to help until you get
the<00:02:05.439> debris<00:02:05.679> out<00:02:05.979> of<00:02:06.039> the<00:02:06.249> inside<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:08.110> we'll<00:02:08.200> go

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
the debris out of the inside so we'll go

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.010 
the debris out of the inside so we'll go
through<00:02:08.619> our<00:02:08.649> step<00:02:08.979> that<00:02:09.160> I<00:02:09.220> use<00:02:09.899> should<00:02:10.899> you

suppose that we're working on is an
InSinkErator<00:02:17.380> disposal<00:02:18.040> towards<00:02:18.880> made<00:02:19.090> by<00:02:19.330> a

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
InSinkErator disposal towards made by a

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.780 
InSinkErator disposal towards made by a
cigarette<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.380> by<00:02:20.740> that<00:02:20.980> what<00:02:21.190> it<00:02:21.310> does<00:02:21.490> is

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
cigarette and by that what it does is

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.150 
cigarette and by that what it does is
that<00:02:21.819> all<00:02:22.510> it's<00:02:22.780> in<00:02:22.930> InSinkErator<00:02:23.470> disposals

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
that all it's in InSinkErator disposals

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.309 
that all it's in InSinkErator disposals
have<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.060> little<00:02:25.240> access<00:02:25.630> at<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.870> bottom

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
have the little access at the bottom

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.980 
have the little access at the bottom
that<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.620> can<00:02:26.650> use<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.010> disposal<00:02:27.880> wrench<00:02:28.150> to

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
that you can use a disposal wrench to

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.830 
that you can use a disposal wrench to
free<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.350> up<00:02:29.470> now<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:30.430> every<00:02:30.850> disposal<00:02:31.660> has

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
free it up now that every disposal has

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.470 
free it up now that every disposal has
that<00:02:32.110> ability<00:02:32.370> some<00:02:33.370> of<00:02:33.520> them<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:34.180> have<00:02:34.330> to

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
that ability some of them you have to

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.570 
that ability some of them you have to
actually<00:02:34.660> use<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.170> disposal<00:02:35.920> wrench<00:02:36.130> that<00:02:36.340> sits

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
actually use a disposal wrench that sits

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.970 
actually use a disposal wrench that sits
down<00:02:36.730> or<00:02:37.150> goes<00:02:37.330> down<00:02:37.540> into<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.840> top<00:02:38.140> of<00:02:38.409> it<00:02:38.560> and

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
down or goes down into the top of it and

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.690 
down or goes down into the top of it and
I'll<00:02:39.400> show<00:02:39.580> you<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:39.790> picture<00:02:40.000> of<00:02:40.120> it<00:02:40.299> here

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.340 

and<00:02:44.910> what<00:02:45.270> that's<00:02:45.480> going<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.750> allow<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:45.990> to<00:02:46.170> do

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
and what that's going to allow you to do

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.200 
and what that's going to allow you to do
is<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.800> actually<00:02:47.130> put<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.460> down<00:02:47.610> inside<00:02:48.030> the

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
is to actually put it down inside the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.300 
is to actually put it down inside the
garbage<00:02:48.540> disposal<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:49.319> work<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:50.069> back<00:02:50.100> and

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
garbage disposal and work it back and

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.850 
garbage disposal and work it back and
forth<00:02:50.750> little<00:02:51.750> increments<00:02:52.290> back<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.709> forth

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
forth little increments back and forth

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.620 
forth little increments back and forth
just<00:02:53.100> like<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.370> would<00:02:53.550> with<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.760> disposal

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
just like you would with the disposal

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.960 
just like you would with the disposal
wrench<00:02:54.810> until<00:02:55.080> you<00:02:55.170> free<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.650> plate<00:02:55.950> up<00:02:56.130> then

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
wrench until you free that plate up then

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.000 
wrench until you free that plate up then
once<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.300> plate<00:02:57.569> is<00:02:57.720> free<00:02:58.020> then<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.530> can<00:02:58.709> spin

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
once the plate is free then you can spin

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.830 
once the plate is free then you can spin
it<00:02:59.100> all<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.310> way<00:02:59.400> around<00:02:59.490> one<00:02:59.850> leg<00:03:00.000> spinning

it all the way around one leg spinning

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.900 
it all the way around one leg spinning
around<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.230> other<00:03:01.380> way<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:02.130> get<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.430> freed<00:03:02.730> up

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
around the other way and get it freed up

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.780 
around the other way and get it freed up
all<00:03:03.720> right<00:03:03.840> as<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.590> mentioned<00:03:05.040> if<00:03:05.280> you've<00:03:05.580> got
