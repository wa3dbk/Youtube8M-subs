 if we went on an excursion 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.310
 further than one's age 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.770

 mom dad 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:08.970

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:10.830

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.890
 sit there idly people 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:27.140

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:29.060
 everywhere from now on 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.370
 knows the area better than it plays at 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.350
 our advantage 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.930
 we go there we harass them with 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:43.630
 strikes is clear we have to get 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:44.950
 like soldiers I do not arrive 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.520
 not to know if what I did is 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.470
 good or bad 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.260
 I think that all in all we have to 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.730
 follow our instinct and instinct 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.570
 what is it telling you that it's time 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.570
 to go to war 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.520
 to pay for it they pay dearly 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.909
 suddenly they will search by all 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.909
 ways to trap us 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.019
 we will not stop 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:17.840
 if you found it bad then 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.709
 for us this war begins tomorrow
