let's go and see how we can make our way
through<00:00:53.309> on<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> base<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:53.910> luckily<00:00:54.420> most<00:00:55.140> of

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
through on the base but luckily most of

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.900 
through on the base but luckily most of
my<00:00:55.410> troops<00:00:55.649> are<00:00:55.770> level<00:00:56.070> 5<00:00:56.219> now<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.640> use<00:00:56.789> in

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
my troops are level 5 now that I use in

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.700 
my troops are level 5 now that I use in
this<00:00:57.000> army<00:00:57.300> composition<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:58.050> my<00:00:58.170> archers<00:00:58.559> and

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
this army composition so my archers and

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.709 
this army composition so my archers and
goblins<00:00:58.770> are<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.460> those<00:00:59.910> make<00:01:00.120> up<00:01:00.149> like<00:01:00.510> over

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
goblins are and those make up like over

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.369 
goblins are and those make up like over
75%<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:02.070> my<00:01:02.219> troops<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.510> army<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.140> yeah

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
75% of my troops in this army so yeah

75% of my troops in this army so yeah
things<00:01:04.710> are<00:01:04.830> working<00:01:04.949> out<00:01:05.100> pretty<00:01:05.189> well<00:01:05.309> I

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
things are working out pretty well I

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.710 
things are working out pretty well I
shouldn't<00:01:05.729> have<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.939> use<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.180> many<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.570> take

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
shouldn't have to use that many to take

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.969 
shouldn't have to use that many to take
care<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:06.960> most<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.320> these<00:01:07.380> collectors<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
care of most of these collectors and

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.289 
care of most of these collectors and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.480 
going in I'm gonna go and take care of
this<00:01:12.420> elixir<00:01:12.750> pump<00:01:13.080> first<00:01:13.320> goldmine<00:01:14.280> should

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
this elixir pump first goldmine should

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.859 
this elixir pump first goldmine should
follow<00:01:14.610> after<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.150> unfortunately<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
follow after that unfortunately the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.740 
follow after that unfortunately the
giant<00:01:16.259> was<00:01:16.380> sitting<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:16.830> top<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.070> my<00:01:17.750> goblins

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
giant was sitting on top of my goblins

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.210 
giant was sitting on top of my goblins
and<00:01:18.869> because<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.380> whenever<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.950> mortar

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and because of that whenever the mortar

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.100 
and because of that whenever the mortar
shell<00:01:20.400> hit<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.759> actually<00:01:21.119> hit<00:01:21.240> my<00:01:21.390> goblins<00:01:21.810> too

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
shell hit it actually hit my goblins too

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.749 
shell hit it actually hit my goblins too
but<00:01:22.619> now<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.040> they<00:01:23.130> went<00:01:23.310> made<00:01:23.490> their<00:01:23.640> way<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
but now that they went made their way to

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.190 
but now that they went made their way to
the<00:01:23.939> goldmine<00:01:24.270> they<00:01:24.509> shouldn't<00:01:24.780> be<00:01:24.840> affected

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
the goldmine they shouldn't be affected

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.120 
the goldmine they shouldn't be affected
by<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.530> they're<00:01:25.710> gonna<00:01:25.830> be<00:01:25.950> able<00:01:26.009> to

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
by that and they're gonna be able to

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.770 
by that and they're gonna be able to
take<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.310> out<00:01:26.549> really<00:01:26.700> easily<00:01:27.030> I'm<00:01:27.570> not

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
take that out really easily I'm not

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.060 
take that out really easily I'm not
worried<00:01:28.049> about<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.320> elixir<00:01:28.530> storage<00:01:28.710> I

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
worried about the elixir storage I

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.230 
worried about the elixir storage I
really<00:01:29.280> don't<00:01:29.430> think<00:01:29.490> too<00:01:29.729> much<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.119> there

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
really don't think too much is in there

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.340 
really don't think too much is in there
somebody<00:01:30.509> go<00:01:30.689> ahead<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:30.930> go<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.200> next

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
somebody go ahead and go to the next

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.380 
somebody go ahead and go to the next
compartment<00:01:31.650> right<00:01:31.920> here<00:01:31.979> do<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.880> same<00:01:33.060> exact

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
compartment right here do the same exact

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.270 
compartment right here do the same exact
thing<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:34.170> looks<00:01:34.200> like<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.590> Giant<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.070> far

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
thing and it looks like the Giant is far

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.830 
thing and it looks like the Giant is far
enough<00:01:35.520> away<00:01:35.700> from<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.210> goblins<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.720> where

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
enough away from the goblins to where

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.480 
enough away from the goblins to where
the<00:01:36.900> wizard<00:01:37.200> tower<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.650> mortar<00:01:37.950> won't<00:01:38.130> affect

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
the wizard tower and mortar won't affect

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.890 
the wizard tower and mortar won't affect
them<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:38.850> pretty<00:01:39.060> easy<00:01:39.240> right<00:01:39.479> there<00:01:39.509> took

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
them so pretty easy right there took

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.210 
them so pretty easy right there took
care<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.110> those<00:01:40.259> two<00:01:40.439> mines<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.829> bumps<00:01:41.100> as

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
care of those two mines and bumps as

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.560 
care of those two mines and bumps as
well<00:01:41.640> as<00:01:41.729> gonna<00:01:41.880> take<00:01:42.060> care<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.360> dark

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
well as gonna take care of this dark

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.139 
well as gonna take care of this dark
elixir<00:01:42.750> drill<00:01:43.140> right<00:01:43.350> here<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.860> then<00:01:44.759> finally

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
elixir drill right here and then finally

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.249 
elixir drill right here and then finally
let<00:01:45.270> me<00:01:45.329> take<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> look<00:01:45.689> at<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.840> left-hand

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
let me take a look at this left-hand

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.139 
let me take a look at this left-hand
side<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:47.009> only<00:01:47.189> have<00:01:47.369> three<00:01:47.610> wall<00:01:47.820> breakers

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
side and I only have three wall breakers

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.969 
side and I only have three wall breakers
left<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.170> going<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.380> be<00:01:49.439> pretty<00:01:49.649> tough<00:01:49.799> to

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
left so it's going to be pretty tough to

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.740 
left so it's going to be pretty tough to
get<00:01:50.070> into<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.340> top<00:01:50.549> compartment<00:01:50.909> if<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.570> even

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
get into that top compartment if I even

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.090 
get into that top compartment if I even
have<00:01:51.869> any<00:01:52.049> troops<00:01:52.320> left<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.710> I'm<00:01:52.799> gonna<00:01:52.890> drop

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
have any troops left so I'm gonna drop

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.069 
have any troops left so I'm gonna drop
my<00:01:53.159> Giants<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.729> accidentally<00:01:54.390> dropped<00:01:54.570> three<00:01:55.049> I

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
my Giants I accidentally dropped three I

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.200 
my Giants I accidentally dropped three I
only<00:01:55.560> meant<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:55.979> walk<00:01:56.189> drop<00:01:56.579> one<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.180> i

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
only meant to walk drop one but i

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.090 
only meant to walk drop one but i
misclicked<00:01:57.990> when<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.380> meant<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.799> hit<00:01:58.979> my

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
misclicked when I meant to hit my

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.830 
misclicked when I meant to hit my
goblins<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.640> my<00:01:59.790> archers<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.420> that's<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.630> little

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
goblins in my archers so that's a little

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.569 
goblins in my archers so that's a little
bit<00:02:00.960> unfortunate<00:02:01.259> seeing<00:02:02.040> as<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.189> needed<00:02:02.399> those

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
bit unfortunate seeing as I needed those

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.100 
bit unfortunate seeing as I needed those
guys<00:02:02.790> in<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.060> top<00:02:03.210> I'm<00:02:03.450> gonna<00:02:03.570> chop<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> couple

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
guys in the top I'm gonna chop a couple

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.800 
guys in the top I'm gonna chop a couple
more<00:02:04.259> goblins<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.009> yeah<00:02:05.880> now<00:02:06.270> there's<00:02:06.570> one

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
more goblins and yeah now there's one

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.570 
more goblins and yeah now there's one
more<00:02:06.840> elixir<00:02:07.259> pump<00:02:07.530> on<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.829> top<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.280> if<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.429> had

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
more elixir pump on the top and if I had

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.919 
more elixir pump on the top and if I had
some<00:02:08.729> Giants<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.270> would<00:02:09.390> have<00:02:09.479> been<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.629> lot

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
some Giants it would have been a lot

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:10.389 
some Giants it would have been a lot
easier

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
easier

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.429 
easier
but<00:02:10.939> seeing<00:02:11.209> as<00:02:11.299> I<00:02:11.420> only<00:02:11.450> have<00:02:11.900> archers<00:02:12.290> and

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:12.439 
but seeing as I only have archers and

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:13.360 
but seeing as I only have archers and
goblins<00:02:12.500> it's<00:02:12.980> going<00:02:13.099> to<00:02:13.159> be<00:02:13.220> pretty

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
goblins it's going to be pretty

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.830 
goblins it's going to be pretty
difficult<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.939> I<00:02:13.970> really<00:02:14.209> only<00:02:14.390> have<00:02:14.599> two

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
difficult and I really only have two

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.319 
difficult and I really only have two
goblins<00:02:15.079> so<00:02:16.040> deciding<00:02:16.459> on<00:02:16.549> what<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:16.700> want<00:02:16.939> to<00:02:17.030> do

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
goblins so deciding on what I want to do

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.170 
goblins so deciding on what I want to do
I<00:02:17.659> know<00:02:17.720> this<00:02:18.019> dark<00:02:18.439> elixir<00:02:18.970> barracks<00:02:19.970> right

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
I know this dark elixir barracks right

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.509 
I know this dark elixir barracks right
here<00:02:20.450> is<00:02:20.599> in<00:02:21.110> my<00:02:21.230> way<00:02:21.470> or<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.099> guess<00:02:22.250> dark

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
here is in my way or I guess dark

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:23.649 
here is in my way or I guess dark
barracks<00:02:22.909> so<00:02:23.030> I'm<00:02:23.120> gonna<00:02:23.209> have<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:23.420> drop<00:02:23.599> a

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
barracks so I'm gonna have to drop a

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.030 
barracks so I'm gonna have to drop a
couple<00:02:23.810> of<00:02:24.019> archers<00:02:24.319> to<00:02:24.500> take<00:02:24.680> care<00:02:24.829> of<00:02:24.920> that

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
couple of archers to take care of that

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.679 
couple of archers to take care of that
and<00:02:25.310> then<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.459> couple<00:02:25.670> of<00:02:25.819> archers<00:02:26.120> after<00:02:26.540> that

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:26.689 
and then a couple of archers after that

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.229 
and then a couple of archers after that
to<00:02:27.230> run<00:02:27.439> to<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:27.799> elixir<00:02:28.099> pump<00:02:28.459> and<00:02:28.640> a<00:02:29.000> see<00:02:29.180> if

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
to run to the elixir pump and a see if

possible before I really focus on the
elixir<00:03:37.579> and<00:03:37.879> that's<00:03:38.239> why<00:03:38.359> I<00:03:38.419> broke<00:03:38.629> through

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
elixir and that's why I broke through

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.270 
elixir and that's why I broke through
those<00:03:38.989> compartments<00:03:39.290> as<00:03:39.560> soon<00:03:39.709> as<00:03:39.829> possible

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:41.580 
left and take care of this gold storage
right<00:04:40.150> here<00:04:40.389> alright<00:04:40.719> so<00:04:40.900> overall<00:04:41.229> pretty

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
right here alright so overall pretty

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.260 
right here alright so overall pretty
good<00:04:41.710> rate<00:04:42.129> I<00:04:42.159> only<00:04:42.550> left<00:04:42.759> a<00:04:42.849> little<00:04:42.969> bit<00:04:43.150> of

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
good rate I only left a little bit of

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.939 
good rate I only left a little bit of
gold<00:04:43.419> left<00:04:43.599> on<00:04:43.749> the<00:04:43.900> table<00:04:44.259> on<00:04:44.439> the<00:04:44.620> right<00:04:44.770> hand

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
gold left on the table on the right hand

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.029 
gold left on the table on the right hand
side<00:04:45.069> but<00:04:45.430> in<00:04:45.550> total<00:04:45.759> over<00:04:46.560> 500,000<00:04:47.560> resources

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 
side but in total over 500,000 resources

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:49.409 
side but in total over 500,000 resources
for<00:04:48.159> that<00:04:48.219> raid<00:04:48.490> I<00:04:48.520> sort<00:04:48.879> of<00:04:48.939> took<00:04:49.060> it<00:04:49.180> slowly

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
for that raid I sort of took it slowly

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.149 
for that raid I sort of took it slowly
on<00:04:49.629> win<00:04:49.960> part<00:04:50.229> by<00:04:50.319> part<00:04:50.499> in<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:50.740> base<00:04:50.919> and

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:51.159 
on win part by part in the base and

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:53.100 
on win part by part in the base and
ended<00:04:51.759> up<00:04:51.849> getting<00:04:52.120> pretty<00:04:52.270> much<00:04:52.509> everything

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
ended up getting pretty much everything

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.050 
ended up getting pretty much everything
so<00:04:53.139> really<00:04:53.680> good<00:04:53.800> raid<00:04:53.949> right<00:04:54.129> there<00:04:54.310> maybe<00:04:54.939> I

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
so really good raid right there maybe I

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.640 
so really good raid right there maybe I
should<00:04:55.270> start<00:04:55.449> bringing<00:04:55.689> more<00:04:56.110> wall<00:04:56.319> breakers

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
should start bringing more wall breakers

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.589 
should start bringing more wall breakers
just<00:04:56.919> in<00:04:57.039> case<00:04:57.250> but<00:04:57.460> overall<00:04:57.759> pretty<00:04:58.029> good<00:04:58.569> I

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:58.599

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
alright let's go and attack this next

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.050 
alright let's go and attack this next
base<00:05:02.080> here<00:05:02.259> this<00:05:02.409> guy's<00:05:02.580> 700,000<00:05:03.580> resources

so<00:05:28.719> I'm<00:05:28.839> making<00:05:29.020> my<00:05:29.259> way<00:05:29.289> through<00:05:29.409> goblins<00:05:30.099> are

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:30.159 
so I'm making my way through goblins are

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:31.709 
so I'm making my way through goblins are
slowly<00:05:30.550> but<00:05:30.789> surely<00:05:30.849> taking<00:05:31.360> care<00:05:31.479> of<00:05:31.509> these

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:31.719

slowly but surely taking care of these
guys<00:05:31.900> I<00:05:32.199> do<00:05:32.469> see<00:05:32.919> a<00:05:32.949> dark<00:05:33.370> elixir<00:05:33.610> pump<00:05:34.060> right

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
guys I do see a dark elixir pump right

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.790 
guys I do see a dark elixir pump right
there<00:05:34.330> that<00:05:34.870> I<00:05:34.900> might<00:05:35.110> want<00:05:35.319> to<00:05:35.379> take<00:05:35.529> care<00:05:35.740> of

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
there that I might want to take care of

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.290 
there that I might want to take care of
in<00:05:35.949> a<00:05:36.039> second<00:05:36.400> even<00:05:36.639> though<00:05:36.729> it<00:05:36.879> probably<00:05:37.180> only

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
in a second even though it probably only

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.179 
in a second even though it probably only
has<00:05:37.449> like<00:05:37.599> ninety<00:05:37.960> dark<00:05:38.169> elixir<00:05:38.379> so<00:05:39.009> I'm<00:05:39.069> going

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:39.189 
has like ninety dark elixir so I'm going

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:40.619 
has like ninety dark elixir so I'm going
to<00:05:39.219> draw<00:05:39.370> my<00:05:39.399> wall<00:05:39.699> breakers<00:05:40.060> drop<00:05:40.300> a<00:05:40.449> couple

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:40.629 
to draw my wall breakers drop a couple

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:42.240 
to draw my wall breakers drop a couple
of<00:05:40.810> goblins<00:05:41.229> and<00:05:41.379> of<00:05:41.710> those<00:05:41.830> guys<00:05:42.069> should

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
of goblins and of those guys should

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.889 
of goblins and of those guys should
break<00:05:42.370> through<00:05:42.460> and<00:05:42.849> take<00:05:43.330> care<00:05:43.479> of<00:05:43.569> that<00:05:43.659> pump

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:43.899 
break through and take care of that pump

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:45.749 
break through and take care of that pump
pretty<00:05:44.080> easily<00:05:44.289> so<00:05:44.680> this<00:05:45.039> guy's<00:05:45.189> sitting<00:05:45.520> at<00:05:45.729> a

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 
pretty easily so this guy's sitting at a

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:47.279 
pretty easily so this guy's sitting at a
hundred<00:05:46.000> thousand<00:05:46.509> gold<00:05:46.659> right<00:05:46.870> now<00:05:46.899> and

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
hundred thousand gold right now and

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:49.679 
hundred thousand gold right now and
eighty<00:05:47.529> two<00:05:47.800> thousand<00:05:48.310> elixir<00:05:48.849> I<00:05:49.029> could<00:05:49.479> break

00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:49.689 
eighty two thousand elixir I could break

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:51.059 
eighty two thousand elixir I could break
through<00:05:49.899> on<00:05:50.110> this<00:05:50.229> right<00:05:50.409> hand<00:05:50.589> side<00:05:50.680> and<00:05:50.949> get

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:51.069 
through on this right hand side and get

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:52.469 
through on this right hand side and get
to<00:05:51.189> this<00:05:51.339> gold<00:05:51.550> storage<00:05:51.789> right<00:05:52.000> here<00:05:52.210> so<00:05:52.389> let

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
to this gold storage right here so let

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.300 
to this gold storage right here so let
me<00:05:52.509> go<00:05:52.569> and<00:05:52.719> drop<00:05:52.870> two<00:05:53.050> wall<00:05:53.259> breakers<00:05:53.589> follow

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
me go and drop two wall breakers follow

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.980 
me go and drop two wall breakers follow
up<00:05:54.520> by<00:05:54.610> a<00:05:54.639> couple<00:05:54.849> of<00:05:54.969> goblins<00:05:55.389> and<00:05:55.569> seeing<00:05:55.899> as

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
up by a couple of goblins and seeing as

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.300 
up by a couple of goblins and seeing as
it<00:05:56.110> was<00:05:56.139> really<00:05:56.409> easy<00:05:56.649> to<00:05:56.770> break<00:05:56.979> into<00:05:57.159> this

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
it was really easy to break into this

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.860 
it was really easy to break into this
and<00:05:57.520> there's<00:05:57.639> fifty<00:05:57.939> thousand<00:05:58.300> gold<00:05:58.479> inside

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
and there's fifty thousand gold inside

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.659 
and there's fifty thousand gold inside
of<00:05:59.020> each<00:05:59.139> of<00:05:59.169> these<00:05:59.349> storages<00:05:59.860> wasn't<00:06:00.490> a<00:06:00.520> bad

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
of each of these storages wasn't a bad

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:02.369 
of each of these storages wasn't a bad
idea<00:06:00.699> to<00:06:01.060> try<00:06:01.210> to<00:06:01.240> get<00:06:01.389> as<00:06:01.509> much<00:06:01.719> gold<00:06:01.779> as<00:06:02.289> I

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:02.379 
idea to try to get as much gold as I

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:04.139 
idea to try to get as much gold as I
could<00:06:02.589> unfortunately<00:06:03.250> there<00:06:03.639> was<00:06:03.759> a<00:06:03.789> wizard

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:04.149 
could unfortunately there was a wizard

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:05.550 
could unfortunately there was a wizard
tower<00:06:04.300> and<00:06:04.539> mortar<00:06:04.779> shooting<00:06:05.050> me<00:06:05.139> down<00:06:05.169> so<00:06:05.500> I

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
tower and mortar shooting me down so I

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.860 
tower and mortar shooting me down so I
couldn't<00:06:05.800> do<00:06:05.889> too<00:06:06.039> much<00:06:06.189> but<00:06:06.699> still<00:06:07.000> over<00:06:07.689> five

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
couldn't do too much but still over five

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.480 
couldn't do too much but still over five
hundred<00:06:07.899> thousand<00:06:08.529> resources<00:06:09.039> for<00:06:09.159> this<00:06:09.279> raid

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
hundred thousand resources for this raid

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.279 
hundred thousand resources for this raid
somewhere<00:06:09.849> around<00:06:09.939> five<00:06:10.270> hundred<00:06:10.300> and<00:06:10.810> twenty

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 
somewhere around five hundred and twenty

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:13.350 
somewhere around five hundred and twenty
five<00:06:11.409> five<00:06:11.710> hundred<00:06:12.009> and<00:06:12.099> thirty<00:06:12.159> so<00:06:13.029> really

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
five five hundred and thirty so really

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.999 
five five hundred and thirty so really
really<00:06:13.509> good<00:06:13.659> raid<00:06:13.990> and<00:06:14.199> let's<00:06:14.710> go<00:06:14.800> ahead<00:06:14.860> and

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:15.009 
really good raid and let's go ahead and

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:16.529 
really good raid and let's go ahead and
head<00:06:15.399> back<00:06:15.550> to<00:06:15.610> base<00:06:15.759> and<00:06:16.060> do<00:06:16.149> a<00:06:16.180> couple<00:06:16.360> of

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:16.539 
head back to base and do a couple of

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:18.839 
head back to base and do a couple of
upgrades<00:06:16.930> so<00:06:17.439> I<00:06:17.500> did<00:06:17.649> about<00:06:17.860> maybe<00:06:18.339> an<00:06:18.729> hour

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:18.849 
upgrades so I did about maybe an hour

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:20.219 
upgrades so I did about maybe an hour
and<00:06:19.000> a<00:06:19.029> half<00:06:19.149> of<00:06:19.270> raiding<00:06:19.479> today<00:06:19.750> I<00:06:19.779> ended<00:06:20.139> up

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:20.229 
and a half of raiding today I ended up

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:22.350 
and a half of raiding today I ended up
getting<00:06:20.379> 2.6<00:06:21.099> million<00:06:21.279> gold<00:06:21.550> 2.8<00:06:22.120> million

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
getting 2.6 million gold 2.8 million

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.450 
getting 2.6 million gold 2.8 million
elixir<00:06:22.930> the<00:06:23.349> gold<00:06:23.620> does<00:06:23.860> give<00:06:24.069> me<00:06:24.159> enough<00:06:24.370> to

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
elixir the gold does give me enough to

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.219 
elixir the gold does give me enough to
upgrade<00:06:24.789> three<00:06:25.000> of<00:06:25.089> my<00:06:25.180> cannons<00:06:25.599> and<00:06:25.839> seeing

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:26.229 
upgrade three of my cannons and seeing

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:28.110 
upgrade three of my cannons and seeing
as<00:06:26.349> I'm<00:06:26.469> going<00:06:26.710> over<00:06:26.889> quantity<00:06:27.520> over<00:06:28.089> quality

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 
as I'm going over quantity over quality

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.570 
as I'm going over quantity over quality
I'd<00:06:29.050> probably<00:06:29.229> rather<00:06:29.469> upgrade<00:06:29.949> all<00:06:30.159> three<00:06:30.490> of

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
I'd probably rather upgrade all three of

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.980 
I'd probably rather upgrade all three of
my<00:06:30.669> cannons<00:06:31.029> right<00:06:31.180> now<00:06:31.300> instead<00:06:31.629> of<00:06:31.719> doing

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
my cannons right now instead of doing

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.449 
my cannons right now instead of doing
like<00:06:32.110> maybe<00:06:32.319> a<00:06:32.409> big<00:06:32.620> upgrade<00:06:32.769> around<00:06:33.159> my<00:06:33.279> base

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:33.459 
like maybe a big upgrade around my base

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:34.390 
like maybe a big upgrade around my base
so<00:06:33.639> let<00:06:33.729> me<00:06:33.789> go<00:06:33.849> ahead<00:06:33.909> and<00:06:34.000> upgrade

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 
so let me go ahead and upgrade

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.640 
so let me go ahead and upgrade
those<00:06:34.550> guys<00:06:34.790> and<00:06:35.090> then<00:06:35.570> as<00:06:35.720> far<00:06:35.960> as<00:06:36.139> my<00:06:36.290> elixir

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
those guys and then as far as my elixir

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.680 
those guys and then as far as my elixir
goes<00:06:36.979> like<00:06:37.520> I<00:06:37.639> said<00:06:37.820> earlier<00:06:38.150> I<00:06:38.300> definitely

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
goes like I said earlier I definitely

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.150 
goes like I said earlier I definitely
want<00:06:38.810> to<00:06:38.840> build<00:06:39.020> this<00:06:39.110> dark<00:06:39.320> spell<00:06:39.560> Factory<00:06:39.979> as

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 
want to build this dark spell Factory as

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.650 
want to build this dark spell Factory as
soon<00:06:40.400> as<00:06:40.580> possible<00:06:41.090> so<00:06:41.210> let<00:06:41.300> me<00:06:41.360> go<00:06:41.449> ahead<00:06:41.509> and

soon as possible so let me go ahead and

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.510 
soon as possible so let me go ahead and
plot<00:06:41.810> that<00:06:42.020> guy<00:06:42.169> down<00:06:42.470> that<00:06:42.770> should<00:06:42.949> be<00:06:43.070> it<00:06:43.460> for

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
plot that guy down that should be it for

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.390 
plot that guy down that should be it for
the<00:06:43.850> elixir<00:06:44.210> upgrades<00:06:44.720> I<00:06:44.990> do<00:06:45.440> actually<00:06:46.220> want

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
the elixir upgrades I do actually want

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.400 
the elixir upgrades I do actually want
to<00:06:46.460> upgrade<00:06:46.820> some<00:06:47.360> troops<00:06:47.660> inside<00:06:47.960> of<00:06:48.259> my

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410 
to upgrade some troops inside of my

to upgrade some troops inside of my
laboratory<00:06:48.650> so<00:06:49.250> rather<00:06:49.460> than<00:06:49.699> do<00:06:49.880> some

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.150 
laboratory so rather than do some

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.850 
laboratory so rather than do some
smaller<00:06:50.630> elixir<00:06:51.169> upgrades<00:06:51.530> I'm<00:06:51.620> just<00:06:51.740> going
