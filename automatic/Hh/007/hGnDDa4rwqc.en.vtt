00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
so that's not really a deal-breaker

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.879 
so that's not really a deal-breaker
that's<00:03:39.660> just<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.900> personal<00:03:40.109> preference<00:03:40.470> on<00:03:40.709> my

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
light deserves something with just a

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.009 
light deserves something with just a
little<00:04:10.620> bit<00:04:10.739> more<00:04:11.359> elegance<00:04:12.359> and<00:04:12.540> quality

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
little bit more elegance and quality

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.800 
little bit more elegance and quality
behind<00:04:13.380> it<00:04:13.590> but<00:04:14.190> it<00:04:14.760> did<00:04:14.970> work<00:04:15.150> as<00:04:15.329> advertised

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
behind it but it did work as advertised

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.719 
behind it but it did work as advertised
so<00:04:16.019> i<00:04:16.049> must<00:04:16.260> say<00:04:16.440> that<00:04:16.470> and<00:04:16.979> you<00:04:17.519> got<00:04:17.639> to

so i must say that and you got to

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.219 
so i must say that and you got to
remember<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:18.150> price<00:04:18.329> point<00:04:18.660> of<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:18.810> light<00:04:19.019> as
