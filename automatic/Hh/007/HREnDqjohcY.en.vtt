bitterness of this citrus so right now
I'm<00:00:39.660> almost<00:00:39.900> done<00:00:40.170> juicing<00:00:40.680> about<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.010> half<00:00:41.280> a

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
I'm almost done juicing about a half a

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.090 
I'm almost done juicing about a half a
head<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.820> green<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:45.440> if<00:00:46.440> you've<00:00:46.650> never<00:00:46.800> done

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
head of green and if you've never done

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.460 
head of green and if you've never done
breed<00:00:47.400> you<00:00:47.640> before<00:00:48.150> or<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.510> blended<00:00:49.200> green

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
breed you before or a blended green

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.010 
breed you before or a blended green
shape<00:00:49.820> i'd<00:00:50.820> say<00:00:50.880> start<00:00:51.450> with<00:00:51.630> the<00:00:51.750> juice

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
shape i'd say start with the juice

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.910 
shape i'd say start with the juice
instead<00:00:52.740> of<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.010> blended<00:00:53.520> green<00:00:53.790> shape<00:00:54.060> because

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
instead of a blended green shape because

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.880 
instead of a blended green shape because
it<00:00:55.920> uses<00:00:56.220> the<00:00:56.910> whole<00:00:57.120> thing<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.900> fast<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.800> then

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
it uses the whole thing so fast and then

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.990 
it uses the whole thing so fast and then
you<00:00:58.980> get<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.160> hundred<00:00:59.400> percent<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.880> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
you get a hundred percent of the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.600 
you get a hundred percent of the
nutrients<00:01:00.570> by<00:01:00.690> juicing<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.830> it's<00:01:02.100> incredibly

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
nutrients by juicing and it's incredibly

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.690 
nutrients by juicing and it's incredibly
good<00:01:02.850> for<00:01:03.000> your<00:01:03.090> digestion<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:04.080> irene

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
good for your digestion and irene

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
there also full bar fill which

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.870 
there also full bar fill which
interesting<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.460> enough<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:13.430> close<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
interesting the enough is close to the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.860 
interesting the enough is close to the
human's<00:01:15.299> blood<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:16.229> terms<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.799> module

human's blood in terms of module

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.700 
human's blood in terms of module
for<00:01:18.200> only<00:01:18.320> one<00:01:18.620> molecule<00:01:18.860> off<00:01:19.370> and<00:01:20.470> we<00:01:21.470> have

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
for only one molecule off and we have

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.080 
for only one molecule off and we have
iron<00:01:22.070> I<00:01:22.580> mean<00:01:23.800> sorry<00:01:24.800> green<00:01:25.160> tough<00:01:25.520> the

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
iron I mean sorry green tough the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.720 
iron I mean sorry green tough the
chlorophyllin<00:01:26.540> greens<00:01:26.840> have<00:01:27.050> iron

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
chlorophyllin greens have iron

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.000 
chlorophyllin greens have iron
chlorophyll<00:01:28.730> and<00:01:29.150> blood<00:01:29.630> has<00:01:29.930> magnesium<00:01:30.440> so

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
chlorophyll and blood has magnesium so

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.340 
chlorophyll and blood has magnesium so
that's<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.430> one<00:01:34.420> a<00:01:35.420> little<00:01:36.110> bit<00:01:36.230> more

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
that's the one a little bit more

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.770 
that's the one a little bit more
finished<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:37.850> then<00:01:37.910> grapefruit<00:01:38.510> as<00:01:38.660> you

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
finished and then grapefruit as you

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.340 
finished and then grapefruit as you
probably<00:01:38.990> know<00:01:39.260> it's<00:01:39.520> it's<00:01:40.520> full<00:01:41.360> of<00:01:41.630> vitamin

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
probably know it's it's full of vitamin

i'm<00:01:57.410> going<00:01:57.560> to<00:01:57.620> put<00:01:57.830> in<00:01:58.040> grapefruit

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.069 

for<00:02:04.220> some<00:02:04.369> of<00:02:04.490> you<00:02:04.640> may<00:02:04.790> be<00:02:04.850> hard<00:02:05.119> to<00:02:05.210> keep<00:02:05.810> rate

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
for some of you may be hard to keep rate

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:07.389 
for some of you may be hard to keep rate
for<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.409> loan<00:02:06.590> but<00:02:06.770> when<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:07.009> put<00:02:07.220> it<00:02:07.280> with

for the loan but when you put it with

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.339 
for the loan but when you put it with
the<00:02:07.430> Greens<00:02:07.820> it<00:02:08.119> really<00:02:08.360> puts<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:08.810> opposite

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
the Greens it really puts the opposite

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.729 
the Greens it really puts the opposite
and<00:02:09.649> then<00:02:10.520> we'll<00:02:10.670> add<00:02:10.819> our<00:02:10.849> stevia<00:02:11.450> and<00:02:11.690> as<00:02:12.590> you

and then we'll add our stevia and as you

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.860 
and then we'll add our stevia and as you
can<00:02:12.890> see<00:02:12.920> there's<00:02:13.280> many<00:02:14.209> many<00:02:14.390> different

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870
