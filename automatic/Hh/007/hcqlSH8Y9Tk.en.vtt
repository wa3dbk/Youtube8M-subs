cubes<00:00:57.510> because<00:00:58.340> they<00:00:59.340> sent<00:00:59.609> me<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.940> view<00:01:00.210> cube

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
cubes because they sent me a view cube

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.240 
cubes because they sent me a view cube
collection<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.109> bought<00:01:01.350> for<00:01:01.530> over<00:01:01.710> $100

and<00:01:02.430> all<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> cubes<00:01:02.969> were<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.390> tight<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.690> could

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
and all the cubes were so tight I could

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.230 
and all the cubes were so tight I could
barely<00:01:04.260> turn<00:01:04.530> them<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.939> wanted<00:01:06.180> to

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
barely turn them and I wanted to

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.520 
barely turn them and I wanted to
exchange<00:01:06.630> them<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.930> they<00:01:07.200> wouldn't<00:01:07.470> even

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
exchange them and they wouldn't even

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.740

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
with the V cube 3 and they sent me one

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.090 
with the V cube 3 and they sent me one
and<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> pieces<00:01:15.390> were<00:01:15.659> glued<00:01:16.110> together<00:01:16.560> it
