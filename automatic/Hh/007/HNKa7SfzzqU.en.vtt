PEGI<00:00:00.980> 18<00:00:14.410> when<00:00:15.410> you<00:00:15.530> look<00:00:15.830> at<00:00:15.950> it<00:00:15.980> spinner<00:00:16.460> cell

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
PEGI 18 when you look at it spinner cell

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.269 
PEGI 18 when you look at it spinner cell
one<00:00:17.060> was<00:00:17.539> a<00:00:17.570> benchmark<00:00:18.260> when<00:00:18.619> it<00:00:18.740> came<00:00:18.890> out<00:00:18.920> and

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
one was a benchmark when it came out and

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.180 
one was a benchmark when it came out and
splinter<00:00:19.699> cell<00:00:19.910> 3<00:00:20.270> was<00:00:20.810> probably<00:00:21.199> the<00:00:21.830> best

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
splinter cell 3 was probably the best

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.790 
splinter cell 3 was probably the best
looking<00:00:22.699> game<00:00:22.910> of<00:00:23.180> the<00:00:23.779> last<00:00:24.050> generation<00:00:24.560> of

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
looking game of the last generation of

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.009 
looking game of the last generation of
consoles<00:00:25.130> so<00:00:25.760> it<00:00:25.880> was<00:00:26.029> extremely<00:00:26.390> important

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
consoles so it was extremely important

consoles so it was extremely important
for<00:00:27.080> us<00:00:27.350> that<00:00:27.380> when<00:00:27.890> we<00:00:27.920> released<00:00:28.580> our<00:00:28.820> spinner

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
for us that when we released our spinner

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.839 
for us that when we released our spinner
cell<00:00:29.960> conviction<00:00:30.260> that<00:00:30.650> it<00:00:31.220> came<00:00:31.430> out<00:00:31.609> as

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
cell conviction that it came out as

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.410 
cell conviction that it came out as
strong<00:00:33.399> we<00:00:34.399> came<00:00:34.579> up<00:00:34.609> with<00:00:34.879> a<00:00:34.909> bunch<00:00:35.120> of<00:00:35.210> things

is we're integrating in the environment
the<00:00:45.199> objectives<00:00:45.739> that<00:00:45.889> were<00:00:46.010> given<00:00:46.159> to<00:00:46.309> the

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:46.459 
the objectives that were given to the

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:49.629 
the objectives that were given to the
player<00:00:47.649> will<00:00:48.649> actually<00:00:48.949> be<00:00:49.100> telling<00:00:49.549> you

wanted to know we'll be seeing
flashbacks<00:00:54.170> where<00:00:54.709> things<00:00:55.039> projected<00:00:55.579> on<00:00:55.699> the

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:55.729 
flashbacks where things projected on the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:57.399 
flashbacks where things projected on the
walls<00:00:55.999> that<00:00:56.119> will<00:00:56.359> explain<00:00:56.719> that<00:00:56.929> so

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:57.409 
walls that will explain that so

00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:58.809 
walls that will explain that so
everything<00:00:58.129> is<00:00:58.219> integrated<00:00:58.429> in<00:00:58.789> the

00:00:58.809 --> 00:00:58.819 
everything is integrated in the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:00.969 
everything is integrated in the
environment<00:00:59.179> and<00:00:59.569> it<00:00:59.719> allows<00:01:00.170> you<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:00.469> tell

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:00.979 
environment and it allows you to tell

environment and it allows you to tell
the<00:01:01.100> story<00:01:01.369> without<00:01:01.789> taking<00:01:02.779> the<00:01:02.809> control

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
the story without taking the control

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.060 
the story without taking the control
from<00:01:03.469> the<00:01:03.589> player

damaged<00:01:58.020> system<00:01:58.440> so<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.070> more<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.280> beat<00:01:59.520> up

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
damaged system so the more you beat up

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.460 
damaged system so the more you beat up
the<00:01:59.759> guy<00:01:59.789> to<00:02:00.149> get<00:02:00.300> information<00:02:00.630> while<00:02:01.170> the

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
the guy to get information while the

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.930 
the guy to get information while the
more<00:02:01.680> he's<00:02:01.800> gonna<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.280> going<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.580> show<00:02:02.729> like

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
more he's gonna is going to show like

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.210 
more he's gonna is going to show like
he's<00:02:03.390> beaten<00:02:03.690> up<00:02:06.050> it<00:02:07.050> gets<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.500> little<00:02:07.710> violent

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
he's beaten up it gets a little violent

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.870 
he's beaten up it gets a little violent
but<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:09.000> gets<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.330> job<00:02:09.390> done<00:02:10.549> we<00:02:11.549> wanted<00:02:11.850> to

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
but it gets the job done we wanted to

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.490 
but it gets the job done we wanted to
have<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.150> unity<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.690> time<00:02:13.019> and<00:02:13.230> location

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
have a unity of time and location

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.440 
have a unity of time and location
because<00:02:14.100> we<00:02:14.220> find<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.549> that<00:02:14.970> makes<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.330> all

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
because we find that that makes it all

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.240 
because we find that that makes it all
more<00:02:15.480> personal<00:02:16.080> for<00:02:16.110> players<00:02:16.470> it's<00:02:16.950> more

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
more personal for players it's more

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.979 
more personal for players it's more
interesting<00:02:17.549> story<00:02:18.000> wise<00:02:18.209> because<00:02:18.600> the

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
interesting story wise because the

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.530 
interesting story wise because the
events<00:02:19.410> are<00:02:19.560> unfolding<00:02:19.769> a<00:02:20.459> lot<00:02:20.610> faster<00:02:21.150> so

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
events are unfolding a lot faster so

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.080 
events are unfolding a lot faster so
Washington<00:02:22.049> was<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.290> very<00:02:22.620> interesting

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
Washington was a very interesting

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.759 
Washington was a very interesting
location<00:02:24.090> for<00:02:24.329> us<00:02:24.450> because<00:02:24.660> obviously<00:02:24.930> it's

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
location for us because obviously it's

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.920 
location for us because obviously it's
that<00:02:26.070> it's<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.370> heart<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:27.060> United<00:02:27.720> States

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
that it's the heart of the United States

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.710 
that it's the heart of the United States
it's<00:02:28.709> also<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:29.250> very<00:02:29.400> interesting<00:02:30.209> location

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
it's also a very interesting location

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.259 
it's also a very interesting location
for<00:02:31.170> Sam<00:02:31.320> Fisher<00:02:31.709> it<00:02:32.010> was<00:02:32.190> working<00:02:32.519> for<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.820> US

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
for Sam Fisher it was working for the US

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.780 
for Sam Fisher it was working for the US
government<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.440> idea<00:02:34.739> that<00:02:34.829> the<00:02:35.220> Sam<00:02:35.489> is

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
government the idea that the Sam is

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.150 
government the idea that the Sam is
facing<00:02:36.510> his<00:02:37.190> former<00:02:38.360> agency<00:02:39.360> home<00:02:40.110> was<00:02:40.920> very

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
facing his former agency home was very

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.190 
facing his former agency home was very
interesting<00:02:41.579> from<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.850> character<00:02:42.690> perspective

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
interesting from a character perspective

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.620 
interesting from a character perspective
we<00:02:44.130> took<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.430> lot<00:02:44.579> of<00:02:44.610> risk<00:02:44.910> when<00:02:45.180> we<00:02:45.299> approached

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
we took a lot of risk when we approached

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.420 
we took a lot of risk when we approached
the<00:02:45.930> design<00:02:46.320> for<00:02:46.590> this<00:02:46.680> we<00:02:46.860> came<00:02:47.130> up<00:02:47.160> with<00:02:47.400> a

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
the design for this we came up with a

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.060 
the design for this we came up with a
whole<00:02:47.760> bunch<00:02:48.299> of<00:02:48.780> new<00:02:49.019> design<00:02:49.470> elements<00:02:49.950> that

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
whole bunch of new design elements that

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.069 
whole bunch of new design elements that
have<00:02:50.250> never<00:02:50.519> been<00:02:50.760> done<00:02:51.000> before<00:02:51.390> in<00:02:51.720> any<00:02:51.870> other

game<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:53.730> day<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.180> all<00:02:54.329> those<00:02:54.510> elements

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
game and the day that all those elements

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.650 
game and the day that all those elements
came<00:02:55.110> together<00:02:55.290> was<00:02:55.650> fascinating<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.790> finally

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
came together was fascinating it finally
