what we're doing today so let's check
out<00:02:41.450> both<00:02:41.690> channels<00:02:42.020> we'll<00:02:42.230> start<00:02:42.590> with<00:02:42.920> the

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
out both channels we'll start with the

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:57.270 
out both channels we'll start with the
clean<00:02:43.370> channel<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.880> start<00:02:44.120> with

whenever I pluck a string it will start

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.900 
whenever I pluck a string it will start
to<00:03:40.970> operate<00:03:41.240> and<00:03:42.370> it'll<00:03:43.370> turn<00:03:43.460> both<00:03:43.670> are<00:03:43.820> in

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
to operate and it'll turn both are in

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.610 
to operate and it'll turn both are in
tune<00:03:44.120> and<00:03:44.270> luckily<00:03:44.540> I'm<00:03:44.780> in<00:03:44.960> Tunes<00:03:45.230> it's<00:03:45.500> gone

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
tune and luckily I'm in Tunes it's gone

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.770 
tune and luckily I'm in Tunes it's gone
straight<00:03:45.890> to<00:03:45.950> green<00:03:46.310> if<00:03:47.000> I<00:03:47.150> was<00:03:47.300> out<00:03:47.450> of<00:03:47.480> tune

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
straight to green if I was out of tune

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.520 
straight to green if I was out of tune
so<00:03:48.050> if<00:03:48.140> I<00:03:48.230> D<00:03:48.290> to<00:03:49.810> you<00:03:50.810> can<00:03:50.990> see<00:03:51.230> that<00:03:51.410> it's

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
so if I D to you can see that it's

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.590 
so if I D to you can see that it's
moving<00:03:51.770> with<00:03:52.010> that<00:03:52.070> so<00:03:52.490> if<00:03:52.910> I'm<00:03:53.180> banging<00:03:53.510> the

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
moving with that so if I'm banging the

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.600 
moving with that so if I'm banging the
centre<00:03:53.900> there<00:03:54.110> that<00:03:54.710> means<00:03:54.830> I'm<00:03:55.010> in<00:03:55.070> tune<00:03:55.370> and

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
centre there that means I'm in tune and

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.740 
centre there that means I'm in tune and
then<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:55.820> can<00:03:55.970> move<00:03:56.090> on<00:03:56.270> it<00:03:56.390> will<00:03:56.480> recognize

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
then you can move on it will recognize

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.140 
then you can move on it will recognize
you<00:03:56.990> string<00:03:57.380> as<00:03:57.620> you<00:03:57.650> play<00:03:57.950> it<00:03:58.070> so<00:03:58.850> my<00:03:59.000> eyes<00:03:59.120> a

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
you string as you play it so my eyes a

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.330 
you string as you play it so my eyes a
little<00:03:59.330> bit<00:03:59.450> sharp<00:03:59.840> there<00:04:00.140> roll<00:04:01.010> it<00:04:01.190> back<00:04:01.220> a

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
little bit sharp there roll it back a

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.670 
little bit sharp there roll it back a
little<00:04:01.430> bit<00:04:01.810> until<00:04:02.810> we<00:04:02.840> get<00:04:03.020> into<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.320> center

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.260
