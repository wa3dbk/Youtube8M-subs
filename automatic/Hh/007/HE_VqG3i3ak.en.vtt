recess<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.750> bottom<00:02:01.049> here<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.950> just

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
recess in the bottom here and you just

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.709 
recess in the bottom here and you just
pop<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.090> there

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.109 

okay<00:02:06.719> now<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.960> secret<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.590> in<00:02:07.860> how<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.759> add

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
okay now the secret is in how you add

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.140 
okay now the secret is in how you add
the<00:02:09.300> water<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.869> coffee<00:02:10.400> you<00:02:11.400> start<00:02:12.000> out

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
the water in the coffee you start out

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.110 
the water in the coffee you start out
you<00:02:12.510> add<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.690> couple

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
you add a couple

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.369 
you add a couple
cups<00:02:13.239> of<00:02:13.390> water<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.299> brewer<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:20.140> then<00:02:20.290> you

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
cups of water to the brewer and then you

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.369 
cups of water to the brewer and then you
pour<00:02:20.620> about<00:02:21.299> half<00:02:22.299> of<00:02:22.599> the<00:02:22.690> coffee<00:02:22.930> in<00:02:23.170> there

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
pour about half of the coffee in there

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.039 
pour about half of the coffee in there
now<00:02:24.069> this<00:02:24.519> is<00:02:24.670> made<00:02:24.879> to<00:02:25.090> brew<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.920> full<00:02:26.920> pound<00:02:27.280> of

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
now this is made to brew a full pound of

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.380 
now this is made to brew a full pound of
ground<00:02:29.049> coffee<00:02:29.319> and<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:30.849> grind<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.269> you

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
ground coffee and the grind that you

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.020 
ground coffee and the grind that you
need<00:02:31.599> is<00:02:31.840> very<00:02:32.349> coarse<00:02:32.739> grind<00:02:33.159> so<00:02:33.579> almost<00:02:33.909> like

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
need is very coarse grind so almost like

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.830 
need is very coarse grind so almost like
a<00:02:34.150> percolator

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
a percolator

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.559 
a percolator
French<00:02:35.170> press<00:02:35.440> type<00:02:35.680> of<00:02:35.829> grind<00:02:36.390> don't<00:02:37.390> use

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
French press type of grind don't use

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.240 
French press type of grind don't use
anything<00:02:37.840> finer<00:02:38.260> because<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:38.709> will<00:02:38.829> clog<00:02:39.040> the

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
anything finer because it will clog the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.600 
anything finer because it will clog the
brewer<00:02:39.519> and<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.930> will<00:02:41.049> also<00:02:41.230> extract<00:02:42.159> too<00:02:42.579> much

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
brewer and it will also extract too much

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.330 
brewer and it will also extract too much
of<00:02:42.909> the<00:02:43.000> flavor<00:02:43.180> which<00:02:43.569> will<00:02:43.750> make<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:43.930> bitter

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
of the flavor which will make it bitter

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.680 
of the flavor which will make it bitter
cold<00:02:45.340> food<00:02:45.489> coffee<00:02:45.670> isn't<00:02:46.000> better<00:02:46.239> when<00:02:46.569> you

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
cold food coffee isn't better when you

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.650 
cold food coffee isn't better when you
do<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:47.079> with<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.290> coarse<00:02:47.769> grind<00:02:48.099> so<00:02:48.940> add<00:02:49.269> a<00:02:49.299> half

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
do it with a coarse grind so add a half

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.800 
do it with a coarse grind so add a half
a<00:02:49.780> pound<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.299> brewer

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
a pound to the brewer

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.330 
a pound to the brewer
you<00:02:52.959> can<00:02:53.170> use<00:02:53.379> less<00:02:53.650> if<00:02:53.829> you<00:02:53.950> don't<00:02:54.129> want<00:02:54.280> to

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
you can use less if you don't want to

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.580 
you can use less if you don't want to
make<00:02:54.459> so<00:02:54.670> much<00:02:54.819> but<00:02:55.629> it<00:02:55.720> will<00:02:55.810> stay<00:02:56.049> fresh<00:02:56.109> in

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
make so much but it will stay fresh in

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.339 
make so much but it will stay fresh in
the<00:02:56.739> in<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.220> fridge<00:02:57.549> for<00:02:58.540> two<00:02:59.109> weeks

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
the in the fridge for two weeks

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.589 
the in the fridge for two weeks
afterwards<00:02:59.890> so<00:03:00.640> after<00:03:00.940> you<00:03:01.030> brew<00:03:01.209> it<00:03:01.329> you<00:03:01.450> can

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
afterwards so after you brew it you can

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:02.789 
afterwards so after you brew it you can
store<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:01.989> in<00:03:02.019> the<00:03:02.109> fridge<00:03:02.319> for<00:03:02.349> a<00:03:02.560> couple

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
store it in the fridge for a couple

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.920 
store it in the fridge for a couple
weeks<00:03:02.829> you<00:03:03.609> can<00:03:03.849> make<00:03:04.030> less<00:03:04.269> so<00:03:04.569> just

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
weeks you can make less so just

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.410 
weeks you can make less so just
proportionally<00:03:05.590> lower<00:03:06.549> the<00:03:06.760> amount<00:03:07.000> of<00:03:07.120> water

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
proportionally lower the amount of water

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.559 
proportionally lower the amount of water
to<00:03:07.599> coffee<00:03:08.109> ratio<00:03:08.859> and<00:03:09.159> if<00:03:09.909> you're<00:03:10.180> using<00:03:10.359> the

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
to coffee ratio and if you're using the

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.229 
to coffee ratio and if you're using the
whole<00:03:10.599> pound<00:03:11.019> just<00:03:11.500> fill<00:03:11.829> this<00:03:12.069> decanter<00:03:12.940> all

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
whole pound just fill this decanter all

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.580 
whole pound just fill this decanter all
the<00:03:13.329> way<00:03:13.420> up<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.599> the<00:03:13.690> top<00:03:13.900> that's<00:03:14.140> about<00:03:14.349> nine

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
the way up to the top that's about nine

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.530 
the way up to the top that's about nine
cups<00:03:14.829> now<00:03:15.340> I've<00:03:15.489> added<00:03:15.700> half<00:03:16.000> a<00:03:16.180> pound<00:03:16.390> of

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
cups now I've added half a pound of

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.690 
cups now I've added half a pound of
coffee<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.500> couple<00:03:17.799> of<00:03:17.859> cups<00:03:18.069> of<00:03:18.190> water<00:03:18.430> and

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
coffee to a couple of cups of water and

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.599 
coffee to a couple of cups of water and
the<00:03:19.150> dried<00:03:19.660> coffee<00:03:19.900> is<00:03:20.139> in<00:03:20.260> there<00:03:20.489> when<00:03:21.489> you

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
the dried coffee is in there when you

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.210 
the dried coffee is in there when you
add<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:22.060> water<00:03:22.299> just<00:03:23.019> do<00:03:23.169> it<00:03:23.290> slowly<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:23.889> pour

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
add the water just do it slowly and pour

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.479 
add the water just do it slowly and pour
in<00:03:24.310> a<00:03:24.400> circular<00:03:24.639> motion<00:03:24.970> so<00:03:25.810> that<00:03:26.099> you<00:03:27.099> totally

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
in a circular motion so that you totally

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.539 
in a circular motion so that you totally
saturate<00:03:28.060> all<00:03:28.329> of<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.780> coffee<00:03:29.470> grinds<00:03:30.069> you're

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
saturate all of the coffee grinds you're

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:31.890 
saturate all of the coffee grinds you're
not<00:03:30.700> going<00:03:30.910> to<00:03:30.970> stir<00:03:31.150> it<00:03:31.269> because<00:03:31.299> that<00:03:31.720> will

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
not going to stir it because that will

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.690 
not going to stir it because that will
cause<00:03:32.859> the<00:03:33.069> filter<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.489> clog<00:03:33.780> so<00:03:34.780> just

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
cause the filter to clog so just

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.580 
cause the filter to clog so just
continuously<00:03:36.700> gently<00:03:37.180> add<00:03:37.359> the<00:03:37.540> water<00:03:37.720> in<00:03:38.079> a

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
continuously gently add the water in a

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.379 
continuously gently add the water in a
circular<00:03:39.040> motion<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.459> wet<00:03:39.940> all<00:03:40.150> of<00:03:40.299> the

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
circular motion to wet all of the

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.379 
circular motion to wet all of the
grounds<00:03:41.220> sufficiently

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
grounds sufficiently

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:46.379 
grounds sufficiently
so<00:03:43.389> you<00:03:43.449> just<00:03:43.840> do<00:03:44.290> this<00:03:44.410> to<00:03:44.620> this<00:03:44.739> half<00:03:45.010> and<00:03:45.389> add

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
so you just do this to this half and add

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.170 
so you just do this to this half and add
about<00:03:46.629> half<00:03:47.019> of<00:03:47.199> the<00:03:47.260> water<00:03:47.440> to<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.400> brewing

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
about half of the water to the brewing

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.780 
about half of the water to the brewing
mixture<00:03:49.690> I<00:03:49.959> like<00:03:50.410> to<00:03:50.530> use<00:03:50.680> something<00:03:51.549> to<00:03:51.609> pour

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
mixture I like to use something to pour

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.720 
mixture I like to use something to pour
with<00:03:51.970> with<00:03:52.150> a<00:03:52.180> narrow<00:03:53.250> spout<00:03:54.250> that<00:03:54.549> way<00:03:54.669> you

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
with with a narrow spout that way you

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.030 
with with a narrow spout that way you
can<00:03:55.000> control<00:03:55.359> the<00:03:55.629> pour<00:03:55.900> much<00:03:56.379> better<00:03:57.989> ok<00:03:59.040> now

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
can control the pour much better ok now

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.349 
can control the pour much better ok now
I'm<00:04:00.250> going<00:04:00.370> to<00:04:00.459> add<00:04:00.579> the<00:04:00.730> remaining<00:04:01.180> half

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
I'm going to add the remaining half
