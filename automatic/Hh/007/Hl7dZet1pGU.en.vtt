well<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:14.880> he<00:00:15.690> pointed<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.199> out<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.460> had<00:00:17.640> to

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
well and he pointed it out and I had to

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.870 
well and he pointed it out and I had to
check<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.000> out<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.449> it's<00:00:18.750> actually<00:00:18.900> amazing

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
check it out and it's actually amazing

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.880 
check it out and it's actually amazing
so<00:00:20.880> basically<00:00:21.420> what<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.660> does<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.769> can

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
so basically what it does it you can

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.990 
so basically what it does it you can
change<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.460> some<00:00:23.880> system<00:00:24.420> apps<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:26.000> there's

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
change in some system apps and there's

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.390 
change in some system apps and there's
for<00:00:27.300> example<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.810> email<00:00:28.170> I'm<00:00:28.410> on<00:00:28.590> darkies

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
for example the email I'm on darkies

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.359 
for example the email I'm on darkies
10.1<00:00:30.060> by<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.510> way<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.900> email<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.980> default

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
10.1 by the way and email the default

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.520 
10.1 by the way and email the default
email<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.090> SGS<00:00:33.600> one<00:00:33.930> now<00:00:34.530> if<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.430> like<00:00:35.730> me

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
email is the SGS one now if you like me

if<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.739> like<00:00:37.950> me<00:00:38.100> if<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.760> are<00:00:39.750> similar<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.320> how

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
if you like me if you are similar to how

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.369 
if you like me if you are similar to how
i<00:00:40.710> think<00:00:41.160> as<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.730> SGS<00:00:42.120> tues<00:00:42.540> email<00:00:43.140> is

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
i think as in the SGS tues email is

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.650 
i think as in the SGS tues email is
better<00:00:43.670> although<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.820> icons<00:00:45.180> were<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.420> same

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
better although the icons were the same

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.560 
better although the icons were the same

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
this is the sgs2 s email when it loads

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.000 
this is the sgs2 s email when it loads
up<00:00:48.750> there<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:48.989> go<00:00:49.110> that's<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.320> SGS<00:00:49.739> tues

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.959 
glitchy knows to 420 force closes which
is<00:00:56.370> right<00:00:56.610> however<00:00:57.379> after<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.620> install<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:58.969> go

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
and then you will have any force closes

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.330 
and then you will have any force closes
on<00:01:20.759> them<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.450> take<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.470> as<00:01:22.619> well<00:01:22.770> forgot

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
so so yeah I don't find I find them the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.140 
so so yeah I don't find I find them the
sgs2<00:01:27.600> s1<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.350> really<00:01:28.920> good<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.280> hasn't<00:01:29.520> hardly

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
sgs2 s1 is really good it hasn't hardly

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.810 
sgs2 s1 is really good it hasn't hardly
any<00:01:30.270> battery<00:01:30.630> drain<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.110> really<00:01:31.320> fast<00:01:31.820> it's

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
any battery drain it's really fast it's

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.910 
any battery drain it's really fast it's
quite<00:01:33.150> responsive<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.560> know<00:01:34.650> it's<00:01:34.680> nice

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
quite responsive it's you know it's nice

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.030 
quite responsive it's you know it's nice
to<00:01:35.130> use<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.119> anyway<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> app

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
to use on I like it anyway so to the app

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.490 
to use on I like it anyway so to the app
and<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.420> also<00:01:39.570> useful<00:01:39.900> for<00:01:40.079> cleaning<00:01:40.439> up

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
and this is also useful for cleaning up

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.440 
and this is also useful for cleaning up
system<00:01:40.829> apps<00:01:41.009> like<00:01:41.220> an<00:01:41.369> idol<00:01:41.610> voice<00:01:42.150> search

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
system apps like an idol voice search

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.380 
system apps like an idol voice search
and<00:01:42.720> whatever<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.079> was<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.439> don't<00:01:43.799> need<00:01:44.130> them

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
and whatever it was I don't need them

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.850 
and whatever it was I don't need them
although<00:01:45.390> people<00:01:45.570> could<00:01:45.930> find<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.170> mutual<00:01:46.500> not

the CIT effect so bear that in mind so
the<00:02:02.310> secret<00:02:02.640> codes<00:02:02.909> as<00:02:03.060> well<00:02:03.210> very<00:02:03.509> useful<00:02:03.899> for

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
the secret codes as well very useful for

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.530 
the secret codes as well very useful for
switching<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.490> know<00:02:05.579> doing<00:02:05.939> things<00:02:06.060> but

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
switching to you know doing things but

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.330 
switching to you know doing things but
for<00:02:06.869> example<00:02:07.409> useful<00:02:07.710> when<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:07.860> find<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.310> a

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
for example useful when I find is a

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.860 
for example useful when I find is a
switch<00:02:09.149> 3g

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.110 

switch<00:02:16.870> 3<00:02:17.260> 3g<00:02:18.159> and<00:02:18.430> i<00:02:18.790> can<00:02:19.209> switch<00:02:19.450> off<00:02:20.010> hsdpa

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
switch 3 3g and i can switch off hsdpa

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.759 
switch 3 3g and i can switch off hsdpa
yeah<00:02:22.120> ignore<00:02:22.599> that<00:02:22.629> do<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.349> again<00:02:23.439> and<00:02:23.680> it

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
yeah ignore that do it again and it

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.069 
yeah ignore that do it again and it
works<00:02:23.950> there<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.430> go<00:02:24.549> you<00:02:25.420> do<00:02:25.569> that<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:25.959> know

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
works there you go you do that you know

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.929 
works there you go you do that you know
can<00:02:26.230> release<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.560> or<00:02:26.920> whatever<00:02:27.159> so<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.459> always

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
can release it or whatever so I always

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.119 
can release it or whatever so I always
press<00:02:28.269> release<00:02:28.599> because<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:29.470> saves<00:02:29.799> you<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.010> lot

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129
