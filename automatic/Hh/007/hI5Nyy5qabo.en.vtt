things<00:00:15.500> competition<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.890> about<00:00:17.279> robotics<00:00:18.240> and

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
things competition is about robotics and

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.410 
things competition is about robotics and
engineering<00:00:19.010> it's<00:00:20.010> really<00:00:20.340> about<00:00:20.580> making<00:00:20.880> a

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
engineering it's really about making a

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.359 
engineering it's really about making a
difference<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.080> road<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:23.160> me

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
difference in the road and to me

over it why is this also important it's

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.700 
over it why is this also important it's
people<00:01:13.479> like<00:01:13.660> you<00:01:13.720> who<00:01:13.990> are<00:01:14.290> going<00:01:14.320> to<00:01:14.530> make

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
people like you who are going to make

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.910 
people like you who are going to make
this<00:01:14.920> future<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.990> you're<00:01:17.110> not<00:01:17.229> only<00:01:17.440> going<00:01:17.740> to

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
this future and you're not only going to

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.520 
this future and you're not only going to
need<00:01:17.950> math<00:01:18.340> and<00:01:18.580> science<00:01:18.970> to<00:01:19.180> do<00:01:19.300> it<00:01:19.530> you're

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
need math and science to do it you're

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.109 
need math and science to do it you're
going<00:01:20.710> to<00:01:20.800> have<00:01:20.920> to<00:01:21.160> learn<00:01:21.340> how<00:01:21.400> to<00:01:21.610> work<00:01:21.940> as

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
going to have to learn how to work as

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.710 
going to have to learn how to work as
teams<00:01:22.930> I<00:01:23.460> think<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.520> goal<00:01:24.700> really<00:01:25.030> is<00:01:25.180> to<00:01:25.300> work

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
teams I think the goal really is to work

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.540 
teams I think the goal really is to work
as<00:01:25.840> a<00:01:25.899> team<00:01:25.990> I<00:01:26.560> think<00:01:27.220> that's<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.430> most

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
as a team I think that's the most

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.850 
as a team I think that's the most
important<00:01:27.970> part<00:01:28.000> we<00:01:28.720> kind<00:01:29.290> of<00:01:29.410> had<00:01:29.590> some

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
important part we kind of had some

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.100 
important part we kind of had some
problems<00:01:30.310> at<00:01:30.580> first<00:01:31.030> figuring<00:01:31.450> out<00:01:31.660> like<00:01:31.869> how

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
problems at first figuring out like how

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.930 
problems at first figuring out like how
the<00:01:32.170> team<00:01:32.470> was<00:01:32.619> going<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:32.830> work<00:01:32.979> how<00:01:33.580> people

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
the team was going to work how people

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.820 
the team was going to work how people
are<00:01:34.000> going<00:01:34.119> to<00:01:34.210> decide<00:01:34.540> with<00:01:34.869> like<00:01:35.110> what<00:01:35.410> who's

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
are going to decide with like what who's

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.410 
are going to decide with like what who's
doing<00:01:36.220> was<00:01:36.430> like<00:01:36.729> how<00:01:36.910> are<00:01:36.940> we<00:01:37.149> going<00:01:37.300> to

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
doing was like how are we going to

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.480 
doing was like how are we going to
decide<00:01:37.600> things<00:01:38.020> as<00:01:38.290> a<00:01:38.320> team<00:01:38.590> they<00:01:39.100> just<00:01:39.340> have

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
decide things as a team they just have

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.090 
decide things as a team they just have
to<00:01:39.520> be<00:01:39.610> patients<00:01:40.450> to<00:01:40.750> care<00:01:41.050> point<00:01:41.470> and<00:01:41.740> if

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
to be patients to care point and if

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.190 
to be patients to care point and if
their<00:01:42.490> point<00:01:42.729> is<00:01:42.820> better<00:01:43.000> than<00:01:43.149> yours<00:01:43.420> and<00:01:43.690> you

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
their point is better than yours and you

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.690 
their point is better than yours and you
just<00:01:44.440> admit<00:01:44.860> it<00:01:44.890> you<00:01:45.070> don't<00:01:45.250> keep<00:01:45.399> a<00:01:45.430> big

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.920 

it's<00:02:57.770> hard<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.340> control<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.150> robot<00:02:59.300> sometimes

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
it's hard to control the robot sometimes

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
you know you did everything right and

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.030 
you know you did everything right and

but it just went you might just your

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.970 
but it just went you might just your
robot<00:03:14.570> might<00:03:14.750> for<00:03:15.110> some<00:03:15.260> reason<00:03:15.560> just<00:03:15.740> miss

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
robot might for some reason just miss

something or you might miss calculate
somehow<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.800> biggest<00:03:19.160> problem<00:03:19.400> we're<00:03:19.520> having

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
somehow the biggest problem we're having

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.160 
somehow the biggest problem we're having
is<00:03:19.880> to<00:03:20.120> follow<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:20.450> line<00:03:20.720> with<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.020> light

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
is to follow the line with the light

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.000 
is to follow the line with the light
sensor<00:03:22.150> it's<00:03:23.150> just<00:03:23.510> acts<00:03:23.690> up<00:03:23.959> randomly<00:03:24.380> and<00:03:24.680> we

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
sensor it's just acts up randomly and we

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.740 
sensor it's just acts up randomly and we
have<00:03:25.160> to<00:03:25.280> do<00:03:25.400> stuff<00:03:25.610> to<00:03:25.790> fix<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.150> right<00:03:26.690> now

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
have to do stuff to fix that right now

have to do stuff to fix that right now
we're<00:03:27.080> having<00:03:27.170> little<00:03:27.610> problems<00:03:28.610> with<00:03:28.850> the

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
we're having little problems with the

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.840 
we're having little problems with the
motion<00:03:29.510> sensor<00:03:29.870> we<00:03:30.800> found<00:03:31.040> out<00:03:31.250> that<00:03:31.310> the

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
motion sensor we found out that the

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.580 
motion sensor we found out that the
loops<00:03:32.060> are<00:03:32.270> facing<00:03:32.660> a<00:03:32.720> different<00:03:33.080> way<00:03:33.140> than<00:03:33.440> we

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
loops are facing a different way than we

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.280 
loops are facing a different way than we
had<00:03:33.800> them<00:03:33.980> at<00:03:34.130> home<00:03:34.340> so<00:03:34.640> we<00:03:35.300> kind<00:03:35.540> of<00:03:35.600> we<00:03:35.959> become

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
had them at home so we kind of we become

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.320 
had them at home so we kind of we become
grand<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.590> robot<00:03:36.890> to<00:03:36.920> pick<00:03:37.280> up<00:03:37.430> lips<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.209> it's

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
grand the robot to pick up lips and it's

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.390 
grand the robot to pick up lips and it's
facing<00:03:38.720> a<00:03:38.780> different<00:03:39.140> way<00:03:39.260> it's<00:03:40.010> not<00:03:40.340> going

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
facing a different way it's not going

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.520 
facing a different way it's not going

it's a nice way to get into backing
science<00:06:00.009> won't<00:06:00.879> you<00:06:01.090> turn<00:06:01.330> on<00:06:01.509> the<00:06:01.539> robot<00:06:01.900> and

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
science won't you turn on the robot and

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.110 
science won't you turn on the robot and
you<00:06:02.169> see<00:06:02.379> it<00:06:02.499> actually<00:06:02.650> did<00:06:03.099> something<00:06:03.340> it's<00:06:03.789> a

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
you see it actually did something it's a

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.149 
you see it actually did something it's a
big<00:06:04.300> sense<00:06:04.569> of<00:06:04.689> accomplishment<00:06:04.960> I<00:06:05.529> really

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:06.159 
big sense of accomplishment I really

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:09.029 
big sense of accomplishment I really
like<00:06:06.639> finding<00:06:07.180> out<00:06:07.270> what<00:06:07.479> we<00:06:07.629> need<00:06:07.659> and<00:06:08.110> how<00:06:08.979> to

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 
like finding out what we need and how to

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.429 
like finding out what we need and how to
get<00:06:09.340> there<00:06:09.580> it's<00:06:10.449> definitely<00:06:10.629> a<00:06:10.870> lot<00:06:11.020> of<00:06:11.199> fun

00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:11.439

to<00:06:12.129> create<00:06:12.550> things<00:06:12.939> and<00:06:13.419> build<00:06:13.569> things<00:06:13.870> I

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:14.349 
to create things and build things I

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:16.709 
to create things and build things I
think<00:06:14.919> you<00:06:15.069> have<00:06:15.219> to<00:06:15.370> really<00:06:15.520> be<00:06:15.909> logical<00:06:16.689> and

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:16.719 
think you have to really be logical and

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:18.989 
think you have to really be logical and
solve<00:06:17.020> problems<00:06:17.219> in<00:06:18.219> the<00:06:18.340> chance<00:06:18.610> to<00:06:18.819> actually

00:06:18.989 --> 00:06:18.999 
solve problems in the chance to actually
