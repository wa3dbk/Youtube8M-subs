00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.280
 they want me to teach them I thought about 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.420
 do one of knows month in which 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.430
 you are going to ask me many questions 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.159
 and then I'm going to answer them here in a 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.080
 video so they know me much better 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.850
 I really am super excited this 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.540
 valeria's family has to grow a 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.070
 heap and wei now yes to continue today 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.290
 I'm going to teach you how to make a design in 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.330
 a super nice super original and super 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.580
 simple for nails 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.390
 the imac green with the design as a 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.580
 leopard 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.800
 If I can do it, it 's a lot 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.350
 you can do it better then I hope 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.310
 that they like and good continue seeing the 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.680
 video in what we came we're going 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.200
 good to start we need novas the 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.540
 enamel an enamel that has a color 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.620
 as super powerful in my case I chose a 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.380
 fluorescent fuchsia a black enamel 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.840
 a clear blotting or polish 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.729
 some punch or in my case I also 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.620
 Take a stick that they get it in 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.810
 any place 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.479
 and we really do not need anything else we're going to 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:06.390
 begin first let's apply a 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.390
 base coat on all nails 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:16.050
 and then we are going to apply the powerful color 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.780
 in three of the fingers I'm going to do it in 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.730
 the ring finger and on the index finger 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.040
 then those two nails are going to stay 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.650
 unpainted for now let's paint the 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.130
 tiny finger to the middle finger and the finger 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.970
 thumb with the powerful enamel that in my 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.970
 case i am fuchsia 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.540
 now in the two sounds that were without 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.939
 enamel let's apply a layer of a 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.269
 enamel that is like a light pink that 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:45.549
 be as nude color or yes that is not 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.530
 precisely transparent or that you go 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.280
 fairly according to the tone 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.280
 strong that you chose 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.950
 now we are going to spend a second layer of 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.950
 all the enamels 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.870
 Now we let it dry a little bit 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.329
 enamel and in the two ones that have the 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.879
 clear enamel let's make little spots 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.739
 it does not matter that they are perfect even 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.110
 the idea of this design is that the 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.599
 spots that super irregular ones more 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.129
 big smaller ones that do not have 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.489
 as a form that is not a circle 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:33.190
 Well, after we did it in the 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:36.880
 two fingers we are going to use this punch 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.560
 and we are going to draw around 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.560
 of the specks the idea is that they are 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.420
 like a good one can delineate some by 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.000
 complete so that it's kind of like 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.670
 oh but you can delineate others not 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.030
 completing the circle as you are seeing 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.030
 in the video 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.720
 now they are going to realize that they are 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.360
 some blanks then what 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.100
 What I'm going to do in this case is do 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.070
 other spots but already with enamel 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:10.870
 black a little bit smaller for 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.870
 go filling and dots 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.060
 after that I have the complete design in 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.830
 the two little fingers what I'm going to do is 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.170
 Wait until the 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.210
 nails because well we do not want to be 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.730
 Mix black in the outlined 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.350
 color fuchsia and pink clarito 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.900
 then let it dry a little 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.640
 to then spend a capita of glitters and 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.640
 sing during transparent 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.099
 and I guess they are wondering 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.629
 why I painted my thumb I'm going 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:47.030
 to tell a guy a secret that 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:49.009
 it really is super practical i the last 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.819
 What I paint are the two little fingers 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:54.620
 thumbs because it really optimizes the 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:56.360
 work that is not painted until 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.000
 the end because if they find out for 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.090
 clean up the excesses that remain in the 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.470
 other nails because I do it with this finger or 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.599
 because while we are painting 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.090
 then he hits the chubby finger with the 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:11.530
 hand against rock with the base on which 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.530
 we are putting our hands 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.490
 and ready girl will be so simple I 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.680
 I'm sure that when they go out 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.690
 they are going to ask you where I have litters of 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.250
 do the nails are going to say they have to 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.259
 follow the YouTube channel of hey 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.100
 valeria because there they will find the 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:28.840
 simple way to make them 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:33.540
