believe that some people call this a

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.770 
believe that some people call this a
braid<00:02:40.830> but<00:02:41.190> in<00:02:41.760> Australia<00:02:42.270> we<00:02:42.420> call<00:02:42.600> this<00:02:42.720> a

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:52.199 
braid but in Australia we call this a
plat

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
and then tie it with a hair tie the end

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.960

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
two other sections doesn't matter if

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.589 
two other sections doesn't matter if
some<00:03:04.160> of<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.370> plots<00:03:04.610> are<00:03:04.940> bigger<00:03:05.300> than<00:03:05.450> the

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
some of the plots are bigger than the

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:15.890 
some of the plots are bigger than the
other

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.870

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
so now I've got the three plots and I

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.580 
so now I've got the three plots and I
want<00:03:19.090> my<00:03:19.210> bun<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:19.630> be<00:03:19.780> really<00:03:20.170> messy<00:03:20.560> and

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
casual you of course could try make the

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.920 
casual you of course could try make the
plots<00:03:23.410> really<00:03:23.800> nice<00:03:23.980> and<00:03:24.430> neat<00:03:24.640> but<00:03:25.030> for<00:03:25.510> me<00:03:25.660> I

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
fingers to messy them make them messy

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.980 
fingers to messy them make them messy
and<00:03:36.370> fat<00:03:38.520> so<00:03:39.520> I<00:03:39.580> do<00:03:39.820> that<00:03:40.090> by<00:03:40.210> digging<00:03:40.510> my<00:03:40.750> nails

bun hasn't been covered so I've got
quite<00:05:07.450> a<00:05:07.510> lot<00:05:07.570> here<00:05:07.960> at<00:05:08.020> the<00:05:08.080> back<00:05:08.350> I'm<00:05:09.160> going

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
quite a lot here at the back I'm going

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.140 
quite a lot here at the back I'm going
to<00:05:10.169> try<00:05:11.169> and<00:05:11.380> make<00:05:11.530> this<00:05:11.740> piece<00:05:12.100> cover<00:05:12.880> this

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
to try and make this piece cover this

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.409 
to try and make this piece cover this
section<00:05:13.600> here<00:05:13.750> so<00:05:13.960> I'm<00:05:14.020> going<00:05:14.229> to<00:05:14.290> pin<00:05:14.650> it<00:05:15.419> into

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
section here so I'm going to pin it into

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.540 
section here so I'm going to pin it into
the<00:05:16.540> bun<00:05:16.720> so<00:05:17.050> this<00:05:17.229> bond<00:05:17.530> is<00:05:17.710> like<00:05:17.860> mesh<00:05:18.190> right

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
the bun so this bond is like mesh right

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.320 
the bun so this bond is like mesh right
can<00:05:18.850> you<00:05:18.940> see<00:05:19.150> this

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
can you see this

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.960 
can you see this
it's<00:05:19.990> like<00:05:20.169> mesh<00:05:20.470> so<00:05:20.710> I<00:05:20.740> can<00:05:20.979> stick<00:05:21.250> pins<00:05:21.550> in<00:05:21.820> it

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
it's like mesh so I can stick pins in it

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:45.200 
it's like mesh so I can stick pins in it
I'm<00:05:22.240> going<00:05:22.570> to<00:05:22.630> pin<00:05:23.020> it<00:05:23.050> along<00:05:23.770> this

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.030 

now<00:05:46.210> I<00:05:46.240> can<00:05:46.600> feel<00:05:46.960> on<00:05:47.260> the<00:05:47.500> top<00:05:47.740> here<00:05:48.010> that

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
now I can feel on the top here that

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.730 
now I can feel on the top here that
there's<00:05:48.370> some<00:05:48.640> exposed<00:05:49.090> mesh<00:05:49.570> so<00:05:50.350> I'm<00:05:50.440> going

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
there's some exposed mesh so I'm going

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.860 
there's some exposed mesh so I'm going
to<00:05:50.970> use<00:05:51.970> bobby<00:05:52.600> pins<00:05:52.960> again<00:05:53.230> to<00:05:53.920> hide<00:05:54.580> them<00:05:54.940> by

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
to use bobby pins again to hide them by

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.560 
to use bobby pins again to hide them by
just<00:05:56.140> sort<00:05:56.530> of<00:05:56.730> pinching<00:05:57.730> the<00:05:58.000> surrounding

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
just sort of pinching the surrounding

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:06.830 
just sort of pinching the surrounding
hair<00:05:58.810> and<00:05:59.140> pinning<00:05:59.530> that<00:05:59.650> together

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.380 

so<00:06:07.840> once<00:06:08.260> everything<00:06:08.800> is<00:06:09.280> in<00:06:09.670> the<00:06:09.910> barn<00:06:10.150> and

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:10.390 
so once everything is in the barn and

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:11.930 
so once everything is in the barn and
it's<00:06:10.540> sort<00:06:10.720> of<00:06:10.750> shaped<00:06:11.110> the<00:06:11.290> way<00:06:11.410> you<00:06:11.470> want<00:06:11.740> it

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
it's sort of shaped the way you want it

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.680 
it's sort of shaped the way you want it
spray<00:06:12.940> it<00:06:13.000> again<00:06:13.150> with<00:06:13.420> hairspray<00:06:15.330> at<00:06:16.330> the<00:06:16.540> end

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
spray it again with hairspray at the end

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.200 
spray it again with hairspray at the end
every<00:06:17.050> month<00:06:17.260> that's<00:06:17.560> some<00:06:17.890> how<00:06:18.760> the<00:06:18.820> messy

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
every month that's some how the messy

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.530 
every month that's some how the messy
bun<00:06:19.450> turns<00:06:19.780> out<00:06:20.310> used<00:06:21.310> with<00:06:21.580> braids<00:06:21.910> so<00:06:22.300> it's<00:06:22.480> a

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
bun turns out used with braids so it's a

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.290 
bun turns out used with braids so it's a
really<00:06:22.960> cool<00:06:23.200> technique<00:06:23.710> and<00:06:24.340> it's<00:06:25.000> really

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300

really cool technique and it's really
easy<00:06:25.600> to<00:06:25.870> do<00:06:26.050> and<00:06:26.380> as<00:06:26.650> I<00:06:26.920> said<00:06:27.190> if<00:06:27.340> you'd<00:06:27.520> be
