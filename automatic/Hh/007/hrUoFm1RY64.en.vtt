00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
to just focus on the floor because it

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.210 
to just focus on the floor because it
was<00:01:57.800> something<00:01:58.190> that<00:01:58.220> was<00:01:59.090> available<00:02:00.050> here<00:02:00.710> in

more based in like the bones you know
like<00:02:23.090> like<00:02:23.900> really<00:02:24.410> using<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.980> impulse<00:02:25.459> and

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
like like really using the impulse and

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.600 
like like really using the impulse and
the<00:02:25.700> momentum<00:02:26.530> so<00:02:27.530> when<00:02:27.709> we<00:02:27.860> are<00:02:28.040> doing<00:02:28.370> the

and<00:02:59.420> physical<00:02:59.870> principles<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:01.459> I<00:03:01.610> found<00:03:01.940> that

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
and physical principles and I found that

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.039 
and physical principles and I found that
there<00:03:02.780> were<00:03:03.100> the<00:03:04.100> basis<00:03:04.610> really<00:03:05.510> established

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
there were the basis really established

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.380 
there were the basis really established
in<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.410> floor<00:03:06.620> world<00:03:06.890> I<00:03:07.160> was<00:03:07.640> questioning<00:03:08.180> how

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
in the floor world I was questioning how

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.449 
in the floor world I was questioning how
can<00:03:08.690> I<00:03:08.810> go<00:03:09.019> from<00:03:09.290> one<00:03:09.500> side<00:03:09.769> to<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:10.040> other

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
can I go from one side to the other

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.229 
can I go from one side to the other
AHA<00:03:11.269> so<00:03:12.079> if<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:12.709> go<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:13.190> here<00:03:13.820> and<00:03:13.910> you<00:03:14.000> want<00:03:14.150> to

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
AHA so if you go to here and you want to

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.199 
AHA so if you go to here and you want to
go<00:03:14.390> to<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.720> other<00:03:14.810> side<00:03:15.079> if<00:03:15.380> you<00:03:15.530> just<00:03:15.769> curve

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
go to the other side if you just curve

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.030 
go to the other side if you just curve
you<00:03:17.209> can<00:03:17.420> move<00:03:17.600> it<00:03:17.959> will<00:03:18.140> require<00:03:18.440> much<00:03:19.010> more

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
you can move it will require much more

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.199 
you can move it will require much more
time<00:03:19.610> but<00:03:20.239> it's<00:03:20.959> more<00:03:21.200> soft<00:03:21.530> for<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:21.890> body<00:03:22.209> and

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
time but it's more soft for the body and

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.250 
time but it's more soft for the body and
also<00:03:23.420> we<00:03:23.690> work<00:03:23.870> in<00:03:24.110> FRA<00:03:24.320> dimension

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
also we work in FRA dimension

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:34.729 
also we work in FRA dimension
I<00:03:25.819> don't<00:03:26.819> actually<00:03:27.480> hate<00:03:28.640> working<00:03:32.180> I<00:03:33.379> work<00:03:34.379> in

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
I don't actually hate working I work in

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.339 
I don't actually hate working I work in
circles<00:03:35.340> almost<00:03:35.849> all<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.269> time<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:36.870> bath

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
circles almost all the time and bath

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.140 
circles almost all the time and bath
them<00:03:37.890> tend<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.700> think<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:41.280> route<00:03:41.519> so<00:03:41.760> you're

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
them tend to think the route so you're

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.880 
them tend to think the route so you're
going<00:03:42.480> into<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.870> wrong<00:03:43.140> direction<00:03:43.319> and<00:03:43.709> you

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
going into the wrong direction and you

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.220 
going into the wrong direction and you
return<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.610> other<00:03:44.760> side<00:03:45.090> having<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:46.019> same

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
return to the other side having the same

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.300 
return to the other side having the same
plane<00:03:46.530> so<00:03:46.830> it's<00:03:47.519> like<00:03:47.930> planes<00:03:48.930> that<00:03:49.140> are

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
plane so it's like planes that are

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.509 
plane so it's like planes that are
linear

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
linear

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.789 
linear
I<00:03:50.550> mean<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.849> just<00:03:50.880> bend<00:03:51.360> them<00:03:51.569> when<00:03:52.170> I<00:03:52.200> start<00:03:52.680> on

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
I mean to just bend them when I start on

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.369 
I mean to just bend them when I start on
exercises<00:03:53.519> okay<00:03:53.819> this<00:03:54.000> is<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.299> path<00:03:54.510> but<00:03:55.230> I'm

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
exercises okay this is the path but I'm

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.490 
exercises okay this is the path but I'm
not<00:03:55.590> gonna<00:03:55.830> say<00:03:56.069> how<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.340> solve<00:03:57.000> it

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
not gonna say how to solve it

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.289 
not gonna say how to solve it
sometimes<00:03:58.500> they<00:03:58.650> how<00:03:59.099> many<00:03:59.340> said<00:03:59.610> I<00:04:00.000> don't

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
sometimes they how many said I don't

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.960 
sometimes they how many said I don't
know<00:04:00.599> I<00:04:00.900> figured<00:04:01.470> out<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:02.069> interesting<00:04:02.489> part

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
know I figured out the interesting part

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.569 
know I figured out the interesting part
of<00:04:03.090> this<00:04:03.510> technique<00:04:04.260> is<00:04:04.500> that<00:04:04.560> that<00:04:05.220> you<00:04:05.370> need

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
of this technique is that that you need

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:12.900 
of this technique is that that you need
to<00:04:05.730> figure<00:04:05.970> out<00:04:06.209> how<00:04:06.510> how<00:04:07.200> is<00:04:07.410> your<00:04:07.560> body

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.930 

we<00:04:13.420> can<00:04:13.690> transfer

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
we can transfer

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:43.750 
we can transfer
the<00:04:16.299> body

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.280 

have<00:04:44.760> learned<00:04:45.060> so<00:04:45.270> many<00:04:45.390> things<00:04:45.510> from<00:04:45.840> the

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
have learned so many things from the

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.280 
have learned so many things from the
students<00:04:46.680> all<00:04:47.460> the<00:04:47.760> time<00:04:47.970> and<00:04:48.290> especially

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
students all the time and especially

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.460 
students all the time and especially
when<00:04:49.920> I<00:04:49.950> don't<00:04:50.340> give<00:04:50.580> them<00:04:50.790> too<00:04:51.780> much<00:04:51.930> I<00:04:52.230> wish

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
when I don't give them too much I wish

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
when I don't give them too much I wish
if<00:04:52.860> I<00:04:53.040> keep<00:04:54.030> information<00:04:54.680> too

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
if I keep information too

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.720 
if I keep information too
they<00:04:57.639> can<00:04:57.849> really<00:04:58.180> work<00:04:58.389> with
