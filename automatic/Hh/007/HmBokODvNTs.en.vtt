00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
let us keep it for this long now I

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.960

believe last year we were able to keep

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.960 
believe last year we were able to keep
until<00:01:24.270> January<00:01:24.960> 1st<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.520> year<00:01:26.790> they

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
until January 1st and this year they

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.609 
until January 1st and this year they
really<00:01:27.360> extend<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.869> 6<00:01:28.140> because<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
really extend to the 6 because of the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.289 
really extend to the 6 because of the
problems<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.159> we<00:01:29.460> had<00:01:29.670> with<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.030> DDoS

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299
