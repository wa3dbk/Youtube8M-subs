00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.360
 turn this off now good I am mister of 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.700
 wish and today I am here bringing a 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.099
 little trick so to speak of 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.760
 some way to earn fast money 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.370
 my talking tom 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.570
 Y 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:29.410
 and nothing but for you to see it here I have 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.330
 dreams we buy the potion 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.870
 and I want his daughter isa Now 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.940
 money that I have with 23 true 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.940
 the little trick is simply 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.570
 play a type of game that is the one that 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.630
 more money of age that is web that is the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:50.230
 connect 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.230
 because you will see dale I want you to see 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.710
 up here where is the little symbol of 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.620
 the currency I want you to see how it goes 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.390
 growing because it's the way I say 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.620
 it's just that the game that most 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.190
 money is and nothing I want to see I want that 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.700
 you see let's take a couple of games 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.770
 I already tell you throwing just one game already 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.920
 reward the reward for having 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.780
 spent the money to buy the potion 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.540
 for example all these levels that are 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.399
 super simple this can be done uve 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.830
 this can be done while for example 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.330
 while I speak that are two things 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.250
 at the same time and this already becomes very 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.300
 complicated then 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.970
 for you to see is it is so simple either in 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.590
 one moment you recover the 50 coins that 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.219
 have you spent 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.409
 with the potion and from there and to all 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:46.990
 they are profits so once you 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.960
 example you die you play again 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.310
 again and you earn more money because as 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.950
 I already said the levels are very 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.110
 simple and basically the trick 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.760
 is in 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.320
 you earn money you get as far as you can 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.780
 you die and you start again the third 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.740
 if you get tired and your cat gets tired 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.660
 you give it a position that I already tell you if 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.899
 little you play, you're going to get pretty 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.899
 agility 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.739
 and I go for 42 coins and just like 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:22.120
 you see the levels are super simple 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.120
 I do in a moment while I speak 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.670
 if as you can see, the money is already there 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.340
 recovered now 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.800
 we continue and now from here and 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.680
 all are profits because the 50 in the 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.880
 50 coins of the 50 coins of the 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:47.070
 potion you have already recovered then 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.070
 as I said all are profits 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.400
 well, nothing the game the truth is that it is 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:00.300
 very simple once based on playing 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.660
 you just get pretty agile 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.580
 pretty mental agility and now 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.770
 and now as you see the phone something is going 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.330
 slow ro simply because of the fact 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.390
 be recording while I play with 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.640
 others with other things does not happen to me but 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.630
 with the my my talking tom clinton method 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.569
 by fifth sometimes if not technical wrong 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:24.350
 pass 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:28.040
 so if it happens then it happens but let's go 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.690
 do not go with this one here there are times that 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.020
 It gives me to join colors that are not 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.020
 same 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:40.020
 to see this voice around here be here 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.870
 up here the 87 87 coins so 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.850
 cojÃ¡is skill when you are going to go 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.590
 100 in 100 in each game 5 games 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.590
 That in 500 coins fuck 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.290
 if you play other games you know what is 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.660
 quite complicated to get money 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.290
 because the truth is that it is a little 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.989
 bitch 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.250
 you see we would be jacob to 100 coins and 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.250
 we have not taken anything then 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.240
 do not 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.240
 there 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:33.270
 and nothing is that it's just that 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.270
 well you already know how to read 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.800
 you 've seen how fast it 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.530
 get money here 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.289
 and here I could continue I do not know if you see there 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:48.479
 up the record what 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:48.479
 he has his own to several deaths like that 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.580
 good as you see I have my record already 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:58.500
 marked I do not know why the screen goes 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.500
 so bad time that you clean it to see yes 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:07.210
 maybe why 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.210
 it seems like it's going good 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:17.080
 this is the fucking this is the one that can 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:17.080
 catch because this is not 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.500
 this is the high level 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:34.520
 I do not know how it is I do not know how this is 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:37.370
 doing so you can not say it like that 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.539
 I do not know how he's doing good from 128 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:44.930
 coins at a time my record is in 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:47.539
 998 points here are the 8 300 so 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.419
 imagine you think I was 300 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:52.069
 it involves coins air blow and so that 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:53.750
 see how this trick does work 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:55.740
 because you look if you are tired because 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.680
 buy it 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.220
 she is 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:03.289
 potion and again so no 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:07.039
 so that you see for example we have won 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:09.380
 128 coins I do not think it's in the 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:12.789
 terror of cakes have counted 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.789
 we get up 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:19.310
 I have a record of 55 but do not have 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.080
 coins for each floor what happens 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.820
 in that for each level everything in 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.790
 modern here you have to go in 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.790
 common that finding then 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:39.180
 that is, fuck this to me an egg happens to me 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:41.809
 only two coins is that I do not know 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.809
 Like very much 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.880
 and it is that in the others it is all similar 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:49.830
 the one from the python they give you a coin for 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.830
 each tube you pass 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.940
 fuck is that 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:58.790
 a coin come that you give if 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.830
 you do that many times because you get yes 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:03.569
 but it happens that you get tired before and with 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:06.240
 the game this connects not 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:07.740
 and good as you see simply canais 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.159
 money when you're tired buy the 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.470
 position in a game recover it and 

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:16.910
 It is done 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:20.170
 so nothing I say goodbye and you know 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.170
 a very strong kiss 

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:25.479
 a very strong kiss for them and them 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.479
 give them goodbye
