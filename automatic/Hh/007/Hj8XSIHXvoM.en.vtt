00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:09.660
 Hello I am today 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.480
 PC for editing to obtain 4 type video It purchased this actually still open 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.910
 Though not 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.920
 a 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:20.120
 It is intended that the good of xt in a place called Dos para 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:25.370
 The fourth place company 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:27.480
 It is management system of 5820 between 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.240
 6 Aday 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:36.540
 3.3 It is ghz 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:39.870
 I wonder if the good is more of 970 I is the emergency 160 of geforce Those who graphics 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.070
 That even if though I thought 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:47.410
 Use and say 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:50.180
 I heard that there is a possibility that the woman's brain will fall down 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.570
 If it were stable 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.230
 It is as it is that 960 is better 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.910
 960 I will 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.560
 Motherboard is eh 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:04.660
 It is x99 zip 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:10.930
 Wally has 16 gb 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.930
 xt 2-It's the same spec, saying that almost nothing is messed up 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:18.040
 Actually a little while ago this 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:24.030
 I bought a macbook pro 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:26.659
 Because it is that it is a net painful to do system 4 softly in any way softly 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.229
 It is now more Mac 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:36.020
 It is the stage has taken today of the now status quo 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:38.730
 That i ãƒ¼ I do not have a view can be selected in bulk 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.909
 The graphics card is much better 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.700
 Fu called wonder if there is only buy a mac pro rather than those made of good 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:51.090
 To determine 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.780
 There are also scientific exchanges and it is from now on that when there is no other performance 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.140
 Also referred to 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:00.750
 If you're a waiter, replace the graphic board 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.070
 First, to say the windows in order Well I vertical in can cope with such a thing 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.170
 so 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.170
 It has been opened today by me 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.220
 In a 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.500
 In the case of this PC 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:34.710
 There are two fans here and here 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.790
 I think you can basically do well behind 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.989
 Here is a row of relationship data 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.989
 I'm knitting now 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:49.010
 There is also a part of AmiAmi in the back here 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.800
 I do not have a moment 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.130
 It is interesting 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.130
 Poop 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.230
 If there is a clothes do you think it part of Ami Ami of Oh Miami 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.980
 There are two fans towards Kenjo 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.310
 Good luck behind you 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.310
 Is it 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.300
 This is actually the content 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:27.360
 here 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.360
 Here is a graphic board for traffic 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.850
 CPU 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.450
 Mother to big child 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.680
 The heat sink is going come x 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.440
 That's right 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:44.460
 It looks like this is because there are quite a few rattles open , so there are still more to expand 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.460
 I can afford it 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.320
 Well Mimori Nde softly two mentioned are 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.320
 I memory equivalent 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.270
 You can still get it 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.300
 But I would like to actually use it 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.069
 When the hard disk is connected, it is already here 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.180
 You should do the part 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.180
 I have one but 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:21.470
 Actually edit and comment on 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.470
 I think that youtube is like to write in the comments book 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:34.280
 Most if you do 4 machines 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:37.050
 Well, it's cpu specs coming up so cpu is still cpu then 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.820
 Then the graphic board 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.180
 a 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:45.710
 Because the speed of the entire sugar content is also related 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.190
 I thought it would be better for ssd, but if it starts, he has almost nothing to do 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.520
 That's right 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.520
 Because 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:59.350
 It would be better to have a cup of coffee and go it down 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:08.160
 Pillars who are busy think that it is better to ssd and get up quickly 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:08.160
 It doesn't matter so much about whether to put ssd in such a form or 4 edits itself 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:20.750
 That 's right, it's just a rise, so I 'll come up with measures that made the rise of the soft start up 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:24.370
 If you want to make it faster even east, put os and editing software in ssd 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:27.240
 The rest is spec 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:33.630
 It is that how much of those dolphins 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:41.810
 There is a guy who does only about 600,000 but I think it is not necessary to get there 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:43.900
 I Kurikuri Kurikuri two hours moving a lot of 60 frames of that four systems in the I individual basis 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.840
 The person who does 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:50.720
 Already 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:52.010
 I can not think about that more than over spec 600,000 get 1 million or so PC 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.840
 Even though I think that 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:57.080
 Ordinary person probably I bought 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.400
 xe 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:04.680
 say good for t new 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:09.660
 Doing well so I think because First in it's enough but often I leave about 200,000 yen 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:11.360
 Who was you were useless try 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.729
 Yes, I 'm down there 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:19.669
 Just that 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:22.330
 If the window is about once that half a year 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.330
 Hey 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:31.139
 cpu is 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:34.290
 It will go up, so look at the timing at that time and compare the current situation with the PC now 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:35.670
 I think that it is better to think of Tteyuu I wish or not to finally 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:42.330
 Already 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:44.440
 Of 1 million yen for now the best specs Well Once was a year or Kobe at the same price Investment Authority of Frey 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:48.040
 I think I will be 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:53.020
 So first of all try using it once 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:56.200
 I wonder if is better to then thought suppress Well in 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:07:00.190
 I also do this but this 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:03.150
 Buy a Video Editing Computer 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:10.409
 I bought a 4 type video camera 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:14.900
 As there is 4 type correspondence , there is no day when we buy time and let's go for taking a photo 

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:18.680
 The worst is Aso travel expenses have seen the pot issue 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:22.070
 If you put on a performance while thinking about that 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.129
 I think it's good, I recommend Dospara 

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.529
 Already 

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:30.720
 I agree 

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:33.870
 And after the parlor of a sound opportunity to return nearly 10 years it has been indebted to the Mac 

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:38.210
 Please take a walk by all means 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:43.240
 Well if you think that it is good with such a feeling 

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:45.040
 In addition I I I use it using this 

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:50.620
 In what felt 

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:53.340
 I think that you look at will since they are already doing it if can be edited Japan type of sound videos 

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.340
 Thank you very much
