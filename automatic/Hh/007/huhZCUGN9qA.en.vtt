next<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.179> quality<00:00:15.630> level<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.170> we<00:00:16.410> go<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.590> write

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
next is quality level and we go to write

your<00:00:16.890> see<00:00:16.980> this<00:00:17.130> test<00:00:17.400> for<00:00:17.789> settings<00:00:18.150> 3<00:00:18.359> star<00:00:18.600> 2

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
your see this test for settings 3 star 2

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.859 
your see this test for settings 3 star 2
star<00:00:18.990> 1<00:00:19.770> star<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.220> raw<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:21.000> this<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.600> again

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
star 1 star and raw and this is again

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.349 
star 1 star and raw and this is again
the<00:00:22.140> compression<00:00:22.830> level<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.850> picture<00:00:24.210> and

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
the compression level of the picture and

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.689 
the compression level of the picture and
that<00:00:24.449> really<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.740> size<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.519> file

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
that really is the size of the file

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.189 
that really is the size of the file
versus<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.180> quality<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:27.750> if<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.900> know<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
versus the quality so if you know the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.679 
versus the quality so if you know the
camera<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.740> put<00:00:29.400> more<00:00:29.550> cashews<00:00:29.789> on<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.480> same

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
camera to put more cashews on the same

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.810 
camera to put more cashews on the same
card<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.230> go<00:00:31.410> down<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.800> less<00:00:32.070> star<00:00:32.369> quality

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
card you go down to a less star quality

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.180 
card you go down to a less star quality
the<00:00:33.450> difference<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.110> very<00:00:34.170> very<00:00:34.530> subtle<00:00:34.950> it's

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
the difference is very very subtle it's

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.440 
the difference is very very subtle it's
going<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.370> compress<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.880> image<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.180> little<00:00:36.329> bit

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
going to compress the image a little bit

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.920 
going to compress the image a little bit
more<00:00:36.690> into<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.260> JPEG<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.370> if<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.879> have<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> nice

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
more into the JPEG so if you have a nice

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.690 
more into the JPEG so if you have a nice
large<00:00:40.170> card<00:00:40.530> I'd<00:00:40.680> say<00:00:40.800> shoot<00:00:41.040> with<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> 3<00:00:41.430> star

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
large card I'd say shoot with the 3 star

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.310 
large card I'd say shoot with the 3 star
falling<00:00:42.300> again<00:00:42.719> because<00:00:43.020> that's<00:00:43.230> gonna

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
falling again because that's gonna

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.950 
falling again because that's gonna
result<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.680> very<00:00:43.950> high<00:00:44.190> picture<00:00:44.670> quality<00:00:45.120> it

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
result in very high picture quality it

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.080 
result in very high picture quality it
will<00:00:46.079> result<00:00:46.350> less<00:00:46.620> images<00:00:47.070> but<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.910> tell

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
will result less images but I can tell

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.010 
will result less images but I can tell
you<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.329> one<00:00:48.510> day<00:00:48.570> when<00:00:48.809> you're<00:00:48.899> out<00:00:48.989> there

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
you that one day when you're out there

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.750 
you that one day when you're out there
shooting<00:00:49.379> you'll<00:00:49.649> either<00:00:49.800> our<00:00:50.219> shows<00:00:50.489> about

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
shooting you'll either our shows about

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.790 
shooting you'll either our shows about
your<00:00:50.969> issue<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.449> best<00:00:51.690> imaging<00:00:52.260> ever<00:00:52.469> shot

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
your issue the best imaging ever shot

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.709 
your issue the best imaging ever shot
and<00:00:53.039> you're<00:00:53.789> going<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.940> really<00:00:54.239> worship<00:00:54.420> that

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
and you're going to really worship that

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.450 
and you're going to really worship that
was<00:00:54.840> taken<00:00:55.230> at<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.530> best<00:00:55.770> quality<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
was taken at the best quality that the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.790 
was taken at the best quality that the
camera<00:00:56.699> can<00:00:56.879> produce<00:00:57.050> of<00:00:58.050> course<00:00:58.289> there's<00:00:58.530> raw

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
camera can produce of course there's raw

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.410 
camera can produce of course there's raw
again<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.520> what<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.820> call<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.090> digital

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
again that is what I call the digital

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.729 
again that is what I call the digital
negative<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.960> records<00:01:01.320> all<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.590> the

post process in special programs but

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.160

having an additional negative allows you

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.620 
having an additional negative allows you
