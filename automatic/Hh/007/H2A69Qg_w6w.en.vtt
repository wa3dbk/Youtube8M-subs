00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.919
 Mediterranean gastronomy is considered 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.020
 one of the healthiest in the world is 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.539
 very varied although it contains 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.340
 pretty simple recipes like the 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.350
 next there will be chef christian 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.169
 rivera because it will present us well 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.580
 we are bringing shrimp with the 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:20.839
 expert board 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.160
 and it's interesting because this agency 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:23.300
 is ready for one of the activities 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.810
 here of the schools 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.050
 as if it were a snack a child 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.880
 phenomenal 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.980
 I'm sure that I'm here 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.440
 sure that yes I have here I have 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.670
 marinating almost 45 minutes to one 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.990
 extra virgin olive oil paprika 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.650
 the year of a little cilantro because 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:45.140
 I like coriander salt and pepper 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.730
 black I do not know everything he has though 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.220
 that what we're going to do is we're going to 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.260
 cook this shrimp inside your own 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.489
 oil 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.489
 therefore the pan does not carry 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.489
 add them 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:06.800
 important interest 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:09.230
 we are working with the mental 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.180
 too much fire to go to 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.130
 carry yes so we're going to do it to 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.680
 medium fire all the time medium 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.290
 low 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.960
 so that to be aware of the shrimp for 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.950
 not about cooking and oil not 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.780
 we are going to put have been or go well 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.300
 Well, well, although I thought that 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.450
 I simply should not use it I should not 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.550
 expose to heat if it can be 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.130
 but at a good temperature and for a 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.050
 Short period of short film of all 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.000
 ways the shrimp are in the field 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.200
 kind that they are already even putting 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.880
 rositas and so that already gives us the vital 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.890
 emphasis really that we are almost to 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.130
 halfway there now I'm going to 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.330
 add a little wine white wine 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.970
 that I already did that I can put a 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.759
 little fire to come was given 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:03.660
 Alcohol will be distributed Aja 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.660
 evaporate the alcohol and the lime and then 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.210
 one 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.510
 quite important 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.440
 little bit more than fresh cilantro that can 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.160
 be 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.630
 it can be this like any other 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.350
 fresh grass the thickness that we have in 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.910
 the house and if the test rich I think that 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.310
 I think that's what distinguishes 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.260
 from shrimp to garlic Puerto Rico 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.660
 true because we are making a plate 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.150
 inspired by Mediterranean cuisine and 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.180
 this is a spice paulo to me 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.100
 love it I use it a lot in the house is 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.830
 a spice that you get basically 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.110
 of a variety of red peppers that 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.840
 it is easy to dry them after they are ground 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.760
 that's why it's also called paprika 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.050
 attention to this species 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.220
 querétaro that I am doing now you 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.540
 add a little cold butter 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.820
 interesting because we are walking 6-3 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.260
 butter like it's going on 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.940
 against all the principles that we have 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
 been mentioning through everything 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.540
 these programs 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.160
 and the point is that in terms of 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.070
 nutrition and fats 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.569
 but in urinary aspects what that 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:23.480
 matter is doing is unifying 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:23.480
 the rest of the dish of consistency 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:30.629
 look, you know what it is that you just 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.489
 mention reminds me and this we had 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:35.010
 said in another in another program but I think 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.769
 that it is important to reiterate the long 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.120
 time shrimp or shrimp have 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.280
 had it loaded with a bad 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.739
 reputation or an undeserved prejudice 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.200
 I would say in terms of its content 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.590
 fat and calories is not that high 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.739
 it really is not that high your level of 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.409
 cholesterol can be between intermediate a 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.079
 little elevated is but it is very healthy or 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:01.889
 be that if in short if we put in a 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:05.370
 balance the nutritive benefits versus 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:07.919
 is to that cholesterol cut 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.689
 really this one is open is fine 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:11.579
 reasonable of course that person 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.980
 have high cholesterol what 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.569
 I should avoid but out of there I do not know 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.370
 worry thinking they are eating 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.229
 something very fat and many 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.479
 calories because it's not health and consumption 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.250
 regular we do it 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.889
 we have the problem every day of 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.840
 week 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.840
 so as you want 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:36.330
 antioxidant we are also going to assemble 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.260
 our plate and I have to go the salad 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.260
 pretty marinated 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:47.900
 that this can accompany with 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:49.689
 pampita with seals fans and that seems to me 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.679
 very weird 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:52.679
 of course 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:01.090
 here we have a refreshing dish 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:03.669
 relatively light at times there are days 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:07.360
 we do not want we are not for food 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:09.020
 very heavy so this is ideal for 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.840
 those days 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.520
 I pick up this same wine with the juice of 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:19.360
 lemon 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:23.800
 the lime juice we have it very well 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.300
 He smells exquisite he cited exquisite but 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.620
 this presentation is so beautiful I 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.509
 I want you to enjoy it, not the 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.949
 I will damage putting the spoon as such 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:31.750
 you hit me something besides that is a bit 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:33.639
 warm the shrimp what yes I 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.090
 it seems this important to emphasize 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.710
 cristian again this is pure nutrition 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.650
 this is pure notation is all the 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.349
 alphabet of vitamin gold of minerals 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.430
 and also if we were to take it to 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:50.530
 digestive properties terms 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.870
 antioxidants to bone antibiotics 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.029
 themselves and if we think that what we eat 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.979
 can definitely cure us 

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:58.539
 brain this is an exact dish that what 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:01.029
 represents not only the kitchen 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:03.759
 Mediterranean but also in that sense 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:05.289
 Well, another success of the chef christian 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:08.080
 rivero our account 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:10.090
 and the good as we said it is a plate 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.159
 refreshing and livianito is that then 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.240
 there will be no charge of conscience with the 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:15.430
 dessert 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.289
 of course you know that 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.050
 always has to be here in itself to the 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:23.470
 kitchen on return from this break the 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:28.620
 hernandez méndez is not going to be a pole on 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.620
 healthy and saffron and do not miss it
