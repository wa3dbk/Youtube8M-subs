00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
on the rockets and then we'll start the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.310 
on the rockets and then we'll start the
rockets

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.060 

start<00:00:36.070> slow

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.960 

now

now
the<00:00:41.480> over<00:00:41.720> never<00:00:41.960> built<00:00:42.350> a<00:00:43.090> rocket<00:00:44.090> ship<00:00:44.450> ride

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
the over never built a rocket ship ride

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.220 
the over never built a rocket ship ride
so<00:00:45.380> this<00:00:45.590> is<00:00:45.770> unique<00:00:46.310> I<00:00:46.670> thought<00:00:47.570> I<00:00:47.600> would<00:00:47.960> show

ten then I will slap the ride as you

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.300 
ten then I will slap the ride as you
know<00:01:22.990> when<00:01:23.140> we<00:01:23.259> were<00:01:23.380> kids<00:01:23.619> it<00:01:23.799> always<00:01:23.950> seemed

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
know when we were kids it always seemed

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.039 
know when we were kids it always seemed
like<00:01:24.340> we<00:01:24.670> never<00:01:24.880> got<00:01:25.060> enough<00:01:25.359> time<00:01:25.630> to<00:01:25.869> ride

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
like we never got enough time to ride

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.389 
like we never got enough time to ride
this<00:01:27.689> as<00:01:28.689> they<00:01:28.899> slow<00:01:29.320> down<00:01:29.350> approaching<00:01:30.219> the

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
this as they slow down approaching the

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:41.920 
this as they slow down approaching the
launch<00:01:30.640> ramp

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.530 

okay<00:01:42.470> then<00:01:42.680> one<00:01:42.890> stop<00:01:43.240> apart<00:01:44.240> from<00:01:44.390> the

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
okay then one stop apart from the

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.190 
okay then one stop apart from the
Rockets<00:01:45.130> you<00:01:46.130> get<00:01:46.280> onto<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.670> elevator<00:01:47.200> and

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
Rockets you get onto the elevator and

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.770 
Rockets you get onto the elevator and
just<00:01:48.640> move<00:01:49.640> this<00:01:49.790> a<00:01:49.850> little<00:01:49.970> bit<00:01:50.300> so<00:01:50.480> you<00:01:50.540> get<00:01:50.720> a

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
just move this a little bit so you get a

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.050 
just move this a little bit so you get a
little<00:01:50.990> better<00:01:51.110> view<00:01:51.260> of<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.650> elevator<00:01:55.060> then

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
little better view of the elevator then

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.410 
little better view of the elevator then
they<00:01:56.450> go<00:01:59.170> and<00:02:00.170> off<00:02:00.950> they<00:02:01.190> go

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
they go and off they go

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.390 
they go and off they go
thus<00:02:03.100> shows<00:02:04.100> on<00:02:04.460> a<00:02:04.490> rocket<00:02:04.940> ship<00:02:04.970> ride
