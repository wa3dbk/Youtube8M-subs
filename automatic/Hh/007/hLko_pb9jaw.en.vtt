00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
unfortunately he does also fall into

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.920 
unfortunately he does also fall into
that<00:01:52.560> hole<00:01:52.829> ap<00:01:53.700> tops<00:01:54.030> currently<00:01:54.450> aren't<00:01:54.750> in

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
that hole ap tops currently aren't in

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.560 
that hole ap tops currently aren't in
the<00:01:55.110> strongest<00:01:55.710> place<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.280> game<00:01:56.460> which<00:01:57.390> is

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
the strongest place in the game which is

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.300 
the strongest place in the game which is
slightly<00:01:57.810> true<00:01:58.229> but<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.710> actually<00:01:58.860> think<00:01:59.040> he

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
slightly true but I actually think he

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.219 
slightly true but I actually think he
has<00:01:59.490> decent<00:01:59.759> damage<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.420> from<00:02:00.659> look<00:02:01.020> like

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
has decent damage and from look like

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.719 
has decent damage and from look like
levels<00:02:01.740> 6<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.540> 12<00:02:03.540> he<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:03.930> very<00:02:04.320> very<00:02:04.740> strong<00:02:05.340> so

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
levels 6 to 12 he is very very strong so

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.370 
levels 6 to 12 he is very very strong so
if<00:02:06.149> you're<00:02:06.240> looking<00:02:06.360> for<00:02:06.540> any<00:02:06.869> mid<00:02:07.170> game

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.479 
know what's changed recently but all the
RAM<00:02:25.140> says<00:02:25.409> I've<00:02:25.590> seen<00:02:25.860> lately<00:02:26.069> have<00:02:26.340> done

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
RAM says I've seen lately have done

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:27.830 
RAM says I've seen lately have done
extremely<00:02:27.000> well<00:02:27.209> I<00:02:27.360> don't<00:02:27.510> know<00:02:27.599> if<00:02:27.689> there's

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
extremely well I don't know if there's

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.660 
extremely well I don't know if there's
been<00:02:27.989> changes<00:02:28.439> just<00:02:28.980> overall<00:02:29.400> in<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.549> game

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
been changes just overall in the game

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.949 
been changes just overall in the game
that<00:02:29.819> have<00:02:29.909> helped<00:02:30.150> him<00:02:30.239> out<00:02:30.420> but<00:02:30.659> he<00:02:30.720> just

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
that have helped him out but he just

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.330 
that have helped him out but he just
seems<00:02:31.140> even<00:02:31.379> tankier<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:31.859> still<00:02:32.040> putting<00:02:32.280> out

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
seems even tankier and still putting out

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.160 
seems even tankier and still putting out
decent<00:02:32.700> amount<00:02:32.879> of<00:02:32.909> damage<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.840> case<00:02:34.019> you

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
decent amount of damage the case you

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.929 
decent amount of damage the case you
don't<00:02:34.379> know<00:02:34.439> he<00:02:35.099> does<00:02:35.280> do<00:02:35.400> more<00:02:35.579> damage<00:02:35.730> than

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:35.939 
don't know he does do more damage than

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.580 
don't know he does do more damage than
people<00:02:36.239> think<00:02:36.569> he<00:02:36.780> does<00:02:36.989> instead<00:02:37.409> of<00:02:37.500> just

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
people think he does instead of just

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.740 
people think he does instead of just
being<00:02:37.739> an<00:02:38.010> extreme<00:02:38.459> tank<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:39.480> other<00:02:39.599> reason

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
being an extreme tank the other reason

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.539 
being an extreme tank the other reason
is<00:02:39.989> he<00:02:40.200> takes<00:02:40.379> so<00:02:40.590> long<00:02:40.799> he<00:02:41.040> usually<00:02:41.159> can<00:02:41.430> get

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
is he takes so long he usually can get

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.130 
is he takes so long he usually can get
full<00:02:41.790> damage<00:02:42.090> out<00:02:42.299> because<00:02:42.659> he's<00:02:42.840> just<00:02:43.019> not

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
full damage out because he's just not

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.869 
full damage out because he's just not
dead<00:02:43.500> so<00:02:44.099> that's<00:02:44.220> another<00:02:44.430> reason<00:02:44.640> his

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
dead so that's another reason his

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.129 
dead so that's another reason his
ultimate<00:02:45.180> does<00:02:45.329> do<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.480> decent<00:02:45.659> amount<00:02:45.840> damage

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
ultimate does do a decent amount damage

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:47.509 
ultimate does do a decent amount damage
too<00:02:46.290> so<00:02:46.409> if<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:46.530> do<00:02:46.620> pick<00:02:46.799> up<00:02:46.889> a<00:02:46.980> one<00:02:47.159> ability

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
too so if you do pick up a one ability

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.190 
too so if you do pick up a one ability
power<00:02:47.639> item<00:02:47.970> on<00:02:48.060> him<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:48.690> ultimate<00:02:49.079> does

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
power item on him that ultimate does

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.020 
power item on him that ultimate does
start<00:02:49.409> to<00:02:49.440> tear<00:02:49.650> through<00:02:49.799> people<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:50.370> rammus

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
start to tear through people so rammus

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.339 
start to tear through people so rammus
is<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.180> good<00:02:51.359> jungler<00:02:51.569> guide<00:02:51.930> good<00:02:52.109> clear

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
is a good jungler guide good clear

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.379 
is a good jungler guide good clear
doesn't<00:02:52.799> really<00:02:52.920> die<00:02:53.069> too<00:02:53.129> much<00:02:53.430> gets<00:02:54.239> around

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
doesn't really die too much gets around

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:55.789 
doesn't really die too much gets around
the<00:02:54.480> map<00:02:54.599> pretty<00:02:54.810> quick<00:02:54.989> too<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:55.379> mobility

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
the map pretty quick too so mobility

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.259 
the map pretty quick too so mobility
