treat animals with their own stem cells

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:58.670 
treat animals with their own stem cells
is<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.940> all<00:00:57.120> animals<00:00:57.659> are<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:58.050> dogs<00:00:58.230> because

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
hear about research in stem cell therapy

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.880 
hear about research in stem cell therapy
we've<00:01:42.180> actually<00:01:42.420> done<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.930> now<00:01:43.079> commercially

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
again using an animal's own stem cells

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.590 
again using an animal's own stem cells
not<00:01:46.530> embryonic<00:01:47.100> stem<00:01:47.310> cells<00:01:47.579> not<00:01:48.060> stem<00:01:48.359> cells

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
not embryonic stem cells not stem cells

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.700 
not embryonic stem cells not stem cells
from<00:01:48.659> embryos<00:01:49.140> which<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.500> all<00:01:49.619> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
from embryos which is all the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.499 
from embryos which is all the
controversy<00:01:50.369> but<00:01:50.729> actually<00:01:51.090> treating<00:01:51.420> an

controversy but actually treating an

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.480 
controversy but actually treating an

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
animal with their own stem cells and

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.340 
animal with their own stem cells and
these<00:01:53.549> stem<00:01:53.759> cells<00:01:53.789> come<00:01:54.180> from<00:01:54.210> fat<00:01:54.509> now<00:01:55.109> can

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
these stem cells come from fat now can

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.529 
these stem cells come from fat now can
you<00:01:55.380> describe<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.280> stem<00:01:56.579> cell<00:01:56.820> process<00:01:57.299> for

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
you describe the stem cell process for

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.060 
you describe the stem cell process for
me<00:01:57.659> how<00:01:57.780> does<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.079> work<00:01:58.289> exactly<00:01:58.439> how<00:01:58.859> do<00:01:58.920> you

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
me how does that work exactly how do you

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.490 
me how does that work exactly how do you
guys<00:01:59.250> do<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.640> yeah<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.969> way<00:02:00.119> we<00:02:00.359> do<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.600> back<00:02:01.469> in

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
guys do it yeah the way we do it back in

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.950 
guys do it yeah the way we do it back in
in<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.250> late<00:02:02.429> 90s<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.179> group<00:02:03.420> at<00:02:03.570> University<00:02:03.929> of

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
in the late 90s a group at University of

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.959 
in the late 90s a group at University of
Pittsburgh<00:02:04.380> discovered<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.369> these<00:02:05.640> stem

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
Pittsburgh discovered that these stem

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.969 
Pittsburgh discovered that these stem
cells<00:02:06.000> were<00:02:06.450> very<00:02:06.810> high<00:02:06.990> concentration<00:02:07.799> in

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
cells were very high concentration in

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.700 
cells were very high concentration in
fact<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:09.030> adipose<00:02:09.450> tissue<00:02:09.660> which<00:02:09.810> we<00:02:10.380> all<00:02:10.530> have

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
fact of adipose tissue which we all have

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.380 
fact of adipose tissue which we all have
our<00:02:10.979> animals<00:02:11.550> all<00:02:11.670> have<00:02:11.880> so<00:02:12.060> there's<00:02:12.240> a<00:02:12.300> nice

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
our animals all have so there's a nice

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.960 
our animals all have so there's a nice
reservoir<00:02:13.020> of<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.410> so<00:02:13.860> they<00:02:14.460> discovered

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
reservoir of it and so they discovered

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.610 
reservoir of it and so they discovered
that<00:02:15.000> these<00:02:15.270> stem<00:02:15.600> cells<00:02:15.630> were<00:02:16.080> in<00:02:16.230> there<00:02:16.440> and

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
that these stem cells were in there and

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.050 
that these stem cells were in there and
they<00:02:16.860> could<00:02:17.040> take<00:02:17.220> these<00:02:17.370> stem<00:02:17.610> cells<00:02:17.640> and

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
they could take these stem cells and

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.450 
they could take these stem cells and
turn<00:02:18.270> them<00:02:18.360> into<00:02:18.510> bone<00:02:19.020> or<00:02:19.530> cartilage<00:02:19.590> or

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
turn them into bone or cartilage or

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.460 
turn them into bone or cartilage or
heart<00:02:20.970> tissue<00:02:21.210> so<00:02:21.810> they<00:02:21.960> look<00:02:22.170> like<00:02:22.290> they<00:02:22.440> were

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
heart tissue so they look like they were

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.310 
heart tissue so they look like they were
highly<00:02:22.920> valuable<00:02:23.340> for<00:02:23.970> use<00:02:24.150> we<00:02:24.750> took<00:02:24.930> that

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
highly valuable for use we took that

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.960 
highly valuable for use we took that
learning<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.190> we<00:02:26.280> sort<00:02:26.459> of<00:02:26.519> stood<00:02:26.700> on<00:02:26.760> their

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
learning so we sort of stood on their

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.570 
learning so we sort of stood on their
shoulders<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.599> said<00:02:27.780> well

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
shoulders and said well

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.250 
shoulders and said well
may-maybe<00:02:29.330> we<00:02:29.450> could<00:02:29.720> actually<00:02:29.870> do<00:02:30.140> this

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
may-maybe we could actually do this

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.710 
may-maybe we could actually do this
consciously<00:02:30.560> so<00:02:31.310> if<00:02:31.610> you<00:02:31.790> for<00:02:32.060> example<00:02:32.090> had<00:02:32.690> a

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
consciously so if you for example had a

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.200 
consciously so if you for example had a
dog<00:02:32.960> or<00:02:33.200> horse<00:02:34.100> and<00:02:34.430> it<00:02:34.550> had<00:02:34.670> an<00:02:34.760> orthopedic

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
dog or horse and it had an orthopedic

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.080 
dog or horse and it had an orthopedic
injury<00:02:35.570> had<00:02:36.020> arthritis<00:02:36.470> had<00:02:37.190> a<00:02:37.220> tendon<00:02:37.700> injury

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
injury had arthritis had a tendon injury

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.540 
injury had arthritis had a tendon injury
your<00:02:38.750> veterinarian<00:02:39.470> after<00:02:40.160> getting

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
your veterinarian after getting

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.490 
your veterinarian after getting
instruction<00:02:41.180> from<00:02:41.270> us<00:02:41.480> would<00:02:42.110> collect<00:02:42.410> a

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
instruction from us would collect a

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.950 
instruction from us would collect a
small<00:02:42.740> sample<00:02:43.100> of<00:02:43.130> fat<00:02:43.310> literally<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.270> couple

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
small sample of fat literally a couple

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.140 
small sample of fat literally a couple
of<00:02:45.200> tablespoons<00:02:45.530> of<00:02:45.920> fact<00:02:46.130> just<00:02:46.790> from<00:02:47.000> under

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
of tablespoons of fact just from under

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.150 
of tablespoons of fact just from under
the<00:02:47.270> skin<00:02:47.480> very<00:02:47.840> simple<00:02:48.260> in<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.500> horses<00:02:48.890> just

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
the skin very simple in the horses just

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.620 
the skin very simple in the horses just
hits<00:02:49.400> on<00:02:49.490> a<00:02:49.550> weight<00:02:49.730> procedure<00:02:50.150> not<00:02:50.390> even

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
hits on a weight procedure not even

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.240 
hits on a weight procedure not even
under<00:02:50.780> anesthesia<00:02:51.170> notice<00:02:51.710> the<00:02:51.770> large<00:02:51.980> feel

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
under anesthesia notice the large feel

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.550 
under anesthesia notice the large feel
that<00:02:52.520> there's<00:02:53.270> my<00:02:53.570> takane<00:02:53.900> put<00:02:54.110> around<00:02:54.290> just

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
that there's my takane put around just

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.990 
that there's my takane put around just
like<00:02:54.650> when<00:02:54.830> you<00:02:54.860> would<00:02:55.070> get<00:02:55.220> l<00:02:55.490> kept<00:02:55.670> dental

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
like when you would get l kept dental

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.700 
like when you would get l kept dental
you<00:02:56.210> know<00:02:56.330> so<00:02:56.510> it's<00:02:56.540> numb<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.170> so<00:02:57.440> they<00:02:57.560> really

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
you know so it's numb and so they really

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.290 
you know so it's numb and so they really
don't<00:02:57.920> feel<00:02:58.100> that<00:02:58.370> we<00:02:58.820> put<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.120> a<00:02:59.150> little

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
don't feel that we put it a little

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.000 
don't feel that we put it a little
sterile<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.840> your<00:03:00.110> veterinarian<00:03:00.320> would<00:03:00.830> then

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
sterile to your veterinarian would then

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.190 
sterile to your veterinarian would then

so that's how it works so now what are

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.890 
so that's how it works so now what are
your<00:03:31.250> results<00:03:31.400> so<00:03:31.820> far<00:03:31.850> today<00:03:32.209> and<00:03:32.360> kind<00:03:32.870> of

your results so far today and kind of
from<00:03:33.050> a<00:03:33.080> business<00:03:33.380> perspective<00:03:33.709> how<00:03:34.370> are<00:03:34.459> you

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
from a business perspective how are you

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.330 
from a business perspective how are you
guys<00:03:34.730> doing<00:03:35.030> yeah<00:03:35.570> so<00:03:35.870> we<00:03:36.380> are<00:03:36.530> growing<00:03:36.830> by

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
guys doing yeah so we are growing by

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.830 
guys doing yeah so we are growing by
leaps<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.760> bounds<00:03:37.850> we're<00:03:38.360> going<00:03:38.480> to<00:03:38.540> triple

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
leaps and bounds we're going to triple

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.350 
leaps and bounds we're going to triple
again<00:03:39.230> this<00:03:39.410> year<00:03:39.470> in<00:03:39.830> terms<00:03:40.070> of<00:03:40.190> size<00:03:40.400> whereas

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
again this year in terms of size whereas

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.729 
again this year in terms of size whereas
you'll<00:03:41.510> see<00:03:41.660> walking<00:03:42.019> on<00:03:42.170> our<00:03:42.290> laboratory

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
you'll see walking on our laboratory

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.740 
you'll see walking on our laboratory
here<00:03:42.980> we've<00:03:43.340> got<00:03:43.519> about<00:03:43.640> 8,000<00:03:44.300> square<00:03:44.540> feet

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
here we've got about 8,000 square feet

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.380 
here we've got about 8,000 square feet
of<00:03:44.989> laboratory<00:03:45.739> office<00:03:46.100> space<00:03:46.340> or<00:03:46.670> sort<00:03:47.330> of

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
of laboratory office space or sort of

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.670 
of laboratory office space or sort of
busting<00:03:47.780> at<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:47.900> seams<00:03:48.019> and<00:03:48.380> we're<00:03:48.500> going<00:03:48.620> to

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
busting at the seams and we're going to

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.430 
busting at the seams and we're going to
have<00:03:48.800> to<00:03:48.920> expand<00:03:49.340> again<00:03:49.870> so<00:03:50.870> from<00:03:51.170> a<00:03:51.230> business

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
have to expand again so from a business

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.800 
have to expand again so from a business
standpoint<00:03:51.800> the<00:03:52.730> owners<00:03:53.150> and<00:03:53.720> the

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
standpoint the owners and the

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.140 
standpoint the owners and the
veterinarians<00:03:54.410> get<00:03:54.890> this<00:03:55.100> interesting<00:03:56.030> it

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
veterinarians get this interesting it

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.090 
veterinarians get this interesting it
and<00:03:56.300> once<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.630> dogs<00:03:56.810> or<00:03:57.140> you<00:03:57.320> know<00:03:57.440> horses<00:03:57.830> or

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
and once the dogs or you know horses or

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.740 
and once the dogs or you know horses or
animals<00:03:58.489> get<00:03:58.670> this<00:03:58.850> treatment<00:03:59.150> and<00:03:59.480> they<00:03:59.570> just

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
animals get this treatment and they just

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.330 
animals get this treatment and they just
bounce<00:04:00.050> right<00:04:00.230> back<00:04:00.380> it's<00:04:00.830> like<00:04:00.980> they're<00:04:01.130> ten

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
bounce right back it's like they're ten

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.890 
bounce right back it's like they're ten
years<00:04:01.489> younger<00:04:01.730> is<00:04:02.000> that<00:04:02.180> there<00:04:02.870> are

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
years younger is that there are

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.380 
years younger is that there are
certainly<00:04:03.410> some<00:04:03.470> that<00:04:04.130> it<00:04:04.310> really<00:04:04.790> is<00:04:05.060> almost

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
certainly some that it really is almost

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.850 
certainly some that it really is almost
managing<00:04:05.900> can<00:04:06.019> you<00:04:06.110> see<00:04:06.320> you<00:04:06.560> know<00:04:06.680> they

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
managing can you see you know they

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.440 
managing can you see you know they
really<00:04:07.220> come<00:04:07.489> back<00:04:07.519> quite<00:04:07.940> dramatically

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
really come back quite dramatically

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.050 
really come back quite dramatically
another<00:04:08.959> one's<00:04:09.230> not<00:04:09.440> so<00:04:09.650> dramatically<00:04:10.160> so<00:04:10.670> we

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
another one's not so dramatically so we

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.120 
another one's not so dramatically so we
want<00:04:11.239> people<00:04:11.420> understand<00:04:11.900> it<00:04:12.170> isn't<00:04:12.709> magic

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
want people understand it isn't magic

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.860 
want people understand it isn't magic
the<00:04:13.430> time<00:04:13.670> isn't<00:04:13.940> turned<00:04:14.300> back<00:04:14.510> where<00:04:14.780> they

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
the time isn't turned back where they

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.960 
the time isn't turned back where they
really<00:04:15.200> are<00:04:15.410> you<00:04:15.950> know<00:04:15.980> a<00:04:16.100> 15<00:04:16.519> year<00:04:16.669> old<00:04:16.790> dog

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
really are you know a 15 year old dog

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.880 
really are you know a 15 year old dog
doesn't<00:04:17.239> become<00:04:17.630> a<00:04:17.810> puppy<00:04:18.049> movie<00:04:18.500> they

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
doesn't become a puppy movie they

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.979 
doesn't become a puppy movie they
sometimes<00:04:19.130> act<00:04:19.640> like<00:04:19.850> that<00:04:20.150> but<00:04:20.510> they<00:04:20.750> really

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
sometimes act like that but they really

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.560 
sometimes act like that but they really
get<00:04:21.320> some<00:04:22.010> of<00:04:22.190> their<00:04:22.340> normal<00:04:22.550> daily<00:04:22.970> function

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
get some of their normal daily function

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.719 
get some of their normal daily function
back<00:04:23.780> or<00:04:24.080> ability<00:04:24.560> to<00:04:24.680> perform<00:04:25.040> the<00:04:25.280> case<00:04:25.490> of<00:04:25.640> a

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
back or ability to perform the case of a

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.610 
back or ability to perform the case of a
horse<00:04:25.940> stem<00:04:26.570> cells<00:04:26.870> are<00:04:27.050> kind<00:04:27.260> of<00:04:27.350> a<00:04:27.410> new<00:04:27.590> thing

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
horse stem cells are kind of a new thing

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.100 
horse stem cells are kind of a new thing
as<00:04:28.520> far<00:04:28.850> as<00:04:29.000> from<00:04:29.180> a<00:04:29.240> long-term<00:04:29.690> impact

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
as far as from a long-term impact

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.330 
as far as from a long-term impact
standpoint<00:04:30.680> what<00:04:30.830> do<00:04:30.919> you<00:04:31.010> think<00:04:31.220> that

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
standpoint what do you think that

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.010 
standpoint what do you think that
they're<00:04:31.490> going<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:31.640> have<00:04:31.850> on<00:04:32.150> animals<00:04:32.780> and

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
they're going to have on animals and

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.190 
they're going to have on animals and
humans<00:04:33.470> so<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.729> big<00:04:34.760> work<00:04:35.270> on<00:04:35.540> the<00:04:35.810> human<00:04:36.140> side

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
humans so the big work on the human side

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.230 
humans so the big work on the human side
of<00:04:36.380> the<00:04:36.650> equation<00:04:36.950> is<00:04:37.400> in<00:04:37.669> cardiovascular

they're very usable right now one of the
keys<00:05:04.110> to<00:05:04.140> these<00:05:04.620> cells<00:05:05.040> particularly<00:05:05.910> the<00:05:06.300> way

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
keys to these cells particularly the way

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.300 
keys to these cells particularly the way
we<00:05:06.570> do<00:05:06.720> it<00:05:06.870> it's<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:07.560> animals<00:05:07.890> own<00:05:08.010> cells

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
we do it it's the animals own cells

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.880 
we do it it's the animals own cells
there's<00:05:09.300> nothing<00:05:09.450> to<00:05:09.630> reject<00:05:10.110> there's<00:05:10.710> no

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
there's nothing to reject there's no

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.740 
there's nothing to reject there's no
foreign<00:05:11.460> material<00:05:11.940> in<00:05:12.090> there<00:05:12.240> all<00:05:12.450> we<00:05:12.600> do<00:05:12.720> is

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
foreign material in there all we do is

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.900 
foreign material in there all we do is
do<00:05:12.990> a<00:05:13.050> separation<00:05:13.740> and<00:05:13.980> give<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:14.520> animal<00:05:14.760> back

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
do a separation and give the animal back

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.290 
do a separation and give the animal back
their<00:05:15.150> own<00:05:15.270> cells<00:05:15.540> so<00:05:16.320> we<00:05:16.800> think<00:05:17.190> in<00:05:17.490> the<00:05:17.940> areas

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
their own cells so we think in the areas

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.420 
their own cells so we think in the areas
that<00:05:18.330> are<00:05:18.780> beyond<00:05:19.200> even<00:05:19.500> orthopedics<00:05:20.160> for

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
that are beyond even orthopedics for

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.770 
that are beyond even orthopedics for
example<00:05:20.730> right<00:05:20.850> now<00:05:20.880> we're<00:05:21.150> studying<00:05:21.480> liver

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
example right now we're studying liver

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.560 
example right now we're studying liver
disease<00:05:22.110> and<00:05:22.400> kidney<00:05:23.400> disease<00:05:23.880> if<00:05:24.360> you<00:05:24.450> have

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
disease and kidney disease if you have

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.410 
disease and kidney disease if you have
cats<00:05:24.870> many<00:05:25.680> old<00:05:25.950> cats<00:05:26.280> have<00:05:26.550> F<00:05:26.850> chronic<00:05:27.240> kidney

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:27.420 
cats many old cats have F chronic kidney

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.810 
cats many old cats have F chronic kidney
disease<00:05:27.540> for<00:05:28.050> their<00:05:28.170> kidneys<00:05:28.530> fail<00:05:28.770> we're<00:05:29.670> in

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
disease for their kidneys fail we're in

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.730 
disease for their kidneys fail we're in
early<00:05:30.180> studies<00:05:30.540> on<00:05:30.750> that<00:05:30.930> and<00:05:31.140> we<00:05:31.200> think<00:05:31.410> it's

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
early studies on that and we think it's

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.260 
early studies on that and we think it's
promising<00:05:32.220> that<00:05:32.640> we<00:05:32.760> can<00:05:32.910> do<00:05:33.030> something

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
promising that we can do something

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.390 
promising that we can do something
really<00:05:33.630> good<00:05:33.810> there<00:05:34.020> on<00:05:34.140> the<00:05:34.980> human<00:05:35.340> side

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
really good there on the human side

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.430 
really good there on the human side
there<00:05:36.000> are<00:05:36.030> these<00:05:36.270> studies<00:05:36.660> going<00:05:36.900> on<00:05:37.020> in<00:05:37.260> the

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
there are these studies going on in the

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.110 
there are these studies going on in the
u.s.<00:05:37.680> people<00:05:38.010> being<00:05:38.190> treated<00:05:38.400> right<00:05:38.520> now<00:05:38.850> in

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
u.s. people being treated right now in

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.540 
u.s. people being treated right now in
clinical<00:05:39.540> studies<00:05:39.870> and<00:05:40.320> around<00:05:40.920> the<00:05:41.040> world<00:05:41.070> so

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
clinical studies and around the world so

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.850 
clinical studies and around the world so
this<00:05:42.240> is<00:05:42.450> really<00:05:42.690> moving<00:05:43.170> ahead<00:05:43.470> quite

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
this is really moving ahead quite

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.130 
this is really moving ahead quite
rapidly<00:05:44.280> a<00:05:44.580> lot<00:05:44.820> of<00:05:44.940> money<00:05:44.970> being<00:05:45.360> spent<00:05:45.570> and<00:05:45.960> a

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
rapidly a lot of money being spent and a

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.100 
rapidly a lot of money being spent and a
lot<00:05:46.290> of<00:05:46.470> progress<00:05:46.950> being<00:05:47.370> made<00:05:47.490> so<00:05:48.180> I<00:05:48.660> would

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
lot of progress being made so I would

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.870 
lot of progress being made so I would
not<00:05:49.290> be<00:05:49.500> surprised<00:05:49.950> within<00:05:50.460> a<00:05:50.490> couple<00:05:50.730> of
