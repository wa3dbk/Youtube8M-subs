00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
and yet all of a sudden they're 4045 and

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.060 
and yet all of a sudden they're 4045 and
they're<00:00:57.870> thinking<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.230> they're<00:00:58.350> still<00:00:58.680> 20

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.560 
they're thinking that they're still 20
and<00:00:59.250> expecting<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.699> same<00:00:59.850> sort<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.180> standard

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
and expecting the same sort of standard

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.360 
and expecting the same sort of standard
is<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.050> not<00:01:01.199> because<00:01:01.350> men<00:01:01.739> are<00:01:01.770> insecure<00:01:02.100> they

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
is it not because men are insecure they

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.880 
is it not because men are insecure they
can't<00:01:02.550> handle<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.879> no<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> don't<00:01:03.600> think<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.589> what

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
can't handle it no I don't think so what

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.460 
can't handle it no I don't think so what
do<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.070> think<00:01:05.309> well<00:01:05.670> my<00:01:06.270> personal<00:01:06.869> opinion<00:01:07.320> is

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
do you think well my personal opinion is

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.950

I<00:01:07.680> love<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.340> strong<00:01:08.580> successful<00:01:08.909> woman<00:01:09.330> but

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
I love the strong successful woman but

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.260 
I love the strong successful woman but
I'm<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.200> glutton<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:10.590> punishment<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.970> think

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
I'm a glutton for punishment and I think

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.820 
I'm a glutton for punishment and I think
my<00:01:12.420> last<00:01:12.570> surely<00:01:13.049> played<00:01:13.260> out<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> balcony

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
my last surely played out on a balcony

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.179 
my last surely played out on a balcony
anyway<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:15.000> believe<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.830> women<00:01:17.100> who

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
anyway so I believe that the women who

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.480 
anyway so I believe that the women who
are<00:01:17.220> smart<00:01:17.640> successful<00:01:18.680> don't<00:01:19.680> happen<00:01:20.310> at<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
are smart successful don't happen at the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.810 
are smart successful don't happen at the
time<00:01:20.670> for<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:22.020> man<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.680> their<00:01:22.830> life<00:01:22.860> yeah<00:01:23.520> that's

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
time for a man in their life yeah that's

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.940 
time for a man in their life yeah that's
what<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.030> was<00:01:24.180> going<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.420> ask<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.439> lot

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
what I was going to ask is it that a lot

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.890 
what I was going to ask is it that a lot
of<00:01:25.979> these<00:01:26.220> girls<00:01:26.520> tend<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.240> be<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.630> independent

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
of these girls tend to be so independent

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.690 
of these girls tend to be so independent
they've<00:01:28.560> just<00:01:28.799> got<00:01:29.100> everything<00:01:29.549> they've<00:01:29.670> got

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
they've just got everything they've got

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.340 
they've just got everything they've got
their<00:01:29.970> car<00:01:30.150> they've<00:01:30.329> got<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.540> house<00:01:30.720> they've

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
their car they've got the house they've

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.080 
their car they've got the house they've
got<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> security<00:01:31.740> alarm<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.820> can

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
got the security alarm and so on I can

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.730 
got the security alarm and so on I can
do<00:01:33.360> everything<00:01:33.659> themselves<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:34.259> don't<00:01:34.320> think

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
do everything themselves I don't think

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.380 
do everything themselves I don't think
so<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.890> think<00:01:35.009> that's<00:01:35.430> their<00:01:35.640> security<00:01:36.060> blanket

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
so I think that's their security blanket

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.330 
so I think that's their security blanket
to<00:01:36.509> make<00:01:36.720> sure<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.200> if<00:01:37.320> they<00:01:37.470> are<00:01:37.950> seeing

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
to make sure that if they are seeing

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.440 
to make sure that if they are seeing
your<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.549> current<00:01:38.759> excuse<00:01:39.119> as<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.270> why

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
your the current excuse as to why

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.510 
your the current excuse as to why
they're<00:01:39.750> single<00:01:39.990> not<00:01:40.710> actually<00:01:41.130> they<00:01:41.280> always

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
they're single not actually they always

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.310 
right person at the right time I just
think<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.120> smart<00:03:20.390> successful<00:03:20.570> women<00:03:21.019> need<00:03:21.290> to

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
think the smart successful women need to

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.680 
think the smart successful women need to
find<00:03:21.950> reasons<00:03:22.430> why<00:03:22.730> they<00:03:22.940> should<00:03:23.239> be<00:03:23.360> going<00:03:23.540> on

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
find reasons why they should be going on

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.120 
find reasons why they should be going on
dates<00:03:23.750> while<00:03:24.110> they<00:03:24.230> can<00:03:24.590> meet<00:03:24.799> someone

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
dates while they can meet someone

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.500 
dates while they can meet someone
instead<00:03:25.489> of<00:03:25.610> having<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.910> excuses<00:03:26.360> while

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
instead of having the excuses while

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.060 
instead of having the excuses while
they're<00:03:26.720> not<00:03:26.930> and<00:03:27.320> I<00:03:27.680> think<00:03:27.709> it's<00:03:27.950> just

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
they're not and I think it's just

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.680 
they're not and I think it's just
changing<00:03:28.489> a<00:03:28.610> bit<00:03:28.760> of<00:03:28.850> a<00:03:28.910> mind<00:03:29.150> shift<00:03:29.390> and<00:03:29.630> if

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
changing a bit of a mind shift and if

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:30.940 
changing a bit of a mind shift and if
all<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.930> sudden<00:03:30.140> you've<00:03:30.230> got<00:03:30.260> a<00:03:30.590> lot<00:03:30.920> of

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
all the sudden you've got a lot of

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.350 
all the sudden you've got a lot of
reasons<00:03:31.250> why<00:03:31.310> you<00:03:31.400> can<00:03:31.790> meet<00:03:32.000> someone<00:03:32.239> and

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
reasons why you can meet someone and

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.270 
reasons why you can meet someone and
you're<00:03:32.480> open<00:03:32.840> to<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:33.049> prospect<00:03:33.680> of<00:03:33.980> meeting
