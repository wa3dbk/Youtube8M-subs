00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 to little fears took several days 

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.850
 quiet until yesterday afternoon 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.610
 when he registered a strong exhalation 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.490
 but after the exhalation something was recorded 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.480
 I do not know what it is I do not know how to explain it 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.799
 let's see them 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.969
 let's see it together a miner that falls in 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.969
 him in the crater 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.450
 this 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.730
 how 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.990
 there is this that falls in the big 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.420
 in front of it, it is not presented yesterday 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.990
 because we look for specialists that 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.480
 today they gave us these explanations look 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.910
 these are images captured by the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.860
 television camera located on the hill 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.980
 also money very close to the volcano 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.230
 popocatépetl according to specialists 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.570
 it's about an object of about one 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.120
 kilometer long by 200 meters of 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.550
 wide you can not appreciate where 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.210
 comes but with a speed greater than 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.130
 of an airplane 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.130
 it seems like it enters the crater 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.960
 so you see it up close is a body 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.640
 cylindrical, an excess of 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.290
 glitter on its front face and a shadow 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.399
 we went with the astronomer of the unam and 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.159
 member of the astronomical union 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.530
 international that has reviewed in detail 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.200
 the luminous objects seen in the area 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.530
 15 days ago and last April when the 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.409
 volcano recorded greater activity one thing 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.140
 interesting in all this is that it goes on 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.860
 drop 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.700
 would be even more spectacular if it were 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.970
 in your life when it 's something that is falling 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:43.240
 as there are more natural causes than 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.280
 when it goes up he ruled out 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.500
 incandescent material released by the 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.930
 volcano and returning in freefall 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.780
 because a path is not appreciated 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.159
 light drawn by the body in movement 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.479
 same situation that rules out the 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.940
 possibility of it being a meteorite 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.649
 catches the attention of astronomers 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.990
 certain characteristics of this object 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.270
 on the one hand that has a good line 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.970
 defined that the edges are bright 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.459
 and of different colors but above all 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.910
 that interaction with no discernable 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.610
 atmosphere or with the gases of the volcano 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:22.870
 imagine a one kilometer cylinder 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:26.500
 long and 200 meters wide to two 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:30.730
 streets wide and one kilometer long 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.220
 in an area where there is apart from the 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.140
 terrestrial atmosphere because they are all 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:40.480
 these gases exhalations and all hot 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.610
 you would expect an explosive phenomenon like 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.920
 more smoke gases a different light and 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.920
 sound nothing is seen or heard 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.830
 the specialist assured that even 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.210
 it may be a video defect 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:59.720
 that many of the pixels in the image 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:03.920
 are saturated then like a 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:09.560
 it was lightning or something like it looked like 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:12.050
 that is not part of the original video a 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.360
 single image for scientists said the 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.210
 Astronomer is not enough to do 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.750
 an assertion is a phenomenon 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:24.130
 interesting you have to be attentive but 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.910
 confirmation is needed and sara méndez 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.000
 television news 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.920
 but we saw it now in slow motion like this 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.730
 it's how our camera registered it 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.730
 is permanently 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.879
 that is in slow motion 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.879
 so he recorded it exactly like that 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:50.200
 well then it's the original record 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.810
 good the weekend we will look for 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.260
 more explanations with specialists 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.260
 While
