an in-breath for the time being and

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.639 
an in-breath for the time being and
we'll<00:02:00.479> do<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.750> out-breath<00:02:01.079> see<00:02:01.500> that

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
we'll do the out-breath see that

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.139 
we'll do the out-breath see that
movement<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.399> very<00:02:02.610> hard<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.909> do<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
movement it's very hard to do the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.429 
movement it's very hard to do the
breathing<00:02:03.329> because<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.750> movement<00:02:04.110> movements

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
breathing because the movement movements

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.170 
breathing because the movement movements
all<00:02:04.560> connecting<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.219> each<00:02:05.280> other<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
all connecting to each other so the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.730 
all connecting to each other so the
out-breath<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:06.659> actually<00:02:07.020> going<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.320> be<00:02:07.500> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
out-breath is actually going to be the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.859 
out-breath is actually going to be the
next<00:02:08.009> move<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.489> see<00:02:08.670> but<00:02:09.239> just<00:02:09.270> while<00:02:09.720> you're

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
next move you see but just while you're

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.210 
next move you see but just while you're
learning<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.349> course<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.739> can<00:02:10.890> go<00:02:11.009> in

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
learning it of course you can go in

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.370 
learning it of course you can go in
