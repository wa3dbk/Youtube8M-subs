00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.679 
honest review because he messed fury
around<00:01:57.999> but<00:01:58.999> i<00:01:59.209> think<00:01:59.509> david<00:01:59.719> haye<00:02:00.079> is<00:02:01.689> having

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
around but i think david haye is having

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.019 
around but i think david haye is having
trouble<00:02:02.929> letting<00:02:03.200> go<00:02:03.520> letting<00:02:04.520> go<00:02:04.789> of<00:02:04.819> the

00:02:05.019 --> 00:02:05.029 
trouble letting go letting go of the

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:06.989 
trouble letting go letting go of the
fact<00:02:05.270> that<00:02:05.389> he's<00:02:05.630> no<00:02:05.840> longer<00:02:05.869> britain's

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:06.999 
fact that he's no longer britain's

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:09.819 
fact that he's no longer britain's
premier<00:02:07.999> heavyweight<00:02:08.569> there<00:02:09.500> are<00:02:09.619> guys<00:02:09.799> who

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:09.829 
premier heavyweight there are guys who

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.800 
premier heavyweight there are guys who
have<00:02:10.189> overtaken<00:02:10.640> him<00:02:10.939> in<00:02:11.060> terms<00:02:11.299> of<00:02:11.480> the

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
have overtaken him in terms of the

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.360 
have overtaken him in terms of the
rankings<00:02:12.200> because<00:02:12.409> david<00:02:12.860> hayes<00:02:12.980> obviously

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
rankings because david hayes obviously

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.410 
rankings because david hayes obviously
not<00:02:13.519> ranked<00:02:13.849> with

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
not ranked with

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.290 
not ranked with
sanctioning<00:02:15.420> bodies<00:02:15.690> anymore<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.370> all<00:02:17.370> the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
sanctioning bodies anymore and all the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.839 
sanctioning bodies anymore and all the
guys<00:02:18.450> have<00:02:18.690> taken<00:02:19.050> over<00:02:19.140> from<00:02:19.440> him<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:19.860> I

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
guys have taken over from him and I

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.370 
guys have taken over from him and I
think<00:02:20.910> he's<00:02:21.180> having<00:02:21.330> trouble<00:02:21.660> coming<00:02:22.230> to

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
think he's having trouble coming to

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.620 
think he's having trouble coming to
terms<00:02:22.470> with<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:22.950> fact<00:02:23.099> he<00:02:24.090> keeps<00:02:24.300> on<00:02:24.450> talking

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
terms with that fact he keeps on talking

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.410 
terms with that fact he keeps on talking
about<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.110> comeback<00:02:25.770> but<00:02:26.640> nothing<00:02:27.300> ever

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
about a comeback but nothing ever

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.360 
about a comeback but nothing ever
materializes<00:02:28.200> he<00:02:28.950> may<00:02:29.130> have<00:02:29.220> been

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
materializes he may have been

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.750 
materializes he may have been
blacklisted<00:02:29.819> by<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:31.140> TV<00:02:31.500> companies<00:02:32.040> because
