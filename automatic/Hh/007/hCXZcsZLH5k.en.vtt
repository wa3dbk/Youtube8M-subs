compare<00:04:53.169> him<00:04:53.380> to<00:04:53.440> see<00:04:53.560> how<00:04:53.650> he<00:04:53.710> was<00:04:53.919> compared

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
compare him to see how he was compared

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.370 
compare him to see how he was compared
to<00:04:54.310> Jason<00:04:54.820> pierre-paul<00:04:55.230> comparing<00:04:56.230> them<00:04:56.320> to

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
to Jason pierre-paul comparing them to

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.370 
to Jason pierre-paul comparing them to
jpp<00:04:57.130> I<00:04:57.430> mean<00:04:58.000> jpp<00:04:58.450> is<00:04:58.510> kind<00:04:58.900> of<00:04:59.020> probably

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
jpp I mean jpp is kind of probably

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.550 
jpp I mean jpp is kind of probably
better<00:04:59.830> not<00:05:00.460> gonna<00:05:00.640> lie<00:05:00.850> I<00:05:01.150> mean<00:05:01.630> like<00:05:02.110> Jared

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
better not gonna lie I mean like Jared

Allen<00:05:02.680> school<00:05:03.010> and<00:05:03.130> all<00:05:03.250> but<00:05:03.490> jpp<00:05:04.120> is<00:05:04.330> probably

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
Allen school and all but jpp is probably

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.540 
Allen school and all but jpp is probably
better<00:05:05.320> just<00:05:05.710> telling<00:05:06.130> the<00:05:06.250> truth

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
better just telling the truth

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.520 
better just telling the truth
for<00:05:06.940> some<00:05:07.090> reason<00:05:07.330> jpp<00:05:07.720> he's<00:05:07.840> got<00:05:07.960> a<00:05:07.990> 94<00:05:08.320> yeah

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
he's got a 95 jump in for a reason jpp

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.050
