rectangles I found it much easier to

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.049 
rectangles I found it much easier to
stretch<00:00:56.750> rectangles<00:00:57.410> into<00:00:57.829> to<00:00:58.340> do<00:00:58.520> rounds<00:00:58.910> as

you can see it's so much easier to

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.600 
you can see it's so much easier to
stretch<00:01:01.840> just<00:01:02.840> yeah<00:01:03.530> why<00:01:03.800> holes<00:01:04.070> right<00:01:04.250> apart

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
stretch just yeah why holes right apart

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.100 
stretch just yeah why holes right apart
yeah<00:01:04.820> it's<00:01:05.119> very<00:01:05.390> easy<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:05.750> it's<00:01:05.899> much<00:01:06.050> easier

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110
