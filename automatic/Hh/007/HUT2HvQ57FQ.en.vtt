sludge<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.040> decided<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.610> go<00:02:17.700> for<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.880> curse

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
sludge so I decided to go for the curse

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.820 
sludge so I decided to go for the curse
here<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.570> knew<00:02:18.960> it<00:02:18.990> was<00:02:19.200> going<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.440> kill<00:02:19.650> me

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
here I knew it was going to kill me

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.410 
here I knew it was going to kill me
because<00:02:20.070> regardless<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.820> what<00:02:20.940> he<00:02:21.060> went<00:02:21.240> for

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
because regardless of what he went for

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.940 
because regardless of what he went for
it<00:02:21.480> would<00:02:21.570> have<00:02:21.660> done<00:02:21.750> enough<00:02:21.990> damage<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.740> kill

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
it would have done enough damage to kill

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.430 
it would have done enough damage to kill
me<00:02:23.100> after<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.610> curse<00:02:23.790> damage<00:02:24.240> but<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:25.020> wanted

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
me after the curse damage but I wanted

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.870 
me after the curse damage but I wanted
to<00:02:25.500> start<00:02:25.770> getting<00:02:25.920> residual<00:02:26.400> damage<00:02:26.490> on<00:02:26.760> this

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
to start getting residual damage on this

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.220 
to start getting residual damage on this
wheezing<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.300> really<00:02:27.570> I<00:02:27.600> just<00:02:27.720> wanted<00:02:28.110> to
