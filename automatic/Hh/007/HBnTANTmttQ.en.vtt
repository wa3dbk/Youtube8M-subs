00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 welcome and be chords you know 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.220
 where are you not in the mania aps where 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.750
 every monday wednesday and friday we do 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.670
 a selection of the best 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.679
 applications of the moment for 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.480
 mobile devices so guys already 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.710
 you know how to put yourself as two decades 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.710
 I like that we started 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.010
 many times we see ourselves in the obligation 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.590
 to have several applications almost by 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.510
 obligation not by imposition because 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.340
 we need twitter facebook to 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.900
 find out what's going on, no guys 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.390
 I'm going to recommend an application that is 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.340
 a multi a meta application is called 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.720
 my home string and the truth is that in 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.760
 she as you see here by way of 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.989
 mini-applications this we can also 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.120
 order to make different 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.620
 compositions in this way not and 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.150
 see here we can install a series 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.390
 of micro applications for example 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.190
 we can put an RSS feed to follow the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.110
 blog that we want we can put 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.239
 a calendar the music application 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.309
 notice that we can put the feed of 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.200
 facebook twitter or even the one 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.820
 instagram something that is quite useful 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.489
 because from here we could see from a 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.200
 look then hey all our feed of 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.180
 instagram or if we adjustments and 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.649
 We can choose for example our feed 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.210
 the popular photographs the 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:08.820
 photographs that are near us 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.710
 is an application one as I say a goal 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.690
 application to integrate all networks 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.580
 socially because they continue our 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.170
 pictures of the reel we will not see 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.729
 a little bit the possibilities to be fixed that 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.259
 We have all this more or less what 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.909
 you have seen above we can add 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.890
 youtube and much more guys a goal 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.810
 and maybe if you do not want so many 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.390
 applications that you can have everything in 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.189
 one can with you there are many 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.200
 applications of calendars and the certain 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.689
 is that the native application of ios already 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.270
 it works well but we have alternatives 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.369
 that give us a plus or good interface or 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.369
 good aesthetics or productivity 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.929
 is providing small doses of each 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.789
 of these boys fields is called peak 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.409
 calendar is an application with which 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.719
 we will be able to see the calendar 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.280
 our events making use there 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:52.299
 for the right we will be able to choose the 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.489
 calendars with which we want 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.469
 work to fix that I have good 

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:58.119
 all of these we can remove and put the 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.799
 calendars that we want and 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.360
 then the calendar works in a 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.069
 pretty curious way to see that 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.959
 we play and in this way they leave 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:07.149
 so good at the end 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.769
 the appointments in the events sorry that 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.079
 we have for appointments clear that 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.819
 we have at the end then in the 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:14.590
 calendar because you are not very well 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.569
 because we also click where 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.519
 we want in the day we want and from 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.739
 this cool way we are going to be able to 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.450
 put an hour for the event we are going to 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.670
 to be able to say it hey, look at the one 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.830
 this this 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.110
 that will last all day or will it last 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.819
 well I know that one hour two hours what 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.080
 you tell him you can not tell him 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.750
 when you want it is an alarm 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.310
 where the event is going to happen and good 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.080
 note that here we have all these 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.910
 typical calendar options at 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.069
 final not an application that really 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.750
 It looks very cool and it's free for 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.840
 limited time if you want to try it I think 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.730
 that is quite worth it guys but 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.890
 especially if you are fans of the mythical 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.750
 arkanoid I have to tell you that it arrives 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.910
 a very popular application but in its 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.380
 second version is called a node and 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.730
 surely you will already know her because it is 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.190
 a video game because of this style 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.810
 arkanoid but very addictive this time 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.640
 we have new functions so that the 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.350
 game is much more addictive you know 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.569
 we have the bar below that we're going 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.700
 moving so that the ball that is 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.959
 colliding with objects 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.970
 do not fall down because then 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.799
 we would lose we are throwing little things that 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.090
 we have to try to collect and 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.769
 above all I think it's one of the 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.049
 news I'm a girlfriend 1 I think not 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.970
 we had to notice that the part of 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.890
 down to the right we have as a 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.330
 indicator that is completing not 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.980
 notice that more or less we already have it 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.799
 completed and when we play 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.240
 we create as a force that attracts the 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.280
 ball 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.020
 at that point and in that way then the 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.870
 ball is going to hit is subject to this 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.280
 way those overwhelming phases of the 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.320
 arcane today not when we were at the end 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.580
 we said we only have one square left 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.200
 and oysters that is that I do not give 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.730
 Well, calmly with this you go 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.260
 to be able to go directly to the area where 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.450
 you want to do a little bit 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.070
 maybe more efficient guys a mark 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.050
 today of all the life but with functions 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.600
 I think quite addictive a new 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.280
 video game that just landed on ios 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.900
 Good guys guys, I hope you have 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.760
 liked this tour you know that you can 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.920
 support them with your likes and that we 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.300
 we see of course in a next video and 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.300
