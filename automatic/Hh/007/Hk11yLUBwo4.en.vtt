00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
I've either slitter bumps and since I

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.929 
I've either slitter bumps and since I
slid<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.210> know<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.539> can<00:00:21.779> bounce<00:00:21.900> off<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.230> them

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
slid I know you can bounce off of them

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.490 
slid I know you can bounce off of them
they're<00:00:23.939> real<00:00:24.150> simple<00:00:24.689> yeah<00:00:25.050> i'm<00:00:25.199> going<00:00:25.439> to

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
they're real simple yeah i'm going to

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.839 
they're real simple yeah i'm going to
show<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:25.949> hit<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.369> one<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:26.789> is

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
show you that I hit this one this is

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.429 
show you that I hit this one this is
probably<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.300> easiest<00:00:27.689> one<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.869> hit<00:00:28.170> since

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
probably the easiest one to hit since

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.750 
probably the easiest one to hit since
you<00:00:28.529> just<00:00:28.740> stand<00:00:28.980> right<00:00:29.070> there<00:00:29.220> on<00:00:29.369> top<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.699> the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
you just stand right there on top of the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.150 
you just stand right there on top of the
stage<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.390> know<00:00:31.230> it's<00:00:31.500> kind<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.740> hard<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.949> see

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
stage I know it's kind of hard to see

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.700 
stage I know it's kind of hard to see
since<00:00:32.369> i<00:00:32.460> don't<00:00:32.520> have<00:00:32.700> an<00:00:32.850> HD<00:00:33.210> PVR<00:00:33.450> now<00:00:33.989> but<00:00:34.350> i

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
since i don't have an HD PVR now but i

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.770 
since i don't have an HD PVR now but i
did<00:00:35.460> slide<00:00:35.790> right<00:00:36.030> there<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.360> some<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.660> these

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
did slide right there and some of these

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.630 
did slide right there and some of these
i<00:00:36.960> bounce<00:00:37.260> but<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.710> bounce<00:00:37.890> are<00:00:38.100> really<00:00:38.430> hard

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
i bounce but the bounce are really hard

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.580 
i bounce but the bounce are really hard
to<00:00:38.730> hit<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.840> one<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.079> probably<00:00:40.410> my

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
to hit and this one is probably my

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.590 
to hit and this one is probably my
favorite<00:00:40.820> you<00:00:41.820> line<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.059> up<00:00:42.210> with<00:00:42.270> those<00:00:42.540> two

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
favorite you line it up with those two

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.630 
favorite you line it up with those two
rocks<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.350> then<00:00:43.440> strafe<00:00:43.800> jump<00:00:43.829> at<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.280> end<00:00:44.489> of

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
rocks and then strafe jump at the end of

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.299 
rocks and then strafe jump at the end of
the<00:00:44.760> second<00:00:45.690> rock<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.770> land<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.160> that

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
the second rock and you land on that

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.069 
the second rock and you land on that
cylinder<00:00:47.700> down<00:00:47.969> there<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.329> can<00:00:48.480> also<00:00:48.660> line<00:00:48.930> to

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
cylinder down there you can also line to

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.360 
cylinder down there you can also line to
the<00:00:49.170> one<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.440> left<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:49.890> one<00:00:50.160> but<00:00:50.340> i

that<00:01:27.479> man<00:01:27.689> but<00:01:28.320> yeah<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.950> wanna<00:01:29.340> let<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.549> guys

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
that man but yeah I wanna let you guys

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.700 
that man but yeah I wanna let you guys
know<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.880> did<00:01:30.150> find<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.689> my<00:01:30.780> own<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.259> was<00:01:31.619> in

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
know I did find this on my own I was in

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.140 
know I did find this on my own I was in
a<00:01:31.799> random<00:01:32.130> ground<00:01:32.369> word<00:01:32.520> match<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.970> thought

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
a random ground word match and thought

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.609 
a random ground word match and thought
it<00:01:33.270> would<00:01:33.360> be<00:01:33.479> cool<00:01:33.659> if<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.869> could<00:01:33.930> jump<00:01:34.229> off<00:01:34.409> and

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
it would be cool if I could jump off and

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.190 
it would be cool if I could jump off and
make<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.829> look<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.130> bounce<00:01:35.400> and

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
make it look like a bounce and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.270 
make it look like a bounce and
unintentionally<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.229> actually<00:01:37.530> slid<00:01:38.070> off<00:01:38.250> and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
unintentionally I actually slid off and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.950 
unintentionally I actually slid off and
I<00:01:38.579> kept<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:38.939> trying<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.509> private<00:01:39.689> match

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
I kept on trying it in a private match

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.200 
I kept on trying it in a private match
and<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.070> was<00:01:41.250> about<00:01:41.460> six<00:01:41.820> months<00:01:41.909> ago

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
and and this was about six months ago

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.060 
and and this was about six months ago
before<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.689> even<00:01:42.840> had<00:01:43.140> my<00:01:43.380> dazzle<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.040> I

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070
