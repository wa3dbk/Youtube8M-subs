00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
so i think a lot of my earlier work was

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.389 
so i think a lot of my earlier work was
sort<00:01:38.569> of<00:01:38.690> you<00:01:38.869> know<00:01:39.009> heartbreak<00:01:40.009> and

00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:42.349 
heartache and trying to figure out that

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:46.690 
heartache and trying to figure out that
you<00:01:43.129> know<00:01:43.250> maze<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:44.209> now<00:01:44.920> i'm<00:01:45.920> kind<00:01:46.610> of

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
you know maze and now i'm kind of

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.839

tackling<00:01:47.739> larger<00:01:48.739> issues<00:01:49.220> i<00:01:49.429> think<00:01:49.670> so
