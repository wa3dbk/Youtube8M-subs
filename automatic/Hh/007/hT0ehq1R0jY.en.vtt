basically with you stand in there that

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.520 
basically with you stand in there that
the<00:02:49.270> pan<00:02:49.450> actually<00:02:49.750> looks<00:02:49.930> a<00:02:49.990> little<00:02:50.020> bit<00:02:50.320> long

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.460 
but what I'm guessing is and when you
think<00:02:52.330> about<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.690> when<00:02:52.810> you're<00:02:52.930> buying<00:02:53.110> pants
