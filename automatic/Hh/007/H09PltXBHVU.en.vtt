00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.180
 it's very important these days 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.710
 open doors be it the one that 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.570
 pessac leognan face in party first 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.279
 December weekend where now for 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.990
 the blu ray days of allowing in 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.630
 somewhere in parentheses at 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.430
 the public at large to discover the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.590
 castles and have to stop that can not be 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.260
 not actually con also a place of 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.970
 production as a direct catch 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.800
 exactly t between the terroir 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.800
 products and legs 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.580
 I'm finally there 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.500
 2 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.770
 the spirit we want to give to these 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.450
 events is the pleasure of people 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.890
 or come to meet discover and 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.140
 also of being able to picnic and a little 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.580
 in the space of the castle ie 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.960
 in the part a little more private 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.880
 we are very family so the idea 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.680
 is that people come with us 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.570
 have a good time and have a little bit of 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.650
 pleasure the audience it's not just 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.940
 people who are in a restaurant or 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.380
 who buys a bottle is that it 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.840
 are people who come to share who 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.670
 just understood from the work of the 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.470
 passion a philosophy there is a 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.160
 generosity in all this the idea is to 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.160
 share 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.280
 this is the first year we had 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.680
 open in November still open 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.729
 for whites because our 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.040
 consumers are our neighbors 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.140
 did not necessarily know olive and 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.630
 after it is to discover the 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.740
 white wines of pessac 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.330
 because the marketing is 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.530
 easy easy that's actually it 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.030
 is most known for is not ashamed 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.040
 deprogrammed with white wine that are 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.280
 really 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.280
 it would be 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.060
 but white caviar is perfect and on 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.380
 a minerality precisely with with a 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.320
 young casar or caviar a very small 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.390
 little more refined that will put in well 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.900
 exergue actually the side a little crazy it's 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.920
 that finally it's getting married very well 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.920
 very good for that we are here 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.300
 the organization 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.560
 white saturday and his onians tail that's 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.200
 a very good idea 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.600
 why a poor one because it does not 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.630
 still brakes a lot of people 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.360

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.360
