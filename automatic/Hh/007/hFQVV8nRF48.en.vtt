 biodiversity 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.100
 a barrier to desertification but 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.040
 they also act as wine keeper 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.600
 contributing an organoleptic improvement and 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.790
 enabling this evolution and this 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.290
 maturation of this wine that will be 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.800

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.540
 leave 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.400
 if you want to discover the best secret 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.959

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.990
 kitchen attentive to its qualities and 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.420
 advantages for our health 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.370
 let's see the sea water we filter it 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.500
 we process and use it for uses 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.959
 culinary because this has 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.300
 mainly two advantages one is the 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.860
 healthy health 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.239
 in the end cooking with sea water is 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.160
 much healthier than with water and salt 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.560
 it gives you nutrients makes it easier 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.630

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.610
 among others 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.250
 Well, the initiative is to give 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.630
 return to traditional inlaid sausage 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.430
 of white pig then the idea is 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.800
 introduce new flavors and make a 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.989
 merger is valid so that good 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.510
