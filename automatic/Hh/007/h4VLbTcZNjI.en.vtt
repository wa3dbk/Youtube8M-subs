00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:29.330 
the same handset the same mobile phone
whether<00:00:27.779> they<00:00:28.020> do<00:00:28.169> have<00:00:28.439> some<00:00:28.680> slides<00:00:28.919> and

differences<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.779> I'll<00:00:31.169> go<00:00:31.380> through<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
differences so I'll go through the

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.710 
differences so I'll go through the
classic<00:00:32.189> burst<00:00:32.520> as<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:33.000> can<00:00:33.149> see<00:00:33.360> it's<00:00:33.510> quite

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
classic burst as you can see it's quite

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.639 
classic burst as you can see it's quite
long<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.649> very<00:00:35.430> thinned<00:00:35.880> now<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.930> it's<00:00:37.410> made

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
long and very thinned now and it's made

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.979 
long and very thinned now and it's made
from<00:00:37.800> an<00:00:37.980> anodized<00:00:38.880> aluminium<00:00:39.210> and

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
from an anodized aluminium and

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.380 
from an anodized aluminium and
apparently<00:00:40.949> each<00:00:41.160> phone<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.699> individually

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
apparently each phone is individually

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.689 
apparently each phone is individually

a different of scratching and pattern on

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.689 
a different of scratching and pattern on
each<00:00:47.370> handset<00:00:47.699> now<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:49.379> my<00:00:49.500> untrained<00:00:49.769> eye<00:00:50.250> it

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
internet ready so the internet is quite

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.880 
internet ready so the internet is quite
vast<00:02:01.009> it's<00:02:01.939> got<00:02:02.090> a<00:02:02.119> 3.2<00:02:02.840> megapixel<00:02:03.409> camera

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
vast it's got a 3.2 megapixel camera

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.199 
vast it's got a 3.2 megapixel camera
with<00:02:04.039> cow<00:02:04.850> Zeiss<00:02:05.329> optics<00:02:05.659> lens<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:07.209> autofocus

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
with cow Zeiss optics lens and autofocus

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.779 
with cow Zeiss optics lens and autofocus
and<00:02:08.660> eight<00:02:09.049> times<00:02:09.319> digital<00:02:09.890> zoom<00:02:10.129> and<00:02:10.519> dual

and eight times digital zoom and dual
LED<00:02:11.120> flash<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:12.470> obviously<00:02:12.920> they're<00:02:13.099> really

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310

I have been trying this over the last

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.530 
I have been trying this over the last
couple<00:02:45.350> of<00:02:45.530> days<00:02:45.769> and<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.190> be<00:02:46.370> honest<00:02:46.700> I<00:02:46.940> mean

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
couple of days and to be honest I mean

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.720 
couple of days and to be honest I mean
we<00:02:48.079> all<00:02:48.170> know<00:02:48.350> 3<00:02:48.709> g's<00:02:48.980> meant<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.340> be<00:02:49.430> amazing

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
something that I'm really excited about

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.420 
something that I'm really excited about
anyway<00:05:50.090> so<00:05:50.780> they<00:05:50.930> have<00:05:51.350> it<00:05:51.470> was<00:05:51.740> another<00:05:52.160> phone

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
anyway so they have it was another phone

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.890 
anyway so they have it was another phone
and<00:05:52.460> gone<00:05:53.860> so<00:05:54.860> they're<00:05:55.010> the<00:05:55.130> two<00:05:55.340> nokia<00:05:55.900> 6500

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
and gone so they're the two nokia 6500

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.480 
and gone so they're the two nokia 6500
so<00:05:57.050> we've<00:05:57.170> got<00:05:57.320> the<00:05:57.410> classic<00:05:57.650> and<00:05:58.010> the<00:05:58.160> slide

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
so we've got the classic and the slide

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.400 
so we've got the classic and the slide
there's<00:05:59.180> only<00:05:59.330> 10<00:05:59.600> pounds<00:05:59.990> different

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
there's only 10 pounds different

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.770 
there's only 10 pounds different
obviously<00:06:00.590> this<00:06:01.160> one<00:06:01.430> is<00:06:01.700> more<00:06:01.850> expensive<00:06:02.120> 10

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
obviously this one is more expensive 10

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.480 
obviously this one is more expensive 10
pounds<00:06:03.170> and<00:06:03.470> I<00:06:03.560> think<00:06:03.740> it'd<00:06:03.860> be<00:06:03.890> nice<00:06:04.190> to<00:06:04.310> go

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
pounds and I think it'd be nice to go

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.890 
pounds and I think it'd be nice to go
for<00:06:04.700> the<00:06:04.760> cheaper<00:06:05.150> one<00:06:05.300> because<00:06:05.510> there's<00:06:05.690> just

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
for the cheaper one because there's just

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.110 
for the cheaper one because there's just
so<00:06:06.020> many<00:06:06.200> more<00:06:06.470> features<00:06:06.680> in<00:06:07.070> this<00:06:07.250> one<00:06:07.490> I<00:06:07.790> mean

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
so many more features in this one I mean

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.660 
so many more features in this one I mean
that<00:06:08.450> it's<00:06:09.200> just<00:06:09.350> so<00:06:09.590> much<00:06:09.620> nice<00:06:10.100> and<00:06:10.370> looking

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:10.670 
that it's just so much nice and looking

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.960 
that it's just so much nice and looking
and<00:06:10.910> the<00:06:11.950> camera<00:06:12.950> photographic<00:06:13.820> capabilities

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:13.970 
and the camera photographic capabilities

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.780 
and the camera photographic capabilities
are<00:06:14.630> just<00:06:14.780> so<00:06:14.930> much<00:06:15.080> better<00:06:15.410> so<00:06:15.980> can<00:06:16.550> make<00:06:16.700> your

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:16.790 
are just so much better so can make your

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.910 
are just so much better so can make your
own<00:06:16.910> mind<00:06:17.210> up<00:06:17.420> but<00:06:17.630> I<00:06:17.660> should<00:06:17.900> recommend<00:06:18.500> this

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:18.920 
own mind up but I should recommend this
