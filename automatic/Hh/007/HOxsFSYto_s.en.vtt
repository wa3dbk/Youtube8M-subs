in order to test that sort of thing Dean

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.240 
in order to test that sort of thing Dean
CPK<00:04:33.330> was<00:04:33.510> measured<00:04:33.810> CPK<00:04:34.530> is<00:04:34.590> an<00:04:34.740> enzyme<00:04:35.070> that's

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
CPK was measured CPK is an enzyme that's

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.040 
CPK was measured CPK is an enzyme that's
found<00:04:35.370> in<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:35.580> heart<00:04:35.850> brain<00:04:36.300> and<00:04:36.630> skeletal

found in the heart brain and skeletal

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.630 
found in the heart brain and skeletal
muscle<00:04:37.080> so<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:37.560> higher<00:04:37.770> your<00:04:37.950> CP<00:04:38.250> cake<00:04:38.460> out

muscle so the higher your CP cake out

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.130 
muscle so the higher your CP cake out
the<00:04:38.820> more<00:04:38.940> damage<00:04:39.300> was<00:04:39.450> done<00:04:39.480> to<00:04:39.630> your<00:04:39.810> muscles

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
the more damage was done to your muscles

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.350 
the more damage was done to your muscles
