man I'd video here from Adam boy and
this<00:00:37.510> is<00:00:37.660> the<00:00:37.750> starting<00:00:38.470> point<00:00:38.650> of<00:00:38.860> cyclists

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
this is the starting point of cyclists

this is the starting point of cyclists
cycling<00:00:39.760> the<00:00:39.880> wrong<00:00:40.030> way<00:00:40.740> in<00:00:41.740> cycling

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.330 
facilities and in roads in general it
really<00:00:43.810> isn't<00:00:44.200> that<00:00:44.470> good<00:00:44.650> an<00:00:44.740> idea<00:00:44.830> in<00:00:45.190> this

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
really isn't that good an idea in this

really isn't that good an idea in this
situation<00:00:46.150> no<00:00:46.540> harm<00:00:46.780> done<00:00:47.020> but<00:00:47.200> you'll<00:00:47.470> see

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
situation no harm done but you'll see

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.470 
situation no harm done but you'll see
later<00:00:47.890> they<00:00:48.130> could<00:00:48.370> well<00:00:48.490> have<00:00:48.580> been<00:00:48.610> number

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
later they could well have been number

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.540

eight<00:00:49.660> another<00:00:50.350> video<00:00:50.620> from<00:00:50.860> Adam<00:00:51.100> boy<00:00:51.220> and

eight another video from Adam boy and

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.950 
eight another video from Adam boy and
there's<00:00:52.030> some<00:00:52.120> cyclists<00:00:52.510> from<00:00:52.570> the<00:00:52.720> right

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
there's some cyclists from the right

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.660 
there's some cyclists from the right
that<00:00:53.320> emerged<00:00:53.650> really<00:00:54.070> without<00:00:54.340> checking

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
that emerged really without checking

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.660 
that emerged really without checking
properly<00:00:55.180> and<00:00:55.960> it<00:00:56.860> really<00:00:57.130> isn't<00:00:57.340> a<00:00:57.460> good<00:00:57.550> idea

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
properly and it really isn't a good idea

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.460 
properly and it really isn't a good idea
to<00:00:57.970> rely<00:00:58.300> on<00:00:58.330> your<00:00:58.540> ears<00:00:58.720> not<00:00:58.930> all<00:00:59.080> vehicles

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
to rely on your ears not all vehicles

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.600 
to rely on your ears not all vehicles
make<00:00:59.620> noise<00:00:59.800> so<00:01:00.010> just<00:01:00.040> make<00:01:00.310> sure<00:01:00.460> you<00:01:00.580> always

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
make noise so just make sure you always

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.690 
make noise so just make sure you always
check<00:01:01.710> number<00:01:02.710> seven<00:01:03.010> a<00:01:03.100> video<00:01:03.340> here<00:01:03.550> from

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
check number seven a video here from

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.609 
check number seven a video here from
cycling<00:01:04.030> Mikey<00:01:04.420> again<00:01:04.989> highlighting<00:01:05.530> the

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
cycling Mikey again highlighting the

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.410 
cycling Mikey again highlighting the
points<00:01:05.920> of<00:01:06.130> cycling<00:01:06.759> the<00:01:06.880> wrong<00:01:07.060> side<00:01:07.270> of<00:01:07.360> the

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
points of cycling the wrong side of the

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.570 
points of cycling the wrong side of the
road<00:01:07.509> these<00:01:07.780> cyclists<00:01:08.380> have<00:01:08.920> to<00:01:09.070> cycle<00:01:09.280> around

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
road these cyclists have to cycle around

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.100 
road these cyclists have to cycle around
him<00:01:09.850> and<00:01:09.970> there's<00:01:10.420> some<00:01:10.540> oncoming<00:01:10.900> traffic

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
him and there's some oncoming traffic

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.270 
him and there's some oncoming traffic
coming<00:01:11.380> around<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.650> corner<00:01:11.770> that<00:01:12.040> has<00:01:12.159> to

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
coming around the corner that has to

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.399 
coming around the corner that has to
avoid<00:01:12.520> them<00:01:12.790> albeit<00:01:13.300> not<00:01:13.690> that<00:01:13.810> seriously<00:01:14.200> and

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
avoid them albeit not that seriously and

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.230 
avoid them albeit not that seriously and
again<00:01:14.920> some<00:01:15.190> more<00:01:15.220> cyclists<00:01:15.909> in<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.090> wrong

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
again some more cyclists in the wrong

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.310 
again some more cyclists in the wrong
side<00:01:16.420> of<00:01:16.480> the<00:01:16.540> road<00:01:16.659> and<00:01:16.840> I'm<00:01:16.900> not<00:01:16.960> sure<00:01:17.200> if

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
side of the road and I'm not sure if

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.200 
side of the road and I'm not sure if
Mikey<00:01:17.560> knew<00:01:17.770> they<00:01:17.890> were<00:01:17.950> coming<00:01:18.400> but<00:01:18.610> myself

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
Mikey knew they were coming but myself

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.850 
Mikey knew they were coming but myself
probably<00:01:19.810> would<00:01:19.900> have<00:01:19.960> been<00:01:20.110> in<00:01:20.170> that<00:01:20.380> cycling

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
probably would have been in that cycling

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.830 
probably would have been in that cycling
lane<00:01:21.460> and<00:01:21.729> I<00:01:21.790> could<00:01:22.000> have<00:01:22.090> well<00:01:22.270> had<00:01:22.420> an<00:01:22.540> on<00:01:22.659> a

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
lane and I could have well had an on a

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.960 
lane and I could have well had an on a
head-on<00:01:23.200> collision<00:01:23.380> so<00:01:23.830> well<00:01:24.400> done<00:01:24.490> to<00:01:24.640> Mikey

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
head-on collision so well done to Mikey

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.910 
head-on collision so well done to Mikey
for<00:01:25.120> avoiding<00:01:25.450> that<00:01:25.570> another<00:01:26.500> video<00:01:26.650> from

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
for avoiding that another video from

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.469 
for avoiding that another video from
math<00:01:27.130> and<00:01:27.159> boy<00:01:27.430> and<00:01:27.640> he's<00:01:27.760> in<00:01:27.909> the<00:01:28.000> main<00:01:28.210> road

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
math and boy and he's in the main road

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.090 
math and boy and he's in the main road
so<00:01:28.659> he<00:01:28.750> has<00:01:28.870> priority<00:01:29.500> over<00:01:29.530> those<00:01:29.860> on<00:01:30.040> the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
so he has priority over those on the

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.969 
so he has priority over those on the
right<00:01:30.340> but<00:01:30.909> this<00:01:31.180> cyclists<00:01:31.690> here<00:01:31.900> fails<00:01:32.800> to

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
right but this cyclists here fails to

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.399 
right but this cyclists here fails to
give<00:01:33.100> way<00:01:33.280> and<00:01:33.450> Adam<00:01:34.450> boy<00:01:34.570> probably<00:01:34.930> he<00:01:35.080> had<00:01:35.290> to

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
give way and Adam boy probably he had to

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.080 
give way and Adam boy probably he had to
slow<00:01:35.680> slightly<00:01:35.979> to<00:01:36.220> avoid<00:01:36.490> a<00:01:36.520> collision<00:01:36.790> and

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
slow slightly to avoid a collision and

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.149 
slow slightly to avoid a collision and
he<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.960> other<00:01:38.080> cyclist<00:01:38.500> is<00:01:38.590> very<00:01:38.799> lucky<00:01:39.040> there

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
he the other cyclist is very lucky there

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.380 
he the other cyclist is very lucky there
wasn't<00:01:39.280> a<00:01:39.400> motorized<00:01:39.850> vehicle<00:01:39.880> because<00:01:40.270> it

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
wasn't a motorized vehicle because it

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.930 
wasn't a motorized vehicle because it
probably<00:01:40.690> would<00:01:40.810> have<00:01:40.840> been<00:01:40.930> a<00:01:41.020> collision

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
probably would have been a collision

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.130 
probably would have been a collision

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.900 
you'll see here he does a really good
look

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
look

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.280 
look
behind<00:04:33.510> him<00:04:33.690> but<00:04:33.810> unfortunately<00:04:34.800> he<00:04:36.080> both<00:04:37.080> of

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
them jumped through the red light which

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.610 
them jumped through the red light which
really<00:04:38.610> isn't<00:04:38.820> something<00:04:39.060> I<00:04:39.210> want<00:04:39.360> to<00:04:39.420> see<00:04:39.620> and

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
really isn't something I want to see and

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.920 
really isn't something I want to see and
another<00:04:40.920> good<00:04:41.220> indication<00:04:42.120> here<00:04:42.330> around<00:04:42.690> some

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
another good indication here around some

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.570 
another good indication here around some
glass<00:04:43.140> obviously<00:04:43.500> he's<00:04:43.800> looking<00:04:44.070> ahead<00:04:44.190> a<00:04:44.340> lot

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
glass obviously he's looking ahead a lot

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.490 
glass obviously he's looking ahead a lot
so<00:04:45.120> that's<00:04:45.240> very<00:04:45.570> good<00:04:45.750> giving<00:04:46.350> other

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
so that's very good giving other

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.650 
so that's very good giving other
cyclists<00:04:47.100> good<00:04:47.250> cues<00:04:47.670> as<00:04:47.850> to<00:04:47.880> what<00:04:48.150> they

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
cyclists good cues as to what they

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.450 
cyclists good cues as to what they
should<00:04:48.840> be<00:04:48.930> avoiding<00:04:49.320> but<00:04:49.740> again<00:04:49.980> returns

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
should be avoiding but again returns

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.880 
should be avoiding but again returns
into<00:04:50.760> the<00:04:50.970> door<00:04:51.180> zone<00:04:51.420> it's<00:04:51.960> really<00:04:52.500> is<00:04:52.620> a<00:04:52.650> big

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
into the door zone it's really is a big

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.260 
into the door zone it's really is a big
issue<00:04:53.010> for<00:04:53.160> cyclists<00:04:53.640> so<00:04:53.700> it<00:04:53.760> really<00:04:54.030> is<00:04:54.240> a

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
issue for cyclists so it really is a

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.750 
issue for cyclists so it really is a
killer<00:04:54.770> I'm<00:04:55.770> going<00:04:56.010> to<00:04:56.070> put<00:04:56.190> a<00:04:56.220> video<00:04:56.370> in<00:04:56.580> the

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
killer I'm going to put a video in the
