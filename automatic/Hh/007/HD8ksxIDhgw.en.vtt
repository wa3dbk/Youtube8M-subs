00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.629

 known some time ago gentlemen and 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.649
 the truth that I liked a lot 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.140
 the shape of its covers is the style of 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.370
 the byproducts itself then this one does not 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.620
 we had the opportunity to be able 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.449
 communicate with them and we are going to 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.340
 proceed to show them the products that 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.860
 they have sent for reviewed to 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.229
 it looks like it's just a sheath two 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.570
 covers but look what waves as they have 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.080
 sent but good let's see we put 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.420
 this here we remove this box and we are going to 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.100
 proceed to show what the covers are 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.440
 they have sent for purposes of 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.860
 revised once is the classic texture 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.990
 snap on cover to classic cover 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.020
 inserted this for iphone 4 the 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.789
 iphone 4s are products for samples 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.979
 gentlemen then do not wait maybe 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.020
 or not to expect it to be 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.970
 like if you're going to buy it in the 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.350
 store since it's simply for 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.929
 show the products that they are 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.909
 offering to the market and this one 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.040
 this will necessarily come 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.750
 new little ones like in the store 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.490
 says this real leather this real stitching 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.469
 well let's proceed to open these 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.439
 we are going to show you quickly here and 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:00.820
 we will remove this sleeve from this one we are going to 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.079
 put here in the description 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.579
 the prices of these covers that we have 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.549
 state that we are going to show you in these 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:09.640
 moments and we put aside brings us 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:12.640
 Gentlemen gentlemen what is this one 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.319
 let's see if only one protector of 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.920
 screen usually right now I'm 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.959
 looking at a microfiber wipe and that's how it is 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.880
 sir a screen saver that 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.880
 maybe they are not of the best quality but 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.800
 yes they are worth it since this one does not offer 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.900
 extra protection for what is our 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.270
 iphone so good look here is the case 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.010
 itself that typical inserted style all 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.050
 the world already knows what inside it is 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.120
 totally plastic and in the part of 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.180
 back brings what is this lining which 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.790
 similar to what they say is pure 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.670
 leather I have my doubts about it 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.060
 it looks more like a sheet a 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.340
 plastic or a decal some kind of 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.380
 of plastic that looks a lot like 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.350
 leather and what has been stuck on it 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.880
 of this case or to take out houses like 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.850
 you can see here gentlemen look is 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.709
 too exact the cut the way in 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.900
 that has been stuck for that I think not 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.850
 I get the impression that it's real leather 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.100
 or genuine look in the part of here 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.670
 also this one looks very, very, very 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.670
 thin 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.800
 in regards to the actual seams 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.250
 as they say of their covers I think that 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.380
 they are not gentlemen it also seems 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.080
 as painted as drawn has its 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.990
 small relief but it does not look 100% 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.330
 that it's real sewing here brings what 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.340
 It is the logo of the company and will 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.310
 proceed to put it in what is our 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.310
 iphone which we have been using with 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.020
 our products of this ray though 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.610
 he again sent us that let's see 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.740
 hopefully it does not affect the time of 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.900
 put it in the case since those 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.670
 decals give a little more thickness it 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.950
 it makes very easy very simple this 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.690
 way and these signs to the style is 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.060
 well or I quite like the price 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.370
 maybe hand does not give much or be leaves much 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.090
 than wanting the product itself is not what 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.709
 they say that this is the 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.370
 case of what is your case that says 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:05.470
 real leather and real seams I have my 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.820
 doubts about those gentlemen but good here 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.860
 is the case itself was have been 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.200
 shipped free by the company t extra 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.850
 and remember that I not only for the fact 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.190
 that have been sent free I'm going to 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.890
 speak well of the products since the 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.410
 that really matter what really 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.459
 I must be as honest as possible 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.800
 with you who are the ones who are going to 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.790
 buy these products when you see them in my 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.710
 channel 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.770
 gentlemen here is the truth that a 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:35.710
 7 a 6.5 I will give you have nothing of the other 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:36.910
 world this name I do not know I do not see anything that 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.280
 it strikes me for it to buy 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.860
 what is this cover here can see in 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.460
 the back says technology 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.650
 extra and this brings the gap for what 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.650
 are 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.350
 the camera to be able to record videos and 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.729
 can also take our photos and that 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.289
 do not affect what the flash is and all 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.960
 the covers bring this thing inside 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:01.979
 in black so you do not have that 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.539
 this shine that will have a cover 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.160
 installed on our iphone the part of 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:08.910
 in plain simple gentlemen and good 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:12.090
 here is the extra case the classic snap 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.620
 on cover the classic cover of inserted and 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.610
 We are going to show you what this other 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.260
 which is for the ipod touch and we're going to 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.639
 proceed to put it so that you more 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.710
 or less you get an idea how is this 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.440
 found on the inside, that's what 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.270
 same technology dt extra the logo in what 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.729
 which is the back is the style 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.610
 from a soccer ball gentlemen to the same 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.850
 a decal with a bit of thread 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.610
 stuck on top of a style cover 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:40.560
 inserted and look at something that the truth that 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.289
 leaves much to be desired speaks very badly of 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.449
 what this company is brand of 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:47.070
 cosmetics gentlemen are the truth that 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.449
 this company did not even take the 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.000
 bother to send us a product of 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:53.099
 quality this so that there would be a 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.550
 good impression since the covers are not 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:56.520
 so 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.080
 they are not so special bitter covers that 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.230
 maybe they have thrown there I do not know what 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.670
 waves I think that lipstick or 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:06.220
 painting 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.420
 a cosmetic of woman gentlemen but good 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.220
 let's proceed to put it so that 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.770
 you can see it as we are going 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.800
 to leave in the style link 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.660
 inserted is put here puts here and already 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.760

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.530

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.060
 and maximum forgiveness is his daughter is 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.730
 using what you see in the back 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.770
 As you can see, the truth is that this 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:30.100
 very simple covers nothing I do not think 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:32.500
 the prices speak well of what they are 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.750
 these products that have been sent to 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.650

 products which this one 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.870
 It is appreciated as many companies 

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:13.129
 they refuse or do not take the trouble to 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.080
 send us a product to be 

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:16.400
 revised already I say goodbye gentlemen do
