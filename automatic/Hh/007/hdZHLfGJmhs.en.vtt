00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.320 
hydrolyzed gelatin and whey protein
isolate<00:04:48.500> but<00:04:49.460> what's<00:04:49.760> nice<00:04:49.880> about<00:04:49.940> this<00:04:50.180> is

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
isolate but what's nice about this is

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.409 
isolate but what's nice about this is
really<00:04:50.660> concentrated<00:04:51.289> so<00:04:51.979> just<00:04:52.910> turn<00:04:53.120> on<00:04:53.180> the

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
really concentrated so just turn on the

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.250 
really concentrated so just turn on the
scale<00:04:54.050> quick<00:04:55.870> make<00:04:56.870> sure<00:04:57.050> you<00:04:57.139> get<00:04:57.200> that

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
scale quick make sure you get that

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.089 
scale quick make sure you get that
milliliters<00:04:57.950> will<00:04:58.190> do<00:04:58.310> about<00:04:59.830> 9<00:05:00.830> 10

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
milliliters will do about 9 10

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:06.159 
milliliters will do about 9 10
milliliters<00:05:03.820> so<00:05:04.820> 12<00:05:05.240> so<00:05:05.690> this<00:05:05.930> right<00:05:06.110> here

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
milliliters so 12 so this right here

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.500 
milliliters so 12 so this right here
that's<00:05:06.860> a<00:05:06.919> little<00:05:07.099> shot<00:05:07.400> although<00:05:08.090> it's<00:05:08.240> thick

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
that's a little shot although it's thick

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.580 
that's a little shot although it's thick
here<00:05:08.690> it's<00:05:08.780> really<00:05:08.930> not<00:05:09.020> bad<00:05:09.080> you<00:05:09.349> can<00:05:09.470> just

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
here it's really not bad you can just

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.690 
here it's really not bad you can just
take<00:05:09.680> it<00:05:09.830> like<00:05:09.919> a<00:05:09.950> shot<00:05:10.039> which<00:05:10.340> you'll<00:05:10.490> see

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
take it like a shot which you'll see

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.140 
take it like a shot which you'll see
it's<00:05:11.479> about<00:05:11.630> 50<00:05:11.930> grams<00:05:12.110> of<00:05:12.229> protein<00:05:12.380> so

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
it's about 50 grams of protein so

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.370 
it's about 50 grams of protein so
although<00:05:14.150> I'd<00:05:14.389> probably<00:05:14.419> recommend<00:05:14.720> way<00:05:15.080> if

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380
