the<00:01:46.530> whole<00:01:46.710> November<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.229> I<00:01:49.229> think<00:01:49.470> it'd<00:01:49.560> be

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
the whole November and I think it'd be

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.080 
the whole November and I think it'd be
better<00:01:49.799> if<00:01:49.950> i<00:01:50.009> was<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.159> have<00:01:50.340> him<00:01:50.460> for<00:01:50.640> December

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
better if i was to have him for December

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.810 
better if i was to have him for December
because<00:01:51.240> they're<00:01:51.450> kind<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:52.430> winter<00:01:53.430> colors

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
because they're kind of winter colors

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.969 
because they're kind of winter colors
but<00:01:54.350> yeah<00:01:56.090> epic<00:01:57.090> fail<00:01:57.299> but<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:58.049> like<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.590> colors
