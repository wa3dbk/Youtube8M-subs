00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Ahoy together and welcome to 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.700
 a tour about the carnival legend the 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.270
 is a recent guest in hamburg 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.710
 been 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.300
 and I thought to myself as human 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.860
 rarely like here in hamburg at the carnival 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.330
 I have to visit the ship 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.880
 to have a look 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.289
 yes relatively rare for that you want to consider 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.390
 carnival cruise lines is at 24 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.699
 after all, the largest shipping company 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.410
 the world madness and what's there 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.289
 expected on board that look us now 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.619
 at times because it screams forward to the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.119
 colorful design by kofax yes that has too 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.590
 For Costa, some ships are made 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.399
 really a bit 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.809
 getting used to frame subject to 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.500
 Incidentally, this ship is Greek 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.059
 mythology 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.680
 but honestly I can understand that 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.170
 why carnival now the ships too 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.059
 from a hamburger office design leaves yes 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.620
 the first pooldeck we have seen 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.640
 rained here in hamburg that is 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.710
 probably the reason why the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.629
 karneval shots here are 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.180
 luckily there is also an over-roofed bar 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.649
 pooldeck yes with cool of course with 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.329
 If the rich are yes you have to 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.670
 Seeing a seaweed then there is 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.960
 a whirlpool where you can relax and 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.510
 we also see the lie all 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.519
 Obviously then brand new 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.110
 It's a drinker I can do that 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.000
 get a simple lemonade or 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.500
 Unsweetened iced tea I especially like 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.720
 like to drink but also coffee 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.220
 For example, there are also burger there 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.049
 for example, yes, then there's one more 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.520
 third boat was the serenity area 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.560
 only for adults with nice 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.090
 So rattan furniture also because it looks 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.250
 really good if you consider 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.170
 The ship is now eleven years old 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.610
 that's her back there later 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.159
 I've been going out of it 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.750
 looks really good but 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.460
 of course it could also do the weather 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.490
 do not do better yes and there is 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.710
 of course also a bar outside 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.170
 here is the extra restaurant the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.270
 steakhouse costs $ 35 per person 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.860
 person without drinks but you can 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.750
 also eat as much as you want and have to 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.320
 not for every corncob or something extra 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.000
 pay 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.280
 and here's a look at this 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.860
 vacuum is not bad or 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:58.350
 this is the club for teenagers 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.130
 with kicker and dance floor yes where are the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.450
 Video game console wii are missing again 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.060
 So there you can see twelve years next to year 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.829
 is the ship has a gymnasium yes that 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.470
 has nothing to do with school but that 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.750
 the sports studio is very interesting 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.239
 By the way, over several decks that goes 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.030
 that is relatively rare 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.440
 just look because the stairs going down there 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.390
 Can I walk then? 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.569
 watch TV if I want to 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.599
 and there is one in the village whirlpool 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.519
 which then belongs to the spa that's it 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.410
 buffet restaurant I think 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.849
 I like that this once the 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.010
 you have a matter of taste with the design 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.470
 yes, some also find these cups 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.690
 very nice but the buffet comes 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.160
 Restaurant I did not think so 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.780
 bad I'm not always like that 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.549
 fan of the four songs on the 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.450
 American ships but here was 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.400
 not that bad 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.170
 pizza is also great i have 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.780
 Eat burger was okay too 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.890
 The salad was also great 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.209
 bad this is it 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.310
 main restaurant as I have this time 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.599
 not eaten because I really only 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.549
 a few hours on board 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.049
 By the way, you can also go there in the morning 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.819
 can not operate so bad 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.410
 Here we are already in the library 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.989
 there is also computer for internet access 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.579
 but it is usually expensive at $ 75 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.730
 cent per minute 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:12.489
 then there is a church which at a 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.010
 said yes a small chapel where you 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.900
 then, for example, you can pray 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.160
 it on every ship and a theater and 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.299
 what about the shows I say 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.350
 I have not seen any but you 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.870
 can assume that if you German 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.489
 shipping companies knows that is no comparison 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.590
 with the shows on American 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.569
 So that's already the rule 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.060
 Much more elaborate with the American Jack 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:38.139
 Casino is very big in the evening 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.190
 It is not allowed to smoke during the daytime 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.139
 yes , a bit too fast for 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.170
 American ships the huge casino 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:46.090
 and then there is a sportsbar for 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.250
 those who then look at themselves 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.230
 to move yourself 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.750
 and this is another track 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.130
 that almost looks a bit 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.890
 European inspired finds no 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.350
 there is also stage and here we are 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.570
 then ultimately in the firebird lounge 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.610
 even with a small stage too for 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.460
 demonstrations unfortunately without windows for it 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.870
 with very special lamps a bit 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.340
 shorter than usual this tour over the 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.320
 karl valentin so much time 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.460
 we did not have anything on board 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.690
 quite interesting because I 'm there 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.010
 time with such a few employees 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.350
 travel agencies entertained and asked 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.989
 man that's so carnival cruise 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.790
 Lines are barely booked in Germany 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.620
 then travel like this at all 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.700
 come the people because it na ja 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.080
 and then I have something as an answer 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.050
 quite close to getting it actually 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.610
 because many many just look where they are 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.760
 at any place, for example, somewhere 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.740
 in texas or in tampa in florida where 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.330
 not quite as many ships depart from 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.880
 other shipping companies and then there is 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.800
 carnival cruise lines often just that 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.200
 shipping company there then calculated 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.540
 leaves so that then I fell for 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.770
 carnival cruise lines decide what 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.380
 It is very interesting if you have this 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.090
 traveling in germany is that 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.320
 gratuity in the travel price contain the 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.610
 is with most American 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.220
 shipping companies here in Germany not so 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.570
 but the general agency that travel 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.100
 sold here in Germany 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.840
 includes the tip while the 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.570
 travel then but overall are more expensive 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.130
 as in the usa yes I hope it has you 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.950
 like this tour about the carnival 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.690
 So give the whole a big thumb 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.850
 high subscribes to the channel if that still 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.690
 Do not have and see us again 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.690
 next time bye
