to<00:00:53.850> cover<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.960> Judaism<00:00:55.440> isn't<00:00:55.559> about

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
to cover that and Judaism isn't about

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.959 
to cover that and Judaism isn't about
covering<00:00:56.070> yourself<00:00:56.340> but<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.520> felt<00:00:56.760> like<00:00:56.850> that

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
covering yourself but I felt like that

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.319 
covering yourself but I felt like that
would<00:00:57.120> be<00:00:57.210> really<00:00:57.890> burdensome<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.190> me<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.699> I

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329
