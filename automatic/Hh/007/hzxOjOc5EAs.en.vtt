00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:06.729
 good quiksilver we are here in the 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:09.370
 episode 86 I bring a pretty mode 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:12.550
 interesting is called animal bike and good 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.860
 mainly 3 as mounts for 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.750
 all the animals and some extras that 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.460
 he adds that he will teach us everything because 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.190
 I want us to just this law because 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.710
 nothing else takes molo to see and what is the 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.420
 mod and for you to try it 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.789
 I'm going to show everyone, all right, because if 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.120
 no no grace the defeat would almost 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.029
 everyone 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.080
 but we will do good for example 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.990
 consists of these wheels visits from here 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.660
 that we will have the tumÃ¡n and I have the 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.300
 Most of them we can crafter with 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:46.910
 various items you will see it freed frei 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:49.430
 in the post but mainly it's 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.190
 Almost every character is good I think that 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.800
 all if I remember correctly its base by 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.210
 example let's approve some like this for 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.990
 that you see how they go, everyone has their 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.350
 specialty for example let's catch 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.830
 the one of the spider that is something interesting 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.280
 good comes out of color 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.940
 it depends let's see if another color comes out 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.940
 that we like 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.700
 you managed and you can walk 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.460
 the controls are a tad guys but 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.320
 finally 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.659
 to the case that can climb with the spider 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.149
 from above 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.920
 because the spiders climb because 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.340
 you go along with scratched can climb by 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.960
 mountains and others which is quite 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.390
 written that comes to you here and you guard 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.369
 wipes and you stay up here for 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.439
 example that's one that's pretty 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.310
 well that is the spider for example let's 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:56.130
 try the chicken 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.840
 we are going to raise another there the chicken what 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.329
 is that to remove them because when 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.490
 they fall down a ravine they do not kill themselves because 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.210
 they have the fall thing 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.940
 the blue 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.220
 Well, when we have it here 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.209
 You see, we are going to fall slowly and not 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.459
 let's hurt 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.630
 then the spider could serve to 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.910
 go up and the chicken to go down 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.150
 quietly that we are not going to do 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.150
 hurt 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.599
 what else do we have for example the wolf 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.760
 would serve to defend us from the 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.780
 enemies of the sheep we can kill them 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.730
 with them 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.400
 the wolves when they are normal kill 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.190
 things because this help is as if it will mount 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.720
 a wolf come by the octopus also comes 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.340
 very good for the water the boat is very 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.410
 slow as you know then you can go in 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.410
 octopus because just machete just 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.350
 yes octopus 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.820
 a squid that more good then we have the 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.770
 how nice the club is funny what 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.120
 mediapunta should look good this time 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.640
 it has gone electric 80 2 but 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.880
 it usually comes out like that and it looks like a little pig 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.180
 hello tripper 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:05.650
 then another one that is also very well a 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.860
 second that I keep is the pony 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.950
 because it goes down more than putting what goes to 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.950
 do 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.569
 good is we have but it's not because if 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.650
 you see that this one has nothing 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.650
 but that one not flown 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:30.490
 neither is this also a unicorn 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.520
 It is not a pony lovera unicorn 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.620
 this supposes then with the pony we can 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.360
 fly 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.950
 it's not much height that you can catch 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.260
 but we can earn a little bit so for 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.360
 go through pits and others pretty well 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.239
 then we have a lot for example we have 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.209
 the air golem 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.580
 and this is going to be slow but he's going to fight 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.480
 pretty good especially against zombies 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:57.769
 and some others who are doing 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.769
 example this 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.269
 of minecraft are extra things that are 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:08.250
 adding we have the night that is 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:10.400
 pretty curious we're going to see head 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.060
 I'm going to ride her 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.060
 and what 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:19.190
 It is hostile when it rains 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.720
 so let's take the rain 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.870
 when he has the red eyes he is 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.870
 attacking 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.580
 and luck apples 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.889
 I think the mop makes you carry this 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.370
 aggressive now you would have to kill them for 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.370
 stop 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.139
 then we also have that I know 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.320
 the dragon that is also very curious 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:47.770
 being the others because no longer 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:50.640
 the dragon's how good is this is the 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.640
 that truly to fly we have 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.640
 quite 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.080
 if we have a dragon 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:03.060
 and finally we do not have the one of leander 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:05.270
 man yes yes it is like this is a third I do not know 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.270
 why 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:10.889
 and do not die in sister 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.250
 he's dead because you know he's going 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.370
 der vaart in the water 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.910
 it's pretty weird in the mop the way that 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.830
 say 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.300
 we have some more things that I want 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.030
 reserve so that you see it and 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.650
 that 6 see them and nothing is mainly 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.810
 this is all you can put in your mac 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.630
 the norm and valentine to party to which 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.820
 you can perfectly in your game 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.990
 normal to have a pet dragon 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.630
 although it is more difficult to create by 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.850
 example here you have a pet pig 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:48.390
 or anything and nothing I hope there 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:50.420
 liked the mod I suppose tomorrow 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:53.729
 you will have another video where every day 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:57.089
 I'm going to upload it tomorrow 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:58.979
 receive on how is the subject of the 

00:05:57.089 --> 00:06:01.559
 strike and others I will raise your three days 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.240
 videos and then we'll go back to the rhythm 

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:04.770
 normal and number calls we're going to 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.449
 fire so we will not see the next 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.449
 goodbye episode
