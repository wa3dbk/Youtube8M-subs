00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.359 
working too well we ever set all of the
website<00:01:27.570> trials<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.259> if<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.680> already<00:01:28.920> use<00:01:29.040> up

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
website trials so if you already use up

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.130 
website trials so if you already use up
yours<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> past<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.990> head<00:01:31.110> over

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
yours in the past you can just head over

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.929 
yours in the past you can just head over
to<00:01:31.350> merge<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.860> try<00:01:32.159> out<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.400> live<00:01:32.549> prices

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
to merge and try out the live prices

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.819 
to merge and try out the live prices
again<00:01:33.060> keep<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.110> mind<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.560> may<00:01:34.680> be<00:01:34.710> very

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
again keep in mind that it may be very

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.249 
again keep in mind that it may be very
crowded<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.670> competition<00:01:36.240> can<00:01:36.509> be<00:01:36.659> high<00:01:36.810> so

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
crowded so competition can be high so

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.539 
crowded so competition can be high so
maybe<00:01:37.530> you'll<00:01:37.799> want<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.070> wait<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> few<00:01:38.490> days

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
maybe you'll want to wait a few days

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.149 
maybe you'll want to wait a few days
until<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.210> try<00:01:39.390> out<00:01:39.450> your<00:01:39.540> trial<00:01:39.990> as<00:01:40.170> always<00:01:41.130> I
