00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.570
 Almond flan and cookies 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.440
 It's an easy and quick plan to do and very 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.440
 rich 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.119
 we start by putting water in a tray 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.540
 and we put it in the oven to make the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.029
 flan in a bain-marie in a bowl crushed 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.540
 the cookies and mix it with the 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.540
 ground almonds 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.840
 mix the cookies well with the 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.240
 almond and we reserve 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.390
 On the other hand, we separate the yolks from the 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.120
 clear and assemble the whites to the point of 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.890
 snow we can do it by hand or with a 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.210
 mixer 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.210
 I did it with the blender 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.040
 water the sugar little by little without leaving 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.910
 to beat and then add the yolks 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.910
 one to one 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.780
 without stopping to mix add the mixture of 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.620
 the cookies with the almond and for 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.620
 last milk 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.340
 we throw liquid candy in a flanera 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.230
 and pour the mixture that we just 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.910
 prepare the truth is that I have 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.910
 past throwing candy but good 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.740
 we put it in the oven that will be 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.900
 preheated to 250 degrees during a 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.090
 about an hour and a half or until 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.040
 we cook it with albal paper 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.750
 so they do not get too brown and 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.520
 We test with a pinch before 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.380
 take it out to see what is done 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.390
 we let cool and we put it in the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.270
 refrigerator and the next day we see we give 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.909
 and that's the way it is, this is what I've done with 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.790
 so much candy and then I made two of 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.580
 the little ones with less candies 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:02.590
 they are delicious delicious very easy 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.590
 fast and very rich
