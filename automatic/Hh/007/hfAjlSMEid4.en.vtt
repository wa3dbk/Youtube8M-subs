but<00:02:19.420> for<00:02:19.600> sure<00:02:19.750> handling<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:21.100> way<00:02:21.220> the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
but for sure handling and the way the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.220 
but for sure handling and the way the
bike<00:02:21.490> feels<00:02:21.760> is<00:02:22.030> really<00:02:22.330> maneuverable<00:02:22.900> and

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
bike feels is really maneuverable and

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.450 
bike feels is really maneuverable and
you<00:02:23.350> can<00:02:23.500> kind<00:02:23.740> of<00:02:23.830> put<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.100> wherever<00:02:24.250> you<00:02:24.400> want

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
you can kind of put it wherever you want

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.770 
you can kind of put it wherever you want
it<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.840> that's<00:02:26.050> pretty<00:02:26.230> cool<00:02:27.210> yeah<00:02:28.210> just<00:02:28.420> been

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
it so that's pretty cool yeah just been

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.690 
it so that's pretty cool yeah just been
been<00:02:29.140> doing<00:02:29.380> some<00:02:29.530> testing<00:02:29.860> it's<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.400> new<00:02:30.520> bike

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
been doing some testing it's a new bike

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.210 
been doing some testing it's a new bike
for<00:02:30.730> everybody<00:02:31.210> so<00:02:31.590> we've<00:02:32.590> all<00:02:32.740> been<00:02:32.890> learning

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
for everybody so we've all been learning

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.000 
for everybody so we've all been learning
and<00:02:33.400> I<00:02:34.060> think<00:02:34.480> we<00:02:34.570> have<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.750> great<00:02:34.900> package<00:02:35.200> to

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
and I think we have a great package to

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.210 
and I think we have a great package to
start<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.400> year<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:37.320> we'll<00:02:38.320> see<00:02:38.470> after<00:02:38.980> the

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
start the year and we'll see after the

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.340 
start the year and we'll see after the
first<00:02:39.400> couple<00:02:39.520> rounds<00:02:39.790> maybe<00:02:40.200> reassess<00:02:41.200> what

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
first couple rounds maybe reassess what

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.700 
first couple rounds maybe reassess what
we<00:02:41.500> have<00:02:41.680> but<00:02:41.920> I<00:02:42.130> believe<00:02:42.880> we<00:02:42.940> will<00:02:43.270> be<00:02:43.680> will<00:02:44.680> be

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
when I first moved to California I was

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.480

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.040 
terrible in the drive slick stuff and
Frances<00:04:24.490> Phoenix<00:04:24.850> last<00:04:25.000> year<00:04:25.210> I<00:04:25.240> mean<00:04:25.480> if<00:04:25.600> that

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
Frances Phoenix last year I mean if that

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.170 
Frances Phoenix last year I mean if that
was<00:04:26.200> six<00:04:26.980> or<00:04:27.130> seven<00:04:27.400> years<00:04:27.430> ago<00:04:27.640> I<00:04:27.790> may<00:04:28.000> not<00:04:28.120> be

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
was six or seven years ago I may not be

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.290 
was six or seven years ago I may not be
off<00:04:29.020> the<00:04:29.290> back<00:04:29.500> so<00:04:29.830> I've<00:04:30.490> gotten<00:04:30.790> better<00:04:30.820> at<00:04:31.060> it

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
off the back so I've gotten better at it

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.650 
off the back so I've gotten better at it
and<00:04:31.450> I've<00:04:31.600> ridden<00:04:31.870> less<00:04:32.680> ruddy<00:04:32.980> tracks<00:04:33.340> so<00:04:33.670> and

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
and I've ridden less ruddy tracks so and

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.390 
and I've ridden less ruddy tracks so and
then<00:04:35.320> even<00:04:35.620> last<00:04:35.710> year<00:04:35.980> there<00:04:36.100> wasn't<00:04:36.370> that

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
then even last year there wasn't that

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.180 
then even last year there wasn't that
many<00:04:36.610> races<00:04:37.480> with<00:04:37.630> a<00:04:37.660> lot<00:04:37.840> of<00:04:37.870> ruts<00:04:38.140> so<00:04:38.410> I<00:04:38.620> think

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
many races with a lot of ruts so I think

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.850 
many races with a lot of ruts so I think
the<00:04:39.280> more<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:39.760> better<00:04:39.790> I<00:04:40.030> just<00:04:40.530> it's<00:04:41.530> nice<00:04:41.710> to
