 that's stupid i 'm never what's going on 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.410
 shorts may need ours 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.649
 rewritten evolutionary history 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.410
 become 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.090
 researchers have the genome of a 400,000 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.040
 years old only people decoded 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.780
 and are looking forward to something completely unexpected 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.760
 result encountered the remains of this 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.920
 primitive man became in the 90's in 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.380
 the cave sima dallas resorts in the north 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.490
 Spain along with that of 27 others 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.740
 found individuals 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.080
 the resort's goal is the most spectacular 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.760
 urmenschen fundstelle in europe and 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.070
 20 individuals from the cave 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.010
 Numerous features of the neanderthal on 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.000
 especially on teeth pine and 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.230
 facial surgery previously suspected 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.640
 that the fossils belong to the group of 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.570
 Neanderthals but that belongs 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.670
 Examination of the DNA of a 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.590
 thighbone by the geneticist 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.300
 matthias mayer provided for one now 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.789
 big surprise that ever the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.140
 DNA of a 400,000-year-old fossil 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.510
 could be decrypted is one 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.399
 absolute novelty it is the oldest dna 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.379
 a person who has ever been analyzed 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.539
 before that came the oldest of 100,000 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.699
 years old fossil for DNA analysis 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.590
 took meyer 2 gram bone that 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.449
 problem with the analysis of such a 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.309
 old dna is that she is in the course of 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.049
 Time continues to decompose and into small 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.060
 Fragments also decays was the sample 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.500
 with bacteria mixed with the DNA of the 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.820
 scientist contaminates the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.680
 Bone previously held in the hands 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.570
 the analysis was as if it were one 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.040
 elaborate puzzle in the part for part 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.500
 must be reassembled 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.570
 but about 98 of them succeeded in research 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.979
 to reconstruct primeval DNA 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.110
 it is the mitochondrial 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.610
 dna not in the nucleus but in the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.740
 mitochondrial power plants of the cell to 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.240
 stored is the mitochondrial dna 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.880
 are comparable to dna of the cell nucleus 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.500
 easier to win as there are many copies 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.000
 from her in the cell meyer has the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.070
 obtained dna sequence with that of 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.360
 modern neanderthal man of the 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.950
 denisova people and that chimpanzee 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.770
 compared and then came the big one 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.960
 Surprise the genome does not look like 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.909
 suspects the Neanderthals instead 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.530
 it resembles the denisova man of 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.870
 dna was only three years ago in the 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.190
 denisova cave in 7 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.510
 Previous found was previously suspected 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.360
 that the descendants of our African 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.190
 ancestors about 300,000 years ago 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.960
 determined to leave africa 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.730
 the theory natzungen the neanderthal 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.440
 at that time to west direction Europe 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.720
 while the iso was moved to east 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.550
 therefore, the dna result now made for 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.290
 general amazement and excitement 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.210
 because then they would never have that 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.160
 and the neanderthals at the same time 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.690
 lived in spain that would turn 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.280
 mean that the theory that the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.840
 denisova at the time only in 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.310
 Asian space have stopped 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.110
 there is, however, wrong 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.790
 various explanations for 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.350
 the given dna result the 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.240
 very first everyone knows the im 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.710
 that's good 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.540
 doubt the result of the experiment 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.770
 that makes sense in this case 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.630
 at the results other the 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.400
 mitochondrial DNA is determined 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.110
 concrete information is only the 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.580
 Cellular analysis This can be done at the time 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.410
 but not on the found bones 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.390
 be done because as so old and 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.460
 are porous and only a small cell nucleus dna 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.690
 contain the second possible explanation 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.340
 is that it is then the 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.990
 denisova is the first in 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.250
 before they live 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.210
 to siberia on 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.340
 but you have that for 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.660
 unlikely because things go that way 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.610
 but then at the same time in the same 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.650
 should have lived together 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.390
 without merging genetically 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.100
 So still variant 3 can bones 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.720
 from the last common ancestors 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.250
 of neanderthals and denisov people 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.959
 This was definitely going to explain that 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.730
 why the cema de los reyes relic the 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.950
 neanderthal have similar features 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.660
 and last but not least, a solution proposal 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.550
 Number four could be one 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.890
 act mysterious immigrants 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.840
 Elian that would mean that 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.709
 it is a hitherto unknown 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.090
 group of people gave in both 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.010
 Spain as well as to Siberia 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.239
 immigrated they mixed with the 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.100
 spanish early humans and 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.300
 thus left their dna the 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.950
 is also the Neanderthal 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.840
 physique with the din iso was dna 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.550
 explain fact is that this dna 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.989
 result lets the researchers puzzle and 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.120
 in further investigations maybe 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.370
 our evolutionary history 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.080
 must be rewritten or expanded 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.640
 here variant appears on 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.140
 most likely and you believe that 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.060
 there are many more human species 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.470
 gave as previously known write us there 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.909
 where it belongs in the comments if 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.470
 you find such science topics cool 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.909
 then know or share it with us 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.440
 the video over there are like you two 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:52.940
 more videos to share here you can 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.260
 subscribe to us there is even the want 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.629
 at the bottom there is facebook twitter and 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.120
 instagram that was what shorts and shorts are about 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:01.129
 We're going to dig now 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.489
 I do not want to dig anymore 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.489
 seethes
