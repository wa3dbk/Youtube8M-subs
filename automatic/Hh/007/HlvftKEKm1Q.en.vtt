that they have I mean it's 21 cycles so

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.310 
that they have I mean it's 21 cycles so
it's<00:01:17.400> been<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> while<00:01:17.790> but<00:01:18.360> like<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.990> said<00:01:19.170> you

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
it's been a while but like you said you

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.840 
it's been a while but like you said you
know<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.439> sexual<00:01:19.950> tension<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.430> definitely

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
know the sexual tension is definitely

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.719 
know the sexual tension is definitely
heightened<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.650> it's<00:01:22.650> it's<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.979> think<00:01:23.400> it's<00:01:23.700> a

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
heightened and it's it's I think it's a

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.330 
heightened and it's it's I think it's a
better<00:01:23.850> show<00:01:24.180> obviously<00:01:25.020> I'm<00:01:25.259> biased<00:01:25.500> it's<00:01:26.280> a

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
better show obviously I'm biased it's a

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.770 
better show obviously I'm biased it's a
better<00:01:26.490> show<00:01:26.729> because<00:01:27.030> guys<00:01:27.240> are<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.600> but

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
better show because guys are on it but

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.480 
better show because guys are on it but
yeah<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:27.960> do<00:01:28.710> think<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:28.979> adds<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.189> whole<00:01:29.220> new

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
yeah I do think it adds a whole new

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.370 
yeah I do think it adds a whole new
layer<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.090> yeah<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.600> know<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.049> back<00:01:31.200> me
