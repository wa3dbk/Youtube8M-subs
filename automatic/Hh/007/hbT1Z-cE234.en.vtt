that<00:00:20.760> was<00:00:20.880> on<00:00:21.029> cars<00:00:21.330> it's<00:00:21.539> nothing<00:00:21.869> like

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
that was on cars it's nothing like

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.259 
that was on cars it's nothing like
what's<00:00:22.260> there<00:00:22.410> today<00:00:22.730> the<00:00:23.730> product<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
what's there today the product the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
technology in vehicles manufacturers are

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.170 
technology in vehicles manufacturers are
actually<00:00:26.130> doing<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.369> very<00:00:26.550> good<00:00:26.760> job<00:00:26.939> at

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
actually doing a very good job at

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.910 
actually doing a very good job at
developing<00:00:27.599> new<00:00:27.660> technologies<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.500> bringing

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
developing new technologies and bringing

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.919 
developing new technologies and bringing
that<00:00:29.039> into<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.490> automotive<00:00:29.789> space<00:00:30.060> we're

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
that into the automotive space we're

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.900 
that into the automotive space we're
constantly<00:00:31.380> updating<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.130> product<00:00:32.550> adding

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
constantly updating the product adding

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.490 
constantly updating the product adding
new<00:00:33.030> features<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.570> functions<00:00:33.930> refining

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
new features and functions refining

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.680 
new features and functions refining
things<00:00:34.710> getting<00:00:35.040> deeper<00:00:35.430> access<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.600> know

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
things getting deeper access you know

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.660 
things getting deeper access you know
really<00:00:37.050> mimicking<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.649> factory<00:00:38.309> tools<00:00:38.520> which

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
really mimicking the factory tools which

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.700 
really mimicking the factory tools which
are<00:00:38.760> much<00:00:38.940> more<00:00:39.090> expensive<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.840> mean<00:00:40.500> getting

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
are much more expensive I mean getting

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.619 
are much more expensive I mean getting
that<00:00:40.890> functionality<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:41.879> are<00:00:41.940> constantly

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
that functionality so we are constantly

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.450 
that functionality so we are constantly
evolving<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.620> updating<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.070> when<00:00:44.250> we<00:00:44.309> say

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
evolving and updating and when we say

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.190 
evolving and updating and when we say
that<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.850> revolution<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.420> Diagnostics<00:00:45.989> it

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
that it's a revolution in Diagnostics it

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.560 
that it's a revolution in Diagnostics it
is<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.590> completely<00:00:46.890> changing<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:47.910> you

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
is is completely changing it but you

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.360 
is is completely changing it but you
know<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.840> continuing<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.860> continuous

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
know it is continuing it's a continuous
