00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.010
 saga mysteries under the sea a video 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.850
 where we will show hidden things there 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.500
 under the sea in the game of gt5 good 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.349
 what we have to do is go to this point 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.460
 which marks on the map to easy to catch a 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.230
 helicopter go 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.890
 to this point here of map where 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.630
 find the submarine 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.109
 that is essential to be able to see the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.109
 low subject 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.380
 and well here we have submarine 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.380
 and we take it 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.000
 and it's right here in this part of the map 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:51.269
 that now I had wrong but here 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.269
 is the map here they are and we do not take it 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.760
 and this is her husband and now we have 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.590
 to direct to this part of the map here 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.770
 is the next mystery pulse that you 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.770
 I bring 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.640
 and we go with gray carla and above da 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.610
 my videos without him the series of 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:17.030
 awesome so it's by out 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.400
 and there we go to the bottom of the ocean to see the 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.540
 next treasure there we have a tank 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.840
 sunken from sea 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.280
 a used tank quite burst all 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.869
 rusty 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.659
 and that you do not know why he 's here 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.079
 bad is a mystery 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:36.460
 with hysteria that you stop arresting and 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.460
 well everyone has their own theories 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.930
 and I think they are 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.009
 it's a tank of the second war 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.170
 world war or the first war 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.150
 global the Japanese or something because it's 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.310
 a pretty old tank 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.290
 you can try it and it's there and look at it 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.160
 you 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.160

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.790
