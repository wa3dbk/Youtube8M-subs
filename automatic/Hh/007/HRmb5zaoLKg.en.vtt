00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.270
 First we must distinguish between 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.940
 simple put on guard to various 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.950
 shows later if you notice a 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.200
 speed of movements outside of what 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.660
 common and insistence on following a 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.030
 victim you are in the presence of true 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.920
 elections if you see that you are in a 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.080
 state of shock where not in other 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.930
 combinations in your greater body 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:52.960
 pigmentation and more tired movements 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.960
 Dear is a simple sports wench 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.030
 multiple species that not all lack 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.730
 of an element that could convert them 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.800
 before, it is truly a danger 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.930
 teeth 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.119
 some of them have certain thorns 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.330
 dorsal but his role is more defensive 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.330
 how offensive 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.130
 if in your case you have fish extremely 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.440
 Aggressive toilets can be assisted more 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.830
 be from fins very sought after or 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.220
 torn attacks incessant stress 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.380
 excessive lack of appetite until the 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.840
 death either by all factors 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.040
 mentioned or have become 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.040
 the food of the prey 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.640
 without the cause of the attacks that continue 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.070
 if you walk hierarchy attacks 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.619
 will end nationally once 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.620
 that the pscl has established has dominated 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.840
 to the rest of the group 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.960
 the predominant will then receive his 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.830
 gratification better access to food to 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.420
 the females decide their two spaces etc 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.150
 the most dominated aquarium fish 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.560
 will grow possibly more slowly and 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.760
 will have fewer opportunities to 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.460
 reproductions 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.590
 but if the cause receives the vocation my 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.760
 territory of territorial crises and 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.950
 sanitary 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.050
 aggressions will interest at least 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.390
 While the lending is due to attend 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.030
 the so many of his relatives by which 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.660
 they consider this super existing this 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.880
 problem is accentuated more and more 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.800
 and we did get the bonus of 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.630
 residential sector victims 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.280
 next we present you a video 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.280
 demonstrative of the mind 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.770
 or not 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.650
 1 which is too small 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.020
 Dominant fish interact 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.790
 constantly with certain this 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:33.780
 It generates a provocation and aggression 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.480
 and the aquarium houses one or several 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.220
 predators 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.069
 remember that the predatory species 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.810
 they are solitary species that come their 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.900
 companions the only thing that no more in the 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.909
 aquarium but as your breakfast meal or 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.299
 be depending on the sheet on which 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.299
 attack 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.549
 and compatibility of male stores 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.790
 for example in the case of moles 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.860
 which is peaceful if we introduce in the 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.349
 aquarium males for only one female 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.260
 the incessant attacks between them are 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:11.239
 guaranteed the right ratio is of 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.239
 three females for each male 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:18.210
 4 incompatibility of species 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.340
 without quiet spices like 

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:23.920
 Japanese with territorial fish like 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.200
 the repairs you will have great results 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.030
 he always asks if the fish he has 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.430
 I feel aquariums are compatible with the 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.990
 fish that you are about to buy that is a great 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.580
 advice number 5 incompatibility of 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.770
 space of nothing 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.500
 there are species that stay swimming 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.289
 on the flat half surface or bottom of the 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.150
 aquarium the opportunities to develop 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.860
 aggressions is growing due to 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.289
 Increased competition for space 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.199
 if you have many fish swimming in the 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:54.729
 same space and height of the aquarium 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.830
 will cause friction that will become 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.400
 brutal fights over the claim of the 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.400
 space 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:07.250
 6 introduction of new species in a 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.229
 aquarium already well established the last 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.860
 fish on arrival is considered 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:14.990
 generally as an intruder it is sometimes 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.710
 It is necessary to plan the introduction of 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.110
 fish based on this parameter 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.960
 This also applies if you start 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.270
 introduce was momentarily 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.820
 displaced in another aquarium can be by 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.580
 the treatment of some disease 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.610
 you may have already lost your site in the 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:37.350
 hierarchy and be considered as a 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.350
 intruder for his former companions 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.980
 7 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.840
 a very high temperature in the aquarium 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:47.320
 when increasing the temperature in the aquarium 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.420
 we accelerate the metabolism of fish 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.790
 causing greater appetite we want the 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.550
 controlled contributes to greater 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.320
 aggressions so we can think of 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.260
 lower the temperature according to the 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.560
 appropriate levels for each species a 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:06.730
 Average temperature is 24 a 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.730
 27 degrees centigrade 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:13.420
 in short how we can avoid 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.210
 aggressions in our aquarium 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.460
 You have to inform yourself about the 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.950
 needs of each of the species 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:24.880
 what are you going to write after empty and 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:26.800
 temperature and temperament you have to 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.650
 have a large volume in their 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.740
 aquarium the older the port 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:35.550
 much better since the small props 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.260
 they concentrate aggressions 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.050
 you have to take into account that 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:42.990
 there are predatory species 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:46.830
 that they can only be alone as a couple or 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:49.009
 in a group you have to respect the relationship 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:52.639
 male and female 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:55.460
 The more males you have 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:58.849
 more problems are going to have 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:01.849
 in matters of aggression 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:05.119
 you must not overpopulate 

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:07.849
 you must install a good decoration and a 

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:11.409
 good planted if possible that will help 

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:14.050
 to have hiding places for the fish besides 

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:16.309
 they play a very important role since 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:19.069
 generate certain divisions in the 

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:21.910
 aquariums and that allows having land or 

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:24.070
 territories of each fish 

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.680
 you must have species that occupy 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:28.930
 different levels of which as already 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.180
 what we had said is that nothing in 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:35.650
 the surface of the aquarium in the middle of 

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:37.870
 aquarium and in the lower part of the aquarium 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:41.009
 taking into account and procuring the 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.009
 balance of the same 

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:47.150
 and if the taste video please 

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:50.650
 subscribe and share it with your friends 

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.650
 they would help us a lot
