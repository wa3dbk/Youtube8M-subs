00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 we normally don't like it 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.750
 asked and let's go shit go 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.000
 he liked to tread I don't know why not 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:22.920
 I can make a sentence but because I play 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:24.449
 fibrous iori i am pieces today i am here 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.109
 to present you a new one 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.199
 today's mod is the et c'est mod 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.340
 we immediately started the fad today 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.200
 developed by an Italian modder ie 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.480
 giannuzzo this way the Italian has 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.140
 used the baskets in a way 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.960
 innovative 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.539
 let's see what it is then we place 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.530
 a basket and we fill it with whatever 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:53.100
 object 123 we never put ourselves in anything else 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.399
 but let's take a bit of pistons 11 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.809
 Professor, let's put it in case now 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.420
 let's go for a wonderful action 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.730
 ie shift and right button 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.580
 you see that the basket is apparently 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.700
 disappeared and a new one appeared on the left 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.080
 bar the certain but in truth it is not 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.520
 disappeared where it ended so much has taken away 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.380
 I have to be careful now because if a 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.420
 new too much ends badly goes well it is 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.960
 arrived on our head we can 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.570
 then bring the basket over ours 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.939
 head and then have an inventory 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.829
 extra very, very nice though 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.960
 exaggerate they wanted to die I have to go 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.369
 pretty plain let's see what 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.590
 what is there now if I go 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.250
 in the known inventory that instead of 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.900
 cap or this chest ok first shift 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.270
 I can see all the contents of the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.090
 this basket is something really beautiful then 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.649
 Now what do we do for example? 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.450
 basket I want to place it on the ground 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.030
 because I don't want to take it with me anymore 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.799
 what do I do right key shift to earth 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.649
 and as you can see, position the basket 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.899
 place the basket and if I open it I find it 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.040
 still all the objects that were there 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.229
 before 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.020
 it's practically a portable inventory 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.000
 but a particularity of this inventing 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.660
 can be lost let's see how 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.730
 the tac bar I knew because I have 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.550
 looked on purpose on the ground but without 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.560
 want 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.030
 a moron we are going to fill it with 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.600
 new 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.240
 ok we take it in the lead 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.820
 here we must be really calm here 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.490
 bar practically what it indicates is a 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.380
 altimeter in quotes because if we 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.930
 let's look up practically 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.700
 let's unbalance the basket then more 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.490
 we make it unbalanced the more there is the 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.000
 probability that the basket will fall if me 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.460
 arrival of the red part of the boom basket 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.100
 it falls and therefore I lose all the objects 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.560
 if instead the basket remains in the green 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.690
 remains stable and nothing happens 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.230
 a way not to lose the basket is 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.720
 use the shift i first shift mi 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.720
 i look like you see around upstairs below 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.060
 but the basket does not fall this because there 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.500
 lets maybe if we have a jump from 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.740
 do and watch where we are going 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.570
 to avoid making unpleasant falls 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.880
 or to lose all the content 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.250
 maybe dying with falling damage 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.740
 so with shift we can probe the 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:19.330
 territory to see then ours 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:22.239
 moves to make so now we put 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.370
 the view in half so we avoid falling 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.010
 another thing we don't have to 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.050
 run if I start running see 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.750
 that the blue bar is filled and the coffin is filled 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.180
 view fills tac to do everything then 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.140
 we must also walk 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.150
 so it's really interesting 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.830
 because it takes advantage of these two features 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.190
 that were never used before 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:45.190
 minecraft ie we say type a sensor 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.860
 ok so i have to walk go slow 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.170
 be careful where I go too 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:55.209
 I am wrong and I look for a moment 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:57.940
 earth bam falls everything you have seen we have 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.340
 this blue bar but that helps us that is 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.980
 if he points out that we are watching 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.870
 for too long on the ground for example 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.430
 too high look at awards on the ground 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.040
 fills up slowly I have some 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.380
 second to raise it but be careful that 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.940
 if you go that way and amanda the south too 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.370
 you end up doing this 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.410
 play upstairs only below 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.450
 but as you can see, you succeed well in 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.280
 manage it ie you have an inventory 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.500
 portable and let's say that 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.600
 the mechanics were very, very beautiful 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.090
 of use and I recommend you do not run 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.910
 because otherwise you lose all the fashion of 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.240
 today was this giannuzzo also said 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.280
 that will introduce machinery to put 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.800
 in the lead, so let's say he will do the fad 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.750
 therefore also compatible with other fashions 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.080
 we could carry machinery and head 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.150
 other baskets and many other things boys 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.480
 he also chose to make this new one 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.860
 what I have reviewed as many as 400 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.590
 fashions approx 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.930
 many have been updated and maybe up 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.510
 shout ok so with new additions 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.970
 many other things maybe I'll do too 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.610
 some way that I've already done that though 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.940
 as the user continues to grow there 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.770
 maybe they are new ones, well let's see 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.290
 also to bring to their fashions that not 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.180
 have ever seen and maybe with a graphic 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.160
 and one of a better than in the past 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.770
 so I could also do old ones again 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.310
 reviews of fashions that have been 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.220
 improved 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.350
 so guys, as always, I invite you 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.610
 to leave a nice like to the 1100 likes 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.290
 I will publish a new fashion 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.660
