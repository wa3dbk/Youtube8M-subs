 fundamental from the beginning to second 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:01.859
 of the importance of the mission 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.110
 we will have to choose carefully which one 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.170
 agent also use in relation to 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.850
 a functional growth path 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.799
 although the third person view of the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.479
 control of the two supports recall in 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.640
 obvious way ghost recon advanced

 for adequate planning the pace 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.430
 In any case, gambling is anything but 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.439
 sternly the enemies alternate without 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.969
 stop regulated by a fetus intelligence

 immobility or elections set in the 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.549
 the fate of the comrades therefore depends 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.320
 from our decisions 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.679
 reminding us that once out of the game 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.090
 we can say goodbye to them forever 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:47.070
 the parterre is definitely interesting 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.780
 skills that improve level 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.210

 action the playful experience changes 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.219
 so depending on who we carry 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.079
 behind 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.810

 replay value luca marin has multiple times 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.439

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.450
 a challenge level rather 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.450
 challenging 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.590
 on the technical front, the technology in RAI 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.230
 in the outline a scenario without drops of 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.260
 decorous framerate on the front and texture 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.640
 with good cues for the particulates 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.380
 suggestive the retro setting is a 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.850
 so vivid use of colors for 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.650
 recreate the new sixties style

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.240
 will make the happiness of those in search of 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.890
 more demanding challenges than usual 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.510
 certainly moves away and not at tip of 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.470
 feet from the very wide-ranging project 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.480
 three years ago 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.280
 what is definitely left for me 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.630
 more dry and more concrete product 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.730
 prone to blast and tone phases 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.590
 tactics that the phantom exploration 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.420
 of an iconographic universe 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.130
 despite this new tool x.com 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.020
 which in hands remains a rich shooter 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.500
 of character and basics rather 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.500
 solid 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.260
