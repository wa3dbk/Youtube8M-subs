the fly I'm going to tie today is the
humungousaur<00:00:19.030> de<00:00:19.270> pattern<00:00:19.630> which<00:00:20.170> is

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199 
humungousaur de pattern which is

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.439 
humungousaur de pattern which is
enjoying<00:00:20.920> something<00:00:21.340> of<00:00:21.610> a<00:00:21.699> revival<00:00:22.060> at<00:00:22.330> the

implies a turn feed upside down that way

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.960 
implies a turn feed upside down that way
the<00:01:33.510> fly<00:01:33.840> will<00:01:34.290> swim<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:35.040> right<00:01:35.280> whale<00:01:37.970> now

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
the fly will swim the right whale now

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.610 
the fly will swim the right whale now
what<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.180> would<00:01:39.480> suggest<00:01:39.690> you<00:01:40.020> do<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:40.500> you're

what I would suggest you do if you're
going<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.800> tie<00:01:40.980> half<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.580> dump<00:01:41.790> these<00:01:41.940> up

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
going to tie half it just dump these up

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.590 
going to tie half it just dump these up
you<00:01:43.410> put<00:01:43.680> do<00:01:43.920> half<00:01:44.190> a<00:01:44.310> dozen<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:45.120> put<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> eyes

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
you put do half a dozen and put the eyes

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.690 
you put do half a dozen and put the eyes
on<00:01:45.630> first<00:01:46.170> like<00:01:46.410> this<00:01:46.650> give<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.550> good

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
on first like this give it a good

half of this ISM in hand and then tar

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.340 
half of this ISM in hand and then tar
the<00:01:53.100> Flies<00:01:53.310> but<00:01:54.180> we<00:01:54.300> can't<00:01:54.510> do<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.780> today

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
the Flies but we can't do that today

it's<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.450> lot<00:02:27.630> more<00:02:27.810> life<00:02:28.019> if<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.500> keep<00:02:28.709> it

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
it's a lot more life if you keep it

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.120
