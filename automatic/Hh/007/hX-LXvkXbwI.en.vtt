opportunity when you arrived over in

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.110

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
the conditions were a lot different than

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.310 
the conditions were a lot different than
what<00:01:02.070> we<00:01:02.190> had<00:01:02.309> expected<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:03.329> infrastructure

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
what we had expected the infrastructure

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.219 
what we had expected the infrastructure
for<00:01:04.409> bikes<00:01:04.920> really<00:01:05.280> was<00:01:05.489> non-existent<00:01:06.229> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
for bikes really was non-existent the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.810 
for bikes really was non-existent the
deal<00:01:07.439> over<00:01:07.710> there<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.130> most<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
deal over there is that most of the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.070 
deal over there is that most of the
population<00:01:09.240> will<00:01:09.479> never<00:01:09.659> be<00:01:09.810> able<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.020> afford

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
population will never be able to afford

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.010 
population will never be able to afford
a<00:01:10.439> private<00:01:10.590> car<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.790> public<00:01:12.060> transit<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.720> is

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
a private car the public transit is is

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.710 
a private car the public transit is is
really<00:01:13.740> nothing<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.159> speak<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.299> that

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
really nothing to speak of so that

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.390 
really nothing to speak of so that
leaves<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.170> really<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.530> only<00:01:16.650> option<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.340> to

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
leaves the really the only option is to

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.210 
leaves the really the only option is to
travel<00:01:17.640> around<00:01:17.850> by<00:01:18.060> foot<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:19.950> really

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
travel around by foot and and we really

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.310 
travel around by foot and and we really
saw<00:01:20.400> an<00:01:20.549> amazingly<00:01:21.060> small<00:01:21.630> number<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.049> bikes

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
saw an amazingly small number of bikes

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.039 
saw an amazingly small number of bikes
so<00:01:23.159> when<00:01:23.400> we<00:01:23.580> saw<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.659> difference<00:01:24.990> we

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
so when we saw that the difference we

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.710 
so when we saw that the difference we
could<00:01:25.200> make<00:01:25.409> by<00:01:25.619> by<00:01:26.280> teaching<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.390> dealers

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
could make by by teaching the dealers

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.910 
could make by by teaching the dealers
over<00:01:27.930> there<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.200> way<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.470> we<00:01:28.560> do<00:01:28.740> business
