00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:53.500
 in during the last two weeks or that 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.629
 the xbox world sdk console is marine 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.629
 know it 's decade means kit 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.609
 development has errors but 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.239
 surely these mistakes are not 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.710
 serious 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.220
 he arrived the day before yesterday he told you news where 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:12.540
 there was a rumor that a screenshot errors 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.700
 being the console and this rumor these 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.020
 news have expanded greatly in 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.479
 the world of video games already have 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.340
 penis not planning director 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.740
 xbox product has jumped to the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.009
 network and to make it clear that 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.990
 the boys and the brothers said what 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.149
 what are people saying forgiveness are 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.580
 common mistakes of these kits 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.220
 development and that nothing is serious 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.110
 currently neither dramatic and if not 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.479
 textually as always his words 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.179
 a phenomenon of the 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.000
 pretty strange network and everything is being 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.860
 caused by the existing frenzy with 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.220
 so many news and rumors that are 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.590
 doubling the logic and the reason we are to 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.659
 a month of launching of xbox world and the 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.729
 people are working hard to polish 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.770
 the last details there is still a 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.299
 lots of things to do but I'm 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.789
 sure that it is only found in the 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.850
 that same situation has told me the 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.909
 poison 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.909
 my conclusion about that console 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.870
 they have errors this is something that no longer 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.440
 can hide we hope that these 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:21.670
 errors in a final version do not exist 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.430
 and I think they should not when 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.440
 make a mistake you should not put the 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.540
 competition for the environment if so 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.280
 Do you want me to say you do not 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.730
 find her in a situation because no 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.730
 you know 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.870
 from microsoft when you say that they 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.630
 they will be the same but that which gives more 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.640
 to people I my personal opinion already 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.850
 I have said a lot of comments 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.540
 my first option was to buy the four 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.580
 first and then the xbox xbox sorry 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.600
 but for now I recommend waiting for a 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:59.160
 couple of months a couple of months to great 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.410
 extension feels for the consoles 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.120
 can settle down and see what kind of 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.990
 errors are coming out as they work 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.990
 the consoles 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.720
 because people are going to be very much 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.210
 money in a person mixer and is worth the 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.810
 it's worth choosing what you're going to 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.810
 find him 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.190
 See you at the next
