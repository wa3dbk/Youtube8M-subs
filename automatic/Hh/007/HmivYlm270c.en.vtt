much<00:01:00.660> all<00:01:00.870> summer<00:01:01.050> it's<00:01:01.320> pretty<00:01:01.530> tough<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.890> do

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
much all summer it's pretty tough to do

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.369 
much all summer it's pretty tough to do
and<00:01:03.270> try<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.510> race<00:01:03.719> with<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.019> Sprint<00:01:04.260> Car

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.200 
and try to race with the Sprint Car
Series<00:01:04.769> but<00:01:04.979> around<00:01:05.519> home<00:01:05.760> I'll<00:01:05.909> get<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.119> do

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
Series but around home I'll get to do

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.210 
Series but around home I'll get to do
probably<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.600> dozen<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.990> 15<00:01:07.350> races<00:01:07.530> maybe<00:01:07.979> and

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
probably a dozen to 15 races maybe and

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.010 
probably a dozen to 15 races maybe and
we'll<00:01:08.310> see<00:01:08.549> they<00:01:09.540> haven't<00:01:09.689> got<00:01:09.930> their

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
we'll see they haven't got their

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.480 
we'll see they haven't got their
schedules<00:01:10.439> out<00:01:10.560> for<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.770> tracks<00:01:11.010> around<00:01:11.310> home

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
schedules out for the tracks around home

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.210 
schedules out for the tracks around home
so<00:01:12.200> time<00:01:13.200> will<00:01:13.350> tell<00:01:13.470> but<00:01:13.530> I'm<00:01:13.770> guessing<00:01:14.100> it'll

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
so time will tell but I'm guessing it'll

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.010 
so time will tell but I'm guessing it'll
be<00:01:14.310> somewhere<00:01:14.549> between<00:01:14.729> 12<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.150> 15<00:01:15.299> races<00:01:15.869> and

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
be somewhere between 12 and 15 races and

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.660 
be somewhere between 12 and 15 races and
then<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.650> know<00:01:16.740> towards<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> fall<00:01:17.430> when

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
then you know towards the fall when

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.940 
then you know towards the fall when
we're<00:01:18.420> not<00:01:18.509> racing<00:01:18.840> as<00:01:18.960> much<00:01:19.110> maybe<00:01:19.350> we'll<00:01:19.530> be

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
we're not racing as much maybe we'll be

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.020 
we're not racing as much maybe we'll be
able<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.130> go<00:01:20.220> out<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.430> do<00:01:20.490> some<00:01:20.640> more<00:01:20.729> races

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030
