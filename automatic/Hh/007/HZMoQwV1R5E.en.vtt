00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Jens and I are here in Valencia today 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.529
 and we drive the new convertible from 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.529
 citroen that the s 3 cabriolet 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.699
 that meant really good with us is the 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:42.780
 thp 155 356 ps not quite as fast 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:48.399
 noticed racing 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:53.649
 but that gets three different 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:54.790
 Configurations there is the roof that was 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.720
 the first 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.720
 a bit more 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.750
 the last rest you still have to 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.860
 do it manually 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.860
 This serves to pinch protection 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.350
 and now I'm sitting on the back 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:24.509
 even a mother in law releasing the space 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.859
 ds3 as a convertible is a five-seater me 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.280
 personally would say 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:30.479
 four people can ride here 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.490
 Of course, it is really comfortable for two 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.740
 no question and that's it 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.959
 in the opinion of the as a target group 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.450
 for this vehicle headroom behind 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:41.159
 is a bit thin therefore just say 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.599
 legroom, too, but I can sit 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.030
 So I'm not right now 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:47.189
 squeezed in and have in mine 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.989
 previous sitting position in front of course 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.000
 A mass of space belongs that I could 

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:54.239
 here before the pieces press and guests 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.590
 a bit more comfortable but also longer 

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:57.299
 stretch how to do that I believe myself 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.619
 of course, at the touch of a button, I could 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.920
 Of course, headroom says something 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.659
 enlarge 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.810
 Of course the problem is to say that 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.450
 just because cabriolet now, of course 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.420
 Rear people are full in the wind and 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.010
 the wind deflector reminds us of that 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:21.859
 Do not even clean windshields 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.859
 really much or seltmann school 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.290
 small problem what this cable, however 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.609
 has the roof is down 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.739
 you look a bit behind there 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:33.810
 is it just three behind jan 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.500
 you do not see in the rearview mirror anymore 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.940
 really much 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.230
 that's just the problem all around 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.000
 that's just not given 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.620
 will probably still be in germany 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.419
 less effort to achieve valencia 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.609
 spain where you have to constantly be a star 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:46.169
 that some corner led especially 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:53.700
 Citroen is proud of the new ones 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:55.470
 3d in the trunk there is the 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.090
 little one drinks what 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.820
 I can not turn my head around now 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.120
 first, something has to open up 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.120
 shut down 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.520
 as if by magic the trunk and 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.520
 go upstairs 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.510
 small flap much behind it 250 liters 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.510
 trunk 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.210
 so one of his class is 4 500 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.280
 and mini cooper convertible number one 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:27.830
 a beverage box is not here 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.830
 but for that 31 usually comes 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:53.909
 your conclusion I am quite pleased 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.829
 fourth car now 255 ps machine 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:59.319
 you can drive open without it too 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:02.500
 I am not completely disturbed yet 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.510
 sure so I think the roof rooms are 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.799
 relatively thick and I finish on the 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.900
 have a page on the other side 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.090
 I but the beautiful free look that 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.439
 I like it well, I have to do that even more 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.079
 let's act on us we are the car 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:15.489
 now 34 hours driven so right 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.139
 I can not deliver a conclusion 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.239
 it definitely makes fun so here 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.729
 We are drove we had a lot 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.539
 fun I think the breath because I hope 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.539
 that barely a bit over
