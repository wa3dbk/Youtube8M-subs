00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.240 
basically two new colors one old color
and<00:01:35.820> then<00:01:35.939> one<00:01:36.450> sort<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.110> modded<00:01:37.680> or<00:01:37.860> glitched

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
and then one sort of modded or glitched

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.950 
and then one sort of modded or glitched
color<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.180> think<00:01:39.329> we<00:01:39.420> get<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.659> right<00:01:39.780> into

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
color but I think we get in right into

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.020 
color but I think we get in right into
the<00:01:40.049> first<00:01:40.409> color<00:01:40.650> from<00:01:40.890> cool<00:01:41.220> simha's<00:01:41.790> guy

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
the first color from cool simha's guy

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.050 
the first color from cool simha's guy
and<00:01:42.390> he<00:01:43.350> calls<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.770> maple<00:01:44.340> syrup<00:01:44.759> which<00:01:44.909> I

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
and he calls it maple syrup which I

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.240 
and he calls it maple syrup which I
actually<00:01:45.119> like<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.840> name<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:47.100> make

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
actually like the name of it and to make

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.130 
actually like the name of it and to make
it<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.430> want<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.729> put<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.970> metallic<00:01:48.329> wine<00:01:48.810> red

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.469 
it you want to put a metallic wine red

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
either way both of them look pretty cool

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.560 
either way both of them look pretty cool
and<00:01:58.369> you<00:01:59.369> know<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.759> is<00:01:59.909> an<00:02:00.090> interesting

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
and you know this is an interesting

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.010 
and you know this is an interesting
color<00:02:00.780> it's<00:02:01.170> not<00:02:01.939> necessarily<00:02:02.939> flashy<00:02:03.509> you

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
color it's not necessarily flashy you

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.020 
color it's not necessarily flashy you
know<00:02:04.320> obviously<00:02:04.890> you're<00:02:05.280> not<00:02:05.399> gonna<00:02:05.579> see<00:02:05.909> it

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
know obviously you're not gonna see it

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.639 
know obviously you're not gonna see it
it's<00:02:06.210> not<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.479> one<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.659> those<00:02:06.780> neon<00:02:07.170> colors

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
it's not like one of those neon colors

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.589 
it's not like one of those neon colors
but<00:02:07.920> for<00:02:08.099> being<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.429> sort<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.789> brownish<00:02:09.119> color

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
but for being a sort of brownish color

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.420 
but for being a sort of brownish color
you<00:02:10.379> know<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.530> actually<00:02:10.739> think<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.220> looks

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
you know I actually think it looks

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.070 
you know I actually think it looks
pretty<00:02:11.670> good<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.420> don't<00:02:12.480> know<00:02:12.690> what<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
pretty good and I don't know what the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.580 
pretty good and I don't know what the
best

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
best

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.839 
best
are<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.739> use<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:13.980> on<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.190> mean<00:02:14.370> obviously<00:02:14.730> as

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
are to use this on I mean obviously as

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.400 
are to use this on I mean obviously as
you<00:02:14.940> can<00:02:15.060> see<00:02:15.209> it<00:02:15.450> looks<00:02:15.629> pretty<00:02:15.780> decent<00:02:16.110> on

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
you can see it looks pretty decent on

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.089 
you can see it looks pretty decent on
the<00:02:16.500> zentorno

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
the zentorno

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.160 
the zentorno
but<00:02:17.610> honestly<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.180> think<00:02:18.300> like<00:02:18.599> out<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.750> all<00:02:18.959> the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
but honestly I think like out of all the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.690 
but honestly I think like out of all the
Browns<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:19.830> we've<00:02:19.950> done<00:02:20.099> this<00:02:20.280> one<00:02:20.489> might<00:02:20.670> be

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
Browns that we've done this one might be

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:40.870 
Browns that we've done this one might be
one<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.300> better-looking<00:02:21.660> ones

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.580 

and<00:02:41.880> then<00:02:42.270> moving<00:02:42.510> on<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.900> next<00:02:43.080> color<00:02:43.260> we

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
and then moving on to the next color we

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.390 
and then moving on to the next color we
have<00:02:43.890> Heineken<00:02:44.820> green<00:02:45.390> from<00:02:45.900> X<00:02:46.200> ill<00:02:46.500> child<00:02:46.980> and

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
have Heineken green from X ill child and

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.760 
have Heineken green from X ill child and
to<00:02:48.030> make<00:02:48.210> this<00:02:48.360> one<00:02:48.570> again<00:02:48.840> pretty<00:02:49.140> simple<00:02:49.560> put

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
to make this one again pretty simple put

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.050 
to make this one again pretty simple put
a<00:02:49.800> dark<00:02:50.370> green<00:02:50.790> metallic<00:02:51.210> with<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.660> lime<00:02:52.260> green

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
a dark green metallic with a lime green

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.010 
a dark green metallic with a lime green
pearlescent<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.240> this<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:54.600> an<00:02:54.720> interesting

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
pearlescent and this is an interesting

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.840 
pearlescent and this is an interesting
green<00:02:55.500> color<00:02:55.770> I<00:02:55.980> really<00:02:56.340> think<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.640> dark

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
green color I really think the dark

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.490 
green color I really think the dark
green<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.360> lime<00:02:57.540> green<00:02:57.810> complement<00:02:58.440> each

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
green and the lime green complement each

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.450 
green and the lime green complement each
other<00:02:58.680> really<00:02:58.770> well

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
other really well

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.490 
other really well
especially<00:03:00.270> when<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.510> sunlight<00:03:00.750> hits<00:03:00.930> on<00:03:01.350> it

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
especially when the sunlight hits on it

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.230 
especially when the sunlight hits on it
you<00:03:01.620> can<00:03:01.800> you<00:03:02.100> really<00:03:02.370> see<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.700> lime<00:03:02.940> green

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
you can you really see the lime green

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.240 
you can you really see the lime green
stand<00:03:03.570> out<00:03:03.750> which<00:03:04.020> I<00:03:04.230> like<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.680> colors<00:03:05.070> that

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
stand out which I like the colors that

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.520 
stand out which I like the colors that
sort<00:03:05.490> of<00:03:05.550> do<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:05.940> but<00:03:06.570> overall<00:03:06.900> if<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.290> like

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
sort of do that but overall if you like

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.470 
sort of do that but overall if you like
green<00:03:07.710> and<00:03:07.980> you<00:03:08.070> want<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.460> different<00:03:09.030> sort<00:03:09.390> of

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
green and you want a different sort of

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.090 
green and you want a different sort of
green<00:03:09.720> that's<00:03:09.960> you<00:03:10.230> know<00:03:10.320> relatively<00:03:10.860> cheap

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
green that's you know relatively cheap

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.180 
green that's you know relatively cheap
and<00:03:11.310> relatively<00:03:11.970> easy<00:03:12.300> to<00:03:12.510> make<00:03:12.660> then<00:03:13.290> this<00:03:13.980> is

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
and relatively easy to make then this is

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:29.330 
and relatively easy to make then this is
the<00:03:14.490> perfect<00:03:14.730> one<00:03:15.060> for<00:03:15.090> you

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340
