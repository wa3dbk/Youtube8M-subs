see<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.560> taking<00:00:22.859> damage<00:00:23.010> right<00:00:23.310> out<00:00:23.490> by<00:00:23.670> the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
see is taking damage right out by the

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.519 
see is taking damage right out by the
mortars<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.600> I'm<00:00:24.810> pretty<00:00:25.019> much<00:00:25.230> going<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.470> do

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
mortars and I'm pretty much going to do

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.410 
mortars and I'm pretty much going to do
this<00:00:25.650> with<00:00:26.070> every<00:00:26.490> single<00:00:26.519> troop<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.150> think<00:00:27.359> I

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
this with every single troop I think I

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.419 
this with every single troop I think I
could<00:00:27.570> pretty<00:00:27.810> start<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.230> base<00:00:28.560> with<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.400> now

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
could pretty start a base with so now

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.370 
could pretty start a base with so now
it's<00:00:29.910> heading<00:00:30.150> towards<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.510> Town<00:00:30.750> Hall<00:00:31.050> only

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
it's heading towards the Town Hall only

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.830 
it's heading towards the Town Hall only
a<00:00:31.410> few<00:00:31.710> strides<00:00:32.040> takes<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.120> beauty<00:00:33.360> Town<00:00:33.570> Hall

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
a few strides takes a beauty Town Hall

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.410 
a few strides takes a beauty Town Hall
we<00:00:33.960> have<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.079> 60%<00:00:34.530> two-star<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:36.149> thought<00:00:36.329> it

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
we have a 60% two-star and I thought it

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.760 
we have a 60% two-star and I thought it
would<00:00:36.540> be<00:00:36.630> interesting<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.110> see<00:00:37.380> how<00:00:37.590> much

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
would be interesting to see how much

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.950 
would be interesting to see how much
percentage<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.430> could<00:00:38.640> get<00:00:38.850> against<00:00:39.600> 8th<00:00:39.780> base

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
percentage I could get against 8th base

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.020 
percentage I could get against 8th base
with<00:00:40.170> max<00:00:40.559> level<00:00:40.770> troops<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.430> only<00:00:41.730> attacking

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
with max level troops and only attacking

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.799 
with max level troops and only attacking
with<00:00:42.329> one

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.690 
with one

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
to take out that Archer tower and this

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.280 
to take out that Archer tower and this
is<00:01:17.640> just<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.909> piece<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.420> cake<00:01:18.659> we<00:01:18.960> didn't<00:01:19.200> have

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
is just a piece of cake we didn't have

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.899 
is just a piece of cake we didn't have
to<00:01:19.380> use<00:01:19.530> too<00:01:19.740> many<00:01:19.830> spells<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.610> attack

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
to use too many spells on this attack

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.270 
to use too many spells on this attack
because<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.479> dragon<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.320> baller<00:01:22.590> so

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
because this dragon is just a baller so

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.679 
because this dragon is just a baller so
now<00:01:23.460> it's<00:01:23.610> going<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.790> head<00:01:23.939> towards<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.360> army

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
now it's going to head towards the army

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.690 
now it's going to head towards the army
camp<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.200> even<00:01:25.830> though<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.250> buildings<00:01:26.580> are
