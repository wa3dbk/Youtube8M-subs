here take it off

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.470 
here take it off
you<00:01:42.800> sort<00:01:43.190> of<00:01:43.250> snap<00:01:43.550> it<00:01:43.700> off<00:01:43.820> it<00:01:44.030> breaks<00:01:44.270> off

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
you sort of snap it off it breaks off

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.030 
you sort of snap it off it breaks off
basically<00:01:44.990> it<00:01:45.080> doesn't<00:01:45.230> do<00:01:45.380> much<00:01:45.530> damage<00:01:45.920> it

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
basically it doesn't do much damage it

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.920 
basically it doesn't do much damage it
just<00:01:46.190> breaks<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.580> pin<00:01:46.790> on<00:01:46.910> the<00:01:47.030> side<00:01:47.060> there<00:01:47.510> if

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
just breaks the pin on the side there if

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.000 
just breaks the pin on the side there if
you<00:01:48.020> can<00:01:48.140> do<00:01:48.260> it<00:01:48.290> without<00:01:48.470> pulling<00:01:48.710> it<00:01:48.920> apart

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
you can do it without pulling it apart

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.830 
you can do it without pulling it apart
like<00:01:49.340> I<00:01:49.520> did<00:01:49.730> I<00:01:49.790> just<00:01:50.000> basically<00:01:50.180> snapped<00:01:50.690> it

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
like I did I just basically snapped it

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.080 
like I did I just basically snapped it
off<00:01:51.070> and<00:01:52.070> it<00:01:52.340> came<00:01:52.490> off<00:01:52.550> I'll<00:01:52.760> show<00:01:52.910> in<00:01:53.030> a

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
off and it came off I'll show in a

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.820 
off and it came off I'll show in a
second<00:01:53.390> what<00:01:53.540> it<00:01:53.600> looks<00:01:53.750> like<00:01:53.900> and<00:01:54.170> then<00:01:54.740> I

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
second what it looks like and then I

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.810 
second what it looks like and then I
drilled<00:01:55.100> a<00:01:55.190> hole<00:01:55.220> through<00:01:55.700> here<00:01:56.320> too<00:01:57.580> to<00:01:58.580> match

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
drilled a hole through here too to match

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.720 
drilled a hole through here too to match
where<00:01:59.480> the<00:01:59.660> the<00:02:00.050> cam<00:02:00.290> of<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.680> camera<00:02:01.130> hole<00:02:01.280> for

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
where the the cam of the camera hole for

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.300 
where the the cam of the camera hole for
the<00:02:01.820> microphone<00:02:02.240> hole<00:02:02.450> is<00:02:02.630> on<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.900> camera<00:02:03.310> so

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
the microphone hole is on the camera so

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.690 
the microphone hole is on the camera so
in<00:02:04.430> a<00:02:04.490> little<00:02:04.580> bit<00:02:04.760> more<00:02:04.880> detail<00:02:05.210> so<00:02:05.450> basically

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
in a little bit more detail so basically

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.940 
in a little bit more detail so basically
that's<00:02:07.700> where<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.269> bit<00:02:09.080> closer<00:02:09.379> I'll<00:02:09.800> just

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
that's where the bit closer I'll just

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.740 
that's where the bit closer I'll just
get<00:02:10.129> rid<00:02:10.250> of<00:02:10.340> this<00:02:10.459> actually<00:02:11.300> now<00:02:11.450> I<00:02:11.480> can't

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
get rid of this actually now I can't

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.479 
get rid of this actually now I can't
remove<00:02:11.989> it<00:02:12.050> cause<00:02:12.260> it's<00:02:12.409> sort<00:02:12.530> of<00:02:12.620> positioned

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
remove it cause it's sort of positioned

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.290 
remove it cause it's sort of positioned
in<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.640> way<00:02:13.790> where<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.000> put<00:02:14.180> on<00:02:14.269> the<00:02:14.360> helmet<00:02:14.480> but

I<00:02:17.470> taught<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.710> somewhere<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.900> see<00:02:20.900> if<00:02:20.960> this

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
I taught you somewhere I see if this

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.700 
I taught you somewhere I see if this
works

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
works

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.590 
works
yep<00:02:23.890> yeah<00:02:24.890> yeah<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.520> think<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:26.000> that<00:02:26.330> sort<00:02:26.480> of

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
yep yeah yeah I think that that sort of

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.950 
yep yeah yeah I think that that sort of
helps<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.870> little<00:02:26.960> bit<00:02:28.630> I'm<00:02:29.630> trying<00:02:29.900> to

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
helps a little bit I'm trying to

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.990 
helps a little bit I'm trying to
position<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:30.530> to<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.130> front<00:02:31.340> here<00:02:31.520> somewhere

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.730 

don't<00:02:35.000> know<00:02:35.090> if<00:02:35.150> you<00:02:35.240> guys<00:02:35.420> can<00:02:35.600> see<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:36.020> like

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
don't know if you guys can see it like

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.380 
don't know if you guys can see it like
that<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:39.340> that's<00:02:40.340> where<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.730> pin<00:02:40.940> goes<00:02:41.180> to

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
that so that's where the pin goes to

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.340 
that so that's where the pin goes to
hold<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:41.840> yellow<00:02:42.940> lock<00:02:43.940> I<00:02:44.240> basically<00:02:45.050> broke

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
hold that yellow lock I basically broke

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.070 
hold that yellow lock I basically broke
it<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:46.040> pin<00:02:46.250> came<00:02:46.460> out<00:02:46.670> bit<00:02:47.570> of<00:02:47.690> this<00:02:47.780> broke

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
it the pin came out bit of this broke

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.330 
it the pin came out bit of this broke
here<00:02:48.320> doesn't<00:02:48.650> really<00:02:48.770> make<00:02:48.980> make<00:02:49.310> a

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
here doesn't really make make a

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.360 
here doesn't really make make a
difference<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:49.970> then<00:02:50.720> this<00:02:51.320> whole<00:02:51.650> way<00:02:52.250> of

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
difference and then this whole way of

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.870 
difference and then this whole way of
position<00:02:52.820> that<00:02:54.400> was<00:02:55.400> when<00:02:55.580> I<00:02:55.610> removed<00:02:56.060> this

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
position that was when I removed this

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.490 
position that was when I removed this
you<00:02:58.880> can<00:02:59.030> see<00:03:01.660> there's<00:03:02.660> this<00:03:02.810> bit<00:03:03.050> of<00:03:03.140> plastic

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
you can see there's this bit of plastic

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.280 
you can see there's this bit of plastic
that<00:03:03.770> little<00:03:04.010> black<00:03:04.160> plastic<00:03:04.370> in<00:03:04.670> there<00:03:05.290> it's

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
that little black plastic in there it's

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.890 
that little black plastic in there it's
like<00:03:06.410> a<00:03:06.440> rail<00:03:06.740> where<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.130> camera<00:03:07.460> sits<00:03:07.670> on<00:03:07.900> on

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
like a rail where the camera sits on on

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.890 
like a rail where the camera sits on on
the<00:03:09.050> back<00:03:09.290> you'll<00:03:09.650> see<00:03:09.740> their<00:03:10.130> screws<00:03:10.900> right

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
the back you'll see their screws right

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.360 
the back you'll see their screws right
on<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.200> back<00:03:12.350> where<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.650> tip<00:03:12.920> of<00:03:13.010> my<00:03:13.040> finger

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
on the back where the tip of my finger

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.580 
on the back where the tip of my finger
is<00:03:13.490> on<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.670> on<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.420> left<00:03:14.990> of<00:03:15.170> my<00:03:15.290> finger

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
is on the on the left of my finger

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.220 
is on the on the left of my finger
you'll<00:03:15.770> see<00:03:16.010> it<00:03:16.720> there's<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.810> there's<00:03:18.080> two

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.810 
you'll see it there's a there's two
little<00:03:18.470> screws<00:03:18.650> you<00:03:18.950> can<00:03:19.100> take<00:03:19.310> you<00:03:19.430> take<00:03:19.610> them

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
little screws you can take you take them

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.729 
little screws you can take you take them
off<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.150> this<00:03:20.750> black<00:03:20.990> thing<00:03:21.170> will<00:03:21.320> slide<00:03:21.560> out

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
off and this black thing will slide out

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.210 
off and this black thing will slide out
when<00:03:22.489> you<00:03:22.610> put<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:22.880> camera<00:03:23.120> in<00:03:23.330> there<00:03:23.590> I<00:03:24.590> just

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
when you put the camera in there I just

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.220 
when you put the camera in there I just
sort<00:03:25.670> of<00:03:25.700> put<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:26.209> in<00:03:26.270> there<00:03:26.510> try<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:26.930> figure

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
sort of put it in there try to figure

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.870 
sort of put it in there try to figure
out<00:03:27.380> how<00:03:27.770> to<00:03:27.830> look<00:03:28.010> up<00:03:28.130> from<00:03:28.340> underneath<00:03:28.550> and

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
out how to look up from underneath and

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.400 
out how to look up from underneath and
decided<00:03:29.360> okay<00:03:29.630> well<00:03:29.810> that's<00:03:29.989> where<00:03:30.140> about<00:03:30.320> the

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
decided okay well that's where about the

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.860 
decided okay well that's where about the
whole<00:03:30.590> Z<00:03:30.800> hole<00:03:31.130> is<00:03:31.370> for<00:03:31.580> the<00:03:31.670> camera<00:03:31.970> hole<00:03:32.090> and

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
whole Z hole is for the camera hole and

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.080 
whole Z hole is for the camera hole and
for<00:03:33.140> the<00:03:33.200> microphone<00:03:33.560> I<00:03:33.590> should<00:03:33.830> say<00:03:33.980> and<00:03:34.940> they

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
for the microphone I should say and they

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.610 
for the microphone I should say and they
started<00:03:35.420> drilling<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:36.020> as<00:03:36.170> you<00:03:36.260> can<00:03:36.380> see<00:03:36.500> it's

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
started drilling and as you can see it's

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.070 
started drilling and as you can see it's
a<00:03:36.680> huge<00:03:36.950> hole<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:38.060> more<00:03:38.239> I<00:03:38.300> drilled<00:03:38.660> and<00:03:38.930> more

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
a huge hole the more I drilled and more

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.810 
a huge hole the more I drilled and more
realize<00:03:39.440> I<00:03:39.560> was<00:03:39.680> off<00:03:39.830> and<00:03:40.130> I<00:03:40.190> kept<00:03:40.400> drilling<00:03:40.730> to

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
realize I was off and I kept drilling to

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.050 
realize I was off and I kept drilling to
the<00:03:40.910> point<00:03:41.150> where<00:03:41.330> it<00:03:41.870> was<00:03:42.020> big<00:03:42.230> enough<00:03:42.410> that

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
the point where it was big enough that

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.449 
the point where it was big enough that
the<00:03:44.060> hole<00:03:44.239> was<00:03:44.360> sort<00:03:44.570> of<00:03:44.630> centered<00:03:45.130> once<00:03:46.130> I<00:03:46.250> did

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
the hole was sort of centered once I did

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.000 
the hole was sort of centered once I did
that<00:03:46.930> flipped<00:03:47.930> it<00:03:48.050> upside<00:03:48.320> down<00:03:48.350> I<00:03:48.530> can<00:03:48.800> see

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
that flipped it upside down I can see

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.010 
that flipped it upside down I can see
the<00:03:49.160> hole<00:03:49.370> from<00:03:49.550> the<00:03:49.610> bottom<00:03:49.730> and<00:03:50.239> using<00:03:50.930> a

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
the hole from the bottom and using a

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.080 
the hole from the bottom and using a
drill<00:03:51.260> I<00:03:51.410> drilled<00:03:51.709> from<00:03:52.070> the<00:03:52.250> bottom<00:03:52.550> because

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
drill I drilled from the bottom because

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.820 
drill I drilled from the bottom because
you<00:03:53.180> can<00:03:53.360> see<00:03:53.540> through<00:03:53.720> it<00:03:53.780> it's<00:03:53.930> clear<00:03:54.170> and<00:03:54.380> I

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
you can see through it it's clear and I

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.540 
you can see through it it's clear and I
match<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.220> hole<00:03:55.430> and<00:03:56.050> it<00:03:57.050> pretty<00:03:57.320> much<00:03:57.550> goes

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
match the hole and it pretty much goes

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.260 
match the hole and it pretty much goes
right<00:03:58.790> through<00:03:58.820> it<00:03:59.860> and<00:04:00.860> then<00:04:01.610> I<00:04:01.820> touch<00:04:02.030> the

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
right through it and then I touch the

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.910 
right through it and then I touch the
strong<00:04:02.570> heavy<00:04:02.900> duty<00:04:03.200> velcro<00:04:03.380> on<00:04:04.010> this<00:04:04.310> side

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
strong heavy duty velcro on this side

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:14.750 
strong heavy duty velcro on this side
and<00:04:06.920> on<00:04:07.130> that<00:04:07.160> side<00:04:07.430> as<00:04:08.420> you<00:04:08.540> can<00:04:08.690> see

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.930 

so<00:04:15.569> basically<00:04:15.960> what<00:04:16.170> I've<00:04:16.260> done<00:04:16.440> is<00:04:16.760> I've<00:04:17.760> used

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
so basically what I've done is I've used

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.020 
so basically what I've done is I've used
a<00:04:18.030> Velcro<00:04:18.450> to<00:04:19.170> hold<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.739> front<00:04:19.980> cap<00:04:20.220> as<00:04:20.910> you

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
a Velcro to hold the front cap as you

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.060 
a Velcro to hold the front cap as you
can<00:04:21.120> see<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.420> holes<00:04:21.630> right<00:04:21.840> there<00:04:22.070> microphone

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
can see the holes right there microphone

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.830 
can see the holes right there microphone
goes<00:04:23.250> right<00:04:23.460> through<00:04:23.490> it<00:04:23.880> camera<00:04:24.630> stays

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
goes right through it camera stays

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.770 
goes right through it camera stays
obviously<00:04:25.260> inside<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:25.920> and<00:04:26.460> you<00:04:26.970> record<00:04:27.330> what

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
obviously inside and and you record what

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.000 
obviously inside and and you record what
I've<00:04:27.930> also<00:04:28.080> done<00:04:28.260> is<00:04:28.560> I<00:04:28.680> don't<00:04:28.830> know<00:04:28.890> if<00:04:28.950> you

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
I've also done is I don't know if you

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.100 
I've also done is I don't know if you
guys<00:04:29.130> can<00:04:29.340> see<00:04:29.520> it<00:04:29.580> too<00:04:30.420> little<00:04:30.630> holes<00:04:30.870> are

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
guys can see it too little holes are

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.409 
guys can see it too little holes are
drilled<00:04:31.350> it's<00:04:31.680> not<00:04:31.830> quite<00:04:32.070> straight<00:04:32.580> but<00:04:32.940> I've

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
drilled it's not quite straight but I've

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.090 
drilled it's not quite straight but I've
drilled<00:04:33.660> two<00:04:33.870> holes<00:04:33.900> because<00:04:34.710> what<00:04:34.830> happens

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
drilled two holes because what happens

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.620 
drilled two holes because what happens
is<00:04:35.220> when<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.490> weather<00:04:35.669> is<00:04:35.790> cold<00:04:36.090> it's<00:04:36.540> you

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
is when the weather is cold it's you

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.090 
is when the weather is cold it's you
know<00:04:36.750> you're<00:04:36.960> in<00:04:37.050> an<00:04:37.140> area<00:04:37.320> where<00:04:37.500> it's<00:04:37.740> not<00:04:37.860> so

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
know you're in an area where it's not so

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.340 
know you're in an area where it's not so
warm<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.970> camera<00:04:39.270> will<00:04:39.419> heat<00:04:39.630> up<00:04:39.660> a<00:04:39.930> fair<00:04:40.169> bit

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
warm the camera will heat up a fair bit

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.800 
warm the camera will heat up a fair bit
and<00:04:40.560> that'll<00:04:40.860> create<00:04:41.070> mist<00:04:42.000> inside<00:04:42.450> and<00:04:42.720> what

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
and that'll create mist inside and what

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.390 
and that'll create mist inside and what
that<00:04:42.960> does<00:04:43.140> it<00:04:43.350> starts<00:04:43.650> to<00:04:43.740> fold<00:04:43.950> up<00:04:44.070> the<00:04:44.190> front

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
that does it starts to fold up the front

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.180 
that does it starts to fold up the front
and<00:04:44.580> then<00:04:45.120> you<00:04:45.210> get<00:04:45.330> very<00:04:45.570> hazy<00:04:46.010> recording<00:04:47.010> and

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
and then you get very hazy recording and

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.640 
and then you get very hazy recording and
you<00:04:48.150> you<00:04:48.390> know<00:04:48.510> obviously<00:04:48.840> it<00:04:49.230> affects<00:04:49.530> the

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
you you know obviously it affects the

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.860 
you you know obviously it affects the
quality<00:04:49.740> of<00:04:50.010> your<00:04:50.220> image<00:04:50.730> so<00:04:51.330> if<00:04:51.540> you<00:04:51.630> drill

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
quality of your image so if you drill

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.780 
quality of your image so if you drill
two<00:04:52.080> holes<00:04:52.110> it<00:04:52.620> doesn't<00:04:53.010> become<00:04:53.280> waterproof

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
two holes it doesn't become waterproof

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.640 
two holes it doesn't become waterproof
however<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:54.750> show<00:04:54.960> will<00:04:55.140> protect<00:04:55.440> it<00:04:55.590> from

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
however the show will protect it from

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.320 
however the show will protect it from
any<00:04:55.860> debris<00:04:56.100> that<00:04:56.400> comes<00:04:56.550> around<00:04:56.760> from<00:04:57.240> the

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
any debris that comes around from the

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.240 
any debris that comes around from the
road<00:04:57.510> that<00:04:57.720> flicks<00:04:57.990> off<00:04:58.169> but<00:04:58.770> at<00:04:58.860> least<00:04:59.010> it

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
road that flicks off but at least it

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.590 
road that flicks off but at least it
won't<00:04:59.370> fall<00:04:59.669> up<00:04:59.820> on<00:04:59.940> the<00:05:00.030> fly<00:05:00.210> you<00:05:00.270> don't<00:05:00.510> have

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
won't fall up on the fly you don't have

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.300 
won't fall up on the fly you don't have
to<00:05:00.750> worry<00:05:00.960> about<00:05:01.050> putting<00:05:01.410> things<00:05:01.740> inside<00:05:01.980> the

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
to worry about putting things inside the

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.480 
to worry about putting things inside the
actual<00:05:02.600> camera<00:05:03.600> to<00:05:03.780> to<00:05:04.410> suck<00:05:04.620> up<00:05:04.770> the<00:05:04.800> the

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
actual camera to to suck up the the

moisture and all that sort of crap and
plus<00:05:07.710> the<00:05:07.860> hole<00:05:08.010> on<00:05:08.160> the<00:05:08.190> bottom<00:05:08.280> will<00:05:08.669> also

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
plus the hole on the bottom will also

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.420 
plus the hole on the bottom will also
help<00:05:09.230> get<00:05:10.230> some<00:05:10.380> of<00:05:10.530> the<00:05:10.590> hot<00:05:10.740> area<00:05:11.100> as<00:05:11.280> well
