although<00:00:28.260> it's<00:00:28.500> expensive<00:00:28.860> up<00:00:29.100> front<00:00:29.130> costs

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
although it's expensive up front costs

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.840

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
okay so I just had it on my bikini line

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.910 
okay so I just had it on my bikini line
and<00:01:09.640> my<00:01:09.760> underarms<00:01:10.390> and<00:01:10.740> actually<00:01:11.740> I<00:01:11.800> was

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
and my underarms and actually I was

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.469 
and my underarms and actually I was
really<00:01:12.220> pleasantly<00:01:12.400> surprised<00:01:12.940> it<00:01:13.360> doesn't

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
really pleasantly surprised it doesn't

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:14.850 
really pleasantly surprised it doesn't
hurt<00:01:13.720> as<00:01:13.870> much<00:01:13.900> as<00:01:14.260> you<00:01:14.440> think<00:01:14.590> it's<00:01:14.770> gonna

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
hurt as much as you think it's gonna

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.610 
hurt as much as you think it's gonna
hurt<00:01:15.100> it<00:01:15.640> has<00:01:16.630> this<00:01:16.750> little<00:01:16.810> suction<00:01:17.229> cup

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
hurt it has this little suction cup

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.190 
hurt it has this little suction cup
which<00:01:17.830> makes<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.490> hair<00:01:18.729> pull<00:01:19.540> taut<00:01:19.900> and

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
which makes the hair pull taut and

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.290 
which makes the hair pull taut and
that's<00:01:20.470> the<00:01:20.680> thing<00:01:20.830> probably<00:01:21.160> hurts<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.119> road

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
that's the thing probably hurts the road

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.000 
that's the thing probably hurts the road
but<00:01:22.570> there's<00:01:22.690> no<00:01:22.840> more<00:01:23.170> painful<00:01:23.680> it's<00:01:23.830> fun

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
but there's no more painful it's fun

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.969 
but there's no more painful it's fun
peachy<00:01:24.430> skin<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:25.090> it's<00:01:25.600> much<00:01:25.960> less<00:01:26.380> painful

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
peachy skin and it's much less painful

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.340
