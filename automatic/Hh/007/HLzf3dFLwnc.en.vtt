controllers instead of having to use
your<00:00:33.890> touchscreen<00:00:34.340> first<00:00:35.210> let's<00:00:35.420> take<00:00:35.540> a

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
your touchscreen first let's take a

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.850 
your touchscreen first let's take a
quick<00:00:35.690> look<00:00:35.990> at<00:00:36.079> the<00:00:36.170> packaging<00:00:36.290> for<00:00:36.800> the

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
quick look at the packaging for the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.500 
quick look at the packaging for the
micro<00:00:37.160> control<00:00:37.490> eye<00:00:37.670> and<00:00:37.850> see<00:00:38.000> what<00:00:38.150> comes<00:00:38.360> in

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
micro control eye and see what comes in

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.180 
micro control eye and see what comes in
the<00:00:38.540> box<00:00:38.810> and<00:00:39.170> of<00:00:39.410> course<00:00:39.590> you<00:00:39.710> do<00:00:39.860> get<00:00:40.010> the

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
the box and of course you do get the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.940 
the box and of course you do get the
controller<00:00:40.610> itself<00:00:40.820> some<00:00:41.720> manuals<00:00:42.110> some

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
controller itself some manuals some

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.889 
controller itself some manuals some
batteries<00:00:43.340> as<00:00:43.550> well<00:00:43.940> as<00:00:44.090> the<00:00:44.210> attachment<00:00:44.810> that

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
batteries as well as the attachment that

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.960 
batteries as well as the attachment that
actually<00:00:45.290> holds<00:00:45.560> your<00:00:45.620> device<00:00:45.920> for<00:00:46.850> the

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
actually holds your device for the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.729 
actually holds your device for the
regular<00:00:47.300> control<00:00:47.630> eye<00:00:47.660> you<00:00:48.200> get<00:00:48.380> pretty<00:00:48.590> much

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
regular control eye you get pretty much

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.229 
regular control eye you get pretty much
the<00:00:48.800> same<00:00:49.010> things<00:00:49.280> although<00:00:49.520> the<00:00:49.760> actual

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
the same things although the actual

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.240 
the same things although the actual
attachment<00:00:51.110> for<00:00:51.320> your<00:00:51.350> smartphone<00:00:51.770> is<00:00:52.190> a

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
attachment for your smartphone is a

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.680 
attachment for your smartphone is a
little<00:00:52.610> bit<00:00:52.700> different<00:00:53.000> in<00:00:53.120> terms<00:00:53.149> of<00:00:53.390> how<00:00:53.570> it

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
little bit different in terms of how it

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.360 
little bit different in terms of how it
attaches<00:00:53.960> to<00:00:54.200> the<00:00:54.350> controller<00:00:54.649> itself<00:00:55.010> as<00:00:55.309> you

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
attaches to the controller itself as you

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.900 
attaches to the controller itself as you
can<00:00:55.850> see<00:00:56.000> right<00:00:56.149> here

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.830 

let's<00:00:59.910> take<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.120> quick<00:01:00.420> look<00:01:00.600> at<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
let's take a quick look at the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.540 
let's take a quick look at the
microcontroller<00:01:01.350> itself<00:01:01.740> and<00:01:02.220> as<00:01:02.310> you<00:01:02.400> can

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
microcontroller itself and as you can

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.430 
microcontroller itself and as you can
tell<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.000> very<00:01:03.030> much<00:01:03.450> resembles<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:03.990> of<00:01:04.140> an

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
tell it very much resembles that of an

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.650 
tell it very much resembles that of an
Xbox<00:01:04.739> controller<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.610> for<00:01:06.120> me<00:01:06.180> at<00:01:06.300> least<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
Xbox controller and for me at least the

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.150 
Xbox controller and for me at least the
overall<00:01:06.990> size<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.620> controller<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.130> a

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
overall size of this controller is a

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.650 
overall size of this controller is a
little<00:01:08.430> bit<00:01:08.550> small<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:08.850> for<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.240> majority<00:01:09.630> of

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
little bit small so for the majority of

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.270 
little bit small so for the majority of
my<00:01:09.810> review<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.110> did<00:01:10.200> take<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.680> look<00:01:10.920> at<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
my review I did take a look at the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.730 
my review I did take a look at the
regular-sized<00:01:12.060> version<00:01:12.630> instead<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.290> really

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
regular-sized version instead I really

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.840 
regular-sized version instead I really
like<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.040> layout<00:01:14.370> and<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.610> buttons

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
like this layout and the buttons

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.980 
like this layout and the buttons
themselves<00:01:15.300> feel<00:01:15.479> great<00:01:15.720> when<00:01:15.840> you're

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
themselves feel great when you're

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.020 
themselves feel great when you're
pressing<00:01:16.200> them<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:17.130> analog<00:01:17.490> sticks<00:01:17.760> are<00:01:17.880> just

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
pressing them the analog sticks are just

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.130 
pressing them the analog sticks are just
a<00:01:18.119> little<00:01:18.360> bit<00:01:18.450> stiffer<00:01:18.720> than<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.990> would<00:01:19.110> like

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
a little bit stiffer than I would like

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.750 
a little bit stiffer than I would like
but<00:01:19.290> they<00:01:19.530> still<00:01:19.770> work<00:01:19.950> just<00:01:19.979> fine<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
but they still work just fine the

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.740 
but they still work just fine the
triggers<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.240> top<00:01:21.540> are

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
triggers on the top are

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.270 
triggers on the top are
pressure-sensitive<00:01:22.290> but<00:01:22.710> most<00:01:22.860> games<00:01:23.040> don't

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
pressure-sensitive but most games don't

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.160 
pressure-sensitive but most games don't
really<00:01:23.490> take<00:01:23.670> advantage<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.990> now

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
really take advantage of this and now

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.719 
really take advantage of this and now
let's<00:01:25.470> take<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> look<00:01:25.860> at<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.010> larger<00:01:26.310> control

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
let's take a look at the larger control

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.550 
let's take a look at the larger control
I<00:01:26.760> and<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.479> fit<00:01:27.630> much<00:01:27.840> more<00:01:28.020> comfortably<00:01:28.410> in

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
I and this fit much more comfortably in

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.170 
I and this fit much more comfortably in
my<00:01:28.590> hand<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.070> definitely<00:01:29.280> prefer<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:30.000> one

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
my hand so I definitely prefer this one

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.420 
my hand so I definitely prefer this one
a<00:01:30.360> bit<00:01:30.630> more<00:01:30.810> compared<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.710> micro<00:01:32.070> control

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
a bit more compared to the micro control

racing<00:03:06.180> which<00:03:06.360> works<00:03:06.750> rather<00:03:06.989> well<00:03:07.139> as<00:03:07.410> well

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
racing which works rather well as well

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.800 
racing which works rather well as well
although<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.160> physics<00:03:08.549> in<00:03:08.730> this<00:03:08.820> game<00:03:08.910> are

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
although the physics in this game are

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.260 
although the physics in this game are
bit<00:03:09.900> weird<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.230> me<00:03:10.349> so<00:03:11.130> using<00:03:11.880> a<00:03:11.940> controller

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
bit weird to me so using a controller

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.680 
bit weird to me so using a controller
still<00:03:12.660> helps<00:03:13.730> here<00:03:14.730> we<00:03:14.880> are<00:03:14.910> taking<00:03:15.300> a<00:03:15.420> look<00:03:15.540> at

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
still helps here we are taking a look at

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.870 
still helps here we are taking a look at
Nitro<00:03:16.170> now<00:03:16.349> the<00:03:16.410> d-pad<00:03:16.950> in<00:03:17.130> this<00:03:17.280> game<00:03:17.459> worked

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
Nitro now the d-pad in this game worked

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.610 
Nitro now the d-pad in this game worked
fine<00:03:18.209> but<00:03:18.510> when<00:03:18.630> you're<00:03:18.750> using<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.260> left

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
fine but when you're using the left

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.130 
fine but when you're using the left
analog<00:03:19.860> stick<00:03:20.239> turning<00:03:21.239> left<00:03:21.450> actually<00:03:21.780> goes

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
analog stick turning left actually goes

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.830 
analog stick turning left actually goes
right<00:03:22.500> while<00:03:22.890> moving<00:03:23.550> it<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.849> the<00:03:23.880> right<00:03:23.970> makes

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
right while moving it to the right makes

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.839 
right while moving it to the right makes
your<00:03:24.989> car<00:03:25.140> go<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.349> the<00:03:25.500> left<00:03:25.770> so<00:03:26.069> seems<00:03:26.790> like

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
your car go to the left so seems like

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.990 
your car go to the left so seems like
the<00:03:27.060> developer<00:03:27.540> had<00:03:27.660> something<00:03:28.050> to<00:03:28.140> work<00:03:28.290> on

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
the developer had something to work on

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.729 
the developer had something to work on
here<00:03:30.000> is<00:03:30.180> Lily<00:03:30.510> which<00:03:30.870> works<00:03:31.080> rather<00:03:31.290> well<00:03:31.440> as

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
here is Lily which works rather well as

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.490 
here is Lily which works rather well as
well<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.660> here<00:03:33.660> we<00:03:33.750> are<00:03:33.780> taking<00:03:34.110> a<00:03:34.200> look<00:03:34.290> at

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
well and here we are taking a look at

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.650 
well and here we are taking a look at
Angry<00:03:34.890> Birds<00:03:35.099> go<00:03:35.519> which<00:03:35.940> worked<00:03:36.209> just<00:03:36.540> fine

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
Angry Birds go which worked just fine

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.770 
Angry Birds go which worked just fine
with<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.349> controller<00:03:38.450> and<00:03:39.450> now<00:03:39.480> we're<00:03:39.660> taking

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
with the controller and now we're taking

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.600 
with the controller and now we're taking
a<00:03:39.930> look<00:03:40.019> at<00:03:40.230> Crossy<00:03:40.709> Road<00:03:40.890> all<00:03:41.160> you<00:03:41.310> have<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.519> do

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
a look at Crossy Road all you have to do

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.220 
a look at Crossy Road all you have to do
is<00:03:41.730> use<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.060> button<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.480> across<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.049> road

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
is use the a button to across the road

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.110 
is use the a button to across the road
you<00:03:43.319> could<00:03:43.440> use<00:03:43.620> a<00:03:43.650> d-pad<00:03:44.069> or<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.519> left<00:03:44.700> analog

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
you could use a d-pad or the left analog

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.110 
you could use a d-pad or the left analog
stick<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.600> move<00:03:45.750> your<00:03:45.870> character<00:03:46.049> around<00:03:46.290> and

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
stick to move your character around and

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.550 
stick to move your character around and
last<00:03:48.120> but<00:03:48.390> not<00:03:48.480> least<00:03:48.720> we<00:03:48.930> have<00:03:48.959> Sonic<00:03:49.440> and

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
last but not least we have Sonic and

they're just one of my I would consider

this<00:03:52.920> a<00:03:52.980> benchmark<00:03:53.519> game<00:03:53.700> for<00:03:53.910> using<00:03:54.120> with<00:03:54.239> the

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
this a benchmark game for using with the

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.880 
this a benchmark game for using with the
controller<00:03:54.660> because<00:03:55.019> you<00:03:55.260> can<00:03:55.380> use<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.560> lot<00:03:55.860> of

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
controller because you can use a lot of

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.190 
controller because you can use a lot of
the<00:03:56.040> buttons<00:03:56.310> for<00:03:56.489> different<00:03:56.549> things<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.239> use

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
the buttons for different things and use

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.410 
the buttons for different things and use
the<00:03:58.410> r-1<00:03:58.769> button<00:03:58.799> to<00:03:59.160> accelerate<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.880> l1<00:04:00.239> to

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
the r-1 button to accelerate the l1 to

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.960 
the r-1 button to accelerate the l1 to
brake<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:01.380> game<00:04:01.590> I<00:04:01.769> don't<00:04:01.980> believe<00:04:02.340> supports

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
brake the game I don't believe supports

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.400 
brake the game I don't believe supports
pressure<00:04:03.209> sensitivity<00:04:03.720> I<00:04:03.930> know<00:04:04.019> I<00:04:04.110> put<00:04:04.380> a

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
pressure sensitivity I know I put a

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.750 
pressure sensitivity I know I put a
little<00:04:04.709> bit<00:04:04.830> of<00:04:04.980> pressure<00:04:05.160> on<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.400> button<00:04:05.489> and

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
little bit of pressure on the button and

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.180 
little bit of pressure on the button and
it<00:04:05.849> either<00:04:05.970> worked<00:04:06.360> all<00:04:07.019> the<00:04:07.440> way<00:04:07.560> or<00:04:07.860> not<00:04:08.040> at

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
it either worked all the way or not at

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.539 
it either worked all the way or not at
all

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
all

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.550 
all
so<00:04:09.060> this<00:04:09.269> game<00:04:09.450> doesn't<00:04:09.750> really<00:04:09.810> support<00:04:10.170> that

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
so this game doesn't really support that

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.229 
so this game doesn't really support that
but<00:04:11.130> I<00:04:11.160> believe<00:04:11.220> that<00:04:11.640> for<00:04:11.819> all<00:04:12.090> of<00:04:12.120> the

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
but I believe that for all of the

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.490 
but I believe that for all of the
different<00:04:12.450> games<00:04:12.780> that<00:04:12.930> are<00:04:13.049> tested<00:04:13.410> I

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
different games that are tested I

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.660 
different games that are tested I
definitely<00:04:13.950> enjoyed<00:04:14.220> using<00:04:14.430> thing

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
definitely enjoyed using thing

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.969 
definitely enjoyed using thing
controller<00:04:15.000> with<00:04:15.239> this<00:04:15.420> game<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.660> most<00:04:16.019> so<00:04:16.859> to

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
controller with this game the most so to

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.830 
controller with this game the most so to
conclude<00:04:17.579> if<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:18.030> are<00:04:18.209> somebody<00:04:18.450> who<00:04:18.690> plays

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
conclude if you are somebody who plays

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.630 
conclude if you are somebody who plays
games<00:04:19.229> quite<00:04:19.590> a<00:04:19.620> bit<00:04:19.799> on<00:04:19.950> your<00:04:20.070> mobile<00:04:20.370> devices

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
games quite a bit on your mobile devices

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.250 
games quite a bit on your mobile devices
and<00:04:21.090> you<00:04:21.329> want<00:04:21.510> something<00:04:21.810> that<00:04:21.930> makes<00:04:21.959> the

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
and you want something that makes the

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.750 
and you want something that makes the
experience<00:04:22.410> a<00:04:22.800> little<00:04:23.010> bit<00:04:23.160> more<00:04:23.430> traditional

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
experience a little bit more traditional

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.730 
experience a little bit more traditional
and<00:04:24.300> that<00:04:24.840> gives<00:04:25.020> you<00:04:25.140> a<00:04:25.169> little<00:04:25.470> bit<00:04:25.650> more

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
and that gives you a little bit more

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.590 
and that gives you a little bit more
screen<00:04:26.070> real<00:04:26.100> estate<00:04:26.580> on<00:04:26.789> your<00:04:27.030> display<00:04:27.270> since

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
screen real estate on your display since

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.640 
screen real estate on your display since
you<00:04:27.660> don't<00:04:27.810> have<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:28.050> actually<00:04:28.140> use<00:04:28.470> the

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
you don't have to actually use the

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.370 
you don't have to actually use the
virtual<00:04:29.070> buttons<00:04:29.430> for<00:04:29.550> games<00:04:29.760> these<00:04:30.690> are<00:04:30.990> I

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
virtual buttons for games these are I

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.950 
virtual buttons for games these are I
believe<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:32.100> best<00:04:32.310> way<00:04:32.520> to<00:04:32.550> go<00:04:32.789> so<00:04:32.820> far<00:04:33.240> some

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
believe the best way to go so far some

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.450 
believe the best way to go so far some
options<00:04:34.500> have<00:04:34.740> it<00:04:34.830> so<00:04:34.950> that<00:04:35.070> you<00:04:35.160> have<00:04:35.250> to<00:04:35.340> take

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
options have it so that you have to take

games and I would even go as far as to
say<00:05:03.630> that<00:05:03.840> I<00:05:04.050> think<00:05:04.200> that<00:05:04.440> these<00:05:04.710> controllers

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
say that I think that these controllers

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.520 
say that I think that these controllers
are<00:05:05.490> fairly<00:05:05.880> affordable<00:05:06.180> 60<00:05:06.930> dollars<00:05:07.200> for<00:05:07.440> the

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
are fairly affordable 60 dollars for the

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.469 
are fairly affordable 60 dollars for the
larger<00:05:07.830> control<00:05:08.280> I<00:05:08.310> does<00:05:08.700> seem<00:05:08.910> a<00:05:08.940> little<00:05:09.270> bit

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
larger control I does seem a little bit

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.779 
larger control I does seem a little bit
high<00:05:09.660> but<00:05:10.440> given<00:05:10.889> that<00:05:10.919> this<00:05:11.310> really<00:05:11.550> does

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
high but given that this really does

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.520 
high but given that this really does
make<00:05:11.940> the<00:05:12.090> experience<00:05:12.510> a<00:05:12.570> lot<00:05:12.720> better<00:05:12.750> for<00:05:13.380> you

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
make the experience a lot better for you
