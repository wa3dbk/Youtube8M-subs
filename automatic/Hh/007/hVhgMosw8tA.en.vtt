00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
what drawing and what art was about

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.930 
what drawing and what art was about
that's<00:00:12.629> where<00:00:13.260> everything<00:00:14.010> came<00:00:14.250> from<00:00:14.309> was

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.990 
that's where everything came from was
drawing<00:00:15.299> as<00:00:15.600> I<00:00:16.320> progressed<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.369> understood

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
drawing as I progressed and understood

visual communication differently and

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.410 
visual communication differently and

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
realized that color and texture and form

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.310 
realized that color and texture and form
and<00:00:24.810> pattern<00:00:25.530> were<00:00:26.520> really<00:00:27.360> just<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.200> other

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.840 
and pattern were really just the other
side<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.950> same<00:00:29.160> coin

scarves is that I can make something
like<00:03:12.790> this<00:03:13.319> but<00:03:14.319> then<00:03:14.680> if<00:03:15.310> I<00:03:15.549> fold<00:03:16.000> this<00:03:16.390> into<00:03:16.750> a

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
like this but then if I fold this into a

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.580 
like this but then if I fold this into a
scarf<00:03:18.239> orientation<00:03:19.239> well<00:03:19.840> then<00:03:20.200> when<00:03:20.440> it's

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
scarf orientation well then when it's

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.710 
scarf orientation well then when it's
put<00:03:20.860> on<00:03:21.360> then

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720

put on then
these<00:03:23.440> marks<00:03:24.190> become<00:03:24.900> like<00:03:25.900> abstract<00:03:26.260> art<00:03:26.709> so

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
these marks become like abstract art so

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.190 
these marks become like abstract art so
they're<00:03:27.129> not<00:03:27.280> so<00:03:27.660> identifiable<00:03:28.660> as<00:03:28.930> they<00:03:29.140> were

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
they're not so identifiable as they were

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.949 
they're not so identifiable as they were
when<00:03:29.769> they're<00:03:29.920> just<00:03:30.129> flat<00:03:30.430> it<00:03:31.299> becomes<00:03:31.720> more

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
when they're just flat it becomes more

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.479 
when they're just flat it becomes more
about<00:03:32.200> positive<00:03:32.650> and<00:03:32.769> negative<00:03:33.129> space<00:03:33.459> and

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
about positive and negative space and

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.330 
about positive and negative space and
the<00:03:34.420> movement<00:03:34.959> of<00:03:35.049> the<00:03:35.650> lines<00:03:35.920> that<00:03:36.280> are

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
the movement of the lines that are

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.690 
the movement of the lines that are
underneath<00:03:36.790> from<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:38.319> existing<00:03:38.859> fabric<00:03:39.160> I

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
underneath from the existing fabric I

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.150 
underneath from the existing fabric I
think<00:03:40.540> people<00:03:40.900> that<00:03:40.989> buy<00:03:41.139> my<00:03:41.350> scarves<00:03:41.889> and<00:03:42.040> my

able<00:04:31.930> to<00:04:32.050> repeat<00:04:32.410> that<00:04:32.710> and<00:04:32.950> then<00:04:33.690> create<00:04:34.690> that

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
able to repeat that and then create that

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.580 
able to repeat that and then create that
new<00:04:35.139> thing

I<00:04:36.990> don't<00:04:37.990> go<00:04:38.500> out<00:04:38.680> and<00:04:38.980> try<00:04:39.340> to<00:04:39.400> get<00:04:39.640> inspired

because<00:04:40.990> that<00:04:41.320> becomes<00:04:41.770> too<00:04:42.070> heavy<00:04:42.340> and<00:04:42.640> too

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
because that becomes too heavy and too

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.080 
because that becomes too heavy and too
weighty<00:04:43.270> all<00:04:43.990> I<00:04:44.050> simply<00:04:44.740> need<00:04:44.950> to<00:04:44.980> do<00:04:45.400> is<00:04:45.850> to
