I<00:00:43.440> would<00:00:44.100> say<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.460> a

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
I would say it's a

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.229 
I would say it's a
drawn-out<00:00:46.920> heart<00:00:47.370> but<00:00:47.579> it's<00:00:47.700> heart<00:00:47.910> shape

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239

this<00:00:52.000> is<00:00:52.210> actually<00:00:52.570> dissected<00:00:53.140> so<00:00:53.320> it's<00:00:53.500> not

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.330 
this is actually dissected so it's not

center of the leaf although it almost
looks<00:00:59.110> like<00:00:59.200> it<00:00:59.380> is<00:00:59.970> all<00:01:00.970> right<00:01:01.090> very<00:01:01.330> soft

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250

look at it and then you'll notice that

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.710 
look at it and then you'll notice that

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
greenhouse if I'm not careful it'll grow

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.460 
greenhouse if I'm not careful it'll grow
in<00:01:51.009> amongst<00:01:51.640> all<00:01:51.790> these<00:01:52.030> holes<00:01:52.720> and<00:01:53.110> into<00:01:53.320> the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
in amongst all these holes and into the

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.870 
in amongst all these holes and into the
light<00:01:53.680> structures<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:54.430> things<00:01:54.550> I've<00:01:54.759> had

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
light structures and things I've had

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.220 
light structures and things I've had
trouble<00:01:55.210> with<00:01:55.330> in<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.540> past<00:01:55.750> so<00:01:55.870> I<00:01:55.900> have<00:01:56.020> to<00:01:56.110> be

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
trouble with in the past so I have to be

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.340 
trouble with in the past so I have to be
really<00:01:56.920> careful<00:01:57.159> with<00:01:57.520> it<00:01:57.670> okay

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
really careful with it okay

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.590 
really careful with it okay
the<00:02:00.040> stems<00:02:00.310> on<00:02:00.520> I'm<00:02:00.640> digging<00:02:00.940> in<00:02:01.030> are<00:02:01.150> almost

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
the stems on I'm digging in are almost

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.550 
the stems on I'm digging in are almost
sort<00:02:02.380> of<00:02:02.440> a<00:02:03.060> squarish<00:02:04.060> to<00:02:04.780> some<00:02:04.960> extent<00:02:05.290> I

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
sort of a squarish to some extent I

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.870 
sort of a squarish to some extent I
wouldn't<00:02:05.950> say<00:02:06.070> they're<00:02:06.190> necessarily<00:02:06.550> square

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
wouldn't say they're necessarily square

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.630 
wouldn't say they're necessarily square
with<00:02:07.030> a<00:02:07.150> feel<00:02:07.390> square<00:02:07.750> okay<00:02:08.740> they're<00:02:09.429> a<00:02:09.459> few

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
with a feel square okay they're a few

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.340 
with a feel square okay they're a few
bits<00:02:09.789> in<00:02:09.970> as<00:02:10.060> well<00:02:10.300> and<00:02:10.959> then<00:02:11.080> you'll<00:02:11.200> notice

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
bits in as well and then you'll notice

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.440 
bits in as well and then you'll notice
that<00:02:14.100> more<00:02:15.100> maturity<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:15.790> does<00:02:16.090> become<00:02:16.270> more

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
that more maturity it does become more

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.400 
that more maturity it does become more
woody<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:19.660> doesn't<00:02:19.990> stay<00:02:20.140> this

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
woody and so it doesn't stay this

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.520 
woody and so it doesn't stay this
herbaceous<00:02:21.340> all<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.880> time<00:02:22.090> all<00:02:22.959> right<00:02:23.050> so

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
herbaceous all the time all right so

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.860 
herbaceous all the time all right so
look<00:02:23.650> for<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:25.890> nice<00:02:26.890> light<00:02:27.220> green<00:02:27.520> soft<00:02:28.240> foliage

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
look for a nice light green soft foliage

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.380 
look for a nice light green soft foliage
the<00:02:29.590> back<00:02:29.800> of<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:30.160> has<00:02:30.280> got<00:02:30.490> remember<00:02:31.330> we

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
the back of it has got remember we

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.880 
the back of it has got remember we
talked<00:02:31.600> about<00:02:31.630> rugose<00:02:32.200> being<00:02:32.560> sort<00:02:32.770> of<00:02:32.800> a

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
talked about rugose being sort of a

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.190 
talked about rugose being sort of a
quilted<00:02:33.280> look<00:02:33.430> this<00:02:34.150> is<00:02:34.330> very<00:02:34.390> quilted<00:02:34.989> in<00:02:35.110> the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
quilted look this is very quilted in the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.290 
quilted look this is very quilted in the
fact<00:02:35.410> that<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:35.920> veins<00:02:36.160> make<00:02:36.910> it<00:02:37.030> look<00:02:37.150> very

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
fact that it the veins make it look very

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.449 
fact that it the veins make it look very
quilted<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:38.530> then<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.830> actual<00:02:39.100> flower

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
quilted and then the actual flower

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.770 
quilted and then the actual flower
structures<00:02:40.090> are<00:02:40.930> these<00:02:41.200> three-sided<00:02:42.780> almost

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
structures are these three-sided almost

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.150 
structures are these three-sided almost
looks<00:02:43.959> sort<00:02:44.140> of<00:02:44.170> bougainvillea<00:02:44.620> like<00:02:44.920> all

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
looks sort of bougainvillea like all

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.100 
looks sort of bougainvillea like all
right<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:46.209> it<00:02:46.300> just<00:02:46.330> so<00:02:46.570> happens<00:02:46.900> that<00:02:46.959> I've

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
right and it just so happens that I've

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.900 
right and it just so happens that I've
got<00:02:47.260> it<00:02:47.350> next<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.709> it<00:02:47.800> there<00:02:48.400> are<00:02:48.489> three<00:02:48.670> sided

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
got it next to it there are three sided

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.160 
got it next to it there are three sided
structures<00:02:49.420> described<00:02:50.410> in<00:02:50.560> them

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
structures described in them

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.970 
structures described in them
that

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.440 

if<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.130> reproductive<00:02:57.730> structures<00:02:58.120> are

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
if the reproductive structures are

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.410 
if the reproductive structures are
are<00:02:59.959> actually<00:03:00.440> inside<00:03:00.830> so<00:03:01.250> if<00:03:01.310> you<00:03:01.459> finally

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
are actually inside so if you finally

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.710 
are actually inside so if you finally
but<00:03:02.629> you<00:03:02.840> feel<00:03:03.170> it<00:03:03.230> open

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
but you feel it open

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.460 
but you feel it open
so<00:03:05.230> this<00:03:05.440> brac<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:07.180> know<00:03:07.270> I<00:03:07.330> don't<00:03:07.870> think<00:03:07.930> they

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
so this brac you know I don't think they

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.360 
so this brac you know I don't think they
are<00:03:08.500> on<00:03:08.650> this<00:03:09.040> particular<00:03:11.070> because<00:03:12.070> of<00:03:12.100> where

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
are on this particular because of where

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.390 
are on this particular because of where
they<00:03:12.520> come<00:03:12.760> from<00:03:13.860> but<00:03:14.860> I'll<00:03:14.980> have<00:03:15.100> to<00:03:15.130> check

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
they come from but I'll have to check

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.460 
they come from but I'll have to check
that<00:03:15.460> out<00:03:15.700> this<00:03:15.820> moisture

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.809 

I<00:03:20.500> was<00:03:21.220> trying<00:03:21.460> to<00:03:21.490> think<00:03:21.640> about<00:03:21.760> that<00:03:21.940> and

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
I was trying to think about that and

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.610 
I was trying to think about that and
I<00:03:23.849> can't<00:03:24.599> think<00:03:24.719> of<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.959> lot<00:03:25.110> of<00:03:25.260> them<00:03:25.349> that<00:03:25.500> do

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
I can't think of a lot of them that do

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.949 
I can't think of a lot of them that do
so<00:03:25.799> this<00:03:25.920> is<00:03:26.099> relatively<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:26.670> need<00:03:26.819> to

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
so this is relatively you need to

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.400 
so this is relatively you need to
yeah

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
yeah

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.850 

okay

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
okay

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.760 
okay
so<00:03:32.430> are<00:03:33.030> they<00:03:33.180> Hardy<00:03:33.560> this<00:03:34.560> intimate<00:03:35.520> yeah<00:03:35.970> yes

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
so are they Hardy this intimate yeah yes

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.210 
so are they Hardy this intimate yeah yes
yeah<00:03:39.140> zones<00:03:40.140> eight<00:03:40.500> with

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
yeah zones eight with

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.770 
yeah zones eight with
some<00:03:42.370> a<00:03:42.580> little<00:03:42.760> bit<00:03:42.880> of<00:03:42.970> protection<00:03:43.150> but<00:03:43.600> yes

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
some a little bit of protection but yes

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.810 
some a little bit of protection but yes
their<00:03:43.990> typical<00:03:44.620> hearty<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:45.250> reason<00:03:45.550> I<00:03:45.610> teach

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
their typical hearty the reason I teach

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.980 
their typical hearty the reason I teach
it<00:03:45.970> in<00:03:46.060> here<00:03:46.210> is<00:03:46.300> because<00:03:46.360> I<00:03:46.510> have<00:03:46.630> to<00:03:46.750> have<00:03:46.870> it

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
it in here is because I have to have it

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.990 
it in here is because I have to have it
up<00:03:47.110> and<00:03:47.320> you<00:03:47.470> know

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.380 

so<00:03:51.510> you<00:03:51.990> get<00:03:52.110> you<00:03:52.890> can<00:03:53.040> also<00:03:53.160> see<00:03:53.430> white<00:03:53.670> forms

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
so you get you can also see white forms

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.980 
so you get you can also see white forms
of<00:03:54.540> this<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.930> little<00:03:55.740> bit<00:03:55.890> lighter<00:03:56.070> pink<00:03:56.990> no

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
of this a little bit lighter pink no

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.400 
of this a little bit lighter pink no
Reds<00:03:58.260> but<00:03:59.450> into<00:04:00.450> a<00:04:00.480> really<00:04:00.780> dark<00:04:00.990> color<00:04:01.050> and

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
Reds but into a really dark color and

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.100 
Reds but into a really dark color and
pink<00:04:01.560> so<00:04:01.710> it's<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.280> really<00:04:02.460> nice<00:04:02.760> vine<00:04:03.120> as<00:04:03.930> long

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
pink so it's a really nice vine as long

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.510 
pink so it's a really nice vine as long
as<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.320> have<00:04:04.440> an<00:04:04.560> area<00:04:04.860> where<00:04:04.920> you<00:04:05.070> don't<00:04:05.340> mind

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
as you have an area where you don't mind

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.340 
as you have an area where you don't mind
anything<00:04:05.970> no<00:04:09.020> that's<00:04:10.020> just

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
anything no that's just

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.009 
anything no that's just
I<00:04:10.500> believe<00:04:10.740> that's<00:04:10.860> just<00:04:11.040> where<00:04:11.310> I<00:04:11.340> I<00:04:11.850> cut<00:04:12.390> it

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.320 

extracurricular<00:04:16.019> love

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
extracurricular love

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:25.840 
extracurricular love
yeah<00:04:19.330> that's<00:04:19.900> just<00:04:20.050> where<00:04:20.200> we<00:04:20.290> cut<00:04:20.500> it<00:04:20.620> easier

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.850 

I<00:04:25.910> think<00:04:26.660> it's<00:04:26.810> flowers<00:04:27.020> I<00:04:27.200> had<00:04:27.350> to<00:04:27.410> check<00:04:27.620> just

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
I think it's flowers I had to check just

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.320 
I think it's flowers I had to check just
to<00:04:27.980> make<00:04:28.130> sure

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.999 

I<00:04:31.389> mean<00:04:31.960> it<00:04:32.050> makes<00:04:32.229> sense<00:04:32.500> that<00:04:32.710> they<00:04:32.800> would<00:04:32.830> be

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
I mean it makes sense that they would be

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:34.860 
I mean it makes sense that they would be
brags<00:04:33.400> but<00:04:33.669> I<00:04:33.699> don't<00:04:34.150> remember<00:04:34.360> ever<00:04:34.659> hearing

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
brags but I don't remember ever hearing

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.690 
brags but I don't remember ever hearing
that<00:04:35.139> before<00:04:35.470> is<00:04:35.560> my<00:04:35.680> problem

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.439 

Hey

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
Hey

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.509 
Hey
