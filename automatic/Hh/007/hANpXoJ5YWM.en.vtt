here's<00:03:04.630> inside<00:03:05.200> view<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.740> thing<00:03:05.950> there's

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
here's inside view of the thing there's

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.450 
here's inside view of the thing there's
four<00:03:06.580> cells<00:03:06.940> there<00:03:07.270> which<00:03:07.450> are<00:03:07.630> used<00:03:07.840> for<00:03:08.460> high

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
four cells there which are used for high

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.530 
four cells there which are used for high
tension<00:03:10.680> driving<00:03:11.680> circuit<00:03:12.160> and<00:03:12.880> these<00:03:13.240> two

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
tension driving circuit and these two

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.630 
tension driving circuit and these two
cells<00:03:13.870> here<00:03:13.990> are<00:03:14.530> wired<00:03:14.770> in<00:03:14.920> parallel<00:03:14.950> and

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
cells here are wired in parallel and

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.380 
cells here are wired in parallel and
they<00:03:16.060> run<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:16.450> firmness<00:03:16.690> of<00:03:17.020> a<00:03:17.110> set<00:03:18.240> the<00:03:19.240> whole

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
they run the firmness of a set the whole

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.670 
they run the firmness of a set the whole
case<00:03:19.690> goes<00:03:19.990> together<00:03:20.170> quite<00:03:20.830> neatly<00:03:22.680> like

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
case goes together quite neatly like

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:33.630 
case goes together quite neatly like
that<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:31.090> screws<00:03:31.390> down<00:03:32.400> giving<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:33.610> a

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
that and screws down giving you a

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.510 
that and screws down giving you a
complete<00:03:33.850> case<00:03:34.770> which<00:03:35.770> will<00:03:35.920> fit<00:03:36.130> in<00:03:36.310> most

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
complete case which will fit in most

00:03:36.520 --> 00:04:39.460 
complete case which will fit in most
large<00:03:38.400> battery<00:03:39.400> portables

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.750 

here<00:04:40.470> you<00:04:40.560> can<00:04:40.740> see<00:04:40.920> the<00:04:41.070> two<00:04:41.220> cells<00:04:41.550> that

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
here you can see the two cells that

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.030 
here you can see the two cells that
widen<00:04:42.360> parallel<00:04:42.840> for<00:04:43.170> the<00:04:43.260> filaments<00:04:43.770> of<00:04:43.920> the

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
widen parallel for the filaments of the

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.820 
widen parallel for the filaments of the
valves<00:04:44.490> and<00:04:45.450> here's<00:04:45.690> a<00:04:45.720> main<00:04:45.990> strands<00:04:46.350> former

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
valves and here's a main strands former

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.990 
valves and here's a main strands former
the<00:04:47.760> transistors<00:04:48.510> are<00:04:49.350> in<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:50.340> heat<00:04:50.490> sinks<00:04:50.880> on

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
the transistors are in the heat sinks on

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:14.230 
the transistors are in the heat sinks on
either<00:04:51.150> side<00:04:51.480> there

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.659 

you<00:05:15.240> think<00:05:15.449> it<00:05:15.600> was<00:05:15.900> Gordon<00:05:16.860> in<00:05:17.160> Roehampton
