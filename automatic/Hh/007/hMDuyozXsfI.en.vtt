everything is in the jars it's time to
decorate<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.930> jars<00:03:16.200> because<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:16.830> just

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
decorate the jars because that just

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.980 
decorate the jars because that just
makes<00:03:17.250> everything<00:03:17.460> at<00:03:18.030> 10<00:03:18.270> billion<00:03:18.750> times

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
makes everything at 10 billion times

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.230 
makes everything at 10 billion times
better<00:03:19.290> now<00:03:19.740> I<00:03:19.770> really<00:03:20.250> like<00:03:20.400> making<00:03:20.790> labels

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
better now I really like making labels

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.120 
better now I really like making labels
for<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.600> jars<00:03:21.810> because<00:03:22.140> I<00:03:22.350> find<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:22.800> this<00:03:22.920> is

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
for the jars because I find that this is

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.440 
for the jars because I find that this is
the<00:03:23.280> best<00:03:23.550> way<00:03:23.820> that<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:24.060> can<00:03:24.240> really

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
the best way that you can really

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.870 
the best way that you can really
personalize<00:03:24.840> everything<00:03:25.800> you<00:03:26.280> can<00:03:26.550> write

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
personalize everything you can write

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.610 
personalize everything you can write
whatever<00:03:27.150> you<00:03:27.390> want<00:03:27.510> on<00:03:27.900> them<00:03:28.080> you<00:03:28.290> can<00:03:28.470> write

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
whatever you want on them you can write

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.740 
whatever you want on them you can write
an<00:03:28.740> inside<00:03:29.160> joke<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.610> that<00:03:29.910> just<00:03:30.120> makes<00:03:30.360> it<00:03:30.570> a

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
an inside joke and that just makes it a

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.450 
an inside joke and that just makes it a
lot<00:03:30.960> more<00:03:31.020> personal<00:03:31.710> and<00:03:31.980> just<00:03:32.010> more

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
lot more personal and just more

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.340 
lot more personal and just more
meaningful<00:03:33.000> so<00:03:33.210> you<00:03:33.390> can<00:03:33.540> make<00:03:33.720> these<00:03:33.900> in<00:03:34.110> any

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
meaningful so you can make these in any

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.470 
meaningful so you can make these in any
shape<00:03:34.740> you<00:03:34.950> want<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:35.370> can<00:03:35.550> go<00:03:35.640> super<00:03:35.940> fancy

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
with it you can keep it super simple I

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.000 
with it you can keep it super simple I
kind<00:03:38.700> of<00:03:38.790> went<00:03:39.120> somewhere<00:03:39.690> in<00:03:39.959> between<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:40.800> if

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
kind of went somewhere in between and if

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.530 
kind of went somewhere in between and if
you<00:03:41.130> want<00:03:41.340> you<00:03:41.490> can<00:03:41.700> go<00:03:41.820> for<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.120> layered<00:03:42.420> look

you want you can go for a layered look
with<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.050> labels<00:03:43.380> like<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:43.770> did<00:03:43.980> with<00:03:44.160> mine<00:03:44.400> I

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
with the labels like I did with mine I

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.760 
with the labels like I did with mine I
just<00:03:45.000> find<00:03:45.209> that<00:03:45.300> this<00:03:45.540> adds<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:46.050> nice<00:03:46.290> depth

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.470 
just find that this adds a nice depth
and<00:03:47.010> it<00:03:47.160> just<00:03:47.340> makes<00:03:47.490> everything<00:03:47.640> pop<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.180> bit

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480
