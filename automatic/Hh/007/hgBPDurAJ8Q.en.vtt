it<00:01:20.920> has<00:01:21.430> a<00:01:21.460> soft<00:01:21.790> body<00:01:22.060> it's<00:01:22.750> easy<00:01:22.930> to<00:01:23.080> print

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
it has a soft body it's easy to print

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.810 
it has a soft body it's easy to print
like<00:01:24.729> I<00:01:24.820> said<00:01:25.060> we<00:01:25.390> needed<00:01:25.540> thick<00:01:26.530> ink<00:01:26.680> deposit

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.950 

so<00:01:30.820> we'll<00:01:30.940> flash<00:01:31.180> it<00:01:31.420> and<00:01:31.570> then<00:01:31.690> print<00:01:31.900> it

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
so we'll flash it and then print it

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.560 
so we'll flash it and then print it
again<00:01:35.670> as<00:01:36.670> you<00:01:36.760> can<00:01:36.820> see<00:01:36.910> it<00:01:37.150> looks<00:01:37.300> very

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
again as you can see it looks very

it<00:02:15.410> cracks<00:02:15.620> very<00:02:15.830> easily<00:02:18.460> then<00:02:19.460> give<00:02:19.700> it<00:02:19.820> a

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
it cracks very easily then give it a

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.960 
it cracks very easily then give it a
gentle<00:02:20.030> tug<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:21.250> like<00:02:22.250> I<00:02:22.340> said<00:02:22.400> it's<00:02:22.730> already

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
gentle tug and like I said it's already

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.490 
gentle tug and like I said it's already
for<00:02:23.210> quite<00:02:23.420> brittle<00:02:23.630> so<00:02:23.990> it<00:02:24.110> will<00:02:24.230> crack

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
for quite brittle so it will crack

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.580 
for quite brittle so it will crack
pretty<00:02:24.770> easy<00:02:24.950> for<00:02:25.220> you<00:02:27.970> there<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.000> go<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:30.440> can

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
pretty easy for you there you go you can

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.320 
pretty easy for you there you go you can
pull<00:02:30.800> them<00:02:30.950> so<00:02:31.100> I<00:02:31.130> decide<00:02:31.430> on<00:02:31.760> down<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.060> cracks

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
pull them so I decide on down the cracks

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.000 
pull them so I decide on down the cracks
in<00:02:32.450> either<00:02:32.600> direction<00:02:32.750> some<00:02:33.650> of<00:02:33.740> it<00:02:33.830> might

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
in either direction some of it might

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.620 
in either direction some of it might
flake<00:02:34.310> off<00:02:34.550> a<00:02:34.580> little<00:02:34.970> bit<00:02:35.090> but<00:02:35.330> that<00:02:35.360> only

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
flake off a little bit but that only

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.560 
flake off a little bit but that only
adds<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.260> effect<00:02:37.180> for<00:02:38.180> joining<00:02:38.480> the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
adds to the effect for joining the

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.270 
adds to the effect for joining the
washout<00:02:39.080> that's<00:02:39.290> why<00:02:39.470> several<00:02:39.950> times<00:02:40.160> the

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
washout that's why several times the

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.370 
washout that's why several times the
more<00:02:40.640> dink<00:02:40.970> may<00:02:41.150> flake<00:02:41.420> off<00:02:41.630> but<00:02:41.900> again<00:02:42.140> that's

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
more dink may flake off but again that's

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.660 
more dink may flake off but again that's
part<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.040> effect<00:02:45.130> that<00:02:46.130> is<00:02:46.280> really<00:02:46.580> is

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
part of the effect that is really is

00:02:46.670 --> 00:03:10.930 
part of the effect that is really is
that<00:02:46.880> simple

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.000
