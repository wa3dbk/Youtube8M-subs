00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
front heated windshield what that means

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.100 
front heated windshield what that means
is<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.040> this<00:02:53.370> vehicle<00:02:53.640> actually<00:02:54.120> has<00:02:54.780> little

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
is that this vehicle actually has little

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.810 
is that this vehicle actually has little
coils<00:02:55.880> within<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:58.010> windshield<00:02:59.010> actually<00:02:59.790> I

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
coils within the windshield actually I

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.400 
coils within the windshield actually I
could<00:03:00.000> see<00:03:00.180> them<00:03:00.330> here<00:03:00.540> on<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.660> screen<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.380> I

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
could see them here on the screen so I

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.630 
could see them here on the screen so I
guess<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.860> could<00:03:02.010> see<00:03:02.160> him<00:03:02.250> if<00:03:02.370> you<00:03:02.489> look

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
guess you could see him if you look

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.520 
guess you could see him if you look
closely<00:03:02.880> little<00:03:03.570> squiggly<00:03:03.989> lines<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.410> go

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
closely little squiggly lines that go

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.120
