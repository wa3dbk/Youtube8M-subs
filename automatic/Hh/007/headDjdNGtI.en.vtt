I<00:00:35.970> know<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.690> know<00:00:36.839> he<00:00:37.019> was<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> little<00:00:37.290> dinged<00:00:37.650> up

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
I know I know he was a little dinged up

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.399 
I know I know he was a little dinged up
but<00:00:38.729> I<00:00:39.059> was<00:00:39.390> watching<00:00:39.659> him<00:00:39.720> on<00:00:39.839> the<00:00:39.930> court<00:00:40.199> and

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:40.409 
but I was watching him on the court and

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:42.200 
but I was watching him on the court and
like<00:00:40.589> he's<00:00:41.100> not<00:00:41.280> hurt<00:00:41.430> enough<00:00:41.699> to<00:00:42.000> where<00:00:42.120> it

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
like he's not hurt enough to where it

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.329 
like he's not hurt enough to where it
should<00:00:42.269> affect<00:00:42.659> him<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:43.019> much<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:44.129> he's

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
should affect him this much but he's

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:45.920 
should affect him this much but he's
definitely<00:00:44.729> got<00:00:44.850> his<00:00:44.940> legs<00:00:45.180> back<00:00:45.360> under<00:00:45.629> him
