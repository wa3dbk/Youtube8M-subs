you<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:52.770> play<00:01:52.950> multiplayer<00:01:53.250> through<00:01:54.149> this

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
you can play multiplayer through this

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.880 
you can play multiplayer through this
which<00:01:54.509> i<00:01:54.630> think<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> really<00:01:55.229> clever<00:01:55.500> idea

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
which i think is a really clever idea

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.580 
which i think is a really clever idea
but<00:01:55.950> those<00:01:56.340> are<00:01:56.750> separate<00:01:57.750> in<00:01:57.960> case<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.469> want

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
but those are separate in case you want

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.770 
but those are separate in case you want
to<00:01:58.619> play<00:01:58.740> multiplayer<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.780> pretty

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
to play multiplayer on that so pretty

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.359 
to play multiplayer on that so pretty
cool<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.500> obviously<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.979> not<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.189> very

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
cool and this obviously is not the very

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.980 
cool and this obviously is not the very
first<00:02:02.610> time<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:02.939> can<00:02:03.060> play<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.810> Game<00:02:03.960> Boy

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
first time you can play the Game Boy

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.069 
first time you can play the Game Boy
Advance<00:02:04.340> games<00:02:05.340> on<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.640> console<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.719> first<00:02:06.930> one

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
Advance games on a console the first one

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.229 
Advance games on a console the first one
being<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.530> course<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.280> Gamecube<00:02:08.789> had<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
being of course the Gamecube had the

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.960 
being of course the Gamecube had the
adapter<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:10.979> love<00:02:11.310> playing<00:02:11.700> that

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
adapter and that I love playing that

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.090 
adapter and that I love playing that
because

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
because

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.520 
because
me<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.910> Gameboy<00:02:14.420> Advance<00:02:14.660> is<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.870> basically

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
me the Gameboy Advance is a basically

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.290 
me the Gameboy Advance is a basically
kind<00:02:15.770> of<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:15.950> portable<00:02:16.310> Super<00:02:16.580> Nintendo<00:02:16.640> it

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
kind of a portable Super Nintendo it

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.550 
kind of a portable Super Nintendo it
doesn't<00:02:17.600> make<00:02:17.720> sense<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.990> have<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.350> on<00:02:18.440> the

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
doesn't make sense to have it on the

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.060 
doesn't make sense to have it on the
Super<00:02:18.740> Nintendo

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
Super Nintendo

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.050 
Super Nintendo
but<00:02:19.730> for<00:02:20.330> up<00:02:20.420> having<00:02:20.690> GameCube<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:21.470> love<00:02:22.220> that

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
but for up having GameCube I love that

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.550 
but for up having GameCube I love that
you<00:02:23.300> could<00:02:23.420> play<00:02:23.600> Game<00:02:23.810> Boy<00:02:23.930> Advance<00:02:24.200> games

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
you could play Game Boy Advance games

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.450 
you could play Game Boy Advance games
the<00:02:24.800> Gamecube<00:02:25.310> on<00:02:25.460> you<00:02:26.330> know<00:02:26.450> TV<00:02:26.780> but<00:02:27.620> I<00:02:27.830> prefer

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
the Gamecube on you know TV but I prefer

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.670 
the Gamecube on you know TV but I prefer
the<00:02:29.240> controllers<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:30.140> superintendent

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
the controllers the superintendent

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.040 
the controllers the superintendent
controllers<00:02:31.070> to<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:31.760> know<00:02:31.850> because<00:02:32.060> they<00:02:32.240> the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
controllers to you know because they the

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.690 
controllers to you know because they the
you<00:02:33.530> know<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.770> layout<00:02:34.040> of<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.310> controller<00:02:34.610> is

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
you know the layout of the controller is

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.640 
you know the layout of the controller is
more<00:02:35.090> similar<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.870> Game<00:02:36.290> Boy<00:02:36.320> Advance

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
more similar to a Game Boy Advance

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.310 
more similar to a Game Boy Advance
system<00:02:37.490> than<00:02:37.670> GameCube<00:02:38.480> controller<00:02:39.170> if<00:02:39.230> that

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
system than GameCube controller if that

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.530 
system than GameCube controller if that
makes<00:02:39.470> sense<00:02:39.530> but<00:02:40.090> without<00:02:41.090> any<00:02:41.240> further<00:02:41.360> ado

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
makes sense but without any further ado

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.480 
makes sense but without any further ado
let<00:02:41.720> me<00:02:41.750> show<00:02:42.620> you<00:02:42.680> how<00:02:43.040> this<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:43.340> should

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
let me show you how this I should

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.200 
let me show you how this I should
demonstrate<00:02:43.580> out<00:02:44.030> this<00:02:44.270> actually<00:02:44.570> works<00:02:44.810> on

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
demonstrate out this actually works on

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.880 
demonstrate out this actually works on
national<00:02:47.210> TV<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.750> then<00:02:48.200> as<00:02:48.710> I<00:02:48.800> mentioned

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
national TV and then as I mentioned

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.880 
national TV and then as I mentioned
before<00:02:49.130> it<00:02:49.490> retails<00:02:49.850> for<00:02:49.990> 45<00:02:50.990> US<00:02:51.260> dollars<00:02:51.650> but

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
before it retails for 45 US dollars but

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.190 
before it retails for 45 US dollars but
if<00:02:52.310> you<00:02:52.400> have<00:02:52.550> a<00:02:52.580> Super<00:02:52.940> Nintendo<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.930> don't

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
if you have a Super Nintendo you don't

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.650 
if you have a Super Nintendo you don't
have<00:02:54.320> a<00:02:54.410> Game<00:02:54.710> Boy<00:02:55.060> Advance<00:02:56.060> or<00:02:56.300> you<00:02:56.360> do<00:02:56.510> have<00:02:56.630> a

Game Boy Advance and you just want to
play<00:02:57.980> on<00:02:58.190> actual<00:02:58.550> TV<00:02:58.760> this<00:02:59.750> might<00:02:59.930> be

play on actual TV this might be

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
play on actual TV this might be
something<00:03:00.200> want<00:03:00.410> to<00:03:00.470> look<00:03:00.560> into<00:03:00.740> it's

something want to look into it's

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.250 
something want to look into it's
definitely<00:03:01.460> cool<00:03:02.240> and<00:03:02.600> it's<00:03:02.720> compatible<00:03:03.020> with

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
definitely cool and it's compatible with

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.680 
definitely cool and it's compatible with
most<00:03:03.890> if<00:03:04.100> not<00:03:04.130> all<00:03:04.400> Game<00:03:04.820> Boy<00:03:04.940> Advance<00:03:05.270> games

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
most if not all Game Boy Advance games

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.230 
most if not all Game Boy Advance games
I've<00:03:06.290> tested<00:03:06.800> this<00:03:06.920> on<00:03:07.130> all<00:03:07.490> the<00:03:07.940> Game<00:03:08.090> Boy

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
I've tested this on all the Game Boy

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.360 
I've tested this on all the Game Boy
Advance<00:03:08.510> games<00:03:08.750> I<00:03:08.930> have<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.530> it<00:03:09.920> doesn't<00:03:10.280> work

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
Advance games I have and it doesn't work

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.520 
Advance games I have and it doesn't work
so<00:03:10.640> I'm<00:03:11.330> not<00:03:11.450> really<00:03:11.600> sure<00:03:11.720> of<00:03:12.110> any<00:03:12.380> wil<00:03:12.500> that

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
so I'm not really sure of any wil that

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.330 
so I'm not really sure of any wil that
don't<00:03:12.890> necessary<00:03:13.600> but<00:03:14.950> pretty<00:03:15.950> easy<00:03:16.130> to<00:03:16.280> hook

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
don't necessary but pretty easy to hook

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.560 
don't necessary but pretty easy to hook
up<00:03:16.550> as<00:03:16.700> you<00:03:16.790> can<00:03:16.850> see<00:03:16.940> you<00:03:17.090> can<00:03:17.210> hook<00:03:17.330> it<00:03:17.390> up<00:03:17.480> it

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
up as you can see you can hook it up it

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.660 
up as you can see you can hook it up it
takes<00:03:17.720> less<00:03:18.560> than<00:03:18.650> a<00:03:18.740> minute<00:03:18.920> to<00:03:19.070> really<00:03:19.460> hook

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
takes less than a minute to really hook

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.480 
takes less than a minute to really hook
up<00:03:19.880> pretty<00:03:20.750> self-explanatory<00:03:21.130> in<00:03:22.130> case<00:03:22.310> you

guys think of this device if you like
the<00:03:32.780> fact<00:03:33.020> that<00:03:33.080> this<00:03:33.230> can<00:03:33.410> play<00:03:33.560> on
