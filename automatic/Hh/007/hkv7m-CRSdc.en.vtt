00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.699

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.340
 onion happiness I take off the lid here in 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.189
 this container is pouring the most ordinary 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.600
 I do not add simple tap water 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.880
 nothing else 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.680
 do not need to pour in the edge to leave 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.890
 one and a half to two centimeters 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.799
 then close the lid and top in 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.159
 look at the special holes and 20 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.780
 pieces i put on average head size 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.960
 onions and so look very simple 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.850
 very lightly planted our onions 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.130
 remember yes our onions don't touch water 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.159
 there are still two centimeters to the edge 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.619
 which means the onion does not rot there is no unpleasant 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.390
 the smell and the most important thing left for us 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.750
 just simply include it in 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.610
 I plug into the outlet and starts 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.130

 this is the heart of our crafty happiness 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.530
 the compressor feeds the hose 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.420

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.480
