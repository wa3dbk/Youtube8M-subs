00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.390
 good afternoon dear friends with you 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.760
 death17 and today we have a battle on the chaffy on 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:14.130
 the very same chuffee who are not yet clear 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:16.230
 that is, before updating 093 just before 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.880
 update I rode it a lot to 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.189
 say goodbye to this tank and I 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.590
 stood out a couple of very interesting fights in 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:28.130
 which I took the master and just a bunch 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.130
 experience and today i will show you one of them 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.969
 so map we have an airfield at the very beginning 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.010
 I'm going to the hill to try 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.770
 Highlight opponents to me successfully 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.260
 I succeed, I blunted and grabbed a bunch 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.250
 buns but after the very beginning 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.470
 battlefield we 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.380
 we snatch a lot of damage we turn on 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:51.030
 special treatment and we wish to kill everyone and 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.680
 revenge here so here I just st 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.040
 and illuminate in the hope that behind 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.000
 somebody shoot this centurion 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.000
 which hinders us very much 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.450
 this is still not deciding our closet to go 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.020
 see what's on the other side there 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.869
 lighted krom be you and right here to me 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.119
 manage time home leg superpershinga 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.490
 which absolutely does not pay on me 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.320
 attention even somehow offensively you know and 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.320
 for this my bear 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.850
 below we killed thirty four 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.040
 Cromwel class no one shines 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.750
 well and super pershing drove in 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.990
 impenetrable semicircle and hid from 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.990
 us 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.909
 here our allies decide to trust 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.719
 is it really such a wall 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.719
 impenetrable 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.610
 and 60 nine runs finally finish 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.920
 this frag superpershing 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.470
 i decide them kromwell which stands here 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.520
 shoots with impunity and find class 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.890
 which is also here somewhere 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.890
 and even has time and can not shoot 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.360
 further driving ahead hope that 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.640
 still have time to shoot the class ass but he 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.090
 hid away from me somewhere 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.090
 I do not see 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.410
 but to happen next it turns out that he 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:47.470
 just and stands below the hill and we 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.470
 give him a couple of guns for the roof 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.980
 at the same time along the way n11 dies 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.980
 tried to target us 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.430
 that reassemble class and centurion and 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.840
 Come back nine 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.840
 and successfully finishes 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.510
 we do not wish to revive the centurion 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.769
 and of course the most crucial moment 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.810
 when u brother remains for one 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.810
 my shot is impregnable but oh well 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.210
 all opponents remained on the other side 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.310
 cards 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.320
 we pushed this part and it would seem 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.920
 you can stand on the grip but I do not 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.160
 I want to 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.490
 and I decide to go on trying to everybody 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.490
 to kill 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.450
 on the way successfully I get a lion who 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:06.190
 back up backwards and found t25 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.190
 which is worth stuffing pork soon 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.370
 then there are three tanks and artillery 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.630
 artillery will now sink where borsch me 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:20.359
 also known standing there for a pebble 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:23.020
 b-lines and i'm going to him to his 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.640
 a little bit highlight 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.130
 10 sorry miss the patrician 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.550
 threesomes first to country she stays in 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.360
 20 living in two, etc. 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.360
 28 i'm sorry 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.830
 and here on the tip deciding to visit 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:46.699
 bar right now taught here and rode here and he stands 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.620
 in place and does not move anywhere 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:52.199
 but unfortunately it looks to me and 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.259
 I decide to drive there a braid and 30 deuces 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:57.480
 would then all be alive allies regret it 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:00.290
 for a little while they will die now i'm not 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.290
 it's a ride 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:09.259
 deciding to kill first borschik that is 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.490
 go back that the opponents did not stand 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:12.490
 I have two different sides 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.830
 and the clerk we find him 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.830
 three goals 3 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.129
 here and 5 climbs our 30 . I think suddenly 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.669
 I will get 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:37.620
 but there is no base with our lower period and 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:42.449
 decide you need to cover think and 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:45.740
 now appears and there it is 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:45.740
 went down a little 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:59.580
 so he decided to still run to shoot down 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:06:01.710
 capture we gradually smear it 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.540
 more that he overshot here decide 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.540
 check if 30 deuce offends me 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.940
 she hid herself somewhere 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:16.290
 choose yourself especially since we are already clearly 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:20.420
 captured the base and at three thousand damage and 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:20.420
 master start and thank you all for watching
