00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.150
 it's sad 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.920
 I'll give you a riddle that does not 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.050
 understood the popis afterwards that he did not 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:25.500
 call explain 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.500
 look at yourself well who is he said 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.270
 look here 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.880
 look carefully who is my dad's son 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.880
 and my mom, you 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.540
 and the center 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.090
 who is the son of my dad and my mom 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.030
 that is not my brother 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.679
 Y 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.309
 ah 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:58.309
 women 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.330
 and not kid but do not get mad do not get 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.660
 I was going to tell you another riddle but 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:19.170
 They are so stupid that I prefer not to lose my 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:21.120
 time for you to smarter and more 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.910
 smart 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:28.250
 do not tell me who is smarter I am 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.320
 I 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.320
 smarter or less gross 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.040
 the same does not 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.900
 because smarter wants unequal 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.540
 it wins good but what I want is that 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.180
 say suppose what there would be 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.000
 competition between daddies and me to see 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.549
 who is smarter what would be the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.549
 result tie to zero 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.500
 you notice in extra times if it is 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.500
 true 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.050
 do not mess 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.149
 you are almost as gross as year 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.150
 to do is the most formal is changing 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.210
 It is as beautiful as love 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.799
 it hits you more numbers 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.310
 what does it say 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.310
 it sparked and it sparked 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.890
 with the straight 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.230
 you do not mess 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.500
 my brother 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.920
 I do not understand what you tell me I do not understand what 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.540
 what do you want to tell me 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.540
 and we are two 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.390
 and the one who started everything was the guy from 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.390
 eight' 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.580
 dad is that the guy left you a 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.580
 Messenger in a figurative sense 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.170
 what is that 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:54.360
 as you do not know what is the meaning 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.800
 figurative is not the figurative sense 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.280
 I do not say that the school does not teach them 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.280
 of geography 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.280
 that 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.010
 figurative sense or figurative sense 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.439
 you do not know 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.450
 the same words says a little guy 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:15.950
 figurative sense is when a person 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.950
 speaks figuratively 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.040
 when it is when a person speaks in 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.040
 figurative sense 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.080
 I say, look, this is you, sir 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.569
 belly by the figurative sense better 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.650
 explain me when you are going to pay me 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:34.030
 the rent 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.310
 I say no, also the conversation 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.440
 we're talking about figure sense like that 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.870
 why did not you record do not give more 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.340
 more turns I tried to avoid it came 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.060
 the moment you and I talk to 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.060
 shorts removed 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:51.360
 to my appointment is talking to you in 

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:52.770
 figurative 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.500
 now 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.830
 this I want to tell you the meaning 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.830
 figurative 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.500
 Now you are changing the 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.380
 compensation the moment you and 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.340
 I will have man to man come out and 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.340
 anything goes 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.650
 sorry I was wrong told me 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.030
 I should have said talk about man to 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.950
 scarecrow 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.950
 and do not speak figuratively 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.009
 you have a lot of belly, sir, reason 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:27.419
 I say that I say you are very right 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.030
 Mr. neighborhood not to mention 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:33.150
 for this scarecrow yes it is true 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.370
 but why because I do not have the money 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.770
 enough to buy me good clothes and 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.990
 walk well dressed but good or bad 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.919
 dressed i am still a man in 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.919
 figurative sense 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.450
 how are you 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.540
 a man felt figures 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:05.479
 it could be thrown away until it takes away 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:05.479
 the bad mood 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.640
 another day I come to collect the straight but 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.640
 there is no figurative sense 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.010
 I said it on purpose I did not brown 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:25.630
 so that Mr. Belly went away and 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.630
 he will forget to collect from the rent 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:39.210
 old when you're in trouble until 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.210
 Menso evil has a flash of life
