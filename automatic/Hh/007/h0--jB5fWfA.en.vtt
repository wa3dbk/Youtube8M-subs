00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.629
 Hello, my name is Putin Sergey 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.479
 I love video courses for 

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:07.979
 customers search engine optimization site 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:10.230
 video courses in an exclusive bark tour 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.679
 165 thousand 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.359
 in this lesson i will say so 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:15.399
 cost 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:16.630
 performance 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.349
 search engine optimization sites 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:20.699
 what does it depend on 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.619
 before 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.659
 discuss 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:25.650
 performance 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.710
 search engine optimization 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.349
 eventually took 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.349
 got to know the site itself 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.960
 job on the search engine optimization site 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.470
 such a task 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.990
 may be 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.990
 given gi mun or in writing 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.650
 rather successful because 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.470
 overwhelming majority 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.830
 customers 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.920
 technically and legally competent 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.570
 task to perform search 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.570
 there is no optimization 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.300
 get down 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.660
 performing search engine optimization 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.950
 eventually took 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.019
 become acquainted 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.879
 with 100 percent open source 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.650
 software code sites 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.860
 and you know 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.190
 at least no worse than 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.140
 previous developer 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.479
 because if he 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.170
 will not understand the program code 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.650
 the site 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.350
 alteration 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.240
 program code 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.180
 may lead to partial or even 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.010
 full not work abilities themselves 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.860
 same year designer 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.130
 study carefully 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.830
 text of the site penetrating the essence of the proposed 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.500
 the site 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.440
 goods and services 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.610
 specific business to understand 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.290
 what exactly should he 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.730
 optimize that is 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.060
 make changes 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.280
 and how should he appear at all 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.689
 earned more efficiently 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.540
 and held 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.430
 higher positions 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.030
 in ratings in results 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.880
 search queries and so on 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.640
 all this takes time 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.040
 that is, in other words 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.200
 on the cost of doing a search 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.190
 optimize any site 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.190
 affects 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.910
 how much time will it take after day 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.099
 to understand the site itself 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.139
 and in the subject will come a particular business 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.339
 offered goods and services 

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:14.129
 and this work must 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.229
 be paid 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:18.609
 since you are a designer wasting your time and 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:21.239
 no such in history no such protest in 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.669
 as a result, they stopped 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:25.869
 the specifics of any business knows everything 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:27.189
 can't 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:28.300
 thereafter 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.329
 you can already start 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.469
 directly quite the world itself 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.769
 search engine optimization 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:35.670
 some 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.950
 which works 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.510
 will improve work efficiency 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.859
 the site 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.349
 overwhelmingly 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.029
 search deadlines 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:46.529
 site optimization is comparable or 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:47.340
 exceed 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.630
 creation cost 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.509
 directly the site itself 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:52.399
 for example if the site 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:54.879
 10 thousand dollars was postponed i.e. 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.599
 site creation was spent 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.189
 10 thousand dollars 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.099
 tons and the search performance 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.469
 site optimization 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:04.639
 may require 10 thousand or more 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.579
 but provided that the search 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.579
 optimization is performed 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:13.019
 just as you should know that 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.400
 since they have no limit to perfection 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.999
 that to her 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:18.489
 any 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.849
 specific timing of the search 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.299
 site optimization if the site develops 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.119
 tons accordingly 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:27.779
 can be optimized 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:28.879
 and therefore 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.200
 troop activization 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.939
 never actually stops 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:34.790
 as the Pamir site develops 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.669
 making it some kind of new 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:38.320
 changes and additions 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.270
 accordingly and will be performed 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.010
 search engine optimization and this 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.150
 means respectively and 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.389
 increase the cost of implementation 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.479
 search engine optimization 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.699
 if for example 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:53.109
 t was developed on the internet 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.299
 optimized work 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.219
 some years 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:58.189
 hundred percent autonomous then 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:59.949
 easy to count 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:01.279
 site costs 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:04.169
 and costs pushus activation can 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.249
 prove approximately 

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:07.679
 comparable if during this time I repeat not 

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:09.009
 there were no changes 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:10.389
 if the site 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:12.389
 constantly evolving 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.189
 he makes some changes 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:16.889
 and executed search 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.099
 optimization 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:20.430
 time will tell 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.579
 website works 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.330
 and while doing sop migration 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.490
 m more than that 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.569
 on the total cost of work 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.830
 and there are cases when 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.550
 expensive prescott and zaz baleen shy 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.780
 hundreds of thousands or even millions 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.939
 dollars should not be surprised 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:40.139
 in fact 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.370
 any popular site is very expensive 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.020
 much more than they can afford 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.370
 represent 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.879
 some customers 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:51.819
 also on the cost of doing a search 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:54.409
 site optimization in many ways 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:56.800
 skill and decency in 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.889
 obligations 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.680
 because really 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.889
 trace 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.439
 what exactly did you do 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:04.189
 necessarily 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:06.379
 quite difficult even professionals 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:07.180
 especially 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.860
 it is difficult 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.080
 by customers 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.919
 that is to trace what exactly 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.620
 Changes made by the site did not appreciate how 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.059
 charge these services 

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:18.229
 is impossible 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:20.080
 various attempts have been made 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.590
 rewrite 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.160
 cost of doing a search 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.259
 optimization 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.969
 but outside one of these attempts did not crown 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:29.680
 success since you can't rate 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.759
 intellectual work 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.710
 search engine optimization 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.400
 not only intellectual 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.379
 work is also art 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.270
 and art 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.680
 36 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.499
 never succeeded 

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:44.439
 often 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:46.189
 that even making some 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:47.849
 insignificant at first glance 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.369
 changes can significantly increase 

00:05:50.369 --> 00:05:52.830
 site performance 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.250
 depends largely on skill from experience 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.680
 developers 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.249
 so when 

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:00.270
 preparation 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.460
 content for sites when creating a site 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.110
 City Hall 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.110
 We recommend the customer 

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:08.020
 pay 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.039
 maximum content preparation 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:11.669
 Attention 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:13.800
 the quality will not be the content the cheaper 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.580
 will be 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.849
 the cost of search engine optimization then 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:18.930
 there is if you hurry first 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.229
 and hastily create a competitor like 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:23.210
 questions for price optimization sites 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.819
 whole 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:25.790
 you spend much more 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.790
 that is, here is a little bit 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:31.610
 try to publish site 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.240
 make quality content 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.610
 and then 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.180
 to his way is pinky 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.830
 that is, the result of an effective site 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.250
 will be 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.250
 higher if it was originally created quality 

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:43.860
 more detailed 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:44.719
 to 

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:47.139
 recommendations about how much 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:49.990
 maybe it’s worth website search engine optimization 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.690
 recommend to study on the site of his student 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:53.370
 wheel
