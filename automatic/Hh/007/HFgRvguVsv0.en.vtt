00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.350 
cavity of the door and you want to give
yourself<00:02:07.409> about<00:02:07.560> an<00:02:08.130> inch<00:02:08.519> to<00:02:08.759> two<00:02:09.000> inches

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
yourself about an inch to two inches

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.390 
yourself about an inch to two inches
worth<00:02:09.600> of<00:02:09.780> clearance<00:02:10.350> here<00:02:10.619> from<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.920> top<00:02:11.160> of

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
worth of clearance here from the top of

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.120 
worth of clearance here from the top of
that<00:02:11.519> door<00:02:11.970> for<00:02:12.660> where<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.930> cardboard<00:02:13.560> is<00:02:13.739> so

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
that door for where the cardboard is so

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.100 
that door for where the cardboard is so
just<00:02:14.340> cut<00:02:14.519> away<00:02:14.610> about<00:02:14.910> two<00:02:15.150> inches<00:02:15.480> okay<00:02:16.049> so

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
just cut away about two inches okay so

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.930 
just cut away about two inches okay so
now<00:02:16.440> it's<00:02:16.650> time<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.010> cut<00:02:17.250> our<00:02:17.370> cleat

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
now it's time to cut our cleat

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.729 
now it's time to cut our cleat
so<00:02:18.450> we<00:02:18.600> need<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.840> measure<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.290> distance

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
so we need to measure the distance

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.300 
so we need to measure the distance
between<00:02:20.780> okay<00:02:21.780> it's<00:02:21.930> about<00:02:22.019> an<00:02:22.320> inch<00:02:22.620> in<00:02:22.890> 1/16

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
between okay it's about an inch in 1/16

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.100 
between okay it's about an inch in 1/16
but<00:02:23.850> we're<00:02:24.000> going<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.239> cut<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.600> so<00:02:24.630> it's<00:02:24.959> an

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
but we're going to cut it so it's an

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.220 
but we're going to cut it so it's an
inch<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.620> 1/8<00:02:26.010> because<00:02:26.880> we<00:02:27.030> want<00:02:27.329> a<00:02:27.420> snug<00:02:27.959> fit

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
inch and 1/8 because we want a snug fit

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.080 
inch and 1/8 because we want a snug fit
so<00:02:29.040> you're<00:02:29.160> probably<00:02:29.280> saying<00:02:29.640> wait<00:02:29.880> wait

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
so you're probably saying wait wait

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.580 
so you're probably saying wait wait
you're<00:02:30.360> cutting<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.959> cleat<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.230> little

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
you're cutting the cleat a little

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.310 
you're cutting the cleat a little
thicker<00:02:31.860> than<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.579> cavity<00:02:33.299> in<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.450> door<00:02:33.750> hey

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
thicker than the cavity in the door hey

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.970 
thicker than the cavity in the door hey
that's<00:02:34.530> fine

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
that's fine

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.979 
that's fine
because<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:36.000> skin<00:02:36.329> of<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.540> door<00:02:36.780> is

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
because the the skin of the door is

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.810 
because the the skin of the door is
flexible<00:02:37.739> what<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.100> cleat<00:02:38.340> could<00:02:38.489> be<00:02:38.609> as

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
flexible what that cleat could be as

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:53.300 
flexible what that cleat could be as
snug<00:02:39.030> as<00:02:39.209> possible

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.440 

okay<00:02:54.300> so<00:02:54.470> this<00:02:55.470> is<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.800> clean<00:02:56.069> and<00:02:56.700> we<00:02:57.090> want<00:02:57.360> to

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
okay so this is the clean and we want to

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.170 
okay so this is the clean and we want to
make<00:02:57.569> certain<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:58.020> we<00:02:58.560> drive<00:02:59.520> fit<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.910> clean

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
make certain that we drive fit to clean

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.340 
make certain that we drive fit to clean
inside<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.720> cavity<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.860> shelf<00:03:02.190> and

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
inside the cavity of the the shelf and

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.270 
inside the cavity of the the shelf and
because<00:03:04.350> you<00:03:04.470> don't<00:03:04.560> want<00:03:04.770> to<00:03:04.860> get<00:03:04.950> this<00:03:05.069> thing

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
because you don't want to get this thing

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.490 
because you don't want to get this thing
secured<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:05.940> wall<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.780> then<00:03:07.020> find<00:03:07.319> out

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
secured to the wall and then find out

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.470 
secured to the wall and then find out
your<00:03:07.709> cleat<00:03:08.040> doesn't<00:03:08.490> fit<00:03:08.730> so<00:03:09.150> that's<00:03:09.330> what

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
your cleat doesn't fit so that's what

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.729 
your cleat doesn't fit so that's what
I'm<00:03:09.569> doing<00:03:09.750> right<00:03:09.810> now<00:03:10.050> I'm<00:03:10.170> just<00:03:10.260> doing<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.560> dry

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.949 
fit okay so I've got my cleat inserted I
know<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:14.550> it<00:03:14.700> fits<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.270> don't<00:03:15.660> want<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:15.840> push

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
know that it fits I don't want to push

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.170 
know that it fits I don't want to push
it<00:03:15.989> all<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.620> way<00:03:17.010> down<00:03:17.400> because<00:03:17.730> then<00:03:18.060> I'll

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
it all the way down because then I'll

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.390 
it all the way down because then I'll
have<00:03:18.330> a<00:03:18.360> hard<00:03:18.600> time<00:03:18.810> removing<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:19.800> we<00:03:20.250> need

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
have a hard time removing it and we need

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.280 
have a hard time removing it and we need
to<00:03:20.459> remove<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:21.300> we<00:03:21.420> can<00:03:21.540> secure<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:22.020> to<00:03:22.260> the

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
to remove it so we can secure it to the

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.199 
to remove it so we can secure it to the
wall

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
wall

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.090 
wall
okay<00:03:24.209> now<00:03:24.480> I've<00:03:24.810> determined<00:03:25.230> where<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:25.590> want

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
okay now I've determined where I want

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.550 
okay now I've determined where I want
the<00:03:26.489> shelf<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.090> be<00:03:27.209> placed<00:03:27.450> on<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.690> wall<00:03:27.900> now

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
the shelf to be placed on the wall now

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.590 
the shelf to be placed on the wall now
what<00:03:28.830> we<00:03:28.950> have<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.160> do<00:03:29.400> is<00:03:29.610> our<00:03:29.850> next<00:03:30.120> step<00:03:30.360> is

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
what we have to do is our next step is

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.570 
what we have to do is our next step is
we<00:03:30.780> have<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.110> determine<00:03:31.380> where<00:03:31.800> the<00:03:31.830> studs<00:03:32.340> are

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
we have to determine where the studs are

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.490 
we have to determine where the studs are
and<00:03:32.910> we're<00:03:33.180> going<00:03:33.300> to<00:03:33.360> use<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.540> stud<00:03:33.959> finder<00:03:33.989> to

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
and we're going to use a stud finder to

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.870 
and we're going to use a stud finder to
do<00:03:34.650> that<00:03:34.830> okay<00:03:35.160> so<00:03:35.190> I'm<00:03:35.370> going<00:03:35.489> to<00:03:35.550> put<00:03:35.730> the

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
do that okay so I'm going to put the

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.390 
do that okay so I'm going to put the
stud<00:03:36.180> finder<00:03:36.330> on<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.690> wall<00:03:36.959> turn<00:03:37.620> it<00:03:37.769> on<00:03:37.950> allow

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
stud finder on the wall turn it on allow

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.780 
stud finder on the wall turn it on allow
it<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.580> calibrate<00:03:39.239> it's<00:03:39.989> calibrated<00:03:40.800> now<00:03:41.160> now

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
it to calibrate it's calibrated now now

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.040 
it to calibrate it's calibrated now now
I'm<00:03:41.850> going<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.180> start<00:03:42.390> moving<00:03:42.569> it<00:03:42.930> across

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
I'm going to start moving it across

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.930 
I'm going to start moving it across
until<00:03:43.769> I<00:03:43.800> locate<00:03:44.220> my<00:03:44.250> stud

here<00:04:07.120> is<00:04:07.450> I've<00:04:07.690> got<00:04:07.750> to<00:04:08.080> clean<00:04:08.410> I'm<00:04:08.709> holding<00:04:09.190> it

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
here is I've got to clean I'm holding it

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.460 
here is I've got to clean I'm holding it
up<00:04:09.520> against<00:04:09.910> our<00:04:10.030> reference<00:04:10.480> line<00:04:10.750> it's<00:04:11.319> gonna

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
up against our reference line it's gonna

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.400 
up against our reference line it's gonna
let<00:04:11.740> me<00:04:11.890> know<00:04:12.130> where<00:04:12.640> I<00:04:12.670> need<00:04:13.270> to<00:04:13.959> pre-drill

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
let me know where I need to pre-drill

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.720 
let me know where I need to pre-drill
holes<00:04:14.800> in<00:04:15.459> the<00:04:15.819> cleat<00:04:16.209> so<00:04:17.139> I'll<00:04:17.489> tap<00:04:18.489> directly

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
holes in the cleat so I'll tap directly

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.360 
holes in the cleat so I'll tap directly
into<00:04:19.030> my<00:04:19.299> stud<00:04:19.600> and<00:04:19.870> I<00:04:20.350> won't<00:04:20.560> split<00:04:20.889> the<00:04:21.040> pine

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
into my stud and I won't split the pine

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:28.890 
into my stud and I won't split the pine
because<00:04:21.940> I'm<00:04:22.150> pre<00:04:22.510> drilling<00:04:27.630> now<00:04:28.630> I'm<00:04:28.750> going

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
because I'm pre drilling now I'm going

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.780 
because I'm pre drilling now I'm going
to<00:04:28.960> use<00:04:28.990> a<00:04:29.110> structural<00:04:29.770> screw<00:04:30.190> you<00:04:30.490> can<00:04:30.610> use<00:04:30.760> a

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
to use a structural screw you can use a

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.610 
to use a structural screw you can use a
lag<00:04:31.090> screw<00:04:31.360> if<00:04:31.510> you<00:04:31.630> like<00:04:31.840> but<00:04:32.110> this<00:04:32.230> is<00:04:32.380> a<00:04:32.410> good

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
lag screw if you like but this is a good

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.010 
lag screw if you like but this is a good
alternative<00:04:32.770> I<00:04:33.550> like<00:04:34.330> because<00:04:34.450> it<00:04:34.750> tends<00:04:34.930> not

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
alternative I like because it tends not

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.800 
alternative I like because it tends not
to<00:04:35.140> split<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.590> wood<00:04:36.090> okay<00:04:37.090> so<00:04:37.150> when<00:04:37.450> you<00:04:37.570> drill

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
to split the wood okay so when you drill

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.540 
to split the wood okay so when you drill
a<00:04:37.840> pilot<00:04:37.960> hole<00:04:38.350> just<00:04:38.680> make<00:04:38.890> certain<00:04:39.070> that<00:04:39.310> the

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
a pilot hole just make certain that the

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.240 
a pilot hole just make certain that the
drill<00:04:40.180> bit<00:04:40.390> that<00:04:40.600> you're<00:04:40.750> using<00:04:41.110> is<00:04:41.500> smaller

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
drill bit that you're using is smaller

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.930 
drill bit that you're using is smaller
in<00:04:42.700> diameter<00:04:43.030> than<00:04:43.630> the<00:04:44.260> diameter<00:04:45.100> of<00:04:45.280> the

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
in diameter than the diameter of the

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.580 
in diameter than the diameter of the
screw<00:04:46.330> that<00:04:46.510> you're<00:04:46.690> going<00:04:46.840> to<00:04:46.900> use<00:04:47.110> to<00:04:47.140> attach

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
screw that you're going to use to attach

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.040 
screw that you're going to use to attach
the<00:04:47.950> cleat<00:04:48.390> just<00:04:49.390> make<00:04:49.540> certain<00:04:49.720> that<00:04:49.900> you

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
the cleat just make certain that you

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.960 
the cleat just make certain that you
clamp<00:04:50.380> the<00:04:50.590> wood<00:04:50.800> down<00:04:51.040> before<00:04:51.490> you<00:04:51.610> start<00:04:51.880> to

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
clamp the wood down before you start to

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.300 
clamp the wood down before you start to
drill<00:04:55.260> okay<00:04:56.260> so<00:04:56.410> now<00:04:56.680> it<00:04:56.830> comes<00:04:57.010> time<00:04:57.250> to

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
drill okay so now it comes time to

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.400 
drill okay so now it comes time to
attach<00:04:57.729> the<00:04:57.760> cleat<00:04:58.090> to<00:04:58.210> the<00:04:58.300> wall<00:04:58.540> we're<00:04:59.200> just

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
we're going to be using a cabinet screw

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.830 
we're going to be using a cabinet screw
and<00:05:57.010> it<00:05:57.400> looks<00:05:57.610> like<00:05:57.700> that<00:05:58.120> looks<00:05:58.539> a<00:05:58.690> little
