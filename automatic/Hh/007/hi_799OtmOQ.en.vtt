you<00:00:11.429> in<00:00:11.550> action<00:00:12.030> here<00:00:12.360> in<00:00:12.710> my<00:00:13.849> in-ground<00:00:14.849> pool

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
you in action here in my in-ground pool

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:23.140 
you in action here in my in-ground pool
watching<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.760> dance<00:00:18.000> around<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.539> pool<00:00:18.779> here

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.929 

as<00:00:23.570> you<00:00:23.869> can<00:00:23.990> see<00:00:24.260> it's<00:00:24.439> making<00:00:24.650> a<00:00:24.890> nice<00:00:25.130> path

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
as you can see it's making a nice path

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.830 
as you can see it's making a nice path
nice<00:00:26.420> movement<00:00:26.720> I<00:00:28.119> currently<00:00:29.119> have<00:00:29.420> it<00:00:29.570> up<00:00:29.660> -

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
nice movement I currently have it up -

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.019 
nice movement I currently have it up -
hooked<00:00:30.289> up<00:00:30.470> to<00:00:30.560> the<00:00:30.680> vacuum<00:00:31.310> line<00:00:31.490> on<00:00:31.669> the<00:00:31.759> side

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
hooked up to the vacuum line on the side

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.880 
hooked up to the vacuum line on the side
of<00:00:32.059> the<00:00:32.239> pool<00:00:32.480> I'm<00:00:32.809> not<00:00:33.170> using<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:33.590> skimmer

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
of the pool I'm not using the skimmer

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.540 
of the pool I'm not using the skimmer
setup<00:00:34.370> but<00:00:34.610> that<00:00:34.730> is<00:00:34.850> another<00:00:35.059> option<00:00:36.340> if<00:00:37.340> you

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
setup but that is another option if you

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.610 
setup but that is another option if you
look<00:00:37.730> closely<00:00:38.120> I<00:00:38.420> will<00:00:38.750> try<00:00:38.989> and<00:00:39.170> get<00:00:39.320> a<00:00:39.350> little

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
look closely I will try and get a little

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.570 
look closely I will try and get a little
tighter<00:00:39.920> view<00:00:41.860> that<00:00:42.860> little<00:00:43.129> ring<00:00:43.400> right

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
tighter view that little ring right

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.950 
tighter view that little ring right
there<00:00:43.640> around<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.180> neck<00:00:44.390> of<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:44.690> device

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
there around the neck of the device

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.950 
there around the neck of the device
actually<00:00:45.680> helps<00:00:45.949> it<00:00:46.269> bounce<00:00:47.269> off<00:00:47.510> of<00:00:47.570> certain

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
actually helps it bounce off of certain

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.950 
actually helps it bounce off of certain
surfaces<00:00:48.530> in<00:00:48.680> your<00:00:48.800> pool<00:00:49.570> you<00:00:50.570> know<00:00:50.660> that<00:00:50.839> way

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
surfaces in your pool you know that way

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.680 
surfaces in your pool you know that way
it<00:00:51.080> won't<00:00:51.170> get<00:00:51.379> caught<00:00:51.559> off<00:00:51.739> on<00:00:51.920> your<00:00:52.010> rails

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
it won't get caught off on your rails

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.299 
it won't get caught off on your rails
steps<00:00:53.690> anything<00:00:54.320> like<00:00:54.500> that<00:00:54.530> so<00:00:54.949> it<00:00:55.100> kind<00:00:55.250> of

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
steps anything like that so it kind of

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.170 
steps anything like that so it kind of
helps<00:00:56.150> navigate<00:00:56.629> it<00:00:57.610> but<00:00:58.610> let<00:00:58.729> me<00:00:58.820> zoom<00:00:59.000> back

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
helps navigate it but let me zoom back

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:13.240 
helps navigate it but let me zoom back
out<00:00:59.390> so<00:00:59.570> you<00:00:59.690> can<00:00:59.809> see<00:00:59.839> the<00:01:00.110> thing<00:01:00.440> in<00:01:00.559> action

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.000 

it's<00:01:13.700> moving<00:01:14.000> quite<00:01:14.210> fast<00:01:14.620> nicely<00:01:15.620> this<00:01:15.860> is

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
it's moving quite fast nicely this is

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.920 
it's moving quite fast nicely this is
the<00:01:16.100> deep<00:01:16.280> end<00:01:16.490> of<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:16.640> pool

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.290 

if<00:01:20.350> you<00:01:20.470> look<00:01:20.650> at<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.890> setup<00:01:21.160> here<00:01:21.790> I<00:01:21.940> have<00:01:22.150> the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
if you look at the setup here I have the

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.910 
if you look at the setup here I have the
hose<00:01:23.250> running<00:01:24.250> back<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.320> suction<00:01:26.560> on<00:01:26.800> the

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
hose running back to the suction on the

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.570 
hose running back to the suction on the
side<00:01:27.100> of<00:01:27.130> my<00:01:27.340> pool<00:01:28.650> skimmer<00:01:29.650> is<00:01:29.950> also<00:01:30.310> turned

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
side of my pool skimmer is also turned

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.610 
side of my pool skimmer is also turned
on<00:01:30.820> so<00:01:31.120> that<00:01:31.240> allows<00:01:31.480> the<00:01:31.750> surface<00:01:32.410> of<00:01:32.530> the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
on so that allows the surface of the

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.030 
on so that allows the surface of the
pool<00:01:32.800> to<00:01:32.950> be<00:01:32.980> cleaned<00:01:33.340> simultaneously<00:01:34.950> let<00:01:35.950> me

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
pool to be cleaned simultaneously let me

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.150 
pool to be cleaned simultaneously let me
pan<00:01:36.430> back<00:01:36.670> in<00:01:36.880> there<00:01:37.650> try<00:01:38.650> and<00:01:38.770> get<00:01:38.860> a<00:01:38.890> tighter

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
pan back in there try and get a tighter

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:46.240 
pan back in there try and get a tighter
view<00:01:39.400> for<00:01:39.610> you

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.830 

and<00:01:46.370> as<00:01:46.880> you<00:01:47.030> can<00:01:47.150> see<00:01:47.210> it's<00:01:47.480> moving<00:01:47.630> around

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
and as you can see it's moving around

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.560 
and as you can see it's moving around
very<00:01:48.170> nicely<00:01:48.410> this<00:01:49.340> unit<00:01:49.730> is<00:01:49.940> a<00:01:50.210> great

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
very nicely this unit is a great

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.700 
very nicely this unit is a great
alternative<00:01:50.750> to<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.590> Barracuda<00:01:52.280> g3<00:01:53.230> I<00:01:54.230> would

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
alternative to the Barracuda g3 I would

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.770 
alternative to the Barracuda g3 I would
say<00:01:54.920> at<00:01:55.160> a<00:01:55.190> fraction<00:01:55.550> of<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:55.970> cost<00:01:56.180> I<00:01:56.510> believe

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
say at a fraction of the cost I believe

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.640 
say at a fraction of the cost I believe
I<00:01:56.870> only<00:01:57.050> paid<00:01:58.480> 125<00:01:59.480> dollars<00:01:59.840> for<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.230> Hayward

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
I only paid 125 dollars for the Hayward

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.720 
I only paid 125 dollars for the Hayward
unit<00:02:00.980> the<00:02:01.310> King<00:02:01.550> Ray<00:02:02.350> its<00:02:03.350> equivalents<00:02:03.980> the

unit the King Ray its equivalents the

unit the King Ray its equivalents the
Barracuda<00:02:05.240> g3<00:02:05.780> I<00:02:05.810> believe<00:02:06.200> retails<00:02:06.620> at<00:02:06.740> 399<00:02:08.229> it

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
Barracuda g3 I believe retails at 399 it

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.370 
Barracuda g3 I believe retails at 399 it
uses<00:02:09.680> the<00:02:09.800> same<00:02:10.040> type<00:02:10.340> of<00:02:10.480> diaphragm<00:02:11.480> of<00:02:11.810> no

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
uses the same type of diaphragm of no

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.860 
uses the same type of diaphragm of no
moving<00:02:12.740> mechanical<00:02:13.280> parts<00:02:13.580> just<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.600> single

diaphragm<00:02:15.380> for<00:02:15.590> suction<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:17.890> so<00:02:18.890> far<00:02:19.130> I've

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
diaphragm for suction and so far I've

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.680 
diaphragm for suction and so far I've
been<00:02:19.250> very<00:02:19.340> impressed<00:02:19.850> with<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.120> quality<00:02:20.150> and

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
been very impressed with the quality and

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.560 
been very impressed with the quality and
the<00:02:21.470> cleaning<00:02:21.980> job<00:02:22.010> as<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:22.940> can<00:02:23.060> see<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:23.390> pool

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
the cleaning job as you can see the pool

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.100 
the cleaning job as you can see the pool
looks<00:02:24.010> nearly<00:02:25.010> spotless

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.980 

and<00:02:29.500> pretty<00:02:29.680> much<00:02:29.770> anything<00:02:30.190> in<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.580> pool

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
and pretty much anything in the pool

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.940 
and pretty much anything in the pool
would<00:02:31.990> be<00:02:32.170> from<00:02:33.660> just<00:02:34.660> recently<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.470> just

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
would be from just recently I just

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.550 
would be from just recently I just
finished<00:02:36.280> cutting<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.550> yard<00:02:36.820> so<00:02:37.410> there<00:02:38.410> are<00:02:38.530> a

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
finished cutting the yard so there are a

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.350 
finished cutting the yard so there are a
couple<00:02:38.620> holes<00:02:39.040> in<00:02:39.220> my<00:02:39.370> screen<00:02:39.760> at<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.030> bottom

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
couple holes in my screen at the bottom

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.110 
couple holes in my screen at the bottom
and<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:41.860> couple<00:02:42.160> grass<00:02:42.430> pieces<00:02:42.850> might<00:02:43.000> have

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
and a couple grass pieces might have
