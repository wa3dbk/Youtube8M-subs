00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.869 

afterwards<00:02:20.470> I<00:02:20.769> will<00:02:21.150> operate<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.299> brakes<00:02:23.879> to

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
afterwards I will operate the brakes to

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:31.130 
afterwards I will operate the brakes to
make<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.269> aircraft<00:02:25.810> stop<00:02:26.170> completely<00:02:30.000> right

next<00:02:32.140> step<00:02:32.439> is<00:02:32.709> to<00:02:33.090> open<00:02:34.230> fsx<00:02:35.230> Pilar<00:02:35.530> and<00:02:36.930> this

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
next step is to open fsx Pilar and this

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.890 
next step is to open fsx Pilar and this
will<00:02:38.110> give<00:02:38.290> you<00:02:38.549> two<00:02:39.549> more<00:02:39.790> screens<00:02:40.510> on<00:02:40.750> the
