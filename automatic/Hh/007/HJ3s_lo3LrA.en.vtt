00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
believe that was my first death I

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.580 
believe that was my first death I
started<00:05:26.940> off<00:05:27.000> like<00:05:27.240> 12<00:05:27.630> and<00:05:27.780> 0<00:05:27.930> or<00:05:28.200> something

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
started off like 12 and 0 or something

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.740 
started off like 12 and 0 or something
so<00:05:28.889> although<00:05:29.789> that<00:05:30.060> was<00:05:30.150> pretty<00:05:30.330> good<00:05:30.570> it

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
so although that was pretty good it

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.580 
so although that was pretty good it
would<00:05:30.810> mean<00:05:30.960> have<00:05:31.080> her<00:05:31.169> to<00:05:31.229> go<00:05:31.380> to<00:05:31.440> game

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
would mean have her to go to game
