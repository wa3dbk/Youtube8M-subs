wildstar being out for a year we're
going<00:00:37.050> free-to-play<00:00:37.640> that's<00:00:38.640> where<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.879> would

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
going free-to-play that's where I would

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.900 
going free-to-play that's where I would
expect<00:00:39.559> it's<00:00:40.559> not<00:00:40.829> confirmed<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.730> game

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
expect it's not confirmed that the game

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.819 
expect it's not confirmed that the game
is<00:00:42.059> going<00:00:42.090> free-to-play<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:43.079> could<00:00:43.320> go<00:00:43.500> by

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
is going free-to-play it could go by

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.069 
is going free-to-play it could go by
deploy<00:00:44.219> or<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.520> could<00:00:44.700> say<00:00:44.910> stay<00:00:45.360> sub<00:00:45.660> based<00:00:45.870> I

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
deploy or it could say stay sub based I

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.619 
deploy or it could say stay sub based I
really<00:00:46.320> don't<00:00:46.500> know<00:00:46.559> but<00:00:47.430> based<00:00:48.210> off<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.480> what

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
really don't know but based off of what

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.410 
really don't know but based off of what
I've<00:00:48.870> seen<00:00:49.140> here<00:00:49.590> them<00:00:50.550> going<00:00:50.789> full-blown

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
I've seen here them going full-blown

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.380 
I've seen here them going full-blown
free<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.989> play<00:00:52.260> makes<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.430> most<00:00:53.670> sense<00:00:53.879> with

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
free of play makes the most sense with

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.840 
free of play makes the most sense with
what<00:00:54.420> they've<00:00:54.840> just<00:00:55.170> kind<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.920> hinted<00:00:56.550> at<00:00:56.699> with

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
what they've just kind of hinted at with

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.599 
what they've just kind of hinted at with
this<00:00:57.260> they<00:00:58.260> could<00:00:58.530> go<00:00:58.710> by<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.980> play<00:00:59.280> but<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
this they could go by to play but the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.779 
this they could go by to play but the
reason<00:00:59.789> i<00:01:00.180> am<00:01:00.930> not<00:01:01.280> leaning<00:01:02.280> towards<00:01:02.550> by<00:01:02.730> to

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
reason i am not leaning towards by to

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.719 
reason i am not leaning towards by to
play<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.359> because<00:01:03.690> there<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.260> been<00:01:04.700> so<00:01:05.700> many

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
play is because there have been so many

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.300 
play is because there have been so many
cheap<00:01:06.420> copies<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:06.960> wildstar<00:01:07.619> available<00:01:08.100> for

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
cheap copies of wildstar available for

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.570 
cheap copies of wildstar available for
so<00:01:08.640> long<00:01:09.060> what<00:01:10.020> amazon<00:01:10.560> had<00:01:10.770> wildstar<00:01:11.369> like

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
so long what amazon had wildstar like

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.899 
so long what amazon had wildstar like
seven<00:01:12.150> bucks<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.810> box<00:01:13.340> so<00:01:14.340> i<00:01:14.369> really<00:01:14.760> i<00:01:14.790> really

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
seven bucks a box so i really i really

doubt they're going to go by to play
with<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.710> game<00:01:16.920> having<00:01:17.310> been<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.850> sheep<00:01:18.210> for
