00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.380
 curd cream 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.930
 This kind of cream I usually use for 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.050
 preparation in tsarik for interlayers 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:18.710
 different cakes and for this recipe me 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:22.070
 need half a kilo of cottage cheese 100 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.519
 milliliters of cream and tablespoons 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.890
 sugar and a bag of vanilla sugar 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.499
 or can replace vanilla sugar 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.130
 vanilla extract and for cooking 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:35.420
 cream 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:43.730
 I'll add 5 tablespoons to the cream 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:46.640
 sugar and vanilla sugar I have it 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.239
 pretty fine car powdered sugar 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.550
 I will add directly to the curd 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.859
 I can very good vanilla sugar 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.839
 advise just such a firm as 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:59.120
 inside sugar is not exactly contained 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.280
 just vanilla flavor namely the particles 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.010
 vanilla can be in notice there are so black 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.979
 the edge of the river and the taste is very 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:12.259
 saturated and vanilla really 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:15.020
 felt and now cream I'll beat up 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.829
 whisk until cooked at not 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.600
 I will become such 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:22.310
 loose fluffy well from the cream well whipped 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.460
 Mixer does not work like this 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.369
 it turns out they do not flock pretty 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.229
 such are pruha can say back and 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:33.590
 Now I will beat the submersible blender 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.149
 cottage cheese 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.280
 you can see that powdered sugar 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.200
 started to melt soak in the curd and 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.320
 That is what I said about black 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.060
 10 pieces this is vanilla 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.430
 crushed so immersion blender i 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.409
 I will chop the valves to the curd 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.719
 it was more or less creamy 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.700
 texture 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:55.500
 Well, the cottage cheese is a little crushed 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.079
 did not become so much zero not eat and became 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.890
 then the dome is creamy and now to 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:08.190
 cottage cheese I add whipped cream and all 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:10.500
 I carefully stir the spoons 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.330
 completely ready it turns out pretty 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.780
 thick on at the same time it turns out 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:19.140
 very gentle juicy saturated 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.489
 cottage cheese cream flavor with aroma and 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.489
