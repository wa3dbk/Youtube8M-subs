the world's first silent roof-rack has
been<00:00:06.759> a<00:00:06.790> fantastic<00:00:07.120> project<00:00:08.610> we<00:00:09.610> think<00:00:10.300> about

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.360 
been a fantastic project we think about

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.879 
been a fantastic project we think about
these<00:00:10.599> things<00:00:10.660> from<00:00:10.990> our<00:00:11.080> perspective<00:00:11.590> and<00:00:11.740> we

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:11.889 
these things from our perspective and we

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:13.530 
these things from our perspective and we
were<00:00:11.980> finding<00:00:12.340> that<00:00:12.370> you<00:00:12.910> know<00:00:13.030> in<00:00:13.210> the<00:00:13.299> past

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:13.540 
were finding that you know in the past

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.140 
were finding that you know in the past
when<00:00:13.839> we've<00:00:14.019> used<00:00:14.259> roof<00:00:14.469> racks<00:00:14.969> they<00:00:15.969> meant

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
when we've used roof racks they meant

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.810 
when we've used roof racks they meant
howling<00:00:16.630> racket<00:00:17.050> women<00:00:17.290> on<00:00:17.380> the<00:00:17.470> roof<00:00:17.820> and

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
howling racket women on the roof and

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.190 
howling racket women on the roof and
when<00:00:19.000> we<00:00:19.090> talked<00:00:19.300> to<00:00:19.420> consumers<00:00:19.960> and<00:00:20.110> talked

people<00:00:24.670> in<00:00:24.730> the<00:00:24.790> market<00:00:25.090> were<00:00:25.150> finally<00:00:25.450> so

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
people in the market were finally so

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.180 
people in the market were finally so
retailers<00:00:26.260> are<00:00:26.350> saying<00:00:26.500> to<00:00:26.590> us<00:00:26.710> look<00:00:26.770> you<00:00:27.070> know

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.190 
retailers are saying to us look you know

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.770 
retailers are saying to us look you know
the<00:00:27.520> number<00:00:27.820> one<00:00:28.000> reason<00:00:28.420> for<00:00:28.450> people

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:28.780 
the number one reason for people

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.310 
the number one reason for people
returning<00:00:29.410> wrecks<00:00:30.130> to<00:00:30.400> us<00:00:30.550> is<00:00:30.820> that<00:00:31.780> they<00:00:32.110> get

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
returning wrecks to us is that they get

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.540 
returning wrecks to us is that they get
them<00:00:32.500> and<00:00:32.619> they<00:00:32.680> find<00:00:32.800> they<00:00:32.950> make<00:00:33.070> a<00:00:33.100> howling

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:35.740 
racket what can we do about that so this

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.470 
racket what can we do about that so this
was<00:00:35.890> like<00:00:36.040> a<00:00:36.100> wonderful<00:00:36.520> moment<00:00:37.090> for<00:00:37.120> us<00:00:37.270> where

here you know if we can bring that to
bear<00:00:44.500> on<00:00:44.770> a<00:00:44.829> roof<00:00:45.010> rack<00:00:45.660> wouldn't<00:00:46.660> that<00:00:46.750> be

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
bear on a roof rack wouldn't that be

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.240 
bear on a roof rack wouldn't that be
amazing<00:00:46.960> if<00:00:47.380> we<00:00:47.440> could<00:00:47.500> create<00:00:47.770> the<00:00:47.980> world's

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
amazing if we could create the world's

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.800 
amazing if we could create the world's
first<00:00:48.460> silent<00:00:48.820> roof<00:00:48.940> rack<00:00:49.120> so<00:00:49.450> that's<00:00:49.570> really

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
first silent roof rack so that's really

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.660 
first silent roof rack so that's really
what<00:00:49.990> we<00:00:50.079> set<00:00:50.260> out<00:00:50.290> to<00:00:50.500> do<00:00:50.650> with<00:00:50.860> whisper<00:00:51.220> and

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
what we set out to do with whisper and

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.040 
what we set out to do with whisper and
we're<00:00:51.820> incredibly<00:00:52.120> excited<00:00:52.720> with<00:00:52.810> what<00:00:52.840> we've

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
we're incredibly excited with what we've

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.400 
we're incredibly excited with what we've
achieved<00:00:53.170> because<00:00:54.360> not<00:00:55.360> only<00:00:55.390> have<00:00:56.290> we

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
achieved because not only have we

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.020 
achieved because not only have we
achieved<00:00:56.530> you<00:00:57.340> know<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.640> world's<00:00:57.880> first

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
achieved you know the world's first

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.210 
achieved you know the world's first
silent<00:00:58.450> roof<00:00:58.660> rack<00:00:58.930> and<00:00:59.920> we're<00:01:00.040> going<00:01:00.160> to

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
silent roof rack and we're going to

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.740 
silent roof rack and we're going to
demonstrate<00:01:00.370> that<00:01:00.670> in<00:01:00.790> a<00:01:00.850> moment<00:01:00.940> but<00:01:01.300> achieve

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
demonstrate that in a moment but achieve

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.500 
demonstrate that in a moment but achieve
something<00:01:01.989> that's<00:01:02.170> incredibly<00:01:02.860> beautiful

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
something that's incredibly beautiful

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.760 
something that's incredibly beautiful
and<00:01:04.510> you<00:01:04.659> can<00:01:04.750> see<00:01:04.900> this<00:01:05.080> is<00:01:05.229> the<00:01:05.290> roof<00:01:05.440> that

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
and you can see this is the roof that

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.399 
and you can see this is the roof that
the<00:01:05.860> rack<00:01:06.040> here<00:01:06.250> shaped<00:01:07.120> like<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.420> like<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.050> wing

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
the rack here shaped like a like a wing

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.580 
the rack here shaped like a like a wing
so<00:01:09.040> that<00:01:09.070> makes<00:01:09.340> abundant<00:01:09.790> sense<00:01:10.060> right<00:01:10.590> also

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
so that makes abundant sense right also

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.469 
so that makes abundant sense right also
has<00:01:11.950> this<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.370> smart<00:01:12.640> foot<00:01:12.820> on<00:01:12.940> the<00:01:13.030> edge<00:01:13.060> here

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
has this the smart foot on the edge here

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:14.790 
has this the smart foot on the edge here
and<00:01:13.720> we'll<00:01:13.930> talk<00:01:14.050> about<00:01:14.170> that<00:01:14.409> another<00:01:14.680> time

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
and we'll talk about that another time

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.260 
and we'll talk about that another time
but<00:01:15.100> that<00:01:15.250> actually<00:01:15.549> made<00:01:15.729> it<00:01:15.760> makes<00:01:16.090> it

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
but that actually made it makes it

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.880 
but that actually made it makes it
incredibly<00:01:16.720> adaptable<00:01:17.110> to<00:01:17.409> a<00:01:17.530> number<00:01:17.799> of

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
incredibly adaptable to a number of

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.820 
incredibly adaptable to a number of
vehicles<00:01:18.450> but<00:01:19.450> not<00:01:19.840> only<00:01:20.140> all<00:01:20.260> of<00:01:20.290> that<00:01:20.560> we've

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
vehicles but not only all of that we've

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.500 
vehicles but not only all of that we've
achieved<00:01:20.950> something<00:01:21.370> that<00:01:21.610> reduces<00:01:22.150> wind

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
achieved something that reduces wind

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.910 
achieved something that reduces wind
drag<00:01:22.630> by<00:01:23.200> up<00:01:23.320> to<00:01:23.350> 70%<00:01:23.890> and<00:01:24.630> therefore<00:01:25.920> it

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
drag by up to 70% and therefore it

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.680 
drag by up to 70% and therefore it
causes<00:01:27.370> a<00:01:27.400> vehicle<00:01:27.790> with<00:01:27.909> a<00:01:27.940> roof<00:01:28.120> rack<00:01:28.299> on<00:01:28.450> to

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
causes a vehicle with a roof rack on to

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.010 
causes a vehicle with a roof rack on to
use<00:01:29.010> phenomenally<00:01:30.010> less<00:01:30.220> fuel<00:01:30.580> so<00:01:31.570> it's<00:01:31.869> like

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
use phenomenally less fuel so it's like

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.070 
use phenomenally less fuel so it's like
the<00:01:32.110> greenest<00:01:32.530> option<00:01:32.860> as<00:01:33.010> well<00:01:33.220> so<00:01:34.000> we<00:01:34.540> feel

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
the greenest option as well so we feel

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.210 
the greenest option as well so we feel
incredibly<00:01:35.500> excited<00:01:35.860> that<00:01:35.950> we've<00:01:36.070> actually

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
incredibly excited that we've actually

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.010 
incredibly excited that we've actually
achieved<00:01:36.400> something<00:01:36.850> that's<00:01:37.119> not<00:01:37.270> just<00:01:37.690> the

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
achieved something that's not just the

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.359 
achieved something that's not just the
world's<00:01:38.260> first<00:01:38.409> silent<00:01:38.770> roof<00:01:38.920> rack<00:01:39.100> but<00:01:39.220> it's

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
world's first silent roof rack but it's

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:40.800 
world's first silent roof rack but it's
also<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.640> greenest<00:01:40.030> it's<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.450> most

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
also the greenest it's the most

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.010 
also the greenest it's the most

and development that the product and

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.120 
and development that the product and
we've<00:01:52.299> we've<00:01:52.659> racked<00:01:52.869> up<00:01:53.049> here<00:01:53.290> a<00:01:53.590> bunch<00:01:53.950> of

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
we've we've racked up here a bunch of

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.390 
we've we've racked up here a bunch of
leading<00:01:54.729> wrecks<00:01:55.119> in<00:01:55.299> the<00:01:55.390> market<00:01:55.750> and<00:01:56.320> we<00:01:57.280> can

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
leading wrecks in the market and we can

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.499 
leading wrecks in the market and we can
actually<00:01:57.520> hear<00:01:57.850> it's<00:01:58.030> actually<00:01:58.240> a<00:01:58.299> wind

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
actually hear it's actually a wind

00:01:58.509 --> 00:01:58.950 
actually hear it's actually a wind
tunnel

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
tunnel

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.359 
tunnel
you<00:01:59.140> actually<00:01:59.290> hear<00:01:59.650> the<00:01:59.830> difference<00:02:00.189> between

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
you actually hear the difference between

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.429 
you actually hear the difference between
the<00:02:00.850> whisper<00:02:01.210> versus<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:01.750> other<00:02:01.900> key

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
the whisper versus the other key

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:03.780 
the whisper versus the other key
competitors<00:02:02.860> in<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.040> marketplace<00:02:03.369> I<00:02:03.520> want<00:02:03.700> to

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
competitors in the marketplace I want to

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.050 
competitors in the marketplace I want to
fire<00:02:04.270> that<00:02:04.390> up<00:02:04.450> now<00:02:04.659> and<00:02:04.770> demonstrate<00:02:05.770> there

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
fire that up now and demonstrate there

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.220 
fire that up now and demonstrate there
so<00:02:08.159> this<00:02:09.159> is<00:02:09.369> our<00:02:09.579> this<00:02:10.029> is<00:02:10.179> our<00:02:10.359> research<00:02:11.139> and

this<00:02:12.579> is<00:02:12.639> our<00:02:12.879> wind<00:02:13.060> tunnel

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
this is our wind tunnel

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.770 
this is our wind tunnel

built for this for this up on the screen
here<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.600> can<00:02:16.720> see<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:17.020> we<00:02:17.110> can<00:02:17.230> actually

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
here you can see that we can actually

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.100 
here you can see that we can actually
set<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.920> road<00:02:18.850> speed<00:02:19.150> for<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.810> purposes

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
yakima round bar and finally the Petula

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.490 
yakima round bar and finally the Petula
square<00:02:36.489> bar<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:36.940> if<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:38.020> listen<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.380> each

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
square bar and if you you listen to each

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.500 
square bar and if you you listen to each
one<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.709> these<00:02:38.890> at<00:02:39.190> that<00:02:39.459> 100<00:02:39.880> kilometre<00:02:40.239> speed

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
one of these at that 100 kilometre speed

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.030 
one of these at that 100 kilometre speed
you<00:02:40.840> can<00:02:40.989> hear<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.350> difference<00:02:41.709> it's<00:02:41.860> quite

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
you can hear the difference it's quite

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.550 
you can hear the difference it's quite
extraordinary<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:42.790> we'll<00:02:42.940> just<00:02:43.030> flip<00:02:43.239> that<00:02:43.390> on

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
extraordinary so we'll just flip that on

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.540 
extraordinary so we'll just flip that on
at<00:02:44.560> 100<00:02:44.860> kilometres<00:02:45.190> an<00:02:45.280> hour

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.770 

all<00:02:48.550> right<00:02:48.640> so<00:02:48.790> that's<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.150> Thule<00:02:49.480> square<00:02:49.600> bar

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
all right so that's the Thule square bar

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.320 
all right so that's the Thule square bar
right<00:02:50.350> there

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
right there

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.380 
right there
if<00:02:52.840> we<00:02:53.080> compare<00:02:53.290> that<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.770> the<00:02:54.550> yakima<00:02:55.210> round

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
if we compare that to the yakima round

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.330 
if we compare that to the yakima round
bar<00:02:55.570> you<00:02:56.380> instantly<00:02:56.740> hear<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.040> difference

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
bar you instantly hear the difference

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:06.970 
bar you instantly hear the difference
between<00:02:57.610> a<00:02:57.640> square<00:02:57.880> and<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:58.150> round<00:02:58.360> bar

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.300 

so<00:03:07.489> it's<00:03:07.610> a<00:03:07.670> huge<00:03:07.819> amount<00:03:08.000> of<00:03:08.239> noise<00:03:09.310> compare

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
so it's a huge amount of noise compare

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.640 
so it's a huge amount of noise compare
that<00:03:10.459> to<00:03:10.520> the<00:03:10.819> thule<00:03:11.209> aero<00:03:11.480> bar<00:03:11.780> which<00:03:12.470> in

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
that to the thule aero bar which in

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.729 
that to the thule aero bar which in
theory<00:03:12.950> should<00:03:13.220> be<00:03:13.840> quite<00:03:14.840> quiet

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
theory should be quite quiet

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.130 
theory should be quite quiet
it<00:03:16.400> actually<00:03:16.580> makes<00:03:16.849> as<00:03:17.239> much<00:03:17.569> if<00:03:17.780> not<00:03:17.810> more

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
it actually makes as much if not more

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.320 
it actually makes as much if not more
noise<00:03:18.379> than<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:18.890> round<00:03:19.160> bar<00:03:19.430> you<00:03:20.150> can<00:03:20.269> see

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
noise than the round bar you can see

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.880 
noise than the round bar you can see
that<00:03:20.540> on<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.900> screen<00:03:20.989> there<00:03:21.379> with<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:21.680> peak

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
that on the screen there with the peak

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.759 
that on the screen there with the peak
of<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.129> noise<00:03:22.310> and<00:03:22.959> finally<00:03:23.959> here<00:03:24.709> the

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
of the noise and finally here the

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.150 
of the noise and finally here the
whisper<00:03:25.989> notes<00:03:26.989> that<00:03:27.170> no<00:03:27.319> sound<00:03:27.530> at<00:03:27.739> all

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
whisper notes that no sound at all
