00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:04.680

 also remove the legs of the prawns 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:19.729
 so as to leave only the carapace 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:23.240
 and his door inside and now 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.240
 we cut the oven 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:42.080

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.990

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.899
 and put on the flame while the broth 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:07.009

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:10.130
 but first we steal a bit of peel only 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:17.540
 an outer part of the peel is 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:22.180
 orange that on the wall as required e 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.180

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:38.620
 therefore Italian in small pieces either 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.930

 king prawns and let them brown a little 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:30.280
 I left the shell because you don't 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:34.049
 they become smaller and larger fallow deer remain 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.049
 that make their effect immediate 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:39.540
