unpleasant burn but you do get a burn
from<00:03:27.610> it<00:03:27.819> so<00:03:28.060> just<00:03:28.299> bear<00:03:28.480> that<00:03:28.510> in<00:03:28.690> mind

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.670 

say<00:03:33.970> nicotine<00:03:34.360> on<00:03:34.510> this<00:03:34.630> one<00:03:34.870> probably<00:03:35.560> about

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
say nicotine on this one probably about

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.680 
say nicotine on this one probably about
medium<00:03:36.190> it<00:03:36.489> still<00:03:36.819> and<00:03:36.970> pack<00:03:37.120> up<00:03:37.150> a<00:03:37.510> big

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
medium it still and pack up a big

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.780 
medium it still and pack up a big
nicotine<00:03:38.110> hip<00:03:38.350> for<00:03:38.560> me<00:03:41.280> maybe<00:03:42.280> it<00:03:42.400> feels<00:03:42.580> a<00:03:42.760> bit

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
nicotine hip for me maybe it feels a bit

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.660 
nicotine hip for me maybe it feels a bit
more<00:03:43.090> because<00:03:43.239> of<00:03:43.360> the<00:03:43.510> burn<00:03:43.769> but<00:03:44.769> I<00:03:45.250> really

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
more because of the burn but I really

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.880 
more because of the burn but I really
don't<00:03:45.820> think<00:03:45.880> it's<00:03:46.650> particularly<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:47.829> high

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.740 

it's<00:03:50.890> not<00:03:51.040> a<00:03:51.070> cheapest<00:03:51.489> snuff<00:03:51.730> this<00:03:51.910> practice

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
it's not a cheapest snuff this practice

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.380 
it's not a cheapest snuff this practice
but<00:03:53.109> it's<00:03:53.290> pretty<00:03:53.440> good<00:03:53.650> so<00:03:54.239> if<00:03:55.239> you're

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
but it's pretty good so if you're

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.970 
but it's pretty good so if you're
looking<00:03:55.510> for<00:03:55.780> something<00:03:55.930> different<00:03:56.079> to<00:03:56.739> try

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
looking for something different to try

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.940 
looking for something different to try
then<00:03:57.370> I'd<00:03:57.489> definitely<00:03:57.670> recommend<00:03:58.680> looking<00:03:59.680> at

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950

compared to that but the grind is good

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.350 
compared to that but the grind is good
because<00:04:19.390> it<00:04:20.140> doesn't<00:04:20.470> it<00:04:21.160> doesn't<00:04:21.340> allow<00:04:21.700> too
