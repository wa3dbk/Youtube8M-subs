 ching wan on hello everybody, alright with 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.970
 You are anna and you are 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.670
 watching each one showing how it is done 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.640
 You asked me for a football cap and I 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.859
 I made two filter models and the other one 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.929
 with milk carton type of fight 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:37.059
 In today's video I'm going to show this one of 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:39.820
 I felt that's what you ask me 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.609
 What is my team? I'm a flamenco guitarist. 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.429
 you leave in the comments what is the 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:47.859
 team and to honor the parents 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:50.079
 since this video was requested for them and 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.449
 their day is almost at 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.499
 today's kisses go to parents and 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.409
 future parents 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:58.780
 Kisses to kleiton lima did not tell me 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.969
 patrick amaral and at the end of the video has 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:06.010
 More kisses to make this campaign 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:10.810
 You're going to need to go downtown black paper. 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:13.050
 contact and transparent image of your 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.830
 team 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:21.100
 del colt black line with a 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.110
 needle hot glue and scissors 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.390
 The first thing we're going to do is 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.580
 the mold for our campaign, let's 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.400
 do more or less in this measure 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.440
 we put the phone on and we have to 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.230
 more or less a finger like 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.980
 shows that we have recruited two 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.900
 felt and now we're going to sew 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.500
 The point that we are going to make will be the 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:47.920
 Casey passed the needle down 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.350
 up and passed the needle inside 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.700
 of the line and let's do 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.640
 around the center let's just leave 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.220
 an open part in the video of the 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.020
 Finally I'll explain better how that point 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.210
 has this video appearing in the 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.619
 I'll leave the description for this video 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.399
 video link 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.050
 after sewing it will be like this 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.390
 now we 'll get a piece of 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:20.410
 felt and let's put it inside the hood 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:28.900
 so let's paste this part into the 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:33.090
 hood and after glued the hood goes 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.090
 stay like this, it will close like this 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.269
 Now we'll get a piece of paper. 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.450
 willingly and let's put on the 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.410
 image of our team that is not my 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.019
 team 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.600
 cut the excess paper with 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.989
 tati and we will leave in a way that 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.230
 stay like this look and now we'll paste 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:59.530
 with the hot glue up here from our 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.200
 walks well in the closed part now 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.360
 This one is missing the Velcro I 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.820
 I'll put two pieces of velcro 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.040
 because it will become much more resistant 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.200
 mine will glue with hot glue but 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.850
 You can also sew 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.630
 it works and it 's like this 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:20.019
 the cap is ready very simple very 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.600
 easy to make the materials are super 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.239
 super cheap any of you 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.940
 can do this walk is a good 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.280
