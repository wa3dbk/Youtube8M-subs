00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:11.060
 820 has the model back detail 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.960
 to show the screen they are big 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:17.780
 the shoes to the model but does not enter 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.680
 detail of a piece of wood that 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.630
 as you see also gives the feeling of leo 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.640
 the feeling of the envelope will be with 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.990
 with a shoe that is much more thought 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.210
 because that has as it opens the 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:35.749
 structure 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:38.019
 I want to ask is pine wood 

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:38.019
 Oregon 

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:42.170
 effectively when one was bought 

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:44.629
 shoe so that it fits well since 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.149
 our life a little bit big is like that 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.940
 with these shoes they have is taken out 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:54.219
 finger in the air and as the 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.219
 buy as one buys the silver 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:02.449
 and it came out like claws we folded the terrible 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.780
 or far back as it seems that you 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.890
 they get big in this problem when 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.240
 have 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.240
 of shoe in front 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.030
 saleh that has room to go out and 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.930
 I hope you buy it as with numbers 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.640
 means very tight and very loose in this 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.490
 case as you say you are very loose and 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.560
 clear it looks good to him I have left very 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.060
 well but when walking a good time the 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.400
 shoe the people who are holding 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.100
 boarding school comes to look for loose data 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.520
 and the tight what is your prediction that 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.560
 are the numbers the modified numbers 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:50.830
 if they did not have the possibility of the medium 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:50.830
 number they have to say the numbers 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:02:02.590
 that tries to pamper or imitate the most 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.590
 high with a while 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.750
 it means this 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.760
 gray and as you say the color is back 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.220
 to disguise that it is a square cue 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.060
 nice hey I like the design of the 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.870
 nail 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:27.340
 with the nails of 10 and the pedicure 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.400
 today we are going to talk about making ourselves the way 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.720
 on how to do it 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.700
 important as I was this is to highlight 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.100
 the one that comes very fashionable the colors 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.460
 strong nails since you show so much 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.650
 welfare for the list that stands out 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.170
 it is important to put color on 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.310
 your nails combine I 'm going to put you 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.310
 the nails collaborate 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.690
 we have to choose today with our 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:00.030

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.540

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.700
 with colors because I am what I am and 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.700
