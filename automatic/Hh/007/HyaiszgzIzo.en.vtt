hey<00:00:01.589> guys<00:00:01.800> I've<00:00:02.190> got<00:00:02.250> another<00:00:02.580> unusual<00:00:03.120> game

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
hey guys I've got another unusual game

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.160 
hey guys I've got another unusual game
controller<00:00:03.810> for<00:00:04.140> you<00:00:04.290> this<00:00:05.250> is<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:06.240> mouse<00:00:07.140> that

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
controller for you this is a mouse that

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.960 
controller for you this is a mouse that
you<00:00:07.529> control<00:00:07.919> with<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.250> tip<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.580> your<00:00:08.610> tongue

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
you control with the tip of your tongue

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.169 
you control with the tip of your tongue
so<00:00:09.809> it's<00:00:10.080> got<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.290> plastic<00:00:11.190> sort<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.790> retainer

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
so it's got a plastic sort of retainer

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.850 
so it's got a plastic sort of retainer
kind<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.599> housing<00:00:12.990> that<00:00:13.110> sticks<00:00:13.440> up<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.740> the

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
kind of housing that sticks up to the

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.890 
kind of housing that sticks up to the
top<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.340> roof<00:00:14.519> of<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.790> mouth<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.360> then

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
top of the roof of the mouth and then

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.810 
top of the roof of the mouth and then
moving<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.410> tongue<00:00:16.590> across<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.250> sensor<00:00:17.460> is

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
moving the tongue across the sensor is

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.429 
moving the tongue across the sensor is
just<00:00:18.060> like<00:00:18.240> moving<00:00:18.449> your<00:00:18.570> finger<00:00:19.050> across<00:00:19.320> the

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
just like moving your finger across the

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.290 
just like moving your finger across the
sensor<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.250> an<00:00:20.340> optical<00:00:20.760> mouse<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.779> like<00:00:22.260> this

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.400 

let<00:00:27.300> me<00:00:27.359> tell<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.599> about<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.810> details

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
let me tell you about the details

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.089 
let me tell you about the details
I<00:00:29.539> built<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.689> mouse<00:00:30.960> by<00:00:31.230> taking<00:00:31.619> apart<00:00:31.949> a

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
I built this mouse by taking apart a

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.850 
I built this mouse by taking apart a
trackball<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.940> in<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.079> trackball<00:00:34.590> there<00:00:34.770> was

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
trackball and in the trackball there was

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.080 
trackball and in the trackball there was
like<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.010> separate<00:00:35.460> circuit<00:00:35.670> board<00:00:36.030> that

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
like a separate circuit board that

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.780 
like a separate circuit board that
housed<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.660> actual<00:00:37.110> optical<00:00:37.559> sensor<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.280> a

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
housed the actual optical sensor and a

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.639 
housed the actual optical sensor and a
short<00:00:39.090> ribbon<00:00:39.660> cable<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.020> went<00:00:40.230> from<00:00:40.500> that

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
short ribbon cable that went from that

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.310 
short ribbon cable that went from that
board<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.340> main<00:00:41.610> board<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.120> what<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.110> did

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
board to this main board and what I did

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.750 
board to this main board and what I did
is<00:00:43.440> basically<00:00:43.710> just<00:00:43.890> put<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> longer<00:00:44.399> piece<00:00:44.579> of

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
is basically just put a longer piece of

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.190 
is basically just put a longer piece of
wire<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.210> there<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.570> it's<00:00:45.750> got<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.020> same

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
wire in there so it's got the same

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.200 
wire in there so it's got the same
optical<00:00:46.680> sensor<00:00:47.100> as<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.370> original<00:00:47.730> trackball

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
optical sensor as the original trackball

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.139 
optical sensor as the original trackball
had<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> USB<00:00:50.280> cable<00:00:50.610> leaving

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
had and this is the USB cable leaving

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.040 
had and this is the USB cable leaving
from<00:00:51.390> here<00:00:51.629> going<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.170> computer<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:54.870> one

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
from here going to the computer the one

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.139 
from here going to the computer the one
thing<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.410> did<00:00:55.680> change<00:00:55.949> that's<00:00:56.370> kind<00:00:57.090> of

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
thing that I did change that's kind of

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.119 
thing that I did change that's kind of
interesting<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.020> light<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
interesting is that the light in the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.090 
interesting is that the light in the
original<00:00:59.550> device<00:01:00.449> was<00:01:00.690> red<00:01:00.989> or<00:01:01.649> actually<00:01:02.010> you

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
original device was red or actually you

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.280 
original device was red or actually you
think<00:01:02.280> whose<00:01:02.399> infrared<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.750> changed<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.260> to

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
think whose infrared and I changed it to

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.440 
think whose infrared and I changed it to
green<00:01:04.650> because<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.460> red<00:01:05.820> or<00:01:05.970> infrared

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
green because the red or infrared

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.170 
green because the red or infrared
illumination<00:01:07.049> was<00:01:07.619> absorbed<00:01:08.520> too<00:01:08.760> easily

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
illumination was absorbed too easily

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.600 
illumination was absorbed too easily
into<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.479> tongue<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:10.830> good<00:01:11.040> contrast

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
into the tongue so to get good contrast

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.340 
into the tongue so to get good contrast
on<00:01:11.909> things<00:01:12.180> moving<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.780> surface<00:01:13.170> I

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
on things moving on the surface I

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.640 
on things moving on the surface I
switched<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.770> green<00:01:13.979> light<00:01:15.080> also<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.110> added<00:01:16.409> a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
switched to green light also I added a

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.469 
switched to green light also I added a
little<00:01:16.830> bit<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.159> plastic<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:17.850> top<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.360> this

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
little bit of plastic on top of this

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.080 
little bit of plastic on top of this
optical<00:01:18.990> assembly<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.189> if<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.880> put

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
optical assembly so that if you put

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.820 
optical assembly so that if you put
something<00:01:21.299> flush<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:22.080> here<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.590> move<00:01:22.740> it

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
something flush on here and move it

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.280 
something flush on here and move it
across<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.430> focal<00:01:23.820> plane<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.390> optical

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
across the focal plane of the optical

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.960 
across the focal plane of the optical
sensor<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.950> set<00:01:26.220> up<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.369> be<00:01:26.520> right<00:01:26.790> at<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
sensor is set up to be right at the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.109 
sensor is set up to be right at the
surface<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.750> plastic<00:01:28.340> otherwise<00:01:29.340> with

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
surface of this plastic otherwise with

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.870 
surface of this plastic otherwise with
most<00:01:30.329> optical<00:01:30.869> mice<00:01:31.079> there's<00:01:31.890> error<00:01:32.400> between

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
most optical mice there's error between

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.359 
most optical mice there's error between
the<00:01:33.119> mousepad<00:01:33.600> surface<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.829> top<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
the mousepad surface and the top of the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.910 
the mousepad surface and the top of the
lens<00:01:35.579> or<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:35.939> bottom<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.869> lens<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.740> if<00:01:37.829> you

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
lens or the bottom of the lens so if you

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.289 
lens or the bottom of the lens so if you
just<00:01:38.070> pushed<00:01:38.310> your<00:01:38.460> finger<00:01:38.790> down<00:01:38.939> into<00:01:39.210> an

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
just pushed your finger down into an

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.410 
just pushed your finger down into an
optical<00:01:39.689> sensor<00:01:40.130> you'd<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.280> passed<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.060> focal

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
optical sensor you'd be passed the focal

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.780 
optical sensor you'd be passed the focal
point<00:01:42.659> you'd<00:01:42.810> be<00:01:42.960> too<00:01:43.140> close<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.799> no<00:01:44.369> movement

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
point you'd be too close and no movement

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.219 
point you'd be too close and no movement
would<00:01:44.850> be<00:01:44.909> detected<00:01:47.420> this<00:01:48.420> hack<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.930> mostly

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
would be detected this hack is mostly

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.319 
would be detected this hack is mostly
just<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.590> test<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.009> idea<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.640> using<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.090> cursor

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
just to test the idea of using a cursor

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.510 
just to test the idea of using a cursor
with<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.899> tongue<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.009> added<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.490> little

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
with the tongue and so I added a little

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.270 
with the tongue and so I added a little
button<00:01:54.030> here<00:01:54.329> just<00:01:54.630> for<00:01:54.979> you<00:01:55.979> know<00:01:56.100> just

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
button here just for you know just

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.249 
button here just for you know just
because<00:01:56.490> it's<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:56.820> easy<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.210> do<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.540> but<00:01:57.780> really

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
because it's so easy to do it but really

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.719 
because it's so easy to do it but really
I'm<00:01:58.530> mostly<00:01:58.770> interested<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.280> figuring<00:01:59.610> out

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
I'm mostly interested in figuring out

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.130 
I'm mostly interested in figuring out
what<00:01:59.790> kind<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.149> precision<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.689> actually

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
what kind of precision you can actually

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.560 
what kind of precision you can actually
get<00:02:01.350> by<00:02:01.860> moving<00:02:02.159> your<00:02:02.280> tongue<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.880> what<00:02:03.540> I

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
get by moving your tongue and what I

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.319 
get by moving your tongue and what I
found<00:02:03.810> out<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.500> for<00:02:04.770> precise<00:02:05.759> XY

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
found out is that for precise XY

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.150 
found out is that for precise XY
movements<00:02:06.899> like<00:02:07.020> cursor<00:02:07.439> control<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:08.039> the

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
movements like cursor control on the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.010 
movements like cursor control on the
screen<00:02:08.489> this<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.090> probably<00:02:09.479> not<00:02:09.629> going<00:02:09.899> to

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
screen this is probably not going to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.290 
screen this is probably not going to
work<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.470> just<00:02:10.500> don't<00:02:10.830> have<00:02:11.069> quite<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.970> level

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
work you just don't have quite the level

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.700 
work you just don't have quite the level
of<00:02:12.569> precision<00:02:12.959> needed

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
of precision needed

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.620 
of precision needed
that<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.340> do<00:02:14.460> with<00:02:14.640> like<00:02:14.850> hands<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.300> fingers

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
that you do with like hands and fingers

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.170 
that you do with like hands and fingers
to<00:02:15.660> do<00:02:15.930> precise<00:02:16.320> pointing<00:02:16.890> however<00:02:17.790> what

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
to do precise pointing however what

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.930 
to do precise pointing however what
might<00:02:18.420> work<00:02:18.600> pretty<00:02:18.900> well<00:02:18.990> is<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.620> do<00:02:19.940> swiping

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
might work pretty well is to do swiping

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.250 
might work pretty well is to do swiping
type<00:02:21.180> movements<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:22.410> on<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:23.330> UI<00:02:24.330> specifically

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
type movements so on a UI specifically

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.830 
type movements so on a UI specifically
designed<00:02:25.650> for<00:02:25.970> swiping<00:02:26.970> up<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.330> down<00:02:27.510> or<00:02:27.810> left

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
designed for swiping up and down or left

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.810 
designed for swiping up and down or left
and<00:02:28.200> right<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.710> could<00:02:29.190> probably<00:02:29.580> pretty

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
and right you could probably pretty

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.000 
and right you could probably pretty
reliably<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.540> effectively<00:02:30.960> and<00:02:31.320> easily<00:02:31.560> do

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
reliably and effectively and easily do

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.830 
reliably and effectively and easily do
that<00:02:32.040> with<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.580> tongue<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.600> wouldn't

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
that with the tongue and you wouldn't

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.440 
that with the tongue and you wouldn't
really<00:02:34.020> need<00:02:34.370> super-high<00:02:35.370> XY<00:02:35.820> positioning

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
really need super-high XY positioning

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.300 
really need super-high XY positioning
that<00:02:36.540> like<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.900> would<00:02:37.020> need<00:02:37.140> for<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.440> Windows

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
that like you would need for a Windows

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.590 
that like you would need for a Windows
type<00:02:38.640> interface<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:41.850> wire<00:02:42.060> is<00:02:42.360> pretty

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
type interface the wire is pretty

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.720 
type interface the wire is pretty
intrusive<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.470> also<00:02:43.710> did<00:02:44.490> a<00:02:44.520> quick

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
intrusive and so I also did a quick

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.790 
intrusive and so I also did a quick
experiment<00:02:45.420> with<00:02:45.570> this<00:02:45.750> which<00:02:45.990> is<00:02:46.020> a<00:02:46.170> wireless

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
experiment with this which is a wireless

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.210 
experiment with this which is a wireless
mouse<00:02:47.040> this<00:02:47.760> is<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:47.970> little<00:02:48.530> ring<00:02:49.530> mouse<00:02:49.740> made

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
mouse this is a little ring mouse made

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.150 
mouse this is a little ring mouse made
by<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.460> company<00:02:50.700> called<00:02:50.910> genius<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:52.860> idea

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
by a company called genius and the idea

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.530 
by a company called genius and the idea
was<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:53.610> would<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:54.060> know<00:02:54.150> put<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:54.390> on

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
was that you would you know put it on

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.260 
was that you would you know put it on
your<00:02:54.690> finger<00:02:55.020> like<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.710> had<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.310> had

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
your finger like this and it had a I had

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.880 
your finger like this and it had a I had
an<00:02:57.390> optical<00:02:57.870> window<00:02:58.200> over<00:02:58.470> here<00:02:58.710> that<00:02:58.860> you

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
an optical window over here that you

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.370 
an optical window over here that you
could<00:02:59.100> slide<00:02:59.340> your<00:02:59.550> finger<00:02:59.880> across<00:03:00.230> so<00:03:01.230> what<00:03:01.350> I

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
could slide your finger across so what I

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.280 
could slide your finger across so what I
did<00:03:01.500> is<00:03:01.770> take<00:03:02.370> all<00:03:02.550> that<00:03:02.700> apart<00:03:03.060> and

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
did is take all that apart and

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.180 
did is take all that apart and
unfortunately<00:03:04.290> I'm<00:03:04.350> missing<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.740> lens<00:03:04.950> now

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
unfortunately I'm missing the lens now

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.600 
unfortunately I'm missing the lens now
but<00:03:05.520> I<00:03:05.700> put<00:03:06.180> all<00:03:06.210> this<00:03:06.480> into<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.810> sealed<00:03:07.200> bag

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
but I put all this into a sealed bag

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.920 
but I put all this into a sealed bag
it's<00:03:08.610> even<00:03:08.820> got<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:08.970> lipo<00:03:09.390> battery<00:03:09.750> and

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
it's even got the lipo battery and

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.560 
it's even got the lipo battery and
everything<00:03:09.990> on<00:03:10.410> there<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:11.030> inside<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.180> bag<00:03:12.360> I

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
everything on there and inside the bag I

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.960 
everything on there and inside the bag I
put<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.840> lens<00:03:13.710> glued<00:03:14.130> on<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.520> it<00:03:14.640> so<00:03:14.760> that<00:03:14.880> this

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
put a lens glued on to it so that this

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.160 
put a lens glued on to it so that this
whole<00:03:15.120> thing<00:03:15.300> could<00:03:15.480> go<00:03:15.510> into<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.990> mouth

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
whole thing could go into the mouth

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.190 
whole thing could go into the mouth
inside<00:03:17.160> this<00:03:17.430> thermoplastic<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.540> retainer<00:03:21.200> so

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
inside this thermoplastic a retainer so

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.830 
inside this thermoplastic a retainer so
as<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:22.500> can<00:03:22.620> see<00:03:22.680> just<00:03:23.190> doing<00:03:23.490> normal<00:03:24.120> tasks

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
as you can see just doing normal tasks

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.500 
as you can see just doing normal tasks
in<00:03:24.960> a<00:03:25.050> Windows<00:03:25.350> type<00:03:25.620> environment<00:03:26.310> is<00:03:27.000> quite

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
in a Windows type environment is quite

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.750 
in a Windows type environment is quite
difficult<00:03:27.810> with<00:03:28.200> this<00:03:28.380> mouse<00:03:28.770> I'm<00:03:29.430> showing

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
difficult with this mouse I'm showing

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.940 
difficult with this mouse I'm showing
you<00:03:29.790> this<00:03:30.200> image<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.440> screen<00:03:31.740> being

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
you this image of the screen being

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.620 
you this image of the screen being
controlled<00:03:32.430> in<00:03:32.580> real<00:03:32.760> time<00:03:33.000> so<00:03:33.210> you<00:03:33.300> can<00:03:33.450> see

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
controlled in real time so you can see

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.830 
controlled in real time so you can see
how<00:03:33.810> much<00:03:33.960> difficulty<00:03:34.380> I'm<00:03:34.680> actually<00:03:34.890> having

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
how much difficulty I'm actually having

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.970 
how much difficulty I'm actually having
controlling<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.930> icons<00:03:39.530> one<00:03:40.530> additional

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
controlling the icons one additional

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.730 
controlling the icons one additional
difficulty<00:03:41.580> is<00:03:41.760> that<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:42.570> trackball<00:03:43.290> X<00:03:43.560> and

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
difficulty is that the trackball X and

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.780 
difficulty is that the trackball X and
y-axis<00:03:44.120> did<00:03:45.120> not<00:03:45.300> map<00:03:45.570> to<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:45.960> x<00:03:46.290> and<00:03:46.470> y<00:03:46.790> sort

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
y-axis did not map to the x and y sort

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.640 
y-axis did not map to the x and y sort
of<00:03:47.880> layout<00:03:48.330> of<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.750> mouse<00:03:48.930> so<00:03:49.200> if<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:49.500> think

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
of layout of the mouse so if you think

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.560 
of layout of the mouse so if you think
side-to-side<00:03:50.160> just<00:03:51.030> because<00:03:51.240> of<00:03:51.300> the<00:03:51.390> shape

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
side-to-side just because of the shape

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.570 
side-to-side just because of the shape
of<00:03:51.720> this<00:03:51.870> sensor<00:03:52.290> turns<00:03:53.250> out<00:03:53.460> that

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
of this sensor turns out that

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.490 
of this sensor turns out that
side-to-side<00:03:54.000> ended<00:03:54.540> up<00:03:54.660> being<00:03:54.900> fore-and-aft

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
side-to-side ended up being fore-and-aft

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.770 
side-to-side ended up being fore-and-aft
in<00:03:55.740> the<00:03:55.860> mouth<00:03:56.040> so<00:03:56.790> I'm<00:03:56.940> using<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.330> program

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
in the mouth so I'm using a program

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.500 
in the mouth so I'm using a program
called<00:03:57.960> autohotkey<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:59.550> swap<00:03:59.850> the<00:04:00.030> x<00:04:00.210> and<00:04:00.390> y

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510

footage of me playing an FPS game with
using<00:04:09.300> boss<00:04:09.480> D<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.900> move<00:04:10.020> around<00:04:10.320> but<00:04:10.620> not

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
using boss D to move around but not

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
using the mouse at all for Direction

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.070 
using the mouse at all for Direction
control<00:04:13.530> and<00:04:14.070> it<00:04:14.790> would<00:04:14.910> be<00:04:15.030> basically<00:04:15.810> pretty

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
control and it would be basically pretty

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.500 
control and it would be basically pretty
much<00:04:16.140> impossible<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:17.010> play<00:04:17.190> this<00:04:17.400> way<00:04:17.670> the

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
much impossible to play this way the

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.940 
much impossible to play this way the
precision<00:04:18.960> needed<00:04:18.989> for<00:04:19.470> aiming<00:04:19.799> and<00:04:19.920> shooting

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
at targets in a game like this is just

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.500 
at targets in a game like this is just
far<00:04:22.440> more<00:04:22.650> than<00:04:22.800> you<00:04:22.890> can<00:04:23.100> really<00:04:23.370> do<00:04:23.580> but<00:04:24.390> like

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
far more than you can really do but like

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.430 
far more than you can really do but like
I<00:04:24.540> say<00:04:24.810> for<00:04:25.340> for<00:04:26.340> swiping<00:04:26.820> and

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
I say for for swiping and

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.170 
I say for for swiping and
sort<00:04:27.830> of<00:04:27.890> gross<00:04:28.190> movements<00:04:28.760> like<00:04:28.880> you<00:04:29.030> might

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
sort of gross movements like you might

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.150 
sort of gross movements like you might
use<00:04:29.420> with<00:04:29.720> like<00:04:30.320> a<00:04:30.350> hat<00:04:30.560> switch<00:04:30.860> or<00:04:31.040> something

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
use with like a hat switch or something

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.830 
use with like a hat switch or something
on<00:04:31.490> a<00:04:31.520> joystick<00:04:32.030> there<00:04:32.330> could<00:04:32.540> be<00:04:32.570> some

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
on a joystick there could be some

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.700 
on a joystick there could be some
possibilities<00:04:33.590> there<00:04:35.140> one<00:04:36.140> reason<00:04:36.500> why<00:04:36.650> you

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
possibilities there one reason why you

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.650 
possibilities there one reason why you
might<00:04:36.980> go<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:37.250> the<00:04:37.460> extremes<00:04:37.910> of<00:04:38.060> using<00:04:38.420> a

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
might go to the extremes of using a

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.660 
might go to the extremes of using a
mouse<00:04:39.260> you<00:04:39.770> know<00:04:39.860> a<00:04:39.890> tongue<00:04:40.190> controller

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
mouse you know a tongue controller

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.300 
mouse you know a tongue controller
basically<00:04:41.200> is<00:04:42.200> for<00:04:42.500> environments<00:04:43.070> where<00:04:43.220> you

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
basically is for environments where you

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.490 
basically is for environments where you
don't<00:04:43.640> have<00:04:43.880> a<00:04:43.940> keyboard<00:04:44.360> or<00:04:44.690> mouse<00:04:44.870> or<00:04:45.200> even

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
don't have a keyboard or mouse or even

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.020 
don't have a keyboard or mouse or even
that<00:04:45.770> you're<00:04:45.920> sitting<00:04:46.310> somewhere<00:04:46.790> that<00:04:46.940> you

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
that you're sitting somewhere that you

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.660 
that you're sitting somewhere that you
can<00:04:47.180> use<00:04:47.390> a<00:04:47.420> computer<00:04:47.990> like<00:04:48.170> that<00:04:48.250> so<00:04:49.250> we<00:04:49.460> might

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
can use a computer like that so we might

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.460 
can use a computer like that so we might
think<00:04:49.820> of<00:04:50.000> applications<00:04:50.660> like<00:04:50.810> augmented

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
think of applications like augmented

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.740 
think of applications like augmented
reality<00:04:51.500> or<00:04:52.340> Google<00:04:52.850> glass<00:04:53.120> type<00:04:53.420> things

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
reality or Google glass type things

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.300 
reality or Google glass type things
where<00:04:54.050> you<00:04:54.200> want<00:04:54.230> to<00:04:54.560> have<00:04:54.680> some<00:04:54.980> sort<00:04:55.250> of

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
where you want to have some sort of

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.010 
where you want to have some sort of
computer<00:04:55.640> control<00:04:56.210> but<00:04:56.450> you<00:04:56.510> really<00:04:56.780> don't

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
computer control but you really don't

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.420 
computer control but you really don't
want<00:04:57.200> to<00:04:57.230> burden<00:04:57.440> your<00:04:57.680> hands<00:04:57.890> with<00:04:58.130> doing
