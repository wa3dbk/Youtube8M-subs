was<00:00:48.450> one<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.719> first<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.260> know<00:00:49.379> while

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
was one of the first you know while

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.700

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
lente which in Latin means make haste

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.319

slowly<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.760> sent<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.210> out<00:00:57.270> to

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
slowly and we sent it out to

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.970
