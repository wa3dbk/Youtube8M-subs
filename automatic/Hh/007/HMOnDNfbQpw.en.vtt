00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.760
 life was not as he expected no 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.520
 he had it with life in itself but of 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.810
 sure he had it to himself when he is 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.330
 was the last time he was 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.129
 really happy when it was the last 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.830
 time when he woke up in the morning and 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.350
 he thought this will be a real treat 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.840
 day finally passed his 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.860
 exams a year ago but just to deal with 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.280
 unemployment 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.980
 this certainly didn't help this 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.280
 that's not what he expected at 32 years old 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.870
 he feels that he has not concluded much 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.390
 full instruction for half aisles 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.090
 degrading jobs were certainly not things 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.620
 of which life is certainly not proud 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.450
 it was like the one he had imagined 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.149
 when I was a child 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:08.140
 twenty years ago it all seemed so far away 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:09.789
 as in another life and tweet boys without 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.039
 half terms is a game you leave 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:13.869
 tremendously take from nostalgia and 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.340
 after this intro where we understood 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.250
 the mood of our protagonist 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.390
 we will have an almost unexpected turn afterwards 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.430
 having continued his monologue 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.200
 thinking back to the good times in which he dreamed of 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.819
 create video games that at the time were 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.649
 very different from those he plays now 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:28.899
 he looks for his old woman 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.580
 8-bit console which then results 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.319
 clearly a master system 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.929
 because of the cartridge that comes 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:36.310
 finally showed the boy on video 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.130
 in the pile of his old video games 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.360
 I find a cassette with no title than one 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.979
 once inserted in the console 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.170
 apparently it sucks him into the 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.250
 game itself making it live a new one 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.500
 adventure 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:53.020
 indeed a new old adventure in 8 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.640
 bit luckily at the beginning of the game 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.130
 we can choose whether to play the title 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.619
 in kid mode alias with many 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.440
 help and easy life or in good health 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.050
 beneficial body retro mode comes 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.910
 killed no continues no checkpoints 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.520
 and bailouts only if you find coins 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.470
 secret that allow you to save that 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.010
 I tell you to do if you don't play backwards 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.110
 you are nobody and the tweet boy turns out 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.060
 suffer particular influences at least for 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.010
 as seen mainly by two 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.420
 super mario titles 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.760
 obviously because of the gameplay of 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.709
 world levels and jump over enemies 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.330
 without counting all the various references 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.750
 that you are definitely in this video 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.190
 noting both some siga titles 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.080
 mainly the wonder boy series by 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.440
 where we can appreciate texture enemies 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.330
 graphic choices and some types of level 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.630
 the game controls are simple and a lot 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.700
 intuitive jump and action where the action 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.590
 it will generally be an attack you can 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.990
 follow in case we have power 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.540
 up will generally be very similar 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.980
 to the flaming balls of supermario not 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.590
 I will miss a myriad of steps 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.600
 more or less detectable secrets and if 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.770
 played in retro mode without putting yourself 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.990
 looking for the latter 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.300
 listen to me you will never find a 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.100
 so you are a rescue token 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.890
 guys who like challenges or are you 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.110
 players born in the 70s 80s and often 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.580
 the two things coincide 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.650
 although it bit boy can make people smile 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.750
 and at times move the player more 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.940
 old 8 on the other could irritate 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.160
 the youngest gamer maybe seen the 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.569
 mechanical a bit complicated to manage 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.680
 as millimeter movements with which 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.390
 we will have to do 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.790
 due to the restricted platforms with 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.440
 which we often go to argue for lack 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.480
 acceleration when we are up 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.200
 mobile platforms and above all 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.220
 stiffness obviously wanted in the movements 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.680
 the thing that immediately seemed to me 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.810
 nice is that the game points to give a 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.450
 classic and pure gameplay and not so much 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.950
 justified by similar plots 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.170
 who found himself in that world that 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.720
 belongs to your past kill enemies 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.100
 and go ahead with no other purpose if 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.400
 not to have a direct challenge 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.600
 with the game and put yourself to the test 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.720
 unfortunately the title has a big one 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.310
 lack of poor variety of enemies 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.740
 attack patterns of the latter e 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.569
 especially levels too but too much 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.430
 similar to each other and I do not mean 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.470
 only the worlds that contain levels 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.720
 in broad lines all the same but 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.760
 simply that every world is a 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.620
 change of theme but in the end are the 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.880
 same maps and masked enemies for 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.880
 be adapted to a particular 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.859
 context and the tweet boys you can find 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.509
 shortly on steam is a game that 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.830
 I really recommend that slice 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:25.690
 of public that wants to live again 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.380
 all those details and clichÃ©s that 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.410
 characterizes 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.450
 cavani games 8 bit 80 and 90 years created 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.390
 apparently from whom that era has it 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.670
 really lived is how I regret it 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.650
 a little bit and although games like are born 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.620
 this nobody could use the titles 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.990
 for mega drive neo neo nes master system 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.940
 snes since the social context 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.470
 technological that we live there does not exist 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.110
 would let those years enjoy them like that 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.420
 he lived for what they were unfortunately 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.070
 and the big boi suffers from the scarce 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.380
 longevity due to gameplay perhaps 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.020
 too short and a style of play often 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.180
 monotonous and also after a while 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.160
 that can be played easily 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.960
 as a resolution unless you 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.970
 traits of boss fights 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.070
 at least they can pull out 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.780
 moments of real frustration that 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.550
 at the time they took you to turn off the 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.830
 console and think of anything else 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.270
 so much the next time you 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.410
 you should have been put back in front of the 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.000
 television 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.830
 you should have started everything from 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.540
 head 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.310
 here is everything for today from france 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.310
 let's review the next video
