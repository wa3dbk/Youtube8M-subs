mysterious the Chinese figured out how

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.580 
mysterious the Chinese figured out how
to<00:01:11.860> how<00:01:12.400> to<00:01:12.460> work<00:01:12.670> with<00:01:12.850> it<00:01:13.000> and<00:01:13.180> Gong<00:01:13.960> means

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
to how to work with it and Gong means

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.980 
to how to work with it and Gong means
work<00:01:14.980> but<00:01:15.730> we<00:01:15.850> can<00:01:16.000> think<00:01:16.090> about<00:01:16.210> is<00:01:16.480> workout

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
work but we can think about is workout

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.930 
work but we can think about is workout
so<00:01:17.440> if<00:01:17.500> you<00:01:17.590> put<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:17.890> two<00:01:18.070> words<00:01:18.280> together<00:01:18.730> you

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
so if you put the two words together you

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.060 
so if you put the two words together you
get<00:01:19.060> Qigong<00:01:19.480> it's<00:01:20.140> a<00:01:20.260> workout<00:01:20.650> for<00:01:20.950> your

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
get Qigong it's a workout for your

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.100

principles that you explore when you're
doing<00:01:25.900> Qigong<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:27.160> first<00:01:27.490> is<00:01:27.790> how<00:01:28.090> well<00:01:28.420> is

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
doing Qigong the first is how well is

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.040 
doing Qigong the first is how well is
your<00:01:28.810> energy<00:01:29.260> flowing<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:31.240> Chi<00:01:31.510> of<00:01:31.540> your<00:01:31.840> body

notice how I feel I can notice how the
other<00:02:31.550> person<00:02:32.390> feels<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:32.810> then<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:33.290> can<00:02:33.440> play

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
other person feels and then I can play

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.979 
other person feels and then I can play
back<00:02:34.130> and<00:02:34.310> forth<00:02:34.550> with<00:02:34.730> our<00:02:34.760> energy<00:02:35.270> to<00:02:35.750> bring

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
back and forth with our energy to bring

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.570 
back and forth with our energy to bring
it<00:02:36.140> into<00:02:36.290> balance<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:37.010> bring<00:02:37.220> more<00:02:37.430> energy

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
it into balance and to bring more energy

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.150 
it into balance and to bring more energy
about<00:02:38.060> now<00:02:38.989> I'm<00:02:39.080> going<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.319> show<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:39.770> short

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
about now I'm going to show you a short

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.340 
about now I'm going to show you a short
set<00:02:40.430> of<00:02:40.550> dragon<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.030> tiger<00:02:41.330> Qigong<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:41.959> I'll

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
set of dragon and tiger Qigong and I'll

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.229 
set of dragon and tiger Qigong and I'll
just<00:02:42.560> explain<00:02:43.160> just<00:02:43.430> a<00:02:43.520> little<00:02:43.850> bit<00:02:44.030> about

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
just explain just a little bit about

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.080 
just explain just a little bit about
each<00:02:44.569> movement<00:02:45.050> as<00:02:45.110> we<00:02:45.260> go<00:02:45.380> along<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:46.850> first

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
each movement as we go along the first

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.240 
each movement as we go along the first
move<00:02:47.360> is<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.690> warm-up<00:02:48.140> where<00:02:48.350> I<00:02:48.380> stir<00:02:48.800> Qi<00:02:49.100> and

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
move is the warm-up where I stir Qi and

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.100 
move is the warm-up where I stir Qi and
connect<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:50.090> energy<00:02:50.420> of<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.630> environment

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
connect to the energy of the environment

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.800 
connect to the energy of the environment
around<00:02:51.170> me<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.620> earth<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:53.540> sky<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:55.310> water

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
around me the earth the sky the water

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.600 
around me the earth the sky the water
and<00:02:56.810> then<00:02:57.800> I<00:02:57.830> begin<00:02:58.220> with<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.580> first<00:02:58.760> exercise

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
and then I begin with the first exercise

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.090 
and then I begin with the first exercise
which<00:03:01.610> is<00:03:01.640> called<00:03:01.970> dragon<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:02.600> Tiger<00:03:02.959> meet<00:03:03.200> it

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
which is called dragon and Tiger meet it

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.970 
which is called dragon and Tiger meet it
brings<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.760> energy<00:03:04.910> of<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.360> earth<00:03:05.620> up<00:03:06.620> into

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
brings the energy of the earth up into

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.790 
brings the energy of the earth up into
my<00:03:07.100> body<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:08.050> activates<00:03:09.050> especially<00:03:09.650> my

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
my body and activates especially my

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.090 
my body and activates especially my
lungs<00:03:10.100> and<00:03:10.430> my<00:03:10.580> liver<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:12.470> second<00:03:12.890> exercise

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
lungs and my liver the second exercise

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.570 
lungs and my liver the second exercise
is<00:03:13.900> called<00:03:14.900> dragon<00:03:15.440> looks<00:03:15.680> to<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:15.980> horizon

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
is called dragon looks to the horizon

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.259 
is called dragon looks to the horizon
and<00:03:17.800> this<00:03:18.800> continues<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.700> process<00:03:19.910> of

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
and this continues the process of

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.030 
and this continues the process of
bringing<00:03:20.450> energy<00:03:20.660> up<00:03:21.050> through<00:03:21.080> my<00:03:21.530> body<00:03:21.739> and

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
bringing energy up through my body and

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.740 
bringing energy up through my body and
out<00:03:22.130> into<00:03:22.280> my<00:03:22.489> arms<00:03:22.850> and<00:03:23.030> I<00:03:23.090> start<00:03:23.360> to<00:03:23.450> release

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
out into my arms and I start to release

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.920 
out into my arms and I start to release
the<00:03:24.049> stagnant<00:03:24.500> energy<00:03:24.890> out<00:03:25.010> of<00:03:25.040> my<00:03:25.250> system<00:03:25.930> the

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
the stagnant energy out of my system the

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.789 
the stagnant energy out of my system the
third<00:03:27.440> is<00:03:28.160> called<00:03:28.280> Tiger<00:03:28.910> crouches<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:29.810> this

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
third is called Tiger crouches and this

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.740 
third is called Tiger crouches and this
is<00:03:30.950> where<00:03:31.130> I<00:03:31.160> go<00:03:31.370> down<00:03:31.579> I<00:03:31.610> get<00:03:32.030> a<00:03:32.060> lot<00:03:32.329> of<00:03:32.360> energy

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
is where I go down I get a lot of energy

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.270 
is where I go down I get a lot of energy
and<00:03:32.840> really<00:03:33.200> bring<00:03:33.410> it<00:03:33.560> in<00:03:33.680> up<00:03:33.860> through<00:03:34.130> my

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
and really bring it in up through my

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.660 
and really bring it in up through my
