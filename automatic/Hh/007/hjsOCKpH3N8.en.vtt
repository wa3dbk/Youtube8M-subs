flasher deluxe designed by Kyle Kuya
this<00:00:08.519> is<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.910> model<00:00:09.660> that<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:09.990> accidentally

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
this is a model that I accidentally

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.930 
this is a model that I accidentally
designed<00:00:11.099> -<00:00:12.110> so<00:00:13.110> let's<00:00:13.320> get<00:00:13.440> started<00:00:13.980> start

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
designed - so let's get started start

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.689 
designed - so let's get started start
with<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.210> square<00:00:15.630> sheet<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:15.929> paper<00:00:17.779> and

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
with the square sheet of paper and

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.580 
with the square sheet of paper and
divide<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.850> into<00:00:20.970> sixteenths<00:00:24.380> first<00:00:25.380> by

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
divide it into sixteenths first by

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:37.299 
divide it into sixteenths first by
folding<00:00:26.010> into<00:00:26.160> half<00:00:28.550> into<00:00:29.689> fourths

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:50.600 

then<00:00:38.309> eights<00:00:44.539> heaven<00:00:45.539> finally<00:00:49.610> sixteenths

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
then eights heaven finally sixteenths

00:00:50.610 --> 00:01:48.899 
then eights heaven finally sixteenths
and<00:01:06.650> do<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.159> other<00:01:08.310> side

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.639 

and<00:01:49.909> then<00:01:50.030> unfold<00:01:50.569> completely<00:01:50.899> I<00:01:53.470> will<00:01:54.470> wait

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
and then unfold completely I will wait

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:09.759 
and then unfold completely I will wait
until<00:01:54.860> you<00:01:55.280> done

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.160 

this<00:02:10.769> model<00:02:11.189> is<00:02:11.370> essentially<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.030> top<00:02:12.329> of<00:02:12.689> a

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
this model is essentially the top of a

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:20.780 
this model is essentially the top of a
flashier<00:02:13.680> hat<00:02:16.609> so<00:02:18.560> take<00:02:19.560> up<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.799> pen<00:02:19.980> locate

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
flashier hat so take up the pen locate

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.220 
flashier hat so take up the pen locate
the<00:02:21.090> center<00:02:21.659> four<00:02:22.079> squares<00:02:23.569> which<00:02:24.569> is<00:02:24.870> right

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
the center four squares which is right

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.449 
the center four squares which is right
here<00:02:25.739> for<00:02:26.040> me

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
here for me

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:34.640 
here for me
and<00:02:27.590> then<00:02:28.819> draw<00:02:29.819> a<00:02:30.180> mountain<00:02:32.810> diagonal<00:02:33.810> dot

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
and then draw a mountain diagonal dot

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.839 
and then draw a mountain diagonal dot
diamond<00:02:36.290> around<00:02:37.290> like<00:02:37.620> this<00:02:39.889> next<00:02:40.889> you<00:02:41.730> want

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
diamond around like this next you want

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:51.770 
diamond around like this next you want
to<00:02:42.000> extend<00:02:43.370> this<00:02:44.370> creases<00:02:45.060> like<00:02:45.090> this<00:02:50.780> and

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
to extend this creases like this and

00:02:51.780 --> 00:03:09.190 
to extend this creases like this and
then<00:02:54.409> hold<00:02:55.409> like<00:02:55.620> that

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:50.910 

and<00:03:10.200> then

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.410 

next<00:03:51.920> you<00:03:52.849> want<00:03:52.970> to<00:03:53.150> take<00:03:53.450> this<00:03:54.849> and<00:03:55.849> then

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
next you want to take this and then

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:07.149 
next you want to take this and then
continue<00:03:57.049> drawing<00:03:57.620> this<00:04:00.489> like<00:04:01.489> this<00:04:06.099> so<00:04:07.099> that

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 
continue drawing this like this so that

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:09.280 
continue drawing this like this so that
these<00:04:07.579> square<00:04:08.209> things<00:04:08.540> line<00:04:08.959> up<00:04:09.110> with<00:04:09.260> each

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
these square things line up with each

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:35.080 
these square things line up with each
other<00:04:09.909> like<00:04:10.909> this<00:04:32.320> and<00:04:33.580> you<00:04:34.580> want<00:04:34.760> to<00:04:34.880> keep

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
other like this and you want to keep

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.210 
other like this and you want to keep
doing<00:04:35.150> that<00:04:35.690> until<00:04:35.960> you<00:04:36.740> reached<00:04:38.650> all<00:04:39.650> the

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
doing that until you reached all the

00:04:40.220 --> 00:05:36.870 
doing that until you reached all the
other<00:04:40.460> edges<00:04:41.000> of<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:41.360> squares

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:07:12.369 

until<00:05:37.880> it<00:05:38.000> reaches<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:38.360> corner<00:05:38.840> like<00:05:39.110> that

00:07:12.369 --> 00:07:12.379 

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:16.719 

and<00:07:13.379> that<00:07:13.589> is<00:07:13.919> the<00:07:14.189> crease<00:07:14.729> pattern<00:07:15.529> for<00:07:16.529> the

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:16.729 
and that is the crease pattern for the

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:21.129 
and that is the crease pattern for the
flasher<00:07:17.749> for<00:07:18.749> the<00:07:18.899> full<00:07:19.229> slash<00:07:20.069> of<00:07:20.309> the<00:07:20.429> look

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:21.139 
flasher for the full slash of the look

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:25.040 
flasher for the full slash of the look
the<00:07:22.139> next<00:07:22.289> thing<00:07:22.589> I<00:07:22.679> want<00:07:22.889> you<00:07:23.069> to<00:07:23.129> do<00:07:23.429> is<00:07:24.050> to

00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:27.629 
pinch all of the blue lines you just

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:30.350 
pinch all of the blue lines you just
they<00:07:28.529> don't<00:07:28.709> have<00:07:28.800> to<00:07:28.919> be<00:07:29.009> blue<00:07:29.249> all<00:07:29.459> the<00:07:29.519> lines

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 
they don't have to be blue all the lines

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.029 
they don't have to be blue all the lines
that<00:07:30.569> you<00:07:30.629> just<00:07:30.990> drew<00:07:32.360> plus<00:07:33.360> all<00:07:34.139> the<00:07:34.499> lines<00:07:34.740> in

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 
that you just drew plus all the lines in

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:37.609 
that you just drew plus all the lines in
the<00:07:35.189> middle<00:07:36.110> like<00:07:37.110> this

00:07:37.609 --> 00:07:37.619 
the middle like this

00:07:37.619 --> 00:07:47.209 
the middle like this
but<00:07:38.159> Valley<00:07:38.490> folded<00:07:45.349> so<00:07:46.349> all<00:07:46.589> the<00:07:46.740> lines<00:07:46.949> in

00:07:47.209 --> 00:07:47.219 
but Valley folded so all the lines in

00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:56.749 
but Valley folded so all the lines in
between<00:07:48.559> like<00:07:49.559> that<00:07:52.639> but<00:07:53.639> valleys<00:07:55.759> once

00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:56.759 
between like that but valleys once

00:07:56.759 --> 00:08:01.610 
between like that but valleys once
you're<00:07:56.939> done<00:07:57.089> we'll<00:07:57.539> be<00:07:57.569> moving<00:07:58.050> on<00:07:58.369> apart<00:07:59.369> too
