 xenopsylla cheopis 1465 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.420
 We used the Helix for Naomi 115 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:22.280
 Not responsible for their high blood pressure 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.020
 But they seem alive 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.520
 Ruling feeling great 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.800
 Although he sounds awful 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.420
 He brings horrific events to the city 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.940
 All of us will fall down 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.900
 We will all fall 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.080
 All of us will fall down 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.700
 We will all fall 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.980
 Witness on brotherhood we will not be free 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.400
 In the Planet Earth Laboratory 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.280
 In the middle I and you 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.320
 He made them watch me 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.080
 And I told them to lock everything around me 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.480
 All of you seem terrible 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.120
 We will all fall down 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.900
 We will all fall 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.680
 We will all fall down 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.280
 We will all fall 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.100
 You will end up in hummingbirds 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.340
 And we will suffocate ashes 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.980
 And all of us will fall down 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.540
 Illusion will live longer 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.760
 Hear him sing and 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.780
 He yells at his national anthem 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.800
 I feel bad 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.780
 Crying 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.800
 They run away 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.820
 Coming 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.960
 Directional 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.040
 Very painful 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.240
 To see 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.040
 We will all fall down 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.960
 We will all fall 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.680
 We will all fall down 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.300
 We will all fall 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.960
 We'll end up in hummingbirds 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.020
 And we will suffocate ashes 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.020
 And we will all fall down 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.420
 We will end in the ashes of their lies 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.660
 We can see the light in our eyes 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.020
 But even shocked 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.860
 And every atom shatter 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.620
 All our minds will disappear 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.360
 You will end up in hummingbirds 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.220
 And we will suffocate ashes 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.120
 And will drop !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
