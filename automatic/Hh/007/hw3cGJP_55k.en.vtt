00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
because he's doing that over the turn

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.560

the bass bar goes to the 4 chord he
starts<00:00:52.140> out<00:00:52.260> with<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:53.780> ok<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:54.930> then

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:04.810 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.120 

so<00:01:05.810> again<00:01:06.110> while<00:01:06.320> this<00:01:06.470> may<00:01:06.620> be<00:01:06.650> a<00:01:06.800> part<00:01:07.040> of

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
so again while this may be a part of

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.070 
so again while this may be a part of
tore<00:01:07.370> down<00:01:07.520> it's<00:01:07.790> kind<00:01:07.970> of<00:01:08.060> a<00:01:08.120> cool<00:01:08.330> turn

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
tore down it's kind of a cool turn

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:16.450 
tore down it's kind of a cool turn
around<00:01:14.140> and<00:01:15.140> there's<00:01:15.560> this<00:01:15.710> cool<00:01:15.980> technique

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
around and there's this cool technique

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.800 
around and there's this cool technique
that<00:01:16.610> he's<00:01:16.730> doing<00:01:17.000> where<00:01:17.120> he's<00:01:17.270> like<00:01:17.450> going

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
that he's doing where he's like going

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.450 
that he's doing where he's like going
you<00:01:18.080> know<00:01:18.260> I<00:01:18.560> think<00:01:18.620> of<00:01:18.890> it<00:01:18.980> as<00:01:19.100> sort<00:01:19.250> of<00:01:19.370> a

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
you know I think of it as sort of a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:38.970 
you know I think of it as sort of a
backwards<00:01:20.000> thing

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.440 

cool<00:01:39.980> so<00:01:40.430> a<00:01:40.460> lot<00:01:40.610> of<00:01:40.730> times<00:01:40.940> when<00:01:41.210> you're<00:01:41.330> doing

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
cool so a lot of times when you're doing

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:49.840 
cool so a lot of times when you're doing
stuff<00:01:41.780> with<00:01:41.960> your<00:01:42.080> pentatonic<00:01:42.860> scales<00:01:48.850> see

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
stuff with your pentatonic scales see

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.610 
stuff with your pentatonic scales see
how<00:01:49.910> I'm<00:01:49.970> going<00:01:50.150> backwards<00:01:50.360> on<00:01:50.690> that<00:01:50.900> or<00:01:51.110> would

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
how I'm going backwards on that or would

00:01:51.620 --> 00:02:09.760 
how I'm going backwards on that or would
I<00:01:51.650> consider<00:01:51.920> backwards<00:02:07.899> alright<00:02:08.899> so<00:02:09.289> a<00:02:09.320> couple

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
I consider backwards alright so a couple

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.500 
I consider backwards alright so a couple
of<00:02:09.860> things<00:02:10.040> here<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:10.250> use<00:02:10.729> of<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.090> sixth

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
of things here that use of the sixth

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.330 
of things here that use of the sixth
again<00:02:11.810> use<00:02:12.380> of<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.709> ninth<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:14.750> band<00:02:15.340> and

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
again use of the ninth and a band and

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.280 
again use of the ninth and a band and
he's<00:02:16.520> bending<00:02:16.760> it<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.209> major<00:02:17.600> third<00:02:18.020> even

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
he's bending it to a major third even

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.840 
he's bending it to a major third even
though<00:02:18.380> we're<00:02:18.530> thinking<00:02:18.980> mostly<00:02:19.370> minor

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
though we're thinking mostly minor

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.479 
though we're thinking mostly minor
pentatonic<00:02:20.239> main<00:02:20.840> pentatonic<00:02:21.560> instead<00:02:22.370> of

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
pentatonic main pentatonic instead of

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.310 
pentatonic main pentatonic instead of
bending<00:02:22.850> to<00:02:22.970> that<00:02:23.120> flat<00:02:23.540> third<00:02:23.810> he's<00:02:23.959> bending

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
bending to that flat third he's bending

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.650 
bending to that flat third he's bending
through<00:02:24.500> it<00:02:24.709> up<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.070> major<00:02:25.250> third<00:02:28.660> now

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
through it up to the major third now

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.030 
through it up to the major third now
actually<00:02:30.080> not<00:02:30.230> in<00:02:30.290> this<00:02:30.380> song<00:02:30.560> he's<00:02:30.680> not<00:02:30.860> but

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
actually not in this song he's not but

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:42.000 
actually not in this song he's not but
sometimes<00:02:31.430> he<00:02:31.550> does<00:02:33.400> yeah<00:02:34.400> he<00:02:34.550> does<00:02:34.700> sometimes

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.320
