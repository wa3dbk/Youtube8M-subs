00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
overview of the three different types

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.090 
overview of the three different types
that<00:00:03.389> you've<00:00:03.689> got<00:00:03.899> you've<00:00:04.500> said<00:00:04.740> like<00:00:04.920> are

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
that you've got you've said like are

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.900 
that you've got you've said like are
these<00:00:05.190> things<00:00:05.490> I'm<00:00:05.640> not

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
these things I'm not

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.460 
these things I'm not
what's<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.330> were<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.810> names<00:00:07.020> of<00:00:07.290> them<00:00:07.440> and

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
what's the were the names of them and

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.570 
what's the were the names of them and
what's<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:08.660> same<00:00:09.660> basic<00:00:09.990> principle<00:00:10.580> I'm

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
what's the same basic principle I'm

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.400 
what's the same basic principle I'm
calling<00:00:11.969> it<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.120> rocket<00:00:12.360> hybrid<00:00:12.900> for<00:00:13.080> now<00:00:13.200> it's

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
calling it a rocket hybrid for now it's

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.440 
calling it a rocket hybrid for now it's
a<00:00:13.469> hybridized<00:00:13.860> rocket<00:00:14.309> stove<00:00:14.549> right<00:00:15.030> so

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
a hybridized rocket stove right so

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.540 
a hybridized rocket stove right so
rocket<00:00:16.199> stove<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.710> principles<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.369> rocket

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
rocket stove the principles of a rocket

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.450 
rocket stove the principles of a rocket
stove<00:00:17.940> are<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.720> elbow<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.590> insulation<00:00:20.250> I

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
stove are the elbow and the insulation I

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.779 
stove are the elbow and the insulation I
have<00:00:21.210> replaced<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.810> insulation<00:00:22.580> but<00:00:23.580> wood

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
have replaced the insulation but wood

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.000 
have replaced the insulation but wood
chip<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:24.930> what<00:00:25.230> ship<00:00:25.410> comes<00:00:25.650> out<00:00:25.830> through

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
chip so that what ship comes out through

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.650 
chip so that what ship comes out through
that<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.279> hatch<00:00:26.490> then<00:00:27.150> that's<00:00:27.300> full<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.480> wood

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
that and hatch then that's full of wood

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.200 
that and hatch then that's full of wood
chip<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.500> I've<00:00:28.710> not<00:00:28.949> little<00:00:29.519> holes<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:30.090> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
chip and I've not little holes in the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.780 
chip and I've not little holes in the
bottom<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.779> elbow<00:00:31.099> so<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.279> wood<00:00:32.489> chip

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
bottom of the elbow so the wood chip

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.420 
bottom of the elbow so the wood chip
gives<00:00:33.540> off<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.870> gas<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.380> can't<00:00:34.649> combust<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
gives off the gas it can't combust the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.209 
gives off the gas it can't combust the
gases<00:00:36.270> go<00:00:36.450> through<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.870> holes<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:38.160> you

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
gases go through the holes and so you

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.400 
gases go through the holes and so you
have<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.579> combustion<00:00:39.090> chamber<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:39.870> a

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
have a combustion chamber and a

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.920 
have a combustion chamber and a
pyrolysis<00:00:40.739> chamber<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.790> that's<00:00:42.510> pyrolysis

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
pyrolysis chamber and that's pyrolysis

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.410 
pyrolysis chamber and that's pyrolysis
oxygen-starved<00:00:43.940> combustion<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.059> burning<00:00:45.360> in

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
oxygen-starved combustion is burning in

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.319 
oxygen-starved combustion is burning in
the<00:00:45.480> presence<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.870> air<00:00:46.489> so<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> same

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
the presence of air so this is the same

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:57.889 
the presence of air so this is the same
as<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:54.350> promote<00:00:55.350> combustion<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.600> this<00:00:57.600> is

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
as this promote combustion and this is

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.630 
as this promote combustion and this is

the<00:01:26.280> fam<00:01:27.030> just<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.720> computer<00:01:28.110> fan<00:01:28.229> on<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.560> side

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
the fam just a computer fan on this side

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.359 
the fam just a computer fan on this side
so<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.939> minute<00:01:30.530> fan<00:01:31.530> blowing<00:01:31.799> air<00:01:32.130> through

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
so the minute fan blowing air through

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.649 
so the minute fan blowing air through
these<00:01:32.490> holes<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.119> top

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
these holes in the top

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.920 
these holes in the top
the<00:01:34.290> minute<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.890> air<00:01:35.100> hits<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.970> smoke<00:01:36.240> you

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
the minute the air hits the smoke you

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.569 
the minute the air hits the smoke you
get<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> most<00:01:37.380> impressive<00:01:37.890> smoke<00:01:38.340> free

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
get the most impressive smoke free

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:45.830 
get the most impressive smoke free
combustion<00:01:43.729> you<00:01:44.729> have<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.329> quench<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.720> with

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
combustion you have to quench it with

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.020 
combustion you have to quench it with
water<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.530> difficult<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.100> light<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.670> then

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
water it's difficult to light and then

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.539 
water it's difficult to light and then
you<00:01:48.329> got<00:01:48.570> like<00:01:48.750> hands<00:01:48.960> how<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.009> do<00:01:50.250> with<00:01:50.430> this

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
you got like hands how you do with this

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.520 
you got like hands how you do with this
but<00:01:50.759> yeah<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.540> should<00:01:51.810> learn<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:51.990> use<00:01:52.110> gloves<00:01:52.439> a

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
but yeah I should learn to use gloves a

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.060 
but yeah I should learn to use gloves a
bit<00:01:52.649> more<00:01:52.939> Sweden<00:01:54.530> there's<00:01:55.530> another<00:01:55.829> one

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
bit more Sweden there's another one

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.590 
bit more Sweden there's another one
called<00:01:56.250> Gunilla<00:01:56.640> stove<00:01:56.969> which<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.329> similar

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
called Gunilla stove which is similar

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.350 
called Gunilla stove which is similar
principle<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.229> Taylor<00:01:59.090> that's<00:02:00.090> up<00:02:00.270> a

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
principle to the Taylor that's up a

draft gasifier

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.870 
draft gasifier
it's<00:02:02.600> a<00:02:02.660> shape<00:02:02.870> it's<00:02:03.020> not<00:02:03.140> going<00:02:03.380> now<00:02:03.880> looking

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
it's a shape it's not going now looking

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.540 
it's a shape it's not going now looking
to<00:02:04.940> get<00:02:05.030> a<00:02:05.090> pen<00:02:05.240> on<00:02:05.390> it<00:02:05.570> you<00:02:05.930> can<00:02:06.080> google<00:02:06.410> those

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550

another<00:04:02.750> step<00:04:02.960> forward<00:04:03.290> from<00:04:03.410> that<00:04:04.000> it's<00:04:05.000> just

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
another step forward from that it's just

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.390 
another step forward from that it's just
as<00:04:05.360> efficient<00:04:05.690> to<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:05.840> rocket<00:04:06.110> stove<00:04:06.320> just<00:04:07.280> as

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
as efficient to the rocket stove just as

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.800 
as efficient to the rocket stove just as
easy<00:04:07.550> to<00:04:07.670> capture<00:04:07.850> all<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.210> hates<00:04:08.420> that's<00:04:08.690> why

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
easy to capture all the hates that's why

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.360 
easy to capture all the hates that's why
I'm<00:04:08.900> demonstrating<00:04:09.080> with<00:04:09.650> big<00:04:09.800> oven<00:04:10.130> which<00:04:10.340> is

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
I'm demonstrating with big oven which is

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.150 
I'm demonstrating with big oven which is
injected<00:04:10.910> potatoes<00:04:11.270> now<00:04:11.420> yeah<00:04:11.990> and<00:04:12.170> you've

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
injected potatoes now yeah and you've

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.460 
injected potatoes now yeah and you've
got<00:04:13.340> the<00:04:13.460> advantage<00:04:13.730> of<00:04:14.210> biochar<00:04:15.080> with<00:04:15.350> your

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
got the advantage of biochar with your

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.530 
got the advantage of biochar with your
rocket<00:04:15.710> stove<00:04:15.890> doesn't<00:04:16.190> owe<00:04:16.310> you<00:04:16.610> empty<00:04:17.000> but

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
rocket stove doesn't owe you empty but

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.430 
rocket stove doesn't owe you empty but
in<00:04:17.720> I<00:04:18.019> turned<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:18.799> insulation<00:04:19.340> to<00:04:19.370> a<00:04:19.580> retort

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
in I turned the insulation to a retort

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.530 
in I turned the insulation to a retort
here's<00:04:21.440> a<00:04:21.530> miniature<00:04:21.950> version<00:04:22.300> going<00:04:23.300> to<00:04:23.510> a

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
here's a miniature version going to a

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.380 
here's a miniature version going to a
heat<00:04:23.840> exchanger<00:04:24.820> I've<00:04:25.820> got<00:04:26.000> around<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.240> back

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
heat exchanger I've got around the back

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.130 
heat exchanger I've got around the back
let's<00:04:26.870> have<00:04:26.990> a<00:04:27.020> look<00:04:27.200> at<00:04:27.290> this<00:04:27.470> yeah<00:04:28.090> this<00:04:29.140> if

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
let's have a look at this yeah this if

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.450 
let's have a look at this yeah this if
you're<00:04:30.350> going<00:04:30.590> to<00:04:30.710> look<00:04:30.980> how<00:04:31.070> much<00:04:31.220> smokes

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
you're going to look how much smokes

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.580 
you're going to look how much smokes
come<00:04:31.670> out<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:31.910> top<00:04:32.090> of<00:04:32.210> that<00:04:32.330> but<00:04:33.200> anyway<00:04:33.530> if

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
come out the top of that but anyway if

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.630 
come out the top of that but anyway if
you're<00:04:33.710> going<00:04:33.800> to<00:04:33.890> have<00:04:34.040> an<00:04:34.160> efficient

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
you're going to have an efficient

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.730 
you're going to have an efficient
combustion<00:04:35.000> and<00:04:35.480> you're<00:04:36.020> gonna<00:04:36.110> be<00:04:36.290> capturing

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
combustion and you're gonna be capturing

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.770 
combustion and you're gonna be capturing
all<00:04:36.890> the<00:04:37.010> heat<00:04:37.240> let<00:04:38.240> me<00:04:38.330> that<00:04:38.420> you<00:04:38.450> don't<00:04:38.600> want

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
all the heat let me that you don't want

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:39.820 
all the heat let me that you don't want
you<00:04:38.930> don't<00:04:39.110> want<00:04:39.230> the<00:04:39.290> heat<00:04:39.380> to<00:04:39.440> go<00:04:39.560> into<00:04:39.740> the

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
you don't want the heat to go into the

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.310 
you don't want the heat to go into the
sky<00:04:40.070> and<00:04:40.400> so<00:04:40.670> I<00:04:40.700> brought<00:04:41.270> myself<00:04:41.450> a<00:04:41.720> ban<00:04:41.900> Murray

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
sky and so I brought myself a ban Murray

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.960 
sky and so I brought myself a ban Murray
I<00:04:42.590> love<00:04:42.980> ripping<00:04:43.280> the<00:04:43.370> electrics<00:04:43.730> out<00:04:43.850> of

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
I love ripping the electrics out of

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.340 
I love ripping the electrics out of
these<00:04:44.090> things<00:04:44.330> and<00:04:44.480> making<00:04:44.750> it<00:04:44.840> intelligent

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
these things and making it intelligent

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.080 
these things and making it intelligent
taken<00:04:45.980> all<00:04:46.070> the<00:04:46.160> electrics<00:04:46.490> out<00:04:46.640> for<00:04:46.880> the<00:04:46.940> hot

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
taken all the electrics out for the hot

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.290 
taken all the electrics out for the hot
shoe<00:04:47.270> of<00:04:47.330> copper<00:04:47.660> piping<00:04:48.110> and<00:04:48.370> so<00:04:49.370> just

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
shoe of copper piping and so just

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.630 
shoe of copper piping and so just
convection<00:04:51.080> of<00:04:51.140> the<00:04:51.230> heat<00:04:51.410> it<00:04:52.160> the<00:04:52.340> hot<00:04:52.430> water

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
convection of the heat it the hot water

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.700 
convection of the heat it the hot water
in<00:04:52.820> a<00:04:52.910> cylinder<00:04:53.390> in<00:04:53.810> firing<00:04:54.169> again<00:04:54.560> it's

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
in a cylinder in firing again it's

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.290 
in a cylinder in firing again it's
producing<00:04:55.130> biochar<00:04:55.700> and<00:04:55.940> it's<00:04:56.030> a<00:04:56.090> very

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
producing biochar and it's a very

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.750 
producing biochar and it's a very
efficient<00:04:56.660> burn<00:04:56.810> heat<00:04:57.770> rises<00:04:58.310> hot<00:04:58.580> water

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
efficient burn heat rises hot water

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.300 
efficient burn heat rises hot water
keeps<00:04:59.120> going<00:04:59.450> up<00:04:59.570> yeah<00:05:00.320> I<00:05:00.470> can<00:05:00.680> send<00:05:01.010> the<00:05:01.130> hot

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
keeps going up yeah I can send the hot

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.040 
keeps going up yeah I can send the hot
water<00:05:01.490> through<00:05:01.760> the<00:05:01.970> ban<00:05:02.150> Murray<00:05:02.360> or<00:05:02.720> straight

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
water through the ban Murray or straight

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.020 
water through the ban Murray or straight
into<00:05:03.260> the<00:05:03.380> tea<00:05:03.560> urn<00:05:03.740> and<00:05:04.460> the<00:05:04.580> cold<00:05:04.820> water

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
into the tea urn and the cold water

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.880 
into the tea urn and the cold water
keeps<00:05:05.330> dropping<00:05:05.480> down<00:05:05.810> yeah<00:05:06.200> I<00:05:06.350> just<00:05:06.470> set<00:05:06.770> it

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
keeps dropping down yeah I just set it

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.710 
keeps dropping down yeah I just set it
up<00:05:07.040> just<00:05:07.070> to<00:05:07.310> keep<00:05:07.370> itself<00:05:07.700> filling<00:05:08.390> yourself

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
up just to keep itself filling yourself

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.980 
up just to keep itself filling yourself
it's<00:05:09.169> a<00:05:09.200> demonstration<00:05:09.500> of<00:05:10.780> how<00:05:11.780> you<00:05:11.810> can

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
it's a demonstration of how you can

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.870 
it's a demonstration of how you can
capture<00:05:12.260> the<00:05:12.470> heat<00:05:12.620> using<00:05:12.919> hot<00:05:13.040> water<00:05:13.070> amazing

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
capture the heat using hot water amazing

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.740 
capture the heat using hot water amazing
you<00:05:13.940> could<00:05:14.030> have<00:05:14.150> this<00:05:14.270> going<00:05:14.540> into<00:05:14.690> a

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
you could have this going into a

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.510 
you could have this going into a
household<00:05:15.020> copper<00:05:15.320> tank<00:05:15.500> you<00:05:16.130> can<00:05:16.250> have<00:05:16.340> that

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
household copper tank you can have that

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.780 
household copper tank you can have that
heat<00:05:17.560> another<00:05:18.560> clever<00:05:18.890> thing<00:05:19.190> about<00:05:19.220> rocket

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
heat another clever thing about rocket

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.390 
heat another clever thing about rocket
stoves<00:05:20.090> is<00:05:20.480> you<00:05:21.110> can<00:05:21.320> send<00:05:21.620> the<00:05:21.710> flue<00:05:21.980> gasses

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
stoves is you can send the flue gasses

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.610 
stoves is you can send the flue gasses
horizontally<00:05:23.180> it<00:05:23.630> through<00:05:23.900> a<00:05:23.930> thermal<00:05:24.260> mass

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
horizontally it through a thermal mass

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.070 
horizontally it through a thermal mass
that<00:05:25.520> is<00:05:25.730> one<00:05:26.180> of<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:26.330> main<00:05:26.510> features<00:05:26.750> of<00:05:27.020> a

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
that is one of the main features of a

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.060 
that is one of the main features of a
rocket<00:05:27.230> stove<00:05:27.470> that<00:05:27.530> makes<00:05:27.740> them<00:05:27.860> intelligent

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
rocket stove that makes them intelligent

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.520 
rocket stove that makes them intelligent
it<00:05:28.850> can<00:05:29.000> do<00:05:29.120> the<00:05:29.210> same<00:05:29.270> with<00:05:29.510> this<00:05:29.690> it's

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
it can do the same with this it's

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.810 
it can do the same with this it's
another<00:05:30.770> way<00:05:31.010> if<00:05:31.280> you're<00:05:31.400> going<00:05:31.490> to<00:05:31.580> have<00:05:31.700> an

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
another way if you're going to have an

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.200 
another way if you're going to have an
efficient<00:05:32.150> burn<00:05:32.270> capture<00:05:32.990> the<00:05:33.110> heat<00:05:33.580> so<00:05:34.580> this

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
efficient burn capture the heat so this

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.820 
efficient burn capture the heat so this
is<00:05:35.450> just<00:05:35.780> like<00:05:35.960> with<00:05:36.140> just<00:05:36.320> to<00:05:36.440> keep<00:05:36.560> the<00:05:36.680> heat

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
is just like with just to keep the heat

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.560 
is just like with just to keep the heat
in<00:05:37.070> it's<00:05:37.400> a<00:05:37.490> bit<00:05:37.669> it's<00:05:37.970> the<00:05:38.030> end<00:05:38.180> of<00:05:38.270> the<00:05:38.360> first
