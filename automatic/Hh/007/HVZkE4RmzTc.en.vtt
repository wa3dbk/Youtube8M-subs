00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.580
 hello today we are going to do the 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.400
 basic stroke for our bikini the 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.910
 Bikini bottom for dogfish 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.160
 this is going to need a rule and a 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.420
 black cup if you want to achieve the shape a 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.420
 revolution paper 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:33.540
 and a color pencil remember 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.580
 this is nothing more without transformations 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.380
 let's do the singles and the 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.080
 transformations are made depending 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.720
 of the quini style and the 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:54.989
 proportions of each person so 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:57.690
 we started to start making angles 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:02.070
 of the fourth of our waist in this 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:05.370
 case of fourth waist minus 16 now 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.799
 long of our shot that are 28 I have to 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.490
 long shot let's mark the long 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.670
 hip 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.080
 I have 18 centimeters and more we mark 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.080
 we make our rectangle 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.780
 here in the fourth here in the long 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:28.859
 we are going to mark the door of 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.859
 hip I have twenty-four chain 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.710
 we are going to undo the structure with the 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.590
 hips can do it by hand or what 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.210
 you can do with your the island and here not 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.380
 we have three centimeters to make 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.380
 we have a good waist 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.310
 and in the bottom part we are going to give you 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:53.340
 three to four centimeters more 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.789
 centimeters in the points 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.789
 ah 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.560
 and here what we are going to do is put the 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.110
 two centimeters or so this is the 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.820
 half 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.820
 and we make it our asset 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.240
 here and our our case in front 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.520
 this front 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.940
 this would be double here is what comes 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.970
 being our 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.040
 our bridge and here it is removed is 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.220
 something normal if they want to do it to the 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.620
 career they go down more or less are 8 to 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.160
 10 centimeters would fall 8 centimeters 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.530
 here also 8 plus one centimeter for being 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.690
 it's front 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.630
 and we already have our 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.790
 hip mid hip 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.650
 and to you if you want it more taken out of 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.490
 the crotch part can be 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.370
 and this already varies according to the 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.230
 type of model that are doing what 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.510
 are the transformations in this case 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.550
 This is the basic short 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.950
 forward let's do the butt now 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.250
 for the basic back pattern we mark 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.980
 the same 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.460
 the fourth of the waist and we mark 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.460
 as well 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.549
 the length of the shot that are 28 and the long 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.990
 of hips that are 18 in the length of 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:24.090
 hip we mark the fourth of chain 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.970
 24 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.760
 and we do and we appreciate what comes 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:34.750
 being joined waist to hip 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.879
 and now for the shot that would be our 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.659
 shots we're going to go down from 7 to 10 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.629
 centimeters 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:42.879
 this already varies very low the chayote this 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.310
 it already varies according to the type of body and according to 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.959
 the measure the more a little more 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.290
 The next one is based on a little 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.209
 plus 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.909
 while more thin is based on download 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.250
 less would be 7 if it is for lines 6 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.530
 centimeters and we left the same 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:01.140
 three centimeters or four according to him 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.140
 they left with unimos 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.549
 and now if instead of getting in, we're not going 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.549
 to come out two centimeters 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.820
 and we left 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.739
 sorry 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.290
 this is an average is table if you 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.019
 has a little more out of the pomp what 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.970
 they can leave the pure flush here either 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.040
 if you want it if you are a person with a lot 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.810
 pomp you have to download them a little more here and 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.540
 also get us a little bit more in the 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:34.380
 peace is already this recalls is the basic 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.920
 nothing more and the part of the hips we 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:41.000
 we passed the same thing that we got off 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:43.370
 in the front nothing else here in 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.650
 instead of going down the part 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.290
 from the opposite we went up a 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.820
 centimeter or you can leave it straight 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.760
 and there is a person who does not have much 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.760
 pomp if it's for a subscriber with a lot 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.950
 we have to climb up is two to three 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.380
 centimeters depending on how much 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:04.610
 pomp have the same here we are going to take out 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.590
 if he is a person with a lot and good 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.660
 we already have the basic patterns 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.660
 let's cut 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:24.390
 good but I did it with the skin 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.370
 it is also finished this has the hip or 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.740
 it is due to the information of the style 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.870
 of the bikini are going to be given according to 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.380
 the model they have can do more 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:36.630
 taken a little higher more or more 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.550
 down the one of the calera one has to check 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.880
 well before cutting we like them 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:45.830
 the sides both the front and the 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.830
 back and when cutting the fabric 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.780
 we put it here so that we do not stay 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.440
 cut that unless you want it is 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.440
 the cut 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:01.320
 We cut back, this is all but 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.120
 I liked you I hope your comments in 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.930
 the bottom part and like it 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.090
