00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.359
 hello then today we're going 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.450
 see how it performs their assembly 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.410
 of a shock absorber on a peugeot 106 s16 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.320
 you at the level of tools we will have 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:22.140
 need a socket of 18 and a 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:23.699
 spring compressor then once 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.410
 the old cartridges were dropped 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.840
 damper so we clean well 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:35.130
 what can be 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:38.309
 liquid from the inside and so we 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.649
 replace we position the new 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.620
 damper cartridge directly into 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.829
 the strut at all on one point the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.489
 mata lambert and after we tighten the ring 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.829
 which keeps the damper 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.620
 on the strut 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.670
 it's the big yellow bins turn 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.670
 in the direction of clockwise 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.119
 and after once she starts to get 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:11.760
 block we take a special tool or 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:16.020
 evening we do that with the chisel and we serve 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.470
 the set makes sure that it is well 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.470
 advisable 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:30.790
 a clamp is used it will 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.790
 especially we could have done that 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.970
 with a hammer and a chisel tapping on 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.740
 the sides on the side of the ring 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:46.960
 so we replace the breath and 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:50.520
 protection of the damper rod and 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:57.880
 we will start to replace the spring 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:59.619
 so their fate here and already compressed on 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.970
 compress the spring beforehand because 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.260
 than if we leave the spring as 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.810
 that we will not be able to trace the 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.540
 cups should be placed next to the 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.369
 cup and damper head so 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.880
 it is important to compress the 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.830
 everything there is a tutorial that will be done 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.540
 especially to show how 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:23.860
 how is it done with pressing 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:27.970
 of the compression of the spring so there we 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.780
 place the damper directly to 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.780
 inside the spring 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.220
 and we go back first the cup l 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.110
 be careful that any match well with their 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.450
 spring in fact one because the 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.610
 cups and the strut have a 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.860
 particular shape to adapt to 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:05.360
 springs 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:10.730
 this is the damper head block and 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:13.060
 the lady anti that then we serve everything 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.019
 with the screw of 18 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.019
 a nut of 18 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:43.430
 already starting to tight and that's 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.360
 that once it's good it's true 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:51.290
 we start to start 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.700
 uncompress their spell otherwise it can 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.960
 to be dangerous if you do not have good 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:59.660
 tight to decompress that can the pieces 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.240
 stolen from everywhere and to hurt so 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.370
 we must already tight their fate before 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.400
 to finally decompress well tighten all 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:13.100
 the screws of inventis tighten the screw of 18 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:15.470
 before decompressing their things I'm doing 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.370
 well coincide their sisters with the 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.109
 leg of strength too 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:25.390
 there we remember there is a gap between the 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.390
 shaped strut and their fate 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:33.460
 at the lot goes unzipping going to take 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.460
 the shape of the luck zone 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.600
 do not hesitate to turn the turn 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.120
 same time it can unlock things 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.280
 so here we are now 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.320
 positioned their forces could of course 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.670
 struts and leaning on the 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:58.300
 cup so we can see that everything has 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.300
 well been reassembled 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:09.320
 we can decompress their fate how 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.490
 kill their mounting a damper on 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.490
 a 106 s16 with terrebonne
