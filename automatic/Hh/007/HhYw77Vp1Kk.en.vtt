00:00:01.659 --> 00:00:08.719
 thousands of times 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.519
 certainly there have also been some 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.490
 controversy regarding the seal 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.049
 ideological in character education 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.730
 ideological that you have one should have the 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.110
 education scared a debate that is given 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.820
 inside or outside Chavism throughout the 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.140
 country and especially with the issue of 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.599
 history the reinterpretation of the 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.950
 contemporary history even the 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.720
 inclusion of the figure of hugo chÃ¡vez 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.160
 within the study programs and 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.169
 right that is not based precious on the 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.270
 misery education should be policies 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.850
 ideological or it should not be me 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.380
 I write within those who think that 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.660
 debate is impossible that there is not a 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.789
 educational process that is not political 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.949
 ideological what can not be is 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:44.210
 partisan in the constitution 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.070
 bolivariana venezuela a country 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.499
 democratic therefore education 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.109
 Venezuelan defends democracy is a 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:52.399
 political and ideological position if 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.379
 we were in Spain the constitution 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.359
 the world is monarchical the process 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.069
 education of Spain would defend the 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.749
 monarchical system in Venezuela is not 

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:01.309
 can defend the monarchical system 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:04.370
 but democratic that's a discussion 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.690
 political ideological policy who me 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.120
 tell me that this debate is not in 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.370
 any educational process in does 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.020
 I think with much ignorance or with 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.210
 a lot of bad intention 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.070
 and I start from a premise and I put it with 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.929
 much clarity on the table all 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.270
 educational process as all process 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.460
 social has a political position and a 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.710
 ideological philosophical position what is 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.000
 ours the bolivariana us 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.219
 we build a Bolivarian education 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.860
 according to the principles expressed in the 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:33.049
 Bolivarian constitution approved by the 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.850
 majority of Venezuelans and 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.299
 Venezuelan if the education that there 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.709
 500 years ago education 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.360
 I would surely say that women have 

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:43.219
 less right than men today the 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.599
 Venezuelan education says there 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:46.069
 gender equality because that's what it says 

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:48.229
 in this constitution that is a position 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:49.700
 policy that has to do with the 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.920
 times with the processes that are being 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.179
 living in every society that mark the 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.399
 political positions of our 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.750
 Venezuelan education this book the 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.819
 Bolivarian constitution of liberation 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.439
 citizen says I do not want to get into 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.270
 a public school because they are going to give 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.489
 an education for socialism and I do not 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.510
 I am a socialist venezuela make a 

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:10.290
 education for 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.030
 Bolivarian position where even if you 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.980
 you read the value to an education that you 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.660
 help to critically interpret the 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.340
 society is the education that we are 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.830

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.870
 says not that the books are I just 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.030
 I answer is very simple I call everyone 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.500
 the parents of all mothers are 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.270
 late when your children arrive at your house 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.370
 that they take away the books we gave them 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.370
 that they read them complete and that they judge
