00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 i remember myself known 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:10.849
 about posts and that one lap and how to 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.830
 don't choose anymore for different 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:18.690
 alternate when you can 1 and 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.590
 1 and here I am taking such a paste 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.590
 green cap 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:32.520
 17 is considered to be almost 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:35.550
 tough too is true of course 74 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.489
 Here is such a benefit and not because 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.649
 There is no reason in principle because 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.860
 pasta 17 plus here such exactly 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.450
 orange circle gives a good effect here 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.820
 driven driven machine for polishing 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.250
 Russian nine in general was to us in 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.940
 in poor condition now I will show in 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.910
 what is the meaning of sale what is the meaning of this 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:05.430
 paid a fortune and yet patrolled 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:09.420
 something there is here such things are not here 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.770
 chic in camera 30 live than kids 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.500
 understand perfectly see if you 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.939
 you'll see must see this transition 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.909
 besides the top varnish slaughtered 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.570
 other paint not preparing and not 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:28.530
 removing old paint from the war are 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.930
 here it will be better to just take on 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.659
 paint with malak in bay paint top 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.329
 lye this hard transition to ladder 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.939
 huge but the problem is not even that 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.450
 Now we'll see here in this varnish has 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.259
 bubbles 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.939
 This is how it will be seen here that 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.610
 It's very hard to take if you already shoot 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.920
 sandpaper then shoot in principle yes 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.040
 old paint 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:57.240
 here but as an option here at the expense of this 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.200
 pasta at the expense of right now us 3 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:05.329
 point and cheese cap here it is 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:07.950
 rushed 17 here's a machine of which is closer 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:12.270
 where the circle killed already sp 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:16.500
 show and so how to do that 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.410
 there was another problem here 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.770
 so here you can here and so there is a problem 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.170
 It was in the fact that they began to handle some type 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.180
 Russians decided to put his hands on them 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.180
 we only wiped varnish during 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.060
 and the paint should be primed here is very hard 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.460
 here I certainly wanted to spit on faces 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.000
 who is this beautiful car why not 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.970
 they did like they took no not pasted over 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.810
 nothing let's say yes that's not demolished 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:48.930
 here here now let's say they wore so we 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.550
 here is no longer admissible we conducted here 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.040
 started here this here went paint over here 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.160
 here now let's say nothing 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.520
 pasted 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.990
 that is, how you conceived a gun so 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.480
 that's all there flew it here 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:04.350
 it was just awful now 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.980
 removed this transition hard here if 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.060
 principle 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.100
 look at the door which i already did 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:17.250
 hard to see but almost no transition 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:19.950
 seen here because the most important thing 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.550
 be sure to dry do not need to wet 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:27.150
 here it is this post here I will try everything 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:34.050
 next shot take off show like this 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:38.190
 principle, try it now you can 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:50.040
 put the camera to us will not be 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:52.860
 Come shoot I'm short right now, could not 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.470
 after this the result should be 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.220
 turn out 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:03.420
 what a reflection principle without any a 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:06.420
 sin in general, this transition is very 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.590
 hard here so here probably will be seen 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.099
 better than him 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.840
 here's the old paint on the new paint on 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:17.620
 old varnish is not under no preparation without 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.350
 nothing at all want death fuck 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:25.139
 completely repaint now i'm rightfully 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.139
 the second video will show how it will be
