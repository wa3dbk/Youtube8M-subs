00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.349
 by facing serbia in a bomb 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.280
 bank arena this time packed 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:10.780
 the French had obviously 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.460
 only one goal wins for 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.139
 validate their reprieve and perhaps their 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.429
 ticket for the semi finals girls 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.630
 krumbholz olive trees know that they 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.250
 do not have all the cards in hand that 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.600
 their fate is intimately linked to the 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.100
 Norwegian performance in the face of 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.050
 Denmark a little later in the evening 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:28.470
 then a single slogan all let go 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:31.689
 to have no regrets for France 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.399
 when she is in variable confidence that 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.019
 can be a match won at it all 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.649
 alone 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:37.569
 pay attention to this team 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.799
 Serbian transcended by his audience at a quarter 

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:39.670
 popovich hour of play digs a gap 

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:41.769
 three points 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.210
 the french are surprisingly difficult 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.459
 too many attacks are doomed to failure 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.229
 beaudoin canto usually success 

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:48.729
 seem doomed to find the poles 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:50.889
 adverse or stumbled facing a guardian 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:53.530
 Serbian Serb in the first period with 

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:55.420
 75% off led 10 to 6 at half time 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:03.639
 the French will nevertheless come back 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:06.850
 track transcend revolt yes by there 

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:08.649
 go we grapple two goals away and 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.140
 great they are two months the 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.450
 French and proves that with an AK 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.729
 tons of wood the tudca france is in 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.049
 take the step France has 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.579
 regained his rank but fails to 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.289
 dig the gap and mano to mano va 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.390
 slowly turn in favor of the Serb 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.649
 they are the ones who validate the penultimate 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.729
 goal of the match that of victory 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.530
 18 to 17 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.850
 because the last one of equalization 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.649
 will simply be refused 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.939
 French on a penalty that had 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.590
 yet crossed the line 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.689
 alone has he changed the fate of the blues 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.130
 not so sure with regard to the last face to 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.460
 face of the lost party by camille 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.109
 Ayglon 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.149
 the blues have failed the Serbs have 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:41.609
 shine here they are in the semifinals of their 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.689
 euro 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:45.399
 yes I had the sensation of 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.810
 way she was grazing the pole the 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.179
 bullet is she back she was coming out 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.859
 good I already had yellow card of any 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.179
 way it's not the only decision 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:54.039
 questionable in the last five six 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.149
 minutes but was there when 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.789
 even amazing is that he is two 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.530
 meters he looks and he's not able 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.549
 to see him then so to him 2 it's up to him 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.649
 to be careful and that's some 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.479
 classic thing a pole that taps into 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.560
 has a ball that hits the pole one can 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.420
 very well returned to the goal and 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.360
 come out that's it's over I think 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.550
 she has 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.310
 that's twice it's the one of times the 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.460
 same scenario I think it's good 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.690
 when it does not want it does not want to see been 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.280
 in any case I am I am happy 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.630
 still of the match since I have 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.000
 found I found ourselves in 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.890
 frankly we did not really 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.360
 really did everything we could 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.760
 for in preparation for this match 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.220
 for tax is here to be present for 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.050
 the and theora miss nothing at all we have 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.150
 the balloons in the end we have we all we have 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.230
 everything to win it frankly I do not 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.230
 do not know what I could have done 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.940
 more at the level of the prep but but hey 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.610
 here I thank all six 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.260
 because frankly it was mine of 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.510
 nothing is a final match lab model 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.730
 it's too bad again we went to 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.080
 side of the occasion 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.040
 we had the balls on the end despite 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.640
 we are at -1 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.380
 we have three balls to equalize 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.989
 maybe not even pass in front of 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.730
 it's a shame we mismanaged our rating 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.610
 6.5 in the money time again 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.070
 we fish but I'm like that 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.140
 a little adot image of our oral and we 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.420
 passed by nothing we had one thing 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.530
 again tonight to qualify that's it 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.019
 did not succeed once again it will be 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.010
 not for this time but I think we 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.430
 will come back stronger next year 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.430
 right here 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.940
 m 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.819
