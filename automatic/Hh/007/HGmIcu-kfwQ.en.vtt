00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.510
 angela hello I then killed the 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.030
 companion from virginia 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.770
 but in fact I also know that well 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.970
 before virginie integrates teams 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.169
 national you had already made 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.030
 european championships and all that you are 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.180
 also a ringo rider is then a 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.540
 day you cross virginia in the form 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.640
 of my life 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.530
 each one is his stone 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.790
 exactly 2 to have a 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.670
 passion like this is to live 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.950
 when yeah that's good dream come back to 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.480
 what are we going to do now 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.400
 so that's really the basis of the work 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.960
 of endurance training end of 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.489
 Endurance horses is not the most 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.519
 fun because it's a lot of 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.830
 slow yeah it's to rehabilitate a little 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.059
 tendons and muscles to 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.589
 training but gently in 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.589
 preserving the members actually agree 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.190
 on the left it's ah yes 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.939
 with virginia which amazes me in 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.060
 amount on this Arab cursan it is to what 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.189
 point they are actually very well trained 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.140
 sensible of least you told me he 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.819
 just see a little more pressure 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.399
 strong on a calf for all alters 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:29.840
 are very balanced actually yes since 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.979
 it's still going faster and faster 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.240
 the races and it's true we do not 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.899
 do not know the tracks on which we 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.640
 will evolve 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.619
 so we have to adapt right now and 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.640
 anticipate so in fact when we arrive 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.679
 in the turns on the last 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.270
 loops now times it turns to 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.740
 over 30 an hour so you arrive 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.970
 when turning, it is necessary that the horses 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.530
 change of foot before turns that 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.630
 can restart without leaving too many 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.200
 curves to not hurt themselves and for 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.060
 win time 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.289
 so it's true that's why I 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.849
 think the training is really very 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.590
 very important it's very technical in 

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:56.000
 done yes a lot more and more worked 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.409
 techniques really presents me so what 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.149
 that we do the walking is like that 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.349
 quietly it must be done how much 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.849
 of time for it to be effective two 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:03.979
 hours that's it me they made us 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:05.719
 minimum two hours and after that we 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.849
 does it for a month and a half two 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.459
 month every two days only it 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:12.500
 never another pace on the part 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.670
 landowners have only taken steps because 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.769
 with us we have some tracks a little bit 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.450
 hard you see hard ground so we preserve 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.680
 the maximum members so it's for 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.540
 that we make the step in the elevation 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.819
 it left still worked 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.819
 less but preserving the limbs
