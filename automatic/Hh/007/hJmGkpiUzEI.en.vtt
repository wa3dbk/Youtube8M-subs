00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.010 

problem<00:01:15.610> that's<00:01:15.909> me<00:01:16.120> yeah<00:01:16.360> it's<00:01:16.690> not<00:01:16.870> very

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.990 

flies<00:01:37.369> perfect<00:01:38.060> then

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
flies perfect then

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:50.570 
flies perfect then
everything<00:01:39.900> balanced<00:01:49.070> nice<00:01:50.070> enough<00:01:50.340> noise

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
everything balanced nice enough noise

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.000 
everything balanced nice enough noise
with<00:01:53.150> yeah<00:01:54.150> it's<00:01:54.330> no<00:01:54.479> aerobatic<00:01:55.080> plane<00:01:55.770> with

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
with yeah it's no aerobatic plane with

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.730 
with yeah it's no aerobatic plane with
this<00:01:56.160> motor<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:57.869> stuff<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.229> bolt<00:01:58.410> is<00:01:58.590> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
this motor the stuff the bolt is the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.790 
this motor the stuff the bolt is the
battery<00:02:02.390> so<00:02:03.390> we<00:02:03.660> got<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.960> find<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.320> way<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.500> put<00:02:04.770> a

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
battery so we got to find a way to put a

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:35.820 
battery so we got to find a way to put a
5s<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.550> there<00:02:05.790> or<00:02:06.470> change<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.680> motor

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.010 

he<00:02:36.550> falls<00:02:36.880> out<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.150> this<00:02:37.420> guy

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.650 

that's<00:03:26.190> pretty<00:03:26.370> decent<00:03:28.520> yeah<00:03:29.520> very<00:03:30.330> speed

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
that's pretty decent yeah very speed

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.490 
that's pretty decent yeah very speed
that's<00:03:31.230> too<00:03:31.470> much<00:03:31.650> probably<00:03:31.980> I<00:03:33.200> view<00:03:34.200> them<00:03:34.350> as

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
that's too much probably I view them as

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.920 
that's too much probably I view them as
spoilers<00:03:35.070> to<00:03:35.220> really<00:03:35.490> think<00:03:35.700> look<00:03:36.570> look<00:03:36.750> at

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
spoilers to really think look look at

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.250 
spoilers to really think look look at
the<00:03:37.050> strutt<00:03:37.380> hanging<00:03:37.770> out<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:39.110> think<00:03:40.110> it's

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
the strutt hanging out I think it's

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.960 
the strutt hanging out I think it's
still<00:03:40.440> plenty<00:03:40.770> juice<00:03:41.010> left<00:03:41.250> in<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.520> battery<00:03:41.880> I

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
still plenty juice left in the battery I

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.400 
still plenty juice left in the battery I
think<00:03:42.210> I<00:03:42.360> don't<00:03:42.600> know<00:03:42.690> we'll<00:03:42.990> see<00:03:43.020> when<00:03:43.380> we
