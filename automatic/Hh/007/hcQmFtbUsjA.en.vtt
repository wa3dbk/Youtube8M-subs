 they also sound very very good there 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.060
 I can tell you why the terminal associated 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.409
 been a couple of days and see 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.600

 testing for three days you see anyway 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.500
 be very good at headphone construction 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.630
 flat headphones with the possibility of here 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.939
 respond through this through this 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.189
 Hot response just click it to

 own ear we have a 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.280
 booklet services with various numbers 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.290
 telephone to the various telephone numbers 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.479
 little of the buy contacts and here we have one 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.340
 quick guide made my notice well 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.399
 because it explains things simply and 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.260
 however, basic things are quick 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.050
 in 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.479
 razer we go opening a little bit the 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.850
 terminal to admit it up front 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:15.950
 terminal has a 5 display 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:18.140
 inch full hd and is an ips display is a 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.870
 display dragon 3 so really a lot 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.170
 but very durable and with a coating 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.350
 oleophobic full hd as already mentioned then 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.500
 1900 20 x 1080 pixels 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.570
 we have a height of 144 wide 61 of 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.320
 work for seven of a 9 millimeters of 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.210
 thick and light because it is 129 grams of 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.410
 weight 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.210
 we have in the front of the sensor of 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.950
 brightness and proximity a camera 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.710
 from 2 megapixels 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.690
 we also have a plaid here sideways 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.760
 obviously capsons pour that button 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.290
 the buttons named go to 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.870
 so turn them on then terminal 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:58.850
 to do will make him lieder and buttons 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:02.120
 back home and menu we have instead in the 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.670
 rear a 13 megapixel camera with 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.740
 autofocus and led the former play of a part 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.860
 front as already mentioned the 2 megapixel the 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.200
 non-extractable retrone is not is not 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.300
 openable since the 2500 battery 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.800
 milian for now can not be extracted not 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.959
 you can increase the memory by 16 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.060
 gigabytes in this version of ours that 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.610
 They do not have expandable via 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:27.620
 micro microsd 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:30.709
 we have bluetooth 4.0 in the here in here 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.200
 below we have the micro usb 2.0 as well as 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.140
 a speaker on the other hand who i am 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.670
 various various microphones on the top 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.290
 we have power buttons and 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.209
 switch-off of the stand-by lock release o 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.070
 as well as the three and a half audio jack 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.590
 laterally to the right we have the 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.110
 volume rocker and we also have a 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.670
 the slot for the second sim while on 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.580
 left side we have the slot for the 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.170
 first sim that you can open with this 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.450
 away to focus in this mechanism 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.489
 magnetic just click here on the 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.630
 click on that yourself this little button 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:04.550
 here always if we succeed here is done and 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.650
 you see that it opens and then closes 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:12.120
 magnetically as I could as you can 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:14.010
 see the network and in download and from 21 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:19.769
 megabits per second while the system 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:22.019
 operating is android 4.2.2 as I do 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.169
 see now in this right now 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:28.680
 see 4.2.2 the operating system is the 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:30.690
 usually customized system from the cut 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.570
 and there are variations from what he had 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.310
 seen on idol hicks and flight only 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.840
 show some buttons are 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.410
 backlit I wanted to show you 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.169
 optimization of the side frames 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.440
 which I think is very satisfactory 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:50.880
 alcatel c also sent some covers from 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:54.300
 to see are flip keys covers 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.570
 that only these here you see are covers 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.090
 so built you see with a back 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:03.419
 that compared to the back of this alcatel 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.830
 that of a material developed by da 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.760
 alcatel that should exist 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:12.510
 really much to the various scratches and 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:15.120
 anything else, however, is lucid and holds a 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.220
 but the footprints are really too much 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.389
 very nice to see this material 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:24.840
 like this side band of all that 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:27.720
 This cover covers the entire terminal 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.669
 we also have in this coloring in the 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.110
 back holds less fingerprints but between 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.229
 the models in the back while in the part 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.240
 front we have this texture I hope 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:40.349
 that manages to show as if there 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.720
 were they micro-origin is not is not 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:44.580
 magnetic this cover just you see 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.250
 when it closes then it can reopen 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.530
 simply yes and fits with 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:53.039
 this interlocking alcatel as you can 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:55.919
 see now you see inserts interlocking 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:58.050
 where it closes you see the name is not 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:02.580
 magnetic because it reopens 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:04.910
 very simply we have here the cap 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.139
 tricolor discovery we have literally 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.900
 only the possibility of raising the 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:11.340
 volume above we have uncovered audio jacks 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:15.000
 and the lock power button 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.889
 stand by unlock you see here looks a lot 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.770
 as can be seen, however, it can be seen 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:21.530
 reach quite easily 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.389
 camera and flash uncovered in the back 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.629
 as with the microphone here discovered the networks 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:32.030
 below we have discovered the whole 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:34.460
 part of the dl under an alternative 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:37.610
 as you can see interesting for whom 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.740
 wanted to cover this alcatel so 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.150
 complete the materials are excellent certain 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.550
 not being a magnetic closure yes 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.139
 it can open very very simply not 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.259
 automatically unlock the pano screen 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:49.819
 let's go to pearls but close it 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:51.710
 this type of cover is really 

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:52.909
 few those with closing closure 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.580
 magnetic 

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:57.319
 so for now it's all here 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.909
 this video unboxing in the next 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:00.590
 days we're also going to do a 

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:02.120
 video focus benchmark games of this 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.740
 terminal as well as his 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.990
 videorecensione thank you again one

 various texts could perform on the various 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.050
 terminals 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:18.250
