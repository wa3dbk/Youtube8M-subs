which<00:00:47.180> is<00:00:47.329> f<00:00:47.540> 5<00:00:47.840> which<00:00:48.470> they<00:00:48.860> added<00:00:49.370> to<00:00:49.550> alpha

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
which is f 5 which they added to alpha

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.120 
which is f 5 which they added to alpha
build<00:00:50.180> 6<00:00:50.570> which<00:00:50.870> is<00:00:50.900> really<00:00:51.320> cool<00:00:51.500> because<00:00:51.650> now

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
build 6 which is really cool because now

is<00:01:23.870> lava<00:01:24.260> is<00:01:24.590> now<00:01:24.890> brighter<00:01:25.400> so<00:01:26.240> let's

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
is lava is now brighter so let's

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.130 
is lava is now brighter so let's
actually<00:01:27.320> check<00:01:28.280> this<00:01:28.430> out<00:01:28.640> because<00:01:28.960> well<00:01:29.960> I

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
actually check this out because well I

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.500 
actually check this out because well I
have<00:01:30.799> even<00:01:30.920> checked<00:01:31.220> it<00:01:31.310> out<00:01:31.369> myself<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:32.299> let's

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
have even checked it out myself so let's

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.710 
have even checked it out myself so let's
actually<00:01:32.659> just<00:01:33.080> place<00:01:33.409> it<00:01:33.490> right<00:01:34.490> here<00:01:35.390> so

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
actually just place it right here so

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
actually just place it right here so
okay<00:01:36.080> that's<00:01:37.390> not<00:01:38.390> too<00:01:38.450> bad<00:01:38.630> I<00:01:39.110> can't<00:01:39.650> really

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
okay that's not too bad I can't really

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.990 
okay that's not too bad I can't really
tell<00:01:39.979> a<00:01:40.010> difference<00:01:40.070> maybe<00:01:40.549> if<00:01:40.700> it's<00:01:40.850> at

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
tell a difference maybe if it's at

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.850 
tell a difference maybe if it's at
nighttime<00:01:41.270> it<00:01:41.840> could<00:01:42.110> maybe<00:01:42.350> tell<00:01:42.799> a

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
nighttime it could maybe tell a

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.130 
nighttime it could maybe tell a
difference<00:01:43.280> but<00:01:43.850> that<00:01:44.299> is<00:01:44.540> one<00:01:44.810> of<00:01:44.900> the<00:01:44.930> new

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
difference but that is one of the new

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.370 
difference but that is one of the new
tweaks<00:01:45.500> so<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.549> next<00:01:46.610> one<00:01:46.820> is<00:01:47.090> recorded<00:01:47.960> stone

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
tweaks so the next one is recorded stone

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.950 
tweaks so the next one is recorded stone
shovel<00:01:48.860> and<00:01:48.979> stone<00:01:49.549> hoe<00:01:49.850> to<00:01:50.450> match<00:01:50.659> other

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
shovel and stone hoe to match other

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.859 
shovel and stone hoe to match other
items<00:01:51.290> in<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:51.830> creative<00:01:52.220> list<00:01:52.490> so<00:01:53.240> that<00:01:53.270> is

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
items in the creative list so that is

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.010 
items in the creative list so that is
pretty<00:01:54.260> sweet<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:55.369> next<00:01:55.610> one<00:01:55.760> is<00:01:55.790> gusts<00:01:56.600> will

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
pretty sweet the next one is gusts will

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.580 
pretty sweet the next one is gusts will
hit<00:01:57.350> more<00:01:57.860> reliable<00:01:58.700> now<00:01:58.909> so<00:01:59.270> I<00:01:59.540> think<00:01:59.900> before

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
hit more reliable now so I think before

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.200 
hit more reliable now so I think before
they<00:02:00.710> kept<00:02:01.009> missing<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.700> stuff<00:02:01.970> like<00:02:02.150> that

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
they kept missing and stuff like that

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.240 
they kept missing and stuff like that
but<00:02:02.509> now<00:02:02.689> it<00:02:02.869> should<00:02:03.049> actually<00:02:03.170> kind<00:02:04.009> of<00:02:04.070> hit

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
but now it should actually kind of hit

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.539 
but now it should actually kind of hit
you<00:02:04.460> I<00:02:04.670> guess<00:02:04.970> so<00:02:05.720> that<00:02:06.439> that<00:02:06.799> might<00:02:07.040> be<00:02:07.250> a<00:02:07.490> good

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
you I guess so that that might be a good

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.719 
you I guess so that that might be a good
a<00:02:08.330> good<00:02:08.780> tweak<00:02:09.319> and<00:02:09.560> maybe<00:02:09.920> not<00:02:10.189> a<00:02:10.250> good<00:02:10.340> tweak

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
a good tweak and maybe not a good tweak

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.759 
a good tweak and maybe not a good tweak
because<00:02:11.060> then<00:02:11.209> I<00:02:11.299> could<00:02:11.360> kill<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:11.930> easy<00:02:12.230> but<00:02:12.590> I

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
because then I could kill you easy but I

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.220 
because then I could kill you easy but I
guess<00:02:13.040> that's<00:02:13.280> how<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:13.909> should<00:02:13.939> be<00:02:14.239> so<00:02:15.110> the

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
guess that's how it should be so the

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.220 
guess that's how it should be so the
next<00:02:15.260> one<00:02:15.530> is<00:02:16.299> yeah<00:02:17.299> that's<00:02:17.510> pretty<00:02:17.659> much<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:17.930> i

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
next one is yeah that's pretty much it i

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.899 
next one is yeah that's pretty much it i
actually<00:02:18.650> know<00:02:18.769> this<00:02:18.829> one<00:02:19.159> more<00:02:19.370> tweaked<00:02:19.670> that

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:19.909 
actually know this one more tweaked that

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:23.080 
actually know this one more tweaked that
they<00:02:20.599> change<00:02:21.049> so<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.920> next<00:02:22.160> one<00:02:22.280> is<00:02:22.400> change

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
they change so the next one is change

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.540 
they change so the next one is change
particles<00:02:23.810> when<00:02:24.290> placing<00:02:24.800> water<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.370> they

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
particles when placing water and they

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.600 
particles when placing water and they
never<00:02:25.790> now<00:02:26.450> I<00:02:26.480> actually<00:02:26.810> never

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
never now I actually never

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.390 
never now I actually never
ever<00:02:28.180> place<00:02:28.600> water<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.200> they<00:02:29.350> never<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:29.890> let's

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
ever place water and they never so let's

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.500 
ever place water and they never so let's
go<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:30.970> do<00:02:31.420> that<00:02:31.450> right<00:02:32.320> now<00:02:32.380> so<00:02:32.860> this<00:02:32.980> is<00:02:33.190> some

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
go and do that right now so this is some

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.010 
go and do that right now so this is some
splits<00:02:34.510> of<00:02:34.660> water<00:02:34.840> down<00:02:35.260> right<00:02:35.770> here<00:02:36.100> oh<00:02:37.020> okay

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
splits of water down right here oh okay

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.500 
splits of water down right here oh okay
I<00:02:38.050> see<00:02:38.200> hey<00:02:38.860> look<00:02:39.340> it's<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:40.000> zombie<00:02:40.360> villager

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
I see hey look it's a zombie villager

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.060 
I see hey look it's a zombie villager
but<00:02:41.140> as<00:02:41.200> you<00:02:41.290> can<00:02:41.350> see<00:02:41.470> if<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.620> please<00:02:41.830> water

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
down it's not going to do anything but

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.460 
down it's not going to do anything but
this<00:02:44.560> particle<00:02:45.100> effects<00:02:45.460> so<00:02:45.790> that<00:02:46.150> is<00:02:46.450> a<00:02:46.510> very

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
this particle effects so that is a very

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.770 
this particle effects so that is a very
good<00:02:47.770> little<00:02:48.190> tweak<00:02:48.610> feature<00:02:48.970> they<00:02:49.270> added<00:02:49.300> to

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
I do actually remember that in a few

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.810 
I do actually remember that in a few
bills<00:03:10.540> say<00:03:10.780> that<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.260> kind<00:03:11.500> of<00:03:11.560> just<00:03:12.400> flowed

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
bills say that the kind of just flowed

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.330 
bills say that the kind of just flowed
really<00:03:13.180> slowly<00:03:13.630> but<00:03:14.350> that<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.650> now<00:03:14.800> fixed<00:03:15.100> and

bug<00:03:28.360> fix<00:03:28.630> is<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:29.290> boat<00:03:29.620> types<00:03:30.010> now<00:03:30.550> have

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
bug fix is the boat types now have

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.390 
bug fix is the boat types now have
different<00:03:31.330> colors<00:03:31.630> when<00:03:32.170> held<00:03:32.500> in<00:03:32.769> hand<00:03:33.160> I

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
different colors when held in hand I

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.789 
different colors when held in hand I
actually<00:03:33.880> never<00:03:34.360> actually<00:03:34.810> got<00:03:35.410> one<00:03:35.590> of<00:03:35.680> these

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
actually never actually got one of these

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.920 
actually never actually got one of these
boots<00:03:36.100> out<00:03:36.340> but<00:03:36.519> I'm<00:03:36.970> guessing<00:03:37.269> that<00:03:37.450> it<00:03:37.750> all

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
boots out but I'm guessing that it all

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.110 
boots out but I'm guessing that it all
had<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.350> same<00:03:38.380> kind<00:03:39.310> of<00:03:39.400> texture<00:03:39.970> when

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
had the same kind of texture when

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.150 
had the same kind of texture when
holding<00:03:40.510> it<00:03:40.630> in<00:03:40.720> your<00:03:40.840> hand<00:03:41.110> but<00:03:41.650> now<00:03:41.830> as<00:03:42.040> you

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
holding it in your hand but now as you

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.370 
holding it in your hand but now as you
can<00:03:42.220> tell<00:03:42.400> by<00:03:43.030> if<00:03:43.330> we<00:03:43.360> switch<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:43.959> to<00:03:43.989> like<00:03:44.230> the

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
can tell by if we switch it to like the

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.410 
can tell by if we switch it to like the
darker<00:03:44.799> one<00:03:44.950> it's<00:03:45.160> actually<00:03:45.700> you<00:03:46.239> know<00:03:46.360> you

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
darker one it's actually you know you

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.840 
darker one it's actually you know you
can<00:03:46.660> tell<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.290> difference<00:03:47.590> when<00:03:48.310> holding<00:03:48.730> it

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
can tell the difference when holding it

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.900 
can tell the difference when holding it
in<00:03:49.000> your<00:03:49.209> hand<00:03:49.570> the<00:03:50.320> next<00:03:50.769> bug<00:03:51.040> fix<00:03:51.370> is<00:03:51.610> that

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
in your hand the next bug fix is that

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.270 
in your hand the next bug fix is that
they<00:03:52.030> fix<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:52.630> mobs<00:03:52.989> becoming<00:03:53.590> dark<00:03:53.920> when

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
they fix the mobs becoming dark when

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.720 
they fix the mobs becoming dark when
moving<00:03:54.580> over<00:03:55.540> soul<00:03:55.840> sand<00:03:56.170> and<00:03:56.440> also<00:03:57.220> fixed

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
moving over soul sand and also fixed

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.750 
moving over soul sand and also fixed
wall<00:03:57.940> particles<00:03:58.570> when<00:03:58.780> jumping<00:03:59.140> and<00:03:59.530> a<00:04:00.430> lot

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
wall particles when jumping and a lot

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.660 
wall particles when jumping and a lot
more<00:04:00.910> others<00:04:01.299> which<00:04:01.540> was<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:02.200> anvil<00:04:02.920> now<00:04:03.160> I<00:04:03.190> do

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
more others which was the anvil now I do
