00:00:01.276 --> 00:00:04.478
(upbeat music)

00:00:07.568 --> 00:00:09.263
- Hey Guys!
- Hey Guys!

00:00:09.263 --> 00:00:10.633
Welcome to Cheap to Chic!

00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:13.001
- This is a brand new
channel that we have created

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:14.998
to kind of show you guys
how you can take things

00:00:14.998 --> 00:00:17.785
in your home and space from cheap to chic.

00:00:17.785 --> 00:00:20.199
- So for our first video
we're doing an apartment tour.

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:21.987
And this is just going to be a before

00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:24.402
of the loft that we
have, before we take it

00:00:24.402 --> 00:00:25.911
all the way from cheap to chic.

00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:27.653
- It's a really cool space that we found.

00:00:27.653 --> 00:00:29.626
It's kind of got that
industrial loft feel.

00:00:29.626 --> 00:00:32.273
There's exposed duct work,
there's concrete floors.

00:00:32.273 --> 00:00:34.920
- Random tile from before whatever this

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.963
building was before we lived in it.

00:00:36.963 --> 00:00:38.914
- Yeah it's a really
old building in our city

00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:40.818
so we're super excited to be here

00:00:40.818 --> 00:00:42.165
because it's very historic and

00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:43.767
it's just a really cool space.

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:45.624
- So when you walk into our loft

00:00:45.624 --> 00:00:47.667
it's a huge open space, you
can see the living room,

00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:49.804
straight into the kitchen.

00:00:49.804 --> 00:00:52.195
- We've got a great bar that
we are going to have some

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:54.540
super cute stools at,
that's how I envision it.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.187
And a really great
island space that I know

00:00:57.187 --> 00:00:59.997
we are going to do some
amazing cooking videos on.

00:00:59.997 --> 00:01:01.808
- We are super lucky because this place

00:01:01.808 --> 00:01:03.990
actually came with all of
the appliances that we need.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.359
We've got a great refrigerator,
dishwasher, stove,

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:07.798
microwave!
- microwave!

00:01:07.798 --> 00:01:10.561
and washer and dryer.
- Oh yeah. Everything we need.

00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:12.837
The colors are amazing because the walls

00:01:12.837 --> 00:01:16.389
are all white, we have
nice bright grey cabinets,

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:18.154
and white countertops.

00:01:18.154 --> 00:01:20.313
- I love the blinds
because a lot of places

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:23.332
you get those kind of like
mini-blinds that don't look

00:01:23.332 --> 00:01:25.445
so chic, they're a little bit more cheap.

00:01:25.445 --> 00:01:27.511
And these I feel like look super nice.

00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:29.694
I know I had an apartment once
that had the really tacky -

00:01:29.694 --> 00:01:31.180
- And those break really easy also

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.037
- Yes they do. The sun like pours in

00:01:33.037 --> 00:01:34.642
and they crack, it's terrible.

00:01:34.642 --> 00:01:36.213
- So, just in case we
didn't tell you guys,

00:01:36.213 --> 00:01:37.884
this place is about 1,200 square feet

00:01:37.884 --> 00:01:40.166
so there are three
bedrooms and two bathrooms.

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:41.814
So once you leave the living room

00:01:41.814 --> 00:01:43.532
you walk into the hallway to the right

00:01:43.532 --> 00:01:45.668
- And you've got the
bedroom off over to the left

00:01:45.668 --> 00:01:48.153
and both the bedrooms, we
actually have three bedrooms,

00:01:48.153 --> 00:01:50.359
but two are going to be
used as bedroom spaces then

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:52.727
the third we're going to use
kind of as an office space.

00:01:52.727 --> 00:01:55.374
So they're pretty similar, tiny closets,

00:01:55.374 --> 00:01:57.510
but we're going to show
you guys some fun ways

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.205
to work around that.

00:01:59.205 --> 00:02:00.830
- Yes. There's also two bathrooms.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.386
One that's kind of a guest but its also

00:02:02.386 --> 00:02:03.988
for one of the bedrooms and then

00:02:03.988 --> 00:02:05.915
one bigger bathroom that's in the back

00:02:05.915 --> 00:02:09.027
that kind of is almost like
a master kind of bathroom

00:02:09.027 --> 00:02:11.279
because there's a bedroom back
there that it connects to.

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:14.065
As well as a gigantic
closet in a third bedroom.

00:02:14.065 --> 00:02:15.714
- The only thing that would
have made this space better

00:02:15.714 --> 00:02:18.222
is if that third bedroom had had windows

00:02:18.222 --> 00:02:20.102
because it's a little bit dark without

00:02:20.102 --> 00:02:21.937
that natural light coming in but I think

00:02:21.937 --> 00:02:24.073
we can figure out some
ways to brighten it up.

00:02:24.073 --> 00:02:26.000
- Alright guys, that is our loft!

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.997
- We're super excited to start the process

00:02:27.997 --> 00:02:30.388
of decorating it, filling
it with really cool pieces,

00:02:30.388 --> 00:02:32.060
and doing it on a budget.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.848
- It's going to be fun. You
guys should stick around.

00:02:33.848 --> 00:02:35.427
- We would love to have your feedback

00:02:35.427 --> 00:02:37.145
on things you'd like
to see on this channel.

00:02:37.145 --> 00:02:39.165
We're going to be going
out and finding pieces

00:02:39.165 --> 00:02:40.303
that work really well in here as well as

00:02:40.303 --> 00:02:42.021
doing some DIY videos.

00:02:42.021 --> 00:02:43.879
- It's going to be a blast so don't forget

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.736
to subscribe and give us viewer thumbs up

00:02:45.736 --> 00:02:47.640
and come back next time for even more.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.846
- We're going to see you
guys super, super soon!

00:02:49.846 --> 00:02:51.084
- Bye guys!
- Bye!
