Easter Egg already because I know a lot
of<00:01:20.400> my<00:01:20.700> subscribers<00:01:20.970> have<00:01:21.750> said<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.170> and

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
of my subscribers have said that and

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.800 
of my subscribers have said that and
this<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.890> new<00:01:23.070> solution<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.540> really

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
this is the new solution so it's really

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.510 
this is the new solution so it's really
cool<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:25.950> with<00:01:26.009> more<00:01:26.369> than

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
cool and you can do this with more than

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.730 
cool and you can do this with more than
one<00:01:26.670> person<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:27.630> example<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:28.380> can<00:01:28.530> just

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
one person so for example you can just

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.710 
one person so for example you can just
have<00:01:28.890> two<00:01:29.159> people<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.729> start<00:01:30.060> up<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.270> custom
