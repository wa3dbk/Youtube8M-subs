00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.719 
can see I've got this extra 26 inch bass
drum<00:00:53.899> which<00:00:54.140> people<00:00:54.469> ask<00:00:54.679> me<00:00:54.890> about<00:00:54.920> a<00:00:55.399> lot

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:55.729 
drum which people ask me about a lot

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:58.180 
drum which people ask me about a lot
over<00:00:56.359> the<00:00:56.390> years<00:00:56.479> I've<00:00:56.899> started<00:00:57.190> realizing

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
over the years I've started realizing

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.770 
over the years I've started realizing
that<00:00:58.309> there's<00:00:58.519> all<00:00:58.639> this<00:00:58.760> space<00:00:59.120> over<00:00:59.389> here

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
that there's all this space over here

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.509 
that there's all this space over here
and<00:00:59.960> how<00:01:00.079> could<00:01:00.229> I<00:01:00.319> mount<00:01:00.679> some<00:01:00.949> interesting

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
and how could I mount some interesting

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.369 
and how could I mount some interesting
sounds<00:01:01.789> and<00:01:02.569> it<00:01:02.629> would<00:01:02.719> be<00:01:02.809> hard<00:01:03.019> to<00:01:03.109> get

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
sounds and it would be hard to get

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.330 
sounds and it would be hard to get
stands<00:01:04.010> in<00:01:04.370> here<00:01:04.759> so<00:01:05.239> DW<00:01:05.930> has<00:01:06.350> this<00:01:06.710> clamp

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
stands in here so DW has this clamp

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.120 
stands in here so DW has this clamp
mount<00:01:07.729> that<00:01:08.689> I've<00:01:08.869> found<00:01:09.170> to<00:01:09.350> be<00:01:09.500> incredibly

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
mount that I've found to be incredibly

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.819 
mount that I've found to be incredibly
useful<00:01:10.450> so<00:01:11.450> you<00:01:11.540> can<00:01:11.780> keep<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.170> Virgen<00:01:12.619> bass

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:12.829 
useful so you can keep the Virgen bass

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:14.770 
useful so you can keep the Virgen bass
drum<00:01:13.250> and<00:01:13.549> not<00:01:13.700> have<00:01:13.880> to<00:01:13.969> drill<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.299> bass<00:01:14.479> drum

and not have to put all kinds of
different<00:01:16.189> stands<00:01:16.700> in<00:01:16.939> here<00:01:17.180> but<00:01:17.719> you<00:01:17.869> can<00:01:18.020> put

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
these little clamps and as you can see

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.569 
these little clamps and as you can see
I've<00:01:20.000> got<00:01:20.240> a<00:01:20.509> cymbal<00:01:21.020> here<00:01:21.530> I've<00:01:22.039> got<00:01:22.369> some

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
I've got a cymbal here I've got some

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:24.940 
I've got a cymbal here I've got some
Pete<00:01:22.759> angle<00:01:23.149> heart<00:01:23.450> stuff<00:01:23.810> here<00:01:24.320> so<00:01:24.469> I've<00:01:24.920> got

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
Pete angle heart stuff here so I've got

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.490 
Pete angle heart stuff here so I've got
three<00:01:25.399> things<00:01:25.700> here<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:26.240> they<00:01:26.750> never<00:01:27.049> give<00:01:27.380> me

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
three things here and they never give me

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.190 
three things here and they never give me
any<00:01:27.649> problem<00:01:28.159> so<00:01:28.789> I<00:01:28.820> can<00:01:29.149> wall<00:01:29.329> up<00:01:29.509> this<00:01:29.659> cymbal

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
any problem so I can wall up this cymbal

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.219 
any problem so I can wall up this cymbal
and<00:01:30.380> it<00:01:30.799> doesn't<00:01:31.189> budge<00:01:31.579> so<00:01:32.539> that's<00:01:32.990> pretty

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
and it doesn't budge so that's pretty

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.289 
and it doesn't budge so that's pretty
hip<00:01:33.500> so<00:01:33.740> you<00:01:33.770> can<00:01:34.219> kind<00:01:34.579> of<00:01:34.640> get<00:01:34.789> creative<00:01:34.909> and

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
hip so you can kind of get creative and

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:36.730 
hip so you can kind of get creative and

I'm about to try to figure out what I
could<00:01:44.689> put<00:01:45.049> right<00:01:45.679> here<00:01:45.710> because<00:01:46.490> now<00:01:46.670> I've

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789

could put right here because now I've
got<00:01:46.969> this<00:01:47.149> space<00:01:47.509> so<00:01:47.840> I<00:01:47.869> might<00:01:48.109> put<00:01:48.320> in<00:01:48.439> like<00:01:48.710> a

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
got this space so I might put in like a

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.340 
got this space so I might put in like a
little<00:01:49.070> mini<00:01:49.759> timbale<00:01:50.329> or<00:01:50.810> something<00:01:51.200> like

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
little mini timbale or something like

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.620 
little mini timbale or something like
that<00:01:51.409> but<00:01:51.770> I've<00:01:51.920> got<00:01:51.950> space<00:01:52.429> now<00:01:52.729> and<00:01:53.090> with

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
that but I've got space now and with

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.609 
that but I've got space now and with
that<00:01:54.250> clamp<00:01:55.250> mount<00:01:55.549> I<00:01:55.850> can<00:01:56.149> get<00:01:56.810> in<00:01:57.079> here<00:01:57.439> and

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
that clamp mount I can get in here and

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.590 
that clamp mount I can get in here and
then<00:01:57.679> I<00:01:58.009> can<00:01:58.070> put<00:01:58.429> different<00:01:58.670> things<00:01:58.880> up<00:01:59.329> in

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
then I can put different things up in

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.209 
then I can put different things up in
this<00:01:59.749> space<00:02:00.109> so<00:02:00.140> I'm<00:02:00.799> gonna<00:02:00.920> think<00:02:01.039> of

this space so I'm gonna think of

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.200 
this space so I'm gonna think of
something<00:02:01.249> to<00:02:01.609> do<00:02:01.759> with<00:02:01.880> that<00:02:01.939> space

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
something to do with that space

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.450 
something to do with that space
