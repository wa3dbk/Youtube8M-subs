the<00:02:12.920> gauges<00:02:13.360> shows<00:02:14.360> us<00:02:14.540> temperatures

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
the gauges shows us temperatures

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.820 
the gauges shows us temperatures
pressures<00:02:15.550> boost<00:02:16.960> only<00:02:17.960> lap<00:02:18.170> times<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:18.650> so<00:02:18.800> on

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
pressures boost only lap times and so on

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.900 
pressures boost only lap times and so on
um<00:02:19.900> we<00:02:20.900> have<00:02:21.080> buttons<00:02:21.380> for<00:02:21.650> main<00:02:21.860> switch<00:02:22.160> use<00:02:22.640> P

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
um we have buttons for main switch use P

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.960 
um we have buttons for main switch use P
off<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.330> fire<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.810> cynosure<00:02:24.110> oh<00:02:24.470> wow

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
off and fire the cynosure oh wow

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.540 
off and fire the cynosure oh wow
we<00:02:26.420> do<00:02:26.540> have<00:02:26.750> engine<00:02:27.620> start/stop<00:02:27.920> button<00:02:28.100> on

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
we do have engine start/stop button on

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.670 
we do have engine start/stop button on
the<00:02:28.730> steering<00:02:28.910> wheel<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.960> the<00:02:30.200> track<00:02:30.440> mode

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
the steering wheel and the track mode

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.199 
the steering wheel and the track mode
button

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
button

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.179 
button
so<00:02:32.299> we<00:02:32.390> can<00:02:32.540> choose<00:02:33.159> three<00:02:34.159> different

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:34.189 
so we can choose three different

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:35.920 
so we can choose three different
mappings<00:02:34.969> from<00:02:35.329> the<00:02:35.510> engine

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
mappings from the engine

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.720 
mappings from the engine
oh<00:02:35.959> so<00:02:36.680> you<00:02:36.739> have<00:02:36.890> three<00:02:37.069> different<00:02:37.099> mappings

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
oh so you have three different mappings

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.979 
oh so you have three different mappings
Street<00:02:38.180> sport<00:02:38.659> and<00:02:38.900> track<00:02:39.170> right<00:02:39.650> yeah<00:02:39.829> nice

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
Street sport and track right yeah nice

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.190 
Street sport and track right yeah nice
so<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.170> engine<00:02:42.530> has<00:02:43.400> different<00:02:43.760> mapping

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
so the engine has different mapping

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.429 
so the engine has different mapping
drivetrain<00:02:45.200> in<00:02:45.439> the<00:02:45.620> dampers<00:02:46.489> well<00:02:47.480> it's<00:02:48.319> just

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:48.439 
drivetrain in the dampers well it's just

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.819 
drivetrain in the dampers well it's just
like<00:02:48.799> you<00:02:49.340> want<00:02:49.579> to<00:02:49.730> so<00:02:50.569> how<00:02:50.810> much<00:02:50.959> what<00:02:51.739> are
