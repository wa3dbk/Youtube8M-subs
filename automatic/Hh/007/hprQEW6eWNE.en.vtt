00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.360
 Decorated i am on here to my garten 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.760
 julien gomes side that is engineer of 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.020
 design planning ne 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.699
 Nice to be here with you and 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.950
 rear julien 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:42.489
 So we'll talk a little about it. 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:46.059
 the structure of this enterprise is that it is 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:49.510
 Everybody passes every day grows 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:52.239
 quickly behind this is Juliana has 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.370
 a lot of technology the designer that is a 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.489
 construction company that has been in the 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.579
 The market is mainly 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.860
 quality safety items 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.039
 the issue of the environment and you 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:09.400
 the right person to tell us about these 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:11.790
 information such as what is in the works and which 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:20.619
 it is these resources that you use 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:22.720
 to move on to all this people 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.360
 need to invest in technology and 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.500
 invest in new equipment everything changes 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:33.280
 is everybody we need 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.189
 innovating looking out of maringá outside 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.280
 Brazil and this is what design does to 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:41.200
 people search new technologies search 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.450
 bring different things to maringá 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.549
 then the crane and our method 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.890
 constructive structure that is here 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.560
 this ribbed slab drew much attention 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.990
 The staff repeats it's cool to see everything. 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.369
 world says so every week 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.229
 that happened here in front of the work 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.450
 were on the top floor 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.790
 Julian e.g. as the crane that 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.659
 this equipment works on the job as 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.329
 it works 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.520
 it facilitates all our logistics 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:10.329
 so we can use it for example 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.810
 use the beams that are made 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.450
 in floor 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.180
 sail to the deck then enough 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.069
 All ready, we do not have that one anymore. 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.640
 time riding way pavement by 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.780
 which is thus the common method that 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.780
 we see here in the city 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.819
 so I guess because it's different it's called 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.980
 a lot of attention is what we are looking for 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.349
 that the client bought his apartment 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.180
 in who passes here every week he does not 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.040
 see how you're walking and that leaves the 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.989
 happy customer he sees that the work 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.000
 it is still going to meet the 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:45.650
 time that we promised by remembering 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.630
 this deadline is for September 2011 even 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.810
 another detail is that you commented with me 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.739
 is the drywall you use in 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.510
 apartments what are the advantages 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.549
 of this material 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.519
 we have a much higher productivity 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.950
 in the work is a good wall quality 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.739
 the best and the customer has the 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.410
 ease of energy like it by 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:12.769
 example he needs a socket he 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.599
 It will put a some background in television 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.549
 Different place it will change 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.160
 his room so he needs a 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.989
 outlet where he did not break all 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.459
 wall that made that lot of 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.799
 debris inside the apartment that they 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.989
 generated it will drill into the dry 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.480
 the oil is going to be able to pull is much more 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.370
 This is easy for the customer and 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.720
 acoustics between the environments also 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.489
 people are talking here in the room 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.930
 Thursday in the room will not be lacking . 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.870
 None of us are talking. 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.430
 Let's enjoy it, we 're here. 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.720
 show who 's watching us 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.790
 that you have interest is still have units 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.850
 it's worth to come and visit 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.970
 three quarters in Juliana and that's 34 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.430
 being that one is a suite and some clients 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.290
 even opted for the apartment with two 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.269
 rooms because that's how I said it 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.040
 The greater can change then it's legal to 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.840
 people have so many plants in it 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.940
 The building we are running here is 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.310
 cool control so are 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.790
 customized plants the basic plant 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.569
 we 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.359
 are three rooms a suite like i said 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.920
 the open kitchen or customer can still 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:18.380
 choose the most closed kitchen 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.780
 open making a success is what the 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.859
 customer likes leaving apartment 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.449
 broad 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.699
 integrate everything here we have the 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:28.520
 barbecue on the balcony then everything is 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:31.550
 a social area so good for 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.810
 Received how great I loved this chat 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.580

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:49.069
