actually<00:03:46.490> the<00:03:46.640> navigation<00:03:47.420> system<00:03:47.450> so<00:03:48.110> now

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
actually the navigation system so now

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.020

when<00:03:48.560> you're<00:03:48.680> gliding<00:03:48.920> around<00:03:49.220> you<00:03:49.730> can<00:03:49.850> glide

when you're gliding around you can glide

when you're gliding around you can glide
around<00:03:50.210> and<00:03:50.540> use<00:03:50.660> your<00:03:50.780> momentum<00:03:50.930> to<00:03:51.350> kind<00:03:51.530> of

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
around and use your momentum to kind of

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.320 
around and use your momentum to kind of
fly<00:03:51.770> around<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:52.220> city<00:03:52.430> and<00:03:52.670> I<00:03:53.000> think<00:03:53.180> that's

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
fly around the city and I think that's

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.820 
fly around the city and I think that's
something<00:03:53.480> that<00:03:53.600> players<00:03:54.230> are<00:03:54.410> really<00:03:54.710> going

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
something that players are really going

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.260 
something that players are really going

to enjoy you know of anything that's

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.210 
to enjoy you know of anything that's
probably<00:03:56.990> what<00:03:57.170> we<00:03:57.260> lose<00:03:57.440> most<00:03:57.740> time<00:03:57.980> on<00:03:58.100> at

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220
