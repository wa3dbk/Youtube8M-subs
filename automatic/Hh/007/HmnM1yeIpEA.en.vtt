00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
that but I'm talking about the way the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.840 
that but I'm talking about the way the
car<00:00:35.300> feels<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:37.260> my<00:00:37.290> friend's<00:00:37.800> car<00:00:38.010> its<00:00:38.340> dippy

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.680 
car feels in my friend's car its dippy
it's<00:00:39.450> slow<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.379> shifts<00:00:40.980> weird<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.640> if<00:00:42.540> there's

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
it's slow it shifts weird and if there's

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.569 
it's slow it shifts weird and if there's
nothing<00:00:42.780> wrong<00:00:43.050> with<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.410> it's<00:00:43.559> just<00:00:43.620> like<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
nothing wrong with it it's just like the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.420 
nothing wrong with it it's just like the
tachometer<00:00:44.940> moves<00:00:45.360> slow<00:00:46.430> transmission

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
tachometer moves slow transmission

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.220 
tachometer moves slow transmission
shifts<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.510> doesn't<00:00:48.750> shift<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
shifts but it just doesn't shift the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.290 
shifts but it just doesn't shift the
same<00:00:49.500> as<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.829> car<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:51.000> car<00:00:51.270> has

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
same as this car and this car has

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.680 
same as this car and this car has
something<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.809> it

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
something to it

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.410 
something to it
tachometer<00:00:54.890> will<00:00:55.890> move<00:00:56.430> faster<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.210> one

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
tachometer will move faster in this one

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.029 
tachometer will move faster in this one
it<00:00:57.629> just<00:00:57.809> seems<00:00:58.260> like<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.500> car<00:00:58.710> goes<00:00:59.010> faster

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
it just seems like the car goes faster

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.569 
it just seems like the car goes faster
although<00:00:59.850> it's<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.059> same<00:01:00.300> exact<00:01:00.600> engine<00:01:01.050> and

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:44.449 

so<00:03:38.010> as<00:03:38.420> any<00:03:39.420> hall<00:03:39.959> would<00:03:40.170> say<00:03:40.439> I<00:03:43.069> can't<00:03:44.069> did<00:03:44.340> it

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
so as any hall would say I can't did it

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.660 
so as any hall would say I can't did it
come<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:45.030> don't<00:03:45.120> have<00:03:45.629> the<00:03:45.810> power<00:03:46.370> this<00:03:47.370> car

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
come I don't have the power this car

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.030 
come I don't have the power this car
definitely<00:03:47.879> loses<00:03:48.569> out<00:03:48.719> on<00:03:48.840> its<00:03:48.989> power<00:03:49.170> and<00:03:49.560> I

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
definitely loses out on its power and I

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.740 
definitely loses out on its power and I
think<00:03:50.250> that's<00:03:50.400> also<00:03:50.549> linked<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.359> the<00:03:51.510> great

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
think that's also linked to the great

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.369 
think that's also linked to the great
fuel<00:03:52.079> economy<00:03:52.140> it<00:03:52.620> has<00:03:52.799> 40<00:03:53.219> miles<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.489> gallon

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
fuel economy it has 40 miles a gallon

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.929 
fuel economy it has 40 miles a gallon
but<00:03:55.379> it<00:03:55.650> loses<00:03:55.799> a<00:03:55.920> lot<00:03:56.069> of<00:03:56.129> power<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.579> it<00:03:56.609> and

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:56.939 
but it loses a lot of power to it and

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.390 
but it loses a lot of power to it and
that's<00:03:57.780> okay<00:03:58.109> I<00:03:58.349> mean<00:03:58.709> I'm<00:03:59.010> not<00:03:59.159> going<00:03:59.310> to

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
that's okay I mean I'm not going to

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.429 
that's okay I mean I'm not going to
complain<00:03:59.640> it's<00:04:00.329> faster<00:04:00.689> than<00:04:00.810> my<00:04:00.930> car<00:04:01.200> my

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 
complain it's faster than my car my

though<00:05:27.190> is<00:05:27.400> a<00:05:27.700> transmission<00:05:28.300> smooth<00:05:28.840> but<00:05:29.200> I

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
though is a transmission smooth but I

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.990 
though is a transmission smooth but I
think<00:05:29.440> it's<00:05:29.560> trying<00:05:29.800> to<00:05:29.860> be<00:05:29.980> true<00:05:30.370> smooth<00:05:30.790> it's

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
think it's trying to be true smooth it's

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.150 
think it's trying to be true smooth it's

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
get into overdrive but then it ends up

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.620 
get into overdrive but then it ends up
down<00:05:36.670> shifting<00:05:37.270> and<00:05:37.600> you're<00:05:38.500> like<00:05:39.000> damn<00:05:40.000> you
