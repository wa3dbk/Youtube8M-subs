00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
a home-built vacuum forming machine but

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.790 
a home-built vacuum forming machine but
when<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.300> do<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:49.110> title<00:00:49.440> runs<00:00:49.590> off<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
when you do that the title runs off the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.340 
when you do that the title runs off the
page<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.460> can't<00:00:50.700> see<00:00:51.030> what<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.660> means<00:00:51.809> another

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
page you can't see what it means another

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.350 
page you can't see what it means another
example<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:52.980> how<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.550> make<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.789> cheap<00:00:54.120> see

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
example is how to make it cheap see

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.959 
example is how to make it cheap see
jeast<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.870> that's<00:00:55.350> okay<00:00:55.739> maybe<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.460> little<00:00:56.850> bit

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
jeast and that's okay maybe a little bit

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.270 
jeast and that's okay maybe a little bit
better<00:00:57.180> would<00:00:57.449> be<00:00:57.629> make<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.170> cheap<00:00:58.500> CG<00:00:58.949> stand

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
better would be make a cheap CG stand

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.979 
better would be make a cheap CG stand
because<00:00:59.820> it's<00:01:00.059> already<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> project

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
because it's already in the project

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.080 
because it's already in the project
category<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.920> makes<00:01:02.100> sense<00:01:02.190> short<00:01:02.730> titles

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
category so it makes sense short titles

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.549 
category so it makes sense short titles
are<00:01:03.239> good<00:01:03.390> make<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:03.809> short<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.320> informative

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
are good make up short and informative

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.560 
are good make up short and informative
