00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:42.640 
this space that wouldn't get sucked in a
lost

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.490 

so<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.799> kind<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.099> thing<00:02:44.310> for<00:02:44.519> me<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:45.120> that's

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
so the kind of thing for me that that's

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.839 
so the kind of thing for me that that's
the<00:02:46.500> sort<00:02:46.739> of<00:02:46.769> power<00:02:47.010> of<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.280> piece<00:02:47.459> is<00:02:47.730> the

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
the sort of power of the piece is the

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.670 
the sort of power of the piece is the
kind<00:02:48.090> of<00:02:48.209> absurdity<00:02:48.900> on<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.170> end<00:02:49.319> but<00:02:49.500> then

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
kind of absurdity on the end but then

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.550 
kind of absurdity on the end but then
how<00:02:49.980> that's<00:02:50.540> repeated<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.930> know<00:02:52.080> the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
how that's repeated you know the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.339 
how that's repeated you know the
repetition<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.489> sort<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.900> mirror<00:02:55.170> in

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
repetition and the sort of the mirror in

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.500 
repetition and the sort of the mirror in
of<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:55.680> absurd<00:02:56.159> shake<00:02:56.519> us<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.760> room<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.209> kind<00:02:57.420> of

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
of this absurd shake us a room I kind of

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.970 
of this absurd shake us a room I kind of
really<00:02:57.690> like<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:58.049> so<00:02:58.260> on<00:02:58.349> the<00:02:58.440> for<00:02:58.620> benches

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
really like that so on the for benches

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.830 
really like that so on the for benches
we've<00:02:59.190> got<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.430> mirrored<00:02:59.790> through<00:03:00.209> here<00:03:00.629> and

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
we've got the mirrored through here and

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.630 
we've got the mirrored through here and
here<00:03:01.290> so<00:03:01.470> this<00:03:01.709> section<00:03:02.069> replicated

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
here so this section replicated

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.580 
here so this section replicated
secession<00:03:03.150> replicates<00:03:03.750> this<00:03:04.200> section

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
secession replicates this section

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:13.150 
secession replicates this section
decision<00:03:05.159> decision<00:03:05.760> decision

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.790 

the<00:03:13.580> idea<00:03:13.940> was<00:03:14.150> just<00:03:14.390> taking<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.990> geometric

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
the idea was just taking the geometric

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.060 
the idea was just taking the geometric
motifs<00:03:16.310> on<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.910> architrave<00:03:17.390> II<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:18.070> breaking

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
motifs on the architrave II and breaking

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.340 
motifs on the architrave II and breaking
that<00:03:19.250> down<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:19.910> then<00:03:20.210> reconstructing<00:03:21.020> it<00:03:21.110> in

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
that down and then reconstructing it in

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.500 
that down and then reconstructing it in
a<00:03:21.470> slightly<00:03:21.830> abstract<00:03:22.550> but<00:03:22.730> functional<00:03:23.330> way

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
a slightly abstract but functional way

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.980 
a slightly abstract but functional way
with<00:03:24.170> a<00:03:24.200> very<00:03:24.470> intentional<00:03:25.690> lift<00:03:26.690> in<00:03:26.900> the

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
with a very intentional lift in the

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.690 
with a very intentional lift in the
center<00:03:27.350> of<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.560> benches<00:03:27.980> so<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.340> benches

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
center of the benches so the benches

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.070 
center of the benches so the benches
actually<00:03:29.000> don't<00:03:29.180> sit<00:03:29.450> flat<00:03:29.660> on<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:29.960> floor

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
actually don't sit flat on the floor

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.810 
actually don't sit flat on the floor
they're<00:03:30.410> being<00:03:30.650> pushed<00:03:30.890> into<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.310> corner<00:03:31.790> of

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
provoking it's so nice to see something

and that gives me chicken skin it makes
me<00:04:31.990> so<00:04:32.110> excited<00:04:32.200> because<00:04:32.620> it's<00:04:32.770> that<00:04:33.220> there's

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
something new here again something new

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.600 
something new here again something new
and<00:04:36.280> I<00:04:36.370> think<00:04:37.200> that's<00:04:38.200> what<00:04:38.410> inspiring<00:04:39.070> it's<00:04:39.490> a

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
and I think that's what inspiring it's a

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.640 
and I think that's what inspiring it's a
really<00:04:39.820> excellent<00:04:40.330> piece<00:04:40.660> I've<00:04:41.410> always

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
really excellent piece I've always

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.070 
really excellent piece I've always
enjoyed<00:04:42.130> and<00:04:42.730> been<00:04:43.120> in<00:04:43.240> love<00:04:43.390> with<00:04:43.540> timber<00:04:43.900> but

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
enjoyed and been in love with timber but

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.420 
enjoyed and been in love with timber but
to<00:04:44.260> see<00:04:44.470> it<00:04:44.590> used<00:04:44.800> in<00:04:45.040> this<00:04:45.690> remarkable<00:04:46.690> way

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
to see it used in this remarkable way

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.160 
to see it used in this remarkable way
it's<00:04:48.430> a<00:04:48.610> really<00:04:48.850> interesting<00:04:48.940> design<00:04:49.690> because

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
it's a really interesting design because

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.040 
it's a really interesting design because
it's<00:04:50.490> the<00:04:51.490> one<00:04:51.640> time<00:04:51.700> really<00:04:52.180> comfortable<00:04:52.750> and

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
it's the one time really comfortable and

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.290 
it's the one time really comfortable and
another<00:04:53.950> time<00:04:54.160> slightly<00:04:54.670> disturbing<00:04:55.150> but

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
another time slightly disturbing but

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.210 
another time slightly disturbing but
many<00:04:55.510> museums<00:04:55.900> are<00:04:56.260> not<00:04:56.380> allowed<00:04:56.710> to<00:04:56.740> actually

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
many museums are not allowed to actually

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.550 
many museums are not allowed to actually
touch<00:04:57.400> anything<00:04:57.760> this<00:04:58.750> you<00:04:58.930> can<00:04:59.080> actually<00:04:59.230> lay

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
touch anything this you can actually lay

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.160 
touch anything this you can actually lay
down<00:04:59.830> on<00:05:00.040> if<00:05:00.190> you<00:05:00.310> wanted<00:05:00.580> to<00:05:00.820> and<00:05:01.060> it<00:05:02.050> was

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
down on if you wanted to and it was

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.200 
down on if you wanted to and it was
wonderful

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.100 

I<00:05:07.430> think<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:08.610> partnership<00:05:09.419> that<00:05:09.630> happens

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
I think the partnership that happens

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.710 
I think the partnership that happens
here<00:05:10.319> is<00:05:10.860> very<00:05:11.250> very<00:05:11.520> inspiring<00:05:12.120> and<00:05:12.389> I<00:05:12.509> think

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
here is very very inspiring and I think

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.850 
here is very very inspiring and I think
that<00:05:12.810> should<00:05:12.960> have<00:05:13.169> much<00:05:13.560> more

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
that should have much more

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.309 
that should have much more
that's<00:05:15.460> when<00:05:15.699> you<00:05:15.849> get<00:05:16.030> unusual<00:05:16.659> stuff<00:05:17.020> like

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:17.319 
that's when you get unusual stuff like

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:18.959 
that's when you get unusual stuff like
this<00:05:17.469> happening<00:05:17.889> what<00:05:18.280> intrigues<00:05:18.669> me<00:05:18.849> about

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:18.969 
this happening what intrigues me about

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:20.730 
this happening what intrigues me about
it<00:05:19.360> is<00:05:19.479> is<00:05:19.719> the<00:05:19.870> way<00:05:19.990> that<00:05:20.139> you<00:05:20.259> don't<00:05:20.500> know<00:05:20.620> if

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
it is is the way that you don't know if

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.490
