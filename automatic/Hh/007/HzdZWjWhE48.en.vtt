normal rifle case the reason I bought it

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:41.979 
normal rifle case the reason I bought it
was<00:00:40.970> because<00:00:41.270> I<00:00:41.360> was<00:00:41.480> looking<00:00:41.720> for<00:00:41.960> a

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
was because I was looking for a

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.310 
was because I was looking for a
alternative<00:00:42.710> to<00:00:42.770> the<00:00:43.100> AR<00:00:43.910> hard<00:00:44.210> case<00:00:44.450> the<00:00:45.140> hard

alternative to the AR hard case the hard

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.229 
alternative to the AR hard case the hard
case<00:00:45.530> is<00:00:45.739> a<00:00:45.770> little<00:00:46.070> long<00:00:46.250> and<00:00:46.280> unwieldy<00:00:46.640> and

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
case is a little long and unwieldy and

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:48.640 
case is a little long and unwieldy and
it's<00:00:47.420> kind<00:00:47.600> of<00:00:47.629> awkward<00:00:47.840> when<00:00:48.230> you're<00:00:48.320> walking

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
it's kind of awkward when you're walking

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.080 
it's kind of awkward when you're walking
up<00:00:48.680> the<00:00:48.830> stairs<00:00:49.070> or<00:00:49.250> trying<00:00:49.460> to<00:00:49.520> transport<00:00:49.850> it

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
up the stairs or trying to transport it

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.120 
up the stairs or trying to transport it
somewhere<00:00:50.390> not<00:00:51.110> to<00:00:51.230> mention<00:00:51.410> it<00:00:51.950> doesn't

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
somewhere not to mention it doesn't

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.860 
somewhere not to mention it doesn't
really<00:00:52.400> fit<00:00:52.730> a<00:00:52.760> whole<00:00:53.030> lot<00:00:53.240> in<00:00:53.450> it<00:00:53.630> you<00:00:53.750> can

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
really fit a whole lot in it you can

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.510 
really fit a whole lot in it you can
pretty<00:00:54.170> much<00:00:54.260> fit<00:00:54.560> the<00:00:54.650> rifle<00:00:55.040> and<00:00:55.190> maybe<00:00:55.400> a

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
pretty much fit the rifle and maybe a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.960 
pretty much fit the rifle and maybe a
sling<00:00:55.910> in<00:00:56.150> a<00:00:56.210> few<00:00:56.420> mags<00:00:56.690> that's<00:00:57.410> about<00:00:57.620> it<00:00:57.970> so

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
sling in a few mags that's about it so

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:59.800 
sling in a few mags that's about it so
what<00:00:59.150> is<00:00:59.239> something<00:00:59.420> that's<00:00:59.540> a<00:00:59.630> little<00:00:59.690> bit

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
what is something that's a little bit

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.080 
what is something that's a little bit
more<00:01:00.079> compact<00:01:00.620> than<00:01:01.070> your<00:01:01.220> normal<00:01:01.340> rifle<00:01:01.940> bag

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
more compact than your normal rifle bag

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.910 
more compact than your normal rifle bag
so<00:01:02.720> I<00:01:02.750> did<00:01:03.050> a<00:01:03.140> search<00:01:03.350> and<00:01:03.560> I<00:01:03.590> ended<00:01:03.739> up<00:01:03.860> coming

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
store it in half I mean that's just kind

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.730 
store it in half I mean that's just kind
of<00:06:07.060> how<00:06:07.180> it<00:06:07.300> is<00:06:07.420> so<00:06:07.660> if<00:06:08.140> you're<00:06:08.440> ever<00:06:08.500> in<00:06:08.650> a

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
of how it is so if you're ever in a

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.350 
of how it is so if you're ever in a
situation<00:06:08.980> where<00:06:09.370> you<00:06:09.430> really<00:06:09.460> need<00:06:09.760> to<00:06:10.150> grab

situation where you really need to grab

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.630 
situation where you really need to grab
your<00:06:10.540> rifle<00:06:10.870> really<00:06:11.110> quick<00:06:11.430> you're<00:06:12.430> going<00:06:12.550> to

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.390 
guess that's not really downfall because

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.270 
guess that's not really downfall because
the<00:06:16.660> bag<00:06:16.840> is<00:06:17.020> designed<00:06:17.170> to<00:06:17.500> be<00:06:17.590> this<00:06:17.800> size<00:06:18.040> for
