00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.870
 so hello to everyone as promised the second 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.330
 part of my review is already with us 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.420
 impressions of using this 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.420
 lantern she let me short 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:18.300
 only there one day m used 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.500
 but already determined by my impression 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.109
 about him folded 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.080
 yesterday was an opportunity to walk with him 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.890
 To test it as they say in the dark 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.439
 time of day already walked through the park 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.800
 walked devoted shrubs bushes and in 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.340
 principle as if more expensive track 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.190
 what can I say well first first on 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.690
 positive what I liked 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.969
 of course he has a wonderful light for me 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.160
 I liked the shooting range completely 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.430
 justified a very central spot 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.550
 it's hard to say what it will be for 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.949
 size at different distances but there was 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.000
 very comfortable with a wide 70 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.239
 degree side illumination 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.550
 was present and was comfortable shine 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.010
 and on medium and long distance and 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.519
 also under my feet everything was visible no neither 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.409
 creature 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.090
 there was no discomfort from the fact that 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.130
 little or not enough light 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.409
 illumination that's purely tactical light 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.439
 color very literate shooting optics here 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.689
 set very competent by 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.540
 light temperature is obviously 5,500 and there is 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.460
 as claimed by the manufacturer as to the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.750
 compared with his neutral datakam 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.270
 on the xm-l diode, then the sixth, I would not say 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.549
 that the cold diode is essentially 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.650
 I lost to a neutral diode, I said 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.400
 if there was any loss after all 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.170
 insignificant all shades which 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.930
 lit asphalt foliage 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.040
 tree trunks which one anything in 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.900
 principle is quite correct 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.320
 passed and comfortable for the eyes 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.310
 Obviously something else played a role 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.740
 focusing the central spot she is not 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.439
 narrow and very wide maybe even 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.920
 slightly wider than fenix pd32 ultimate 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.979
 edition 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.140
 but the nature of the light is somewhere similar when 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.909
 this temperature is pure white light 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:09.069
 no shades any shades of green 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.080
 blue and blue purple pure beat 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.090
 from possible with easy easy easy 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.050
 yellowish slight but very 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.069
 nice and comfortable my opinion personally 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.470
 it is about light but range 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.970
 so hard to say but i used 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.799
 lithium battery here I still 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.110
 since then itâ€™s been playing since yesterday 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.880
 did not notice the drawdown by the way this posts about 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.680
 I will say stabilization did not notice on 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.620
 some kind of significant drawdown fall 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.330
 brightness not at maximum not at 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.049
 the main mode by the way by the modes I would 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.420
 they would have called them so described 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:45.120
 basic general mode and maximum 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.170
 turbo mu because the minimum 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.660
 there is no minimum mode 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.100
 of that 80 min on battery and order 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.799
 160 to lithium 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.630
 but this is no minimum mode even 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.540
 the average would be hard to call 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.310
 general mut and turbo mode and now 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.680
 wishes to the manufacturer 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.150
 the main thing in the first review I allowed 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.829
 error said that the lantern is always 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.959
 included with a minimum next to 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.600
 main janan mode so -called yes 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.609
 nothing like a lantern turned on with 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.019
 the next regime after which he was 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.820
 turned off if you turned off 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.560
 flashlight in main mode 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.150
 next inclusion he will 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.489
 maximum if turned off 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.410
 the maximum will be the main this for 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.720
 me here and essentially one minus was 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.430
 if the manufacturer corrects it for 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.459
 I think it will not be some problem 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.180
 big so the fan is always turned on with 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.040
 main mode is the first second but 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.069
 I would like to have been a button 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.049
 tactical for what so without a click without 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.690
 switching on was able to choose a mode 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:46.420
 in advance 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.650
 this will not include click here so here 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.409
 yes and 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.230
 semi-click to select the maximum mode 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:55.000
 if you need though if there was a memory 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.579
 main mode is always on 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.599
 pine regime that is it would not 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.870
 very necessary 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:04.230
 shemay did not seem to notice this djano val 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.230
 mode and now I will call it 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.230
 turbo 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.739
 what there may be I do not know but not him 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.810
 can not see almost his camera is not 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:19.090
 notices this flicker of some his 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:21.340
 there is no eye 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.080
 maybe this can specific camera 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.100
 rented on the phone so everything can 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.470
 to be and one more wish is this 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.520
 groove for optional 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.190
 clips 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.080
 who needs who needs to buy 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.120
 this clip use it he was 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.539
 could well handle the function 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.680
 headband yes but as an auxiliary 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:46.270
 the function came again kill not replace 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.190
 Here is my opinion extremely positive 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.860
 a ten point system would put him 9 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.949
 with a plus to checked it on 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.020
 water resistance two hours 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:58.120
 enabled main bathroom mode 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.340
 filled there and somewhere half a meter can 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.330
 so there may be a little less 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.760
 40 centimeters no leakage all 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.419
 Perfectly everything is super switched mode when 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:13.409
 This periodically came to me without 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:16.599
 questions can recommend it for 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:18.130
 dives up to 5 maybe even 10 meters i 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:23.320
 I think to cope with it because 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:25.419
 because if the lantern is not leaked on the floor 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.220
 Meter I even but not think that he will give 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.159
 speech at some more serious depth 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.180
 but again this is not giving a lantern 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:34.780
 dive on some small year 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:38.380
 but with him it is possible but nothing more 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.849
 recommended it like dc flashlight and yes 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.740
 principle flashlight for all occasions 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:43.720
 since you are a little finger Lenin power 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.139
 on every corner you can buy very 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:50.440
 satisfied with the purchase I do not regret a penny 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:52.120
 spent on it and ready for everything 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.360
 recommend a great model 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:59.259
 armytek partner 1 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.259
 Thank you all for your attention
