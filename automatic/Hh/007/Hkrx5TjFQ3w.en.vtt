 The Cube comes with a 1-point 6-liter engine that delivers 110 hp and 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:24.109
 so that has a consumption of 6 point 6 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.440
 but the cube is much more about the special than about 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.480
 the performance 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.910

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.870

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.440
 In the seats of the Cube one should feel as comfortable as at home in one's own 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.440
 recliner 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.530
