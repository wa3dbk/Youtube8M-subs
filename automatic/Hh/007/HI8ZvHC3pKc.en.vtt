00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.529 
I talk about 2016 I would like to remind
everyone<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.829> takes<00:01:02.370> each<00:01:02.609> Park<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.090> while<00:01:03.270> to

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
everyone that takes each Park a while to

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.570 
everyone that takes each Park a while to
decide<00:01:03.960> which<00:01:04.439> attractions<00:01:05.070> they're<00:01:05.250> adding

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
decide which attractions they're adding

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.580 
decide which attractions they're adding
and<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.000> these<00:01:06.150> predictions<00:01:06.750> are<00:01:06.960> made<00:01:06.990> based

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
and so these predictions are made based

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.310 
and so these predictions are made based
off<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.920> what<00:01:08.490> would<00:01:08.729> fit<00:01:09.090> best<00:01:09.540> at<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.049> park

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
off of what would fit best at the park

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.990 
off of what would fit best at the park
in<00:01:10.500> my<00:01:10.650> opinion<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.400> video<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.790> being

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
in my opinion this video is being

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.340 
in my opinion this video is being
released<00:01:12.210> when<00:01:12.420> there<00:01:12.570> are<00:01:12.630> currently<00:01:12.990> no

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
released when there are currently no

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.380

rumors<00:01:13.950> about<00:01:14.310> what<00:01:14.549> could<00:01:14.700> be<00:01:14.729> added<00:01:15.150> at<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
rumors about what could be added at the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.420 
rumors about what could be added at the
park<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.810> future<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.979> what<00:01:17.220> I

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
park in the future but this is what I

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.310 
park in the future but this is what I
think<00:01:17.790> would<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.000> great<00:01:18.509> at<00:01:18.750> Hershey<00:01:19.140> Park

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
of these pop up at a park and I think

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.460 
of these pop up at a park and I think
Hershey<00:01:42.000> Park<00:01:42.240> would<00:01:42.450> be<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> great<00:01:42.960> park<00:01:43.259> to

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
Hershey Park would be a great park to

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.050 
Hershey Park would be a great park to
build<00:01:43.710> one<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.009> these<00:01:44.130> because<00:01:44.399> one<00:01:44.790> they<00:01:44.970> have

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
build one of these because one they have

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.910 
build one of these because one they have
a<00:01:45.149> great<00:01:45.420> relationship<00:01:45.630> with<00:01:46.110> intimate<00:01:46.740> as

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
a great relationship with intimate as

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.100 
a great relationship with intimate as
far<00:01:47.159> as<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.399> know<00:01:47.460> they've<00:01:48.270> installed<00:01:48.600> lots<00:01:48.899> of

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
far as I know they've installed lots of

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.410 
far as I know they've installed lots of
intamin<00:01:49.649> rides<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.280> they<00:01:50.670> don't<00:01:50.909> have<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> drop

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
intamin rides and they don't have a drop

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.999 
intamin rides and they don't have a drop
tower<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.140> something<00:01:52.439> like<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.770> would<00:01:52.979> be

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
tower so something like this would be

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.340 
tower so something like this would be
absolutely<00:01:53.549> fantastic<00:01:53.820> at<00:01:54.390> Hershey<00:01:54.689> Park<00:01:54.840> for

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
absolutely fantastic at Hershey Park for

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.380 
absolutely fantastic at Hershey Park for
2017<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.189> could<00:01:56.340> see<00:01:56.490> Hershey<00:01:56.790> Park<00:01:56.909> adding<00:01:57.299> a

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
2017 I could see Hershey Park adding a

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.749 
2017 I could see Hershey Park adding a
new<00:01:57.570> show<00:01:57.899> something<00:01:58.560> smaller<00:01:58.950> like<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.460> or

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
new show something smaller like that or

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.030 
new show something smaller like that or
maybe<00:02:00.210> even<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.719> family<00:02:01.110> ride<00:02:01.320> they<00:02:01.680> did<00:02:01.860> add

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
maybe even a family ride they did add

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.359 
maybe even a family ride they did add
some<00:02:02.070> smaller<00:02:02.729> family<00:02:03.299> rides<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:03.840> 2014<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.219> int

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
some smaller family rides in 2014 so int

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.219 
some smaller family rides in 2014 so int
Y<00:02:05.520> 17<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.090> will<00:02:06.240> have<00:02:06.360> been<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> few<00:02:06.810> years<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.200> I

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
Y 17 it will have been a few years so I

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.600 
Y 17 it will have been a few years so I
think<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.590> they<00:02:07.710> would<00:02:07.890> upgrade<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.580> a

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
think that they would upgrade to a

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.969 
think that they would upgrade to a
larger<00:02:09.360> family<00:02:09.660> ride<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.200> could<00:02:10.590> see<00:02:10.739> something

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
larger family ride I could see something

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.949 
larger family ride I could see something
like<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.250> flying<00:02:11.610> carpet<00:02:11.940> or<00:02:12.209> maybe<00:02:12.450> even<00:02:12.569> a

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
like a flying carpet or maybe even a

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.430 
like a flying carpet or maybe even a
level

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
level

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.050 
level
from<00:02:13.650> that<00:02:13.800> like<00:02:13.980> an<00:02:14.130> air<00:02:14.370> race<00:02:14.610> these<00:02:14.820> air

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
from that like an air race these air

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.910 
from that like an air race these air
races<00:02:15.420> are<00:02:15.540> pretty<00:02:15.780> popular<00:02:15.990> right<00:02:16.530> now<00:02:16.680> I

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
races are pretty popular right now I

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.950 
races are pretty popular right now I
could<00:02:17.430> see<00:02:17.580> them<00:02:17.760> going<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:18.210> route<00:02:18.390> but<00:02:18.930> I

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
could see them going that route but I

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.570 
could see them going that route but I
doubt<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.410> they<00:02:19.500> would<00:02:19.650> add<00:02:19.770> more<00:02:20.130> than<00:02:20.340> two

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
doubt that they would add more than two

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.820 
doubt that they would add more than two
rides<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:21.300> could<00:02:21.750> even<00:02:21.870> see<00:02:22.140> them<00:02:22.290> adding<00:02:22.620> no

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
rides I could even see them adding no

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.010 
rides I could even see them adding no

make<00:03:15.840> for<00:03:16.050> some<00:03:16.230> sweet<00:03:16.590> banked<00:03:17.040> turns<00:03:17.340> they

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
make for some sweet banked turns they

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.580 
make for some sweet banked turns they
get<00:03:17.910> thrown<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:18.540> version<00:03:19.050> on<00:03:19.170> there<00:03:19.380> if<00:03:19.470> they

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
get thrown and version on there if they

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.860 
get thrown and version on there if they
wanted<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.160> bet<00:03:20.520> it<00:03:20.670> would<00:03:20.760> be<00:03:20.820> a<00:03:20.940> really<00:03:21.420> great

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
wanted I bet it would be a really great

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.810 
wanted I bet it would be a really great
ride<00:03:22.290> Hershey<00:03:22.800> Park<00:03:23.040> is<00:03:23.220> not<00:03:23.370> known<00:03:23.580> for

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
ride Hershey Park is not known for

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.000 
ride Hershey Park is not known for
having<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:24.180> great<00:03:24.540> collection<00:03:24.989> of<00:03:25.410> flat<00:03:25.739> rides

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
having a great collection of flat rides

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.760 
having a great collection of flat rides
as<00:03:26.340> of<00:03:26.760> right<00:03:26.940> now<00:03:27.000> 2015<00:03:27.989> really<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.590> only

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
as of right now 2015 really the only

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.010 
as of right now 2015 really the only
flat<00:03:29.010> ride<00:03:29.190> they<00:03:29.370> have<00:03:29.580> is<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.030> claw<00:03:30.300> so<00:03:30.840> one

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
flat ride they have is the claw so one

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.510 
flat ride they have is the claw so one
thing<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.350> think<00:03:31.440> could<00:03:31.770> work<00:03:31.980> really<00:03:32.250> well

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
thing I think could work really well

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.520 
thing I think could work really well
this<00:03:32.790> park<00:03:33.060> would<00:03:33.209> be<00:03:33.270> a<00:03:33.390> SkyScreamer<00:03:33.930> not<00:03:34.350> to

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
this park would be a SkyScreamer not to

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.290 
this park would be a SkyScreamer not to
mention<00:03:34.950> because<00:03:35.130> they're<00:03:35.489> so<00:03:35.700> tall<00:03:36.030> they

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
mention because they're so tall they

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.330 
mention because they're so tall they
don't<00:03:36.510> stay<00:03:36.750> on<00:03:36.780> very<00:03:37.260> much<00:03:37.470> land<00:03:37.830> so<00:03:38.250> that's

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
don't stay on very much land so that's

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.650 
don't stay on very much land so that's
another<00:03:38.670> reason<00:03:38.910> why<00:03:39.150> I<00:03:39.209> think<00:03:39.270> that<00:03:39.450> this

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
another reason why I think that this

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.630 
another reason why I think that this
ride<00:03:39.900> could<00:03:40.110> work<00:03:40.350> well<00:03:40.560> for<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.860> park<00:03:41.070> and<00:03:41.310> in

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
ride could work well for the park and in

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.330 
ride could work well for the park and in
2020<00:03:42.390> I<00:03:42.420> believe<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:43.110> they<00:03:43.230> will<00:03:43.260> expand<00:03:44.040> the

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
2020 I believe that they will expand the

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.460 
2020 I believe that they will expand the
boardwalk<00:03:44.880> I'd<00:03:45.300> love<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.690> see<00:03:45.840> them<00:03:46.019> add<00:03:46.170> some

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
boardwalk I'd love to see them add some

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.290 
boardwalk I'd love to see them add some
of<00:03:46.560> this<00:03:46.739> capsule<00:03:47.340> slides<00:03:47.670> with<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.000> floor

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
of this capsule slides with a floor

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.870 
of this capsule slides with a floor
drops<00:03:48.630> beneath<00:03:48.900> you<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.440> in<00:03:49.890> 2020<00:03:50.519> that<00:03:50.670> will

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
drops beneath you and in 2020 that will

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.520 
drops beneath you and in 2020 that will
have<00:03:51.000> meant<00:03:51.239> that<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.510> last<00:03:51.720> expansion<00:03:52.320> had

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
have meant that the last expansion had

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.860 
have meant that the last expansion had
happened<00:03:52.920> seven<00:03:53.400> years<00:03:53.430> ago<00:03:53.790> so<00:03:54.450> I<00:03:54.480> think<00:03:54.570> by

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
happened seven years ago so I think by

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.960 
happened seven years ago so I think by
the<00:03:54.930> year<00:03:55.200> 2020<00:03:55.890> a<00:03:55.920> boardwalk<00:03:56.280> expansion

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
the year 2020 a boardwalk expansion

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.729 
the year 2020 a boardwalk expansion
would<00:03:57.120> be<00:03:57.180> welcomed<00:03:57.780> so<00:03:58.260> that's<00:03:58.440> what<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.680> think

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
would be welcomed so that's what I think

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.310 
would be welcomed so that's what I think
Hershey<00:03:59.310> parks<00:03:59.700> next<00:04:00.000> five<00:04:00.360> years<00:04:00.720> might<00:04:01.019> look

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
Hershey parks next five years might look

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.470 
Hershey parks next five years might look
like<00:04:01.380> Hershey<00:04:02.280> Park<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:02.640> already<00:04:02.820> a<00:04:03.180> great

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
like Hershey Park is already a great

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.750 
like Hershey Park is already a great
part<00:04:03.750> but<00:04:03.930> these<00:04:04.170> five<00:04:04.500> things<00:04:04.920> being<00:04:05.280> added<00:04:05.640> I

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
part but these five things being added I

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.910 
part but these five things being added I
think<00:04:05.790> would<00:04:06.269> help<00:04:06.510> balance<00:04:07.260> out<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.500> park

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
think would help balance out the park

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.820 
think would help balance out the park
and<00:04:08.160> draw<00:04:08.550> more<00:04:09.000> guests<00:04:09.510> in<00:04:09.720> especially<00:04:10.650> that
