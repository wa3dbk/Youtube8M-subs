will still be at play and possibly they

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.600 
will include even new features like NFC
they<00:01:57.960> might<00:01:58.140> build<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.560> camera<00:01:59.040> into<00:01:59.579> the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
they might build the camera into the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.539 
they might build the camera into the
screen<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.540> make<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:01.170> screen<00:02:01.469> bigger<00:02:01.740> the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
screen to make the screen bigger the

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.219 
screen to make the screen bigger the
camera<00:02:02.820> itself<00:02:02.880> will<00:02:03.240> remain<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.899> same<00:02:04.170> but

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
camera itself will remain the same but

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.840 
camera itself will remain the same but
over<00:02:04.649> all<00:02:04.710> those<00:02:04.920> are<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.130> features<00:02:05.490> we<00:02:05.670> can

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
over all those are the features we can

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.389 
over all those are the features we can
expect<00:02:06.329> now<00:02:07.290> design<00:02:07.680> wise<00:02:07.920> as<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.129> can<00:02:08.280> see

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
expect now design wise as you can see

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.770 
expect now design wise as you can see
from<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:08.700> photo<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.270> bigger<00:02:09.479> than<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
from this photo it is bigger than the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.170 
from this photo it is bigger than the
other<00:02:09.810> devices<00:02:10.700> that<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.849> what<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.060> will<00:02:12.120> look

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
other devices that is what it will look

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.240 
other devices that is what it will look
like<00:02:12.300> in<00:02:12.569> hand

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
like in hand

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.220 
like in hand
this<00:02:13.490> is<00:02:13.730> will<00:02:13.940> have<00:02:14.210> the<00:02:14.330> same<00:02:14.600> fingerprint

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
this is will have the same fingerprint

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.140 
this is will have the same fingerprint
reader<00:02:15.470> etc<00:02:15.800> I've<00:02:16.250> heard<00:02:16.490> rumors<00:02:16.880> that<00:02:16.910> the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
reader etc I've heard rumors that the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.420 
reader etc I've heard rumors that the
camera<00:02:17.570> might<00:02:17.750> actually<00:02:17.900> be<00:02:18.170> built<00:02:18.440> in<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:19.280> the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
camera might actually be built in to the

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.060 
camera might actually be built in to the
screen<00:02:19.730> which<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:20.030> can't<00:02:20.300> actually<00:02:20.540> see<00:02:21.070> from

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
screen which you can't actually see from

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.440 
screen which you can't actually see from
this<00:02:22.220> photo<00:02:22.460> you<00:02:22.670> can<00:02:22.820> see<00:02:22.970> that<00:02:23.000> it<00:02:23.210> looks<00:02:23.240> a

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
this photo you can see that it looks a

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.210 
this photo you can see that it looks a
lot<00:02:23.630> like<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.140> ipod<00:02:24.500> touch<00:02:24.530> 5th<00:02:25.010> generation

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
lot like the ipod touch 5th generation

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.190 
lot like the ipod touch 5th generation
again<00:02:25.730> this<00:02:25.850> is<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.030> preview<00:02:26.300> in<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.600> mock-up<00:02:26.870> so

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
again this is a preview in a mock-up so

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.780 
again this is a preview in a mock-up so
we're<00:02:27.350> not<00:02:27.470> really<00:02:27.680> sure<00:02:27.770> if<00:02:28.190> this<00:02:28.730> is

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
we're not really sure if this is

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.100 
we're not really sure if this is
actually<00:02:29.060> how<00:02:29.300> it's<00:02:29.450> going<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:29.720> be<00:02:29.840> it's<00:02:29.990> all

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
actually how it's going to be it's all

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.290 
actually how it's going to be it's all
speculation<00:02:30.380> but<00:02:31.130> if<00:02:31.340> this<00:02:31.760> is<00:02:31.910> true<00:02:32.150> it's

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
speculation but if this is true it's

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.410 
speculation but if this is true it's
going<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.480> be<00:02:32.570> a<00:02:32.600> great<00:02:32.780> device<00:02:33.440> also<00:02:34.300> here<00:02:35.300> you

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
going to be a great device also here you

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.330 
going to be a great device also here you
can<00:02:35.570> see<00:02:35.840> just<00:02:35.870> what<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:36.680> generally<00:02:37.130> looks

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
can see just what it generally looks

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.780 
can see just what it generally looks
like<00:02:37.520> camera<00:02:37.940> wise<00:02:38.150> up<00:02:38.510> there<00:02:39.490> this<00:02:40.490> is<00:02:40.640> the

like camera wise up there this is the

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.640 
like camera wise up there this is the

on<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.200> left<00:02:45.380> you<00:02:45.470> can<00:02:45.590> see<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.860> big

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
on the left you can see the big

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.449 
on the left you can see the big
difference<00:02:46.489> in<00:02:46.670> screen<00:02:47.239> size<00:02:48.100> here<00:02:49.100> you<00:02:49.310> can

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
difference in screen size here you can

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.310 
difference in screen size here you can
also<00:02:49.580> see<00:02:49.970> a<00:02:50.239> more<00:02:50.480> in-depth<00:02:50.900> look<00:02:50.989> at<00:02:51.200> the

screen size and the phone device itself
here<00:02:54.260> is<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.440> picture<00:02:54.920> of<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.250> thinness<00:02:55.580> as<00:02:56.330> you

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
here is a picture of the thinness as you

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.020 
here is a picture of the thinness as you
can<00:02:56.660> see<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:56.989> iphone<00:02:57.350> 6<00:02:57.709> is<00:02:57.830> on<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.070> bottom<00:02:58.489> so

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
can see the iphone 6 is on the bottom so

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.220 
can see the iphone 6 is on the bottom so
it's<00:02:59.150> going<00:02:59.270> to<00:02:59.330> be<00:02:59.420> a<00:02:59.450> lot<00:02:59.600> thinner<00:02:59.870> than<00:03:00.110> all

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
it's going to be a lot thinner than all

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.840 
it's going to be a lot thinner than all
the<00:03:00.320> other<00:03:00.410> devices<00:03:00.770> the<00:03:01.160> iPhone<00:03:01.430> 5s<00:03:01.700> is

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
the other devices the iPhone 5s is

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.460 
the other devices the iPhone 5s is
directly<00:03:02.270> on<00:03:02.390> top<00:03:02.540> of<00:03:02.720> it<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:02.959> I<00:03:02.989> can't<00:03:03.260> even

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
directly on top of it and I can't even

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.410 
directly on top of it and I can't even
imagine<00:03:03.530> how<00:03:03.950> they<00:03:04.070> did<00:03:04.340> it<00:03:04.370> thinner<00:03:05.060> than<00:03:05.300> the

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
imagine how they did it thinner than the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.750 
imagine how they did it thinner than the
5s<00:03:05.840> but<00:03:06.110> apparently<00:03:06.980> they<00:03:07.160> can<00:03:07.400> this<00:03:07.550> is<00:03:07.610> a

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
5s but apparently they can this is a

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.400 
5s but apparently they can this is a
great<00:03:08.030> markup<00:03:08.450> so<00:03:08.600> if<00:03:08.720> someone<00:03:08.870> can<00:03:09.080> just<00:03:09.260> make

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
great markup so if someone can just make

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.860
