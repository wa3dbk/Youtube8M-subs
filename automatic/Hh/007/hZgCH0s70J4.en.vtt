galaxy happens to be a cosmic clone

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.320 
galaxy happens to be a cosmic clone
chase<00:00:09.679> you<00:00:10.679> have<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:10.980> redo<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.670> last<00:00:11.880> part<00:00:12.269> of

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
chase you have to redo the last part of

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.810 
chase you have to redo the last part of
the<00:00:12.450> galaxy<00:00:12.740> while<00:00:13.740> being<00:00:14.009> chased<00:00:14.099> by<00:00:14.610> the

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
the galaxy while being chased by the

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.849 
the galaxy while being chased by the
cosmic<00:00:15.179> clone<00:00:17.930> this<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.109> difficult<00:00:19.680> because

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
cosmic clone this is difficult because

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.300 
cosmic clone this is difficult because
as<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.730> might<00:00:21.029> remember<00:00:21.710> you<00:00:22.710> need<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:23.010> stand

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
as you might remember you need to stand

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.700 
as you might remember you need to stand
still<00:00:25.789> yes<00:00:26.789> standing<00:00:27.300> still<00:00:27.599> pushes<00:00:28.170> down<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
still yes standing still pushes down the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.740 
still yes standing still pushes down the
MOOC<00:00:29.160> platforms<00:00:30.769> so<00:00:32.210> you're<00:00:33.210> going<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.540> have

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
MOOC platforms so you're going to have

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.720 
MOOC platforms so you're going to have
to<00:00:33.960> stand<00:00:34.320> still<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:35.190> put<00:00:35.370> down<00:00:35.579> those

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
to stand still to put down those

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.709 
to stand still to put down those
platforms<00:00:36.380> and<00:00:37.380> at<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.649> same<00:00:37.890> time<00:00:38.210> not<00:00:39.210> stand

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
platforms and at the same time not stand

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.670 
platforms and at the same time not stand
still<00:00:40.969> because<00:00:41.969> if<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.450> stand<00:00:42.690> still<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
still because if you stand still the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.279 
still because if you stand still the
clones<00:00:43.980> will<00:00:44.250> attack<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:47.660> and<00:00:48.660> let's<00:00:49.050> see<00:00:49.260> if

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
clones will attack you and let's see if

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.990 
clones will attack you and let's see if
the<00:00:49.440> clones<00:00:49.739> look<00:00:50.010> any<00:00:50.250> different<00:00:50.640> if<00:00:50.910> you

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
the clones look any different if you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.189 
the clones look any different if you
play<00:00:51.239> as<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.600> eat<00:00:53.090> and<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.390> Luigi<00:00:54.750> clothes

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
play as we eat and we have Luigi clothes

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.650 
play as we eat and we have Luigi clothes
or<00:00:55.440> will<00:00:55.620> they<00:00:55.800> still<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.129> mario<00:00:56.610> clones

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.810 

looks<00:01:03.660> like<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:03.990> still<00:01:04.050> get<00:01:04.410> Mario<00:01:04.800> claws<00:01:05.129> pop

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
looks like we still get Mario claws pop

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:15.530 
looks like we still get Mario claws pop
I<00:01:10.490> will<00:01:11.490> really<00:01:12.150> good<00:01:14.060> anyway<00:01:15.060> as<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.510> was

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
I will really good anyway as I was

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.600 
I will really good anyway as I was
saying<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:16.229> blue<00:01:16.530> platform<00:01:16.800> here<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.370> can

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
saying this blue platform here you can

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:26.170 
saying this blue platform here you can
practice<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.420> bill<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.320> its<00:01:19.530> platform<00:01:24.979> yeah

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
practice and bill on its platform yeah

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.080 
practice and bill on its platform yeah
doesn't<00:01:27.180> work<00:01:27.300> very<00:01:27.390> well<00:01:28.430> but<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.610> saw<00:01:29.850> what

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
doesn't work very well but you saw what

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.240 
doesn't work very well but you saw what
happened<00:01:30.360> right<00:01:30.780> when<00:01:31.080> you<00:01:31.619> stand<00:01:31.950> still<00:01:32.190> on

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
happened right when you stand still on

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.690 
happened right when you stand still on
the<00:01:32.430> platform<00:01:33.050> platform<00:01:34.050> goes<00:01:34.560> down<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.550> our

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
the platform platform goes down and our

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.460 
the platform platform goes down and our
friend<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.149> golden<00:01:36.450> chomp<00:01:36.750> will<00:01:36.960> be<00:01:37.080> able<00:01:37.200> to

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
friend the golden chomp will be able to

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:49.790 
friend the golden chomp will be able to
make<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.770> across<00:01:47.030> this<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.750> very<00:01:49.110> good<00:01:49.320> timing

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
make it across this is very good timing

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.840 
make it across this is very good timing
all<00:01:49.950> going<00:01:50.280> through<00:01:50.520> there<00:01:52.160> don't<00:01:53.160> do<00:01:53.640> what<00:01:53.820> I

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
all going through there don't do what I

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.880 
all going through there don't do what I
did<00:01:53.970> there<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.660> you<00:01:54.930> know<00:01:55.050> get<00:01:55.320> hit<00:01:55.619> by<00:01:55.830> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
did there and you know get hit by the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:06.860 
did there and you know get hit by the
song

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.620 

let<00:02:07.770> me<00:02:08.040> see<00:02:08.340> in<00:02:08.550> here<00:02:10.820> stop<00:02:11.820> on<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.180> switch<00:02:12.450> at

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
let me see in here stop on the switch at

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:20.750 
let me see in here stop on the switch at
the<00:02:12.660> right<00:02:12.930> time<00:02:15.950> kombucha<00:02:16.950> top<00:02:17.430> up<00:02:17.760> top<00:02:19.760> is

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
the right time kombucha top up top is

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.760 
the right time kombucha top up top is
going<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.060> fall<00:02:21.300> into<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.780> bowl<00:02:21.990> thus

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
going to fall into the bowl thus

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.560 
going to fall into the bowl thus
creating<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.400> start<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:23.970> throwing<00:02:24.300> all<00:02:24.450> the

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
creating the start is throwing all the

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:32.720 
creating the start is throwing all the
cosmic<00:02:24.960> lumps<00:02:25.370> okay<00:02:29.990> not<00:02:30.990> too<00:02:31.560> difficult<00:02:31.800> as

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
cosmic lumps okay not too difficult as

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.940 
cosmic lumps okay not too difficult as
you<00:02:32.940> can<00:02:33.060> see<00:02:33.240> it's<00:02:33.390> not<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.780> easiest<00:02:33.950> galaxy

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
you can see it's not the easiest galaxy

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.220 
you can see it's not the easiest galaxy
just<00:02:35.250> because<00:02:35.640> well<00:02:36.120> Luigi<00:02:36.630> tends<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.020> fall

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
just because well Luigi tends to fall

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.980 
just because well Luigi tends to fall
off<00:02:37.440> into<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.920> lava<00:02:38.210> but<00:02:39.210> you<00:02:39.360> managed<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.870> get

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
off into the lava but you managed to get

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.950 
off into the lava but you managed to get
the<00:02:40.170> star<00:02:40.470> anyway
