so the graphics aren't that fantastic
you<00:01:53.509> could<00:01:53.690> say<00:01:53.929> because<00:01:54.649> things<00:01:55.130> if<00:01:55.459> you<00:01:55.640> look

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789

you're doing the game stats for example

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.340 
you're doing the game stats for example
let's<00:03:36.110> say<00:03:36.380> you<00:03:36.820> like<00:03:37.820> now<00:03:38.630> the<00:03:38.690> problem<00:03:38.960> is<00:03:39.170> I

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
let's say you like now the problem is I

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.620 
let's say you like now the problem is I
prefer<00:03:39.800> that<00:03:39.950> using<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.400> d-pad<00:03:40.910> to<00:03:41.270> do<00:03:41.480> all

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
prefer that using the d-pad to do all

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.350 
prefer that using the d-pad to do all
this<00:03:41.960> the<00:03:42.500> reason<00:03:42.860> why<00:03:43.070> is<00:03:43.130> because<00:03:43.400> if<00:03:43.970> you

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
this the reason why is because if you

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.760 
this the reason why is because if you
use<00:03:44.570> the<00:03:44.690> stylus<00:03:44.900> let's<00:03:45.350> say<00:03:45.470> you<00:03:45.530> want<00:03:45.740> to

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
use the stylus let's say you want to

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.100 
use the stylus let's say you want to
attack<00:03:46.070> you'll<00:03:46.520> accidentally<00:03:47.000> capture<00:03:47.540> which

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
attack you'll accidentally capture which

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.440 
attack you'll accidentally capture which
is<00:03:48.320> kind<00:03:48.860> of<00:03:49.040> a<00:03:49.160> suckish<00:03:49.490> thing<00:03:49.730> because<00:03:49.970> using

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
is kind of a suckish thing because using

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.300 
is kind of a suckish thing because using
the<00:03:50.630> stylus<00:03:50.810> can't<00:03:51.170> get<00:03:51.320> annoying<00:03:51.500> and<00:03:52.040> if<00:03:52.250> you

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
the stylus can't get annoying and if you

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.980 
the stylus can't get annoying and if you
want<00:03:52.490> to<00:03:52.580> scroll<00:03:52.850> through<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.180> math<00:03:53.420> your
