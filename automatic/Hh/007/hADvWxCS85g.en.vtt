00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
because think EECOM says that this

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.930 
because think EECOM says that this
candle<00:03:09.390> should<00:03:09.810> get<00:03:10.110> 300<00:03:10.860> hours<00:03:11.550> of<00:03:11.580> battery

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
is it actually looks like a real candle

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.490 
is it actually looks like a real candle
maybe<00:05:02.150> it<00:05:02.270> looks<00:05:02.419> a<00:05:02.539> little<00:05:02.810> artificial

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
maybe it looks a little artificial

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.260 
maybe it looks a little artificial
because<00:05:04.250> that's<00:05:04.520> like<00:05:04.639> really<00:05:04.940> bright<00:05:05.060> in

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:09.349 
think it looks cool the average person

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:10.930 
think it looks cool the average person
wouldn't<00:05:09.620> know<00:05:09.740> that<00:05:09.830> it's<00:05:10.099> actually<00:05:10.430> an<00:05:10.550> LED

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729 
just a little side note but I would say

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:46.719
