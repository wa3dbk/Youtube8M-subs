00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:02.249 
which is very nice if you have low range

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:05.150 
which is very nice if you have low range
also<00:01:02.489> Xena<00:01:03.149> uses<00:01:03.719> all<00:01:03.870> stats<00:01:04.410> so<00:01:04.800> I<00:01:04.830> should

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
also Xena uses all stats so I should

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.969 
also Xena uses all stats so I should
spend<00:01:05.550> it<00:01:05.700> here<00:01:05.910> but<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:07.110> use<00:01:07.320> three<00:01:07.590> stat<00:01:07.800> so

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
spend it here but you use three stat so

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.399 
spend it here but you use three stat so
if<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.220> get<00:01:08.340> %<00:01:08.759> all<00:01:08.909> started<00:01:09.420> really<00:01:09.960> good<00:01:10.259> on

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
potential I think while having the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.889 
potential I think while having the
mobility<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.729> dodge<00:01:50.939> skills<00:01:51.299> makes

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
mobility of this to dodge skills makes

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:58.200 
mobility of this to dodge skills makes
it<00:01:52.020> my<00:01:52.200> number<00:01:52.590> 5<00:01:52.950> most<00:01:53.729> favorite<00:01:54.240> class

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210

so<00:01:58.870> at<00:01:59.080> the<00:01:59.200> number<00:01:59.470> four<00:01:59.740> spot<00:01:59.920> we<00:02:00.250> got

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
so at the number four spot we got

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.080 
so at the number four spot we got
phantom<00:02:00.970> why<00:02:01.630> phantom<00:02:02.229> phantom<00:02:02.740> is<00:02:03.250> really

also it's a very new class at a warrior
your<00:04:42.480> Claire<00:04:42.750> a<00:04:43.020> class<00:04:43.260> which<00:04:43.500> I<00:04:43.620> really<00:04:43.800> like

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
your Claire a class which I really like

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
so that's really said I put out a really

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.380 
so that's really said I put out a really
small<00:04:47.160> bit<00:04:47.400> of<00:04:47.430> funding<00:04:47.880> in<00:04:48.000> this<00:04:48.120> guy<00:04:48.390> but<00:04:49.230> um

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
small bit of funding in this guy but um

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.020 
small bit of funding in this guy but um
it's<00:04:51.390> a<00:04:51.600> nice<00:04:51.960> car<00:04:52.169> it<00:04:52.350> also<00:04:52.530> has<00:04:52.860> great<00:04:53.400> Boston

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
it's a nice car it also has great Boston

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.050 
it's a nice car it also has great Boston
capabilities<00:04:54.870> but<00:04:55.380> the<00:04:55.860> downside<00:04:56.400> is<00:04:56.940> the

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
capabilities but the downside is the

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.640 
capabilities but the downside is the
late<00:04:57.270> game<00:04:57.540> funding<00:04:58.020> is<00:04:58.140> a<00:04:58.169> bit<00:04:58.410> difficult

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
late game funding is a bit difficult

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.850 
late game funding is a bit difficult
because<00:04:59.370> %<00:05:00.000> max<00:05:00.540> HP<00:05:00.780> gear<00:05:01.200> is<00:05:01.380> not<00:05:01.680> that

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
because % max HP gear is not that

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.480 
because % max HP gear is not that
popular<00:05:02.100> and<00:05:02.550> you<00:05:03.210> need<00:05:03.419> and<00:05:04.010> it<00:05:05.010> does<00:05:05.280> not

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
popular and you need and it does not

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.159 
popular and you need and it does not
have<00:05:05.730> too<00:05:06.000> much<00:05:06.210> impact<00:05:06.690> on<00:05:06.870> your<00:05:06.990> range

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
have too much impact on your range

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.380 
have too much impact on your range
compared<00:05:07.680> to<00:05:07.770> like<00:05:07.890> %<00:05:08.370> strength<00:05:08.700> for<00:05:09.000> warrior

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
compared to like % strength for warrior

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.110 
compared to like % strength for warrior
for<00:05:09.900> some<00:05:10.080> reason<00:05:10.380> so<00:05:11.070> that's<00:05:11.550> my<00:05:11.760> number

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
for some reason so that's my number

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.620 
for some reason so that's my number
three

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.410 

so<00:05:15.620> at<00:05:15.860> the<00:05:16.040> number<00:05:16.280> two<00:05:16.430> spot<00:05:16.610> we<00:05:16.910> got<00:05:17.090> khana

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
so at the number two spot we got khana

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.640 
so at the number two spot we got khana
khana<00:05:18.170> is<00:05:18.560> basically<00:05:19.370> a<00:05:19.930> quite<00:05:20.930> underpowered

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
khana is basically a quite underpowered

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.280 
khana is basically a quite underpowered
class<00:05:22.100> actually<00:05:22.370> but<00:05:23.270> as<00:05:23.420> one<00:05:23.720> main<00:05:23.900> thing<00:05:24.140> it

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
class actually but as one main thing it

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.290 
class actually but as one main thing it
has<00:05:24.440> the<00:05:24.650> skill<00:05:24.950> called<00:05:25.400> kitchen<00:05:25.820> shakugan

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
has the skill called kitchen shakugan

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.070 
has the skill called kitchen shakugan
and<00:05:26.510> it<00:05:27.410> increases<00:05:28.160> the<00:05:28.340> spawn<00:05:28.850> rate<00:05:29.480> of<00:05:29.750> mobs

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
and it increases the spawn rate of mobs

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.200 
and it increases the spawn rate of mobs
in<00:05:30.200> your<00:05:30.350> map<00:05:30.560> by<00:05:30.740> an<00:05:30.860> amazing<00:05:31.070> amount<00:05:31.430> I<00:05:31.700> also

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
in your map by an amazing amount I also

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.330 
in your map by an amazing amount I also
think<00:05:32.510> it<00:05:32.750> has<00:05:33.080> amazing<00:05:33.500> support<00:05:34.100> which<00:05:34.310> is

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
think it has amazing support which is

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.120 
think it has amazing support which is
various<00:05:35.150> so<00:05:35.810> we<00:05:35.930> got<00:05:36.110> blossom<00:05:36.470> barriers<00:05:36.950> yeah

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
various so we got blossom barriers yeah

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.940 
various so we got blossom barriers yeah
let's<00:05:37.970> just<00:05:38.030> give<00:05:38.330> nice<00:05:39.020> bonus<00:05:39.470> stats<00:05:39.710> like

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
let's just give nice bonus stats like

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.390 
let's just give nice bonus stats like
sand<00:05:40.460> balls<00:05:40.760> attack<00:05:41.090> and<00:05:41.270> stuff<00:05:42.070> you<00:05:43.070> have

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
sand balls attack and stuff you have

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.750 
sand balls attack and stuff you have
only<00:05:43.670> one<00:05:43.910> limitation<00:05:44.420> you<00:05:44.900> got<00:05:45.190> 100<00:05:46.190> mana<00:05:46.400> you

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
only one limitation you got 100 mana you

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.390 
only one limitation you got 100 mana you
cannot<00:05:47.180> use<00:05:47.540> mana<00:05:47.870> potions<00:05:48.500> but<00:05:48.680> your<00:05:49.190> mother

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
will G regenerate so this one attack

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.440 
will G regenerate so this one attack
doesn't<00:05:51.500> consume<00:05:51.890> mana<00:05:52.160> all<00:05:52.580> the<00:05:52.730> skills<00:05:53.000> to

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
handle it good you shouldn't have too

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.800 
handle it good you shouldn't have too
much<00:06:00.860> of<00:06:01.100> a<00:06:01.400> problem<00:06:01.640> with<00:06:01.940> it<00:06:02.240> but<00:06:02.270> it<00:06:02.570> limits

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810
