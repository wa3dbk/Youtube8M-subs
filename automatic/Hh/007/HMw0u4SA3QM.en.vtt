looking<00:05:25.509> around<00:05:25.570> you're<00:05:25.990> probably<00:05:26.199> thinking

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
looking around you're probably thinking

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.580 
looking around you're probably thinking
wow<00:05:27.220> there<00:05:27.580> are<00:05:27.610> a<00:05:27.669> lot<00:05:27.820> of<00:05:27.849> seats<00:05:28.180> in<00:05:28.330> here
