00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
people who randomly are thrown together

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.400 
people who randomly are thrown together
and<00:00:43.620> boost<00:00:44.620> their<00:00:44.920> stats<00:00:45.280> up<00:00:46.140> based<00:00:47.140> on<00:00:47.379> a

now<00:00:50.020> if<00:00:50.610> prestigious<00:00:51.610> mode<00:00:51.850> is<00:00:52.030> what<00:00:52.210> I<00:00:52.239> think

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
now if prestigious mode is what I think

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.260 
now if prestigious mode is what I think
it<00:00:52.720> is<00:00:52.750> and<00:00:53.170> once<00:00:53.800> you<00:00:53.920> reach<00:00:54.129> past<00:00:54.489> that<00:00:54.760> level

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
it is and once you reach past that level

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.510 
it is and once you reach past that level
fifty<00:00:55.780> five<00:00:56.020> or<00:00:56.230> whatever<00:00:56.350> it<00:00:56.649> is<00:00:56.739> and<00:00:57.040> your

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
fifty five or whatever it is and your

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.569 
fifty five or whatever it is and your
stats<00:00:57.820> reset<00:00:58.620> then<00:00:59.620> what<00:00:59.800> that<00:00:59.829> does<00:01:00.010> is<00:01:00.370> give

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
stats reset then what that does is give

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.360 
stats reset then what that does is give
people<00:01:00.910> it<00:01:01.329> gives<00:01:01.540> us<00:01:01.660> time<00:01:01.989> it's<00:01:02.380> amazed<00:01:03.040> this

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
people it gives us time it's amazed this

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.040 
people it gives us time it's amazed this

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
is the most amazing thing in the game

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.780 
is the most amazing thing in the game
because<00:01:05.950> not<00:01:06.220> only<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:07.270> shows<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:08.050> fact<00:01:08.290> that
