00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
middle of the eye to the outside load it

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:47.520 
middle of the eye to the outside load it
up<00:02:38.440> I<00:02:44.640> follow<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.909> my<00:02:46.239> fake<00:02:46.930> crease<00:02:47.349> a<00:02:47.379> little

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.789 
up I follow the my fake crease a little
bit<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:49.180> all<00:02:49.629> that<00:02:49.840> does<00:02:50.079> is<00:02:50.109> adds<00:02:50.560> more

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
bit and all that does is adds more

with the same height on your eyes when
your<00:04:50.700> eyes<00:04:50.790> relaxed<00:04:51.540> so<00:04:52.170> I<00:04:52.200> always<00:04:52.290> have<00:04:52.500> to

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
your eyes relaxed so I always have to

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:01.559 
your eyes relaxed so I always have to
double<00:04:52.800> check<00:04:52.860> that<00:04:54.320> it<00:04:55.320> looks<00:04:55.650> pretty<00:04:55.980> good

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:01.569 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:06.269

and then I take my liner and color on

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:18.540 
and then I take my liner and color on
the<00:05:06.369> waterline

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.370

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.510 
and then since this is a nighttime monk
I'm<00:05:20.470> going<00:05:20.620> to<00:05:20.680> go<00:05:20.740> all<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:20.890> way<00:05:20.980> across<00:05:21.130> on
