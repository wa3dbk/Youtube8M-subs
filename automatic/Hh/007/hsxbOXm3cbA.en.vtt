 bye 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.990
 circus art has its roots first in man's lips 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.440
 and accompanies the ancient history of civilization in almost all phases of his 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.760
 development the circle is the form in which we know it today 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.750
 masses in the mid-nineteenth century 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.229
 with the acrobats small groups of acrobats and comedians 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:49.489
 that carried in their shows inside the wandering taverns 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.329
 to try to have food with the heart to face the difficulties of 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:54.190
 life 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.080
 and it is to this ancient tradition transformed over the years 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.760
 with the introduction of the mostly exotic trained animals that yes 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.280
 recalls the magnificent aquatic race who chose to return to the ancient 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.220
 setting aside the animals by choosing a street of pure spectacle often 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.070
 first you get there 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.650
 a circus 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.190
 as a synonym of circus with animals a liter of animals in general if this 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.950
 I think it's one 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.650
 a wrong injury 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.370
 in the sense that the circus must be must always have been must continue to 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.490
 to be synonymous with entertainment 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.749
 with animals without animals we always talk about entertainment 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.490
 our choice of having to have the animals to bring a show without 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.700
 animals has been dictated by a clear choice of wanting to have one 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.730
 markedly acrobatic komiko gymnastic show 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:49.780
 is 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.780
 to be able to offer something different 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.560
 that of the circus without animals a battle that has long fought also 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.429
 it was your thesis against the shows 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.559
 that would force the animals into efforts and work against their nature 

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:07.979
 for us this animalist association 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.869
 and a great victory 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.099
 finally seeing the show like this our city is definitely one 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.819
 joy year 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.790
 the great battle of the lamp years one of the great battles of the ship from 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.549
 years is precisely that of being able to free animals in circuses 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.290
 so we were really happy with the choice of this circus of 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:30.749
 focus on human dignity 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:33.980
 acrobats jugglers clowns much more 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.020
 a show that finds its foundation in water made integral 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.310
 of life the element of water is certainly the fundamental element 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.740
 of the show our one of our protagonists the terrestrial clown 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.650
 for those who love among a sailor 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.329

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.329
 his own 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:01.229
 and that accompany him to know and above all respect the creatures
