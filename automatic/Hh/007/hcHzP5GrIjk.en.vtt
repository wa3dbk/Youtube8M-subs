00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
things if you can control the guys your

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.910 
things if you can control the guys your

out<00:00:47.820> each<00:00:48.030> other<00:00:48.149> right<00:00:48.300> away<00:00:48.500> you<00:00:49.500> notice

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
out each other right away you notice

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.500

second on that course referees are gonna
trap<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.110> magic<00:02:11.840> is<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.170> ultimate<00:02:13.410> goal

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
your point differential the only I got

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.850 
your point differential the only I got
you<00:05:06.080> only<00:05:06.230> got<00:05:06.440> two<00:05:07.090> 14<00:05:08.090> -<00:05:08.360> no<00:05:09.260> it's<00:05:09.440> I<00:05:09.620> think

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
you only got two 14 - no it's I think

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.760 
you only got two 14 - no it's I think
it's<00:05:13.300> it<00:05:14.300> seems<00:05:14.510> we<00:05:14.720> have<00:05:14.810> a<00:05:14.870> confusion<00:05:15.230> how

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
it's it seems we have a confusion how

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.010 
it's it seems we have a confusion how
many<00:05:15.950> points<00:05:16.610> they<00:05:16.700> did<00:05:16.820> award<00:05:17.120> him<00:05:17.240> I<00:05:17.570> think

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
many points they did award him I think

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.200 
many points they did award him I think
he<00:05:18.260> got<00:05:18.380> 2<00:05:18.650> and<00:05:18.680> 2<00:05:19.040> is<00:05:19.070> score<00:05:19.520> was<00:05:19.730> 12<00:05:20.000> the<00:05:20.090> two

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
he got 2 and 2 is score was 12 the two

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.270 
he got 2 and 2 is score was 12 the two
was<00:05:20.360> not<00:05:20.630> that's<00:05:20.960> right<00:05:21.140> so<00:05:21.410> it<00:05:21.470> should<00:05:21.680> be<00:05:21.800> 16

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
was not that's right so it should be 16

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.870 
was not that's right so it should be 16
-<00:05:22.400> 2<00:05:22.610> now<00:05:22.910> if<00:05:23.660> he<00:05:23.780> scores<00:05:24.110> one<00:05:24.350> more<00:05:24.530> point<00:05:24.880> the

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
- 2 now if he scores one more point the

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.060 
- 2 now if he scores one more point the
differential<00:05:26.480> between<00:05:26.510> the<00:05:26.810> scores<00:05:27.200> will<00:05:27.920> be

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
differential between the scores will be

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.650 
differential between the scores will be
more<00:05:28.370> than<00:05:28.520> 15<00:05:29.000> that's<00:05:29.150> considered<00:05:29.570> a

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
more than 15 that's considered a

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
more than 15 that's considered a

technical foul which is like a pin you
get<00:05:33.770> the<00:05:33.920> same<00:05:34.100> amount<00:05:34.280> of<00:05:34.460> points<00:05:34.640> for<00:05:34.880> your
