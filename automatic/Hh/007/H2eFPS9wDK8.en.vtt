00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.719
 I like it. 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:14.639
 From now on, I 'll show you how to get the garden dirt to work with a rotary killer. 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:17.910
 Breaking the pole with a killer makes it easier to put the plant, 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:22.260
 You can get a nice garden because it mixes. 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:27.090
 If you go to the 3rd floor and make the first flower bed or the original large garden 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.949
 If the minutes if it is a small but good beds that were originally written for a small killer 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.630
 It is recommended to use a curator 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:38.070
 For more information, please refer to the Printing Guide in Rostakham / Cricket 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.260
 So I'm in the middle of this ground to change . Make a new garden on the lawn. 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.290
 Min would be exposed from the grass. 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.820
 If your garden was original, pick out all the thick weeds . 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:52.440
 Cause it'll lay a little weed killer will also be just and digging 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.800
 Please call 8 1 to make sure there are no buried pipelines. 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.329
 Before we grind the ground, we will evaluate the soil first. 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.859
 Usually black is organic, but the land is already improving. 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.450
 There is also hard soil. 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.710
 If the humidity is too high or impoverished black how to make even more by putting beds 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.680
 There is 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:17.100
 Commonly seen wet black clay babies, I do not know what they are. 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:20.640
 Then blackness breaks well and moisture and nutrients mix well 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.540
 I can test various soil conditions with these test kits. 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.049
 You can buy it from Ross. Put a little bit of soil on the 2b and inspect it with the main bed. 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.460

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:33.479
 Each regional office will only charge you a regular fee and will inspect your soil. 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.369
 You can use this kit to check pH balance. Plants like blueberries 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.390
 Grow well in acidic soil 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.549
 The same cabbage like alkaline soils and better yet in a neutral soil 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.869
 There is also growing. 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:50.369
 Please refer to the appropriate pH of the plants in the printing instructions 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.630
 If the pH value is low, it is acid soil. 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.700
 He sprinkled and balanced. 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:00.600
 If the pH value is high, it is alkaline . So it is made of chrysotile or leaves or sawdust. 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.600
 Give me compost. 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:08.869
 When you slaughter the mountain soil eggs in the shop, you can do as you would on the label. 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:13.580
 When you give me the tv, just cover it. 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:17.780
 Compost made from a mixture of organic matter can be given to any land. 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.500
 When sprayed the metering Now I'd have to mix well with the soil where this is necessary 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.010
 That's it. 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.150
 Rotation that mixes the soil to the deepest ground where the organic matter is the most necessary 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.680
 I have a killer. 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:31.910
 If only it really easy jijyo gardening Los varying degrees by official 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:36.500
 There's a killer and a volunteer curator, so pick one thing you need. 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:39.019
 Do not forget to read the manufacturer's instructions and learn how to operate them. 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.110
 Be sure to wear your closed shoes 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:46.549
 Wear long pants and long sleeve tops 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:50.480
 Do not take off your gloves and safety goggles . 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.709
 Oh lay a good time 'cause when I rainy day or after a few black 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.750
 It's dry. 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.739
 I'll set the depth first. If it's a hardened ground, it's thin at first. 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.420
 Please set up 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:04.519
 Rather, the ground water is beginning to set prices in the middle of a killer yo bed manufacturer 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:09.500
 I'll take an action. 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:14.269
 For while the drive went to have a quiet garden with a parallel start slowly 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.590
 The killer will be taken care of gateumyeon the whole garden again now up to the tiller 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.130
 Set to depth 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.849
 I change it vertically with the old furrow 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:27.950
 As you walk slowly, let the machine take care of you. 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:32.239
 Until well mixed organic matter to the soil will continue to change for at least 8 inches deep 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:36.980
 Now, leave the soil for a few days. It would be better if you wait a few weeks . 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:41.480
 As organic matter starts to decompose, nutrients come out and make the soil fertile. 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:44.959
 After the waiting time is over , the air will go through and the ground will be 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.480
 Once you change it, it will be easy to plant. 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:52.560
 Set the critical depth and depth 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.670
 Change the garden back and forth, maybe it's all easier to move 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.900
 It is. 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:02.220
 Now, set it deeper and change the ground vertically. 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:07.560
