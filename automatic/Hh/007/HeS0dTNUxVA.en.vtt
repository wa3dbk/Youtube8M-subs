00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.590 
aka coltd Klem and today I'm gonna show
you<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.289> difference<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.890> quality<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.609> AC

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
you the difference in the quality of AC

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.060 
you the difference in the quality of AC
bias<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.470> DC<00:00:20.369> bias<00:00:21.619> now<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.650> lot<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:22.890> you

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
bias and DC bias now a lot of you

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.590 
bias and DC bias now a lot of you
watching<00:00:23.279> this<00:00:23.550> are<00:00:23.760> probably<00:00:23.789> thinking

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
watching this are probably thinking

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.400 
watching this are probably thinking
not<00:00:25.260> another<00:00:25.590> bias<00:00:25.949> video<00:00:26.869> but<00:00:27.869> nor<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.230> ones

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
not another bias video but nor the ones

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.580 
not another bias video but nor the ones
I've<00:00:28.619> seen<00:00:28.650> it's<00:00:29.070> never<00:00:29.279> been<00:00:29.429> too<00:00:29.699> clear<00:00:30.590> so

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
I've seen it's never been too clear so

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.690 
I've seen it's never been too clear so
I'm<00:00:31.769> going<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.009> give<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.309> clear

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
I'm going to give you a clear

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.500 
I'm going to give you a clear
demonstration<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:34.040> how<00:00:35.040> much<00:00:35.250> AC<00:00:35.550> bias<00:00:36.059> sounds

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
demonstration of how much AC bias sounds

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.910 
demonstration of how much AC bias sounds
better<00:00:36.660> than<00:00:37.020> DC<00:00:37.530> bias<00:00:40.520> well<00:00:41.520> I'll<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:42.030> get

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
better than DC bias well I'll just get

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.650 
better than DC bias well I'll just get
I've<00:00:43.920> taken<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.250> corner<00:00:44.579> here<00:00:45.110> now<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:47.600> is<00:00:48.600> a

quality<00:01:35.600> now<00:01:36.600> we'll<00:01:36.780> just<00:01:36.990> run<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.409> back

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:49.490 

okay<00:01:46.009> this<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.159> DC<00:01:47.549> bias<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:48.960> I'm<00:01:49.049> doing<00:01:49.320> this

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
okay this is DC bias and I'm doing this

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.670 
okay this is DC bias and I'm doing this
to<00:01:50.040> demonstrate<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.820> sound<00:01:51.030> quality<00:01:51.680> okay

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
to demonstrate the sound quality okay

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.760 
to demonstrate the sound quality okay
now<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:52.979> sounds<00:01:53.310> pretty<00:01:53.430> clear<00:01:54.380> but<00:01:55.380> I'm<00:01:55.590> now

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
now that sounds pretty clear but I'm now

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.770 
now that sounds pretty clear but I'm now
gonna<00:01:55.950> record<00:01:56.310> myself<00:01:56.579> on<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> tape<00:01:57.360> recorder

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
gonna record myself on a tape recorder

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.069 
gonna record myself on a tape recorder
that<00:01:57.930> has<00:01:58.110> AC<00:01:58.380> bias<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.750> you'll<00:02:00.750> hear<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
that has AC bias and you'll hear the

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.600 
that has AC bias and you'll hear the
difference<00:02:01.229> in<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.680> sound<00:02:01.979> when<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.219> play<00:02:02.460> it

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
difference in the sound when I play it

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.539 
difference in the sound when I play it
back<00:02:03.110> now<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.619> tape<00:02:04.829> recorder<00:02:05.369> that

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
back now this is the tape recorder that

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.479 
back now this is the tape recorder that
I<00:02:06.180> will<00:02:06.479> be<00:02:06.630> recording<00:02:07.079> on<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.129> one<00:02:08.340> I've

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
I will be recording on this is one I've

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.070 
I will be recording on this is one I've
modified<00:02:08.849> but<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.390> haven't<00:02:09.569> made<00:02:09.810> any

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
modified but I haven't made any

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.210 
modified but I haven't made any
modifications<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.640> recordings

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
modifications to the recordings

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.470 
modifications to the recordings
it's<00:02:12.840> all<00:02:13.840> I've<00:02:14.080> done<00:02:14.260> is<00:02:15.060> I've<00:02:16.060> tapped<00:02:16.300> the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
it's all I've done is I've tapped the

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.770 
it's all I've done is I've tapped the
main<00:02:16.660> supply<00:02:17.080> so<00:02:17.410> I've<00:02:17.560> got<00:02:18.510> power<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.750> my

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
main supply so I've got power to my

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.920 
main supply so I've got power to my
shaver<00:02:23.700> running<00:02:24.700> off<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:24.970> 8<00:02:25.150> volt<00:02:25.420> positive

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
shaver running off the 8 volt positive

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:33.020 
shaver running off the 8 volt positive
rail<00:02:26.170> as<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:27.310> can<00:02:27.460> see<00:02:27.760> here<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:30.310> goes<00:02:30.520> to<00:02:30.730> this

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.260 

lead<00:02:34.030> here<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:36.190> on<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.400> other<00:02:36.520> end<00:02:36.640> of<00:02:36.910> that<00:02:37.120> I

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
lead here and on the other end of that I

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.200 
lead here and on the other end of that I
have<00:02:40.270> this<00:02:41.110> microphone<00:02:41.680> which<00:02:42.550> I<00:02:42.760> have<00:02:42.880> also

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
have this microphone which I have also

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.360 
have this microphone which I have also
modified<00:02:43.690> by<00:02:43.930> putting<00:02:44.380> our<00:02:44.500> two<00:02:44.710> transistor

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
modified by putting our two transistor

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.410 
modified by putting our two transistor
preamp<00:02:45.760> in<00:02:45.940> it<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.460> is<00:02:48.610> connected<00:02:49.210> to

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
preamp in it and that is connected to

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.290 
preamp in it and that is connected to
the<00:02:50.170> tape<00:02:50.350> recorder<00:02:50.820> which<00:02:51.820> I'm<00:02:52.000> going<00:02:52.210> to

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
the tape recorder which I'm going to

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.470 
the tape recorder which I'm going to
record<00:02:52.540> on<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:54.400> all<00:02:54.580> this<00:02:54.730> stuff<00:02:54.910> is<00:02:55.240> here

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
record on and all this stuff is here

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.470 
record on and all this stuff is here
it's<00:02:56.140> in<00:02:56.590> this<00:02:56.830> box<00:02:57.100> and<00:02:57.370> this<00:02:57.880> switch<00:02:58.150> they're

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
it's in this box and this switch they're

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.560 
it's in this box and this switch they're
just<00:02:58.660> speed<00:02:58.930> controls<00:02:59.350> which<00:02:59.560> I've<00:02:59.710> had<00:02:59.860> it

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
just speed controls which I've had it

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.300 
just speed controls which I've had it
I've<00:03:01.570> had<00:03:01.720> to<00:03:01.840> change<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.350> motor<00:03:02.560> so<00:03:03.040> I<00:03:03.070> can

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
I've had to change the motor so I can

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.220 
I've had to change the motor so I can
use<00:03:03.460> the<00:03:03.640> speed<00:03:03.880> control<00:03:04.270> I<00:03:04.540> don't<00:03:05.050> know<00:03:05.170> if

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
use the speed control I don't know if

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.460 
use the speed control I don't know if
you<00:03:05.320> can<00:03:05.470> see<00:03:05.680> it<00:03:05.770> in<00:03:05.920> there<00:03:06.100> very<00:03:06.220> clearly

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
you can see it in there very clearly

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.160 
you can see it in there very clearly
that's<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.650> motor<00:03:08.860> from<00:03:09.160> that<00:03:09.900> dual<00:03:10.900> deck

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
that's the motor from that dual deck

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.160 
that's the motor from that dual deck

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.780 
tape recorder with high-speed dubbing it
just<00:03:17.410> needed<00:03:17.739> so<00:03:17.920> I<00:03:17.950> can<00:03:18.220> use<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.580> speed

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
just needed so I can use the speed

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:27.780 
just needed so I can use the speed
control<00:03:19.770> so<00:03:25.890> now<00:03:26.890> I'm<00:03:26.980> going<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.250> record<00:03:27.430> onto

and I'm gonna put the camera right up

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.820 
and I'm gonna put the camera right up
close<00:04:11.019> to<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.290> speaker

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.890 

I<00:04:14.120> don't<00:04:15.120> know<00:04:15.210> if<00:04:15.300> you'll<00:04:15.420> be<00:04:15.510> able<00:04:15.600> to<00:04:15.720> hear

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
I don't know if you'll be able to hear

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.449 
I don't know if you'll be able to hear
it<00:04:16.019> very<00:04:16.140> clearly<00:04:16.440> with<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:16.799> computer<00:04:17.280> noise

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
it very clearly with the computer noise

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.120 
it very clearly with the computer noise
in<00:04:17.640> the<00:04:17.730> background<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:19.500> cameras<00:04:19.830> right<00:04:19.980> up

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
in the background the cameras right up

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.030 
in the background the cameras right up
close<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.549> speaker<00:04:21.470> so<00:04:22.470> I<00:04:22.530> can<00:04:22.710> give<00:04:22.860> you<00:04:22.950> a

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
close to the speaker so I can give you a

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.160 
close to the speaker so I can give you a
demonstration<00:04:23.580> of<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.270> difference<00:04:24.420> in<00:04:25.050> the

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
demonstration of the difference in the

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.020 
demonstration of the difference in the
sound<00:04:25.500> quality<00:04:26.660> first<00:04:27.660> we<00:04:27.810> have<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.320> 8<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.640> DC

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
sound quality first we have the 8 the DC

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.690 
sound quality first we have the 8 the DC
bias<00:04:30.270> recording<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.290> then<00:04:31.890> the<00:04:32.100> AC<00:04:32.310> bias

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
bias recording and then the AC bias

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:40.330 
bias recording and then the AC bias
recording<00:04:38.330> should<00:04:39.330> come<00:04:39.450> on<00:04:39.480> any<00:04:39.780> minute<00:04:40.080> now

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
recording should come on any minute now

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.340 
recording should come on any minute now
okay<00:04:41.340> this<00:04:41.580> is<00:04:41.640> Clement<00:04:42.180> sega's<00:04:42.540> recording<00:04:43.230> on

okay this is Clement sega's recording on

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.900 
okay this is Clement sega's recording on
the<00:04:43.440> Sony<00:04:43.710> TCM<00:04:44.370> 150<00:04:45.090> this<00:04:45.810> is<00:04:45.990> DC<00:04:46.380> bias<00:04:46.700> and<00:04:47.700> I'm

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
the Sony TCM 150 this is DC bias and I'm

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.880 
the Sony TCM 150 this is DC bias and I'm
doing<00:04:48.120> this<00:04:48.360> to<00:04:48.900> demonstrate<00:04:48.930> the<00:04:49.710> sound

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
doing this to demonstrate the sound

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
doing this to demonstrate the sound
quality<00:04:50.460> it's<00:04:51.210> now<00:04:51.390> recording<00:04:52.700> this<00:04:53.700> is

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
quality it's now recording this is

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.240 
quality it's now recording this is

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
the much better sound quality and there

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.110 
the much better sound quality and there
you<00:05:04.050> go<00:05:04.200> there's<00:05:04.890> the<00:05:04.980> difference<00:05:05.400> between<00:05:05.580> DC

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
you go there's the difference between DC

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.680 
you go there's the difference between DC

don't<00:05:09.690> know<00:05:09.780> how<00:05:09.930> well<00:05:10.140> you<00:05:10.260> heard<00:05:10.470> it<00:05:10.970> so<00:05:11.970> I'm

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
don't know how well you heard it so I'm

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.730 
don't know how well you heard it so I'm
going<00:05:12.240> to<00:05:12.360> connect<00:05:12.630> my<00:05:12.750> tape<00:05:12.960> recorder<00:05:12.990> up<00:05:13.560> to

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
going to connect my tape recorder up to

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.230 
going to connect my tape recorder up to
the<00:05:13.830> computer<00:05:14.210> which<00:05:15.210> is<00:05:15.390> recording<00:05:15.840> this<00:05:17.240> so

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
the computer which is recording this so

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.090 
the computer which is recording this so
you<00:05:18.330> can<00:05:18.480> hear<00:05:18.690> for<00:05:18.840> yourself<00:05:18.960> exactly<00:05:19.830> how

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
you can hear for yourself exactly how

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.600 
you can hear for yourself exactly how
much<00:05:20.340> better<00:05:20.580> the<00:05:20.850> quality<00:05:20.880> of<00:05:21.540> AC<00:05:21.750> bias<00:05:22.110> is

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
much better the quality of AC bias is

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:31.070 
much better the quality of AC bias is
than<00:05:23.610> DC<00:05:24.030> bias<00:05:28.669> okay<00:05:29.669> this<00:05:30.180> is<00:05:30.360> Clement<00:05:30.720> sega's

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
than DC bias okay this is Clement sega's
