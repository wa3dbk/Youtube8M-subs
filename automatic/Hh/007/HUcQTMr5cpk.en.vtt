00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.950
 in an old timbered house on the market 12 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.320
 in bad hersfeld is short on sunday 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.570
 after 14 o'clock a fire broke out 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.629
 dense smoke billowed from the 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.060
 Build 70 to 80 firefighters and 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.780
 women were in action 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.490
 the firefighters were supported 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.160
 from the police and from 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.420
 emergency medical service access to the market 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.370
 was completely locked 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.560
 From Rotburg was the turntable 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.300
 requested 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.370
 the back of a yard to the 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.500
 Burning buildings drove up 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.760
 Respiratory protection fought the fire department that 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.760
 fire with water and foam 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.359
 it was an overlap on the 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.640
 to prevent neighborhood buildings 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:49.460
 also mayor thomas Fehling before 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.319
 Place he explained an injured person 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.140
 the conscious and forced that brought 

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:56.690
 were the fire department rausgeholt out 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.519
 the brand object otherwise are also 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.120
 probably no other people currently 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.440
 danger to the damage height one can do nevertheless 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.479
 nothing to say the fire department is 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.500
 watching the fire under control 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.759
 bring to 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.350
 We have several deletions in use 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.610
 as I said there, we still have 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.130
 Support from the fire department 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.920
 redburg the turning ladder back I will 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.939
 still with the use so currently 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.500
 Neat portion of firefighters 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.719
 try to get it under control 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.549
 to get 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:26.020
 the mission was in the middle of downtown 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.020
 a special challenge for everyone 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.890
 old houses half-timbered houses and stand 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.610
 it does not come like that at some point 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.380
 ran right 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.060
 So that's all very built up 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.020
 here in a state and that's why 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.420
 that, of course, a decent one 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.310
 challenge the firefighters 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.530
 but I'm confident that we 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.490
 that'll get a good grip soon 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.440
 Of course, for those for the residents 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.770
 this is the big excitement more central 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.840
 Point 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.250
 Bad hersfeld and you also see how the 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.210
 Firefighters forward backward 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.170
 rank 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.880
 so that's a small one 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.050
 logistical challenge here on 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.790
 market that the colleagues are good 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.120
 trained 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.120
 we can do this
