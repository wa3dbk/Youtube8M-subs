00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.100
 My name is Nick Konkl I am a leading designer 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.689
 gameplay elder scrolls online 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.760
 all games kick scrolls had pretty 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.529
 open development system and this game is not 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.630
 the exception will be a huge selection 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.670
 opportunities and you can invest in one of 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.470
 them or develop a little bit all at once and 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.090
 of course having spent enough time 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.859
 you can achieve mastery in everything 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.600
 dream to let's start with the basics 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.340
 during the game you will kill 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.080
 monsters perform errands or 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.640
 explore the world and it will bring 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.710
 you experience points that you can 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.449
 spend on character development points 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.820
 skills can be obtained not only by raising 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.739
 your level but also finding special 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.350
 fragments known as heavenly fragments 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.229
 or performing special assignments at 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.879
 passing the storyline getting a new 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.979
 level you also get one by one 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.140
 performance point and one skill point 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:00.720
 performance points increase three 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.440
 basic sources of power health magic and 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.600
 power reserve 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.460
 health is spent when you get 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.470
 damage in battle magic when I read these 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.110
 spells reserve power when you use 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.890
 sprint or weapon abilities 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.930
 characteristics define your 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.880
 character in many ways do I want 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.890
 be really tenacious do I want to 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.840
 to be a magician spellcaster or I wish 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.670
 become powerful forward to attack right in the forehead 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.200
 a fighter 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.789
 other side skill points allow 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.780
 develop character individually 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.270
 they can be spent on studying 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.770
 abilities or spells abilities 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.539
 and spells belong to different 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.759
 skill branches that bind them 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.649
 thematically the more often you use 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.170
 abilities from one branch like let's say 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.759
 stone fist and curls of earth magic 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.770
 more advanced abilities you 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.920
 get access like petrification or 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.880
 lava armor when you type 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.619
 enough experience to use 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.420
 ability will appear 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.460
 change it so that it fits better 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.740
 so you like the ability of the templar 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.689
 swift healing ceremony 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.219
 neighboring ally can be turned 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.780
 the attraction of three allies or 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.070
 restoring your magic for a while 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.050
 enable abilities 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.760
 moving far enough along the branch 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.560
 of skills you will get access to ultimate 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.229
 abilities one of the most effective 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.570
 in a game such as dragon jump 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.040
 dragon knight or overload 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.270
 sorcerer or another at the templar 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.160
 ultimate abilities work somewhat 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.470
 otherwise than the rest they do not consume 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.970
 magic or power reserve instead you 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.590
 gain strength to use this 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.060
 the ability then causes 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.470
 crushing blow to the enemy so we 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.060
 talked about spells that 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.770
 used in battle we call them 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.150
 active abilities but you also 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.640
 you can spend points on my 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.700
 passive abilities whose effect 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.140
 less noticed but they work constantly 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.150
 It can be such effects as 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.550
 increased damage to fuel spells 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.350
 or the chance that the target struck and your 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.580
 the lightning spell will instantly disappear 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.580
 leaving only a handful of ashes 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.250
 when creating a character you need to take 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.410
 two decisions that will affect the branches 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.990
 skills in further development choose 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.120
 a race that will set a set of abilities 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.710
 determining the identity of the hero and class 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.960
 which gives you three unique branches 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:10.040
 skills that won't make you 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:12.050
 play some special role your 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.700
 class and racial skills make up only 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.830
 a small part of everything available in the game 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.650
 there is a whole set of basic skills 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.420
 which will be available to any player 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.320
 good example of that is handling skills 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.090
 weapons and armor 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.250
 in which they start to play each and 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.650
 anyone can take the time and finish up 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.750
 wizards so whatever 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.700
 class or time and taking up the shield and sword 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.860
 You can improve the skill of owning it 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.450
 with this weapon or vice versa if i want 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.650
 wear light armor and use 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.600
 staves can become a good magician 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.250
 playing a game exploring the world your character 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.310
 will be able to open completely new branches 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.320
 skills can be obtained relatively 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.140
 easy just by joining the mages guild or 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.610
 guild of fighters or more difficult 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.510
 the way of becoming a werewolf or a vampire 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.680
 getting one of these skill branches 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.660
 will give you the opportunity to get 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.300
 special abilities that are not otherwise 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.920
 your character would be available to us 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.720
 made up a whole variety scheme 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.920
 bolt combinations and abilities that 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.750
 players can choose in that system 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.640
 character development is what you are 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.890
 expect from any game elder scrolls and 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.360
 it's all a player choice you can 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.100
 develop a character on your own 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.100
 and we can not wait to see him
