00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.160 
which it's gone there had to be
something<00:02:13.180> there<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.420> make<00:02:13.510> it<00:02:13.630> burn<00:02:13.780> hotter<00:02:14.050> I

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
something there to make it burn hotter I

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.080 
something there to make it burn hotter I
believe<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:14.680> get<00:02:14.800> burnt<00:02:14.980> hotter<00:02:15.190> so<00:02:16.030> if
