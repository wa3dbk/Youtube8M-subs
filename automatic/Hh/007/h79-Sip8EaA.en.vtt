them as long as they're low from
harassing<00:01:02.430> enough<00:01:03.829> so<00:01:04.829> they<00:01:05.729> just<00:01:05.759> stunned

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
harassing enough so they just stunned

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.090 
harassing enough so they just stunned
and<00:01:06.360> exhaust<00:01:06.780> me<00:01:06.960> there<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.649> had<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.860> flash

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
and exhaust me there and I had to flash

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.830 
and exhaust me there and I had to flash
out<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.610> or<00:01:08.790> else<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.060> definitely<00:01:09.600> would

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
out of it or else I definitely would

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.129 
out of it or else I definitely would
have<00:01:09.869> died<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:11.270> now<00:01:12.270> Sion<00:01:12.719> is<00:01:12.749> low<00:01:13.020> enough

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:13.139 
have died and now Sion is low enough

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:16.069 
have died and now Sion is low enough
that<00:01:13.340> he<00:01:14.340> got<00:01:14.579> pushed<00:01:14.880> out<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.270> lane<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.479> i

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
that he got pushed out of the lane so i

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.120 
that he got pushed out of the lane so i
can<00:01:16.289> push<00:01:16.469> up<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.740> bit<00:01:16.950> without<00:01:17.670> worrying<00:01:18.270> about

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
can push up a bit without worrying about

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.980 
can push up a bit without worrying about
both<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.159> them<00:01:20.429> killing<00:01:20.639> me<00:01:23.659> so<00:01:24.659> here<00:01:24.840> they

mu bandage toss is in on the jacks and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.919 
mu bandage toss is in on the jacks and
uses<00:01:31.649> his<00:01:31.799> ultimate<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.429> then<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.880> bullet<00:01:33.749> time

00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:39.959 
that and I go to chase him down when it

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:41.149 
that and I go to chase him down when it
probably<00:01:40.259> would<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:40.409> been<00:01:40.499> better<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.979> just

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
probably would have been better to just

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.349 
probably would have been better to just
go<00:01:41.340> for<00:01:41.490> scion<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:43.639> for<00:01:44.639> some<00:01:44.819> reason<00:01:44.849> he

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:45.359 
go for scion and for some reason he

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:48.230 
go for scion and for some reason he
thinks<00:01:46.159> he<00:01:47.159> can<00:01:47.219> kill<00:01:47.549> me<00:01:47.670> there<00:01:47.819> i<00:01:47.849> don't<00:01:48.149> know

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
but my range is just too far for him to

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.879 
but my range is just too far for him to
even<00:01:51.659> get<00:01:51.869> away<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:54.229> now<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.499> both<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.679> them

in<00:02:01.889> that<00:02:01.950> general<00:02:02.459> area<00:02:02.639> then<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.659> know<00:02:03.810> if

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:03.989 
in that general area then you know if

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:05.899 
in that general area then you know if
they're<00:02:04.200> doing<00:02:04.349> dragon<00:02:04.889> or<00:02:05.159> if<00:02:05.489> someone's

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
they're doing dragon or if someone's

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.510 
they're doing dragon or if someone's
coming<00:02:06.179> down<00:02:06.299> with<00:02:06.419> the<00:02:06.479> bottom<00:02:06.810> lane<00:02:06.959> to<00:02:07.520> kill

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
coming down with the bottom lane to kill

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.470 
coming down with the bottom lane to kill
is<00:02:08.670> ever<00:02:08.849> down<00:02:08.940> there

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.480 
is ever down there

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.820 
is ever down there
now<00:02:11.480> I'm<00:02:11.540> just<00:02:11.630> creeping<00:02:12.020> around<00:02:12.200> where<00:02:12.500> golem

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
now I'm just creeping around where golem

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.980 
now I'm just creeping around where golem
is<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:15.100> do<00:02:16.100> my<00:02:16.250> ultimate<00:02:16.780> somewhere<00:02:17.780> in<00:02:17.870> the

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
is and do my ultimate somewhere in the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.850 
is and do my ultimate somewhere in the
general<00:02:18.470> area<00:02:18.650> that<00:02:19.070> they<00:02:19.730> are<00:02:19.850> all<00:02:20.000> in<00:02:20.240> I

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
general area that they are all in I

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.810 
general area that they are all in I
probably<00:02:21.860> should<00:02:22.010> have<00:02:22.190> just<00:02:22.370> gone<00:02:22.520> in<00:02:22.730> a

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
probably should have just gone in a

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.930 
probably should have just gone in a
little<00:02:23.060> bit<00:02:23.150> closer<00:02:23.390> but<00:02:23.810> i<00:02:23.870> guess<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:25.550> Corgi

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
little bit closer but i guess the Corgi

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.270 
little bit closer but i guess the Corgi
stuck<00:02:26.180> around<00:02:26.330> too<00:02:26.660> long<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:27.230> I<00:02:27.950> ended<00:02:28.190> up

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
stuck around too long and I ended up

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
stuck around too long and I ended up
getting<00:02:28.460> him<00:02:28.960> so<00:02:29.960> was<00:02:30.700> all<00:02:31.700> in<00:02:31.940> all<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.210> was

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
getting him so was all in all it was

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.870 
getting him so was all in all it was
worth<00:02:32.450> it<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:35.180> then<00:02:35.570> my<00:02:35.660> team<00:02:35.870> can<00:02:36.020> push<00:02:36.200> up

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
worth it and then my team can push up

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.000 
worth it and then my team can push up
3v2<00:02:37.880> and<00:02:38.240> try<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:38.480> get<00:02:38.600> this<00:02:38.720> tower<00:02:38.960> down<00:02:42.010> but

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
3v2 and try and get this tower down but

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.580 
3v2 and try and get this tower down but
now<00:02:43.790> we<00:02:43.850> have<00:02:43.940> no<00:02:44.180> minions<00:02:45.020> so<00:02:45.200> we<00:02:45.290> just<00:02:45.380> kind

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
now we have no minions so we just kind

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.130

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
look in the mini-map you see that gragas

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.340 
look in the mini-map you see that gragas
just<00:03:07.310> all<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.360> cannon<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:08.870> now<00:03:08.960> he<00:03:09.020> has<00:03:09.290> no

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
just all the cannon and now he has no

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.100 
just all the cannon and now he has no
life<00:03:09.710> so<00:03:09.890> we<00:03:09.980> chased<00:03:10.220> him<00:03:10.400> down<00:03:10.660> I'm<00:03:11.660> trying<00:03:12.020> to

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
life so we chased him down I'm trying to

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.800 
life so we chased him down I'm trying to
go<00:03:12.200> over<00:03:12.440> there<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:12.740> help<00:03:13.070> him<00:03:13.250> out<00:03:13.540> but<00:03:14.540> this

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
go over there and help him out but this

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.930 
go over there and help him out but this
Kevin<00:03:15.140> smart<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:15.800> he<00:03:16.130> just<00:03:16.310> dives<00:03:16.550> into<00:03:16.790> the

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
Kevin smart and he just dives into the

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.520 
Kevin smart and he just dives into the
tower<00:03:17.120> because<00:03:17.360> he<00:03:17.540> knows<00:03:17.750> he's<00:03:18.110> going<00:03:18.140> to<00:03:18.320> die

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
tower because he knows he's going to die

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.740 
tower because he knows he's going to die
there's<00:03:18.800> no<00:03:18.920> way<00:03:19.040> he's<00:03:19.160> getting<00:03:19.280> out<00:03:19.520> of<00:03:19.610> that

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
there's no way he's getting out of that

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.660 
there's no way he's getting out of that
so<00:03:20.750> if<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:20.959> just<00:03:21.170> if<00:03:21.709> you<00:03:22.190> wait<00:03:22.400> long<00:03:22.430> enough

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
so if you just if you wait long enough

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.870 
so if you just if you wait long enough
and<00:03:23.620> then<00:03:24.620> go<00:03:24.860> into<00:03:24.890> a<00:03:25.160> tower<00:03:25.430> if<00:03:25.610> you<00:03:25.700> know

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
and then go into a tower if you know

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.720 
and then go into a tower if you know
you're<00:03:26.030> gonna<00:03:26.090> die<00:03:26.450> then<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:27.230> can<00:03:27.440> just<00:03:27.730> stop

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
you're gonna die then you can just stop

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.580 
you're gonna die then you can just stop
the<00:03:28.940> team<00:03:29.150> from<00:03:29.330> getting<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.750> kill<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.260> then

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
the team from getting the kill and then

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.710 
the team from getting the kill and then
they<00:03:30.800> don't<00:03:30.980> get<00:03:31.130> all<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.340> gold<00:03:31.520> from<00:03:31.730> it<00:03:31.940> so

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
they don't get all the gold from it so

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.250 
they don't get all the gold from it so
it's<00:03:32.900> actually<00:03:33.230> a<00:03:33.260> smart<00:03:33.530> play<00:03:33.739> and<00:03:34.540> then<00:03:35.540> me

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
it's actually a smart play and then me

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.830 
it's actually a smart play and then me
in<00:03:36.380> a<00:03:36.470> muumuu<00:03:36.739> end<00:03:36.950> up<00:03:37.040> getting<00:03:37.480> at<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.690> key

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
in a muumuu end up getting at the key

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.979 
in a muumuu end up getting at the key
longer<00:03:39.170> I<00:03:39.200> guess<00:03:39.230> anyway<00:03:40.660> so<00:03:41.660> I<00:03:41.690> see<00:03:41.870> that

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
longer I guess anyway so I see that

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.290 
longer I guess anyway so I see that
silent<00:03:42.650> around<00:03:42.860> with<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:43.489> eve<00:03:43.760> behind<00:03:44.120> him

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
silent around with the eve behind him

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.660 
silent around with the eve behind him
and<00:03:45.700> he<00:03:46.700> thought<00:03:46.880> it<00:03:47.000> would<00:03:47.120> just<00:03:47.239> be<00:03:47.420> a<00:03:47.450> 1v1<00:03:48.670> so

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
and he thought it would just be a 1v1 so

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.400 
and he thought it would just be a 1v1 so
he<00:03:49.820> tried<00:03:50.000> to<00:03:50.090> attack<00:03:50.330> me<00:03:50.360> but<00:03:50.630> then<00:03:50.810> he<00:03:51.170> did

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
he tried to attack me but then he did

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.850 
he tried to attack me but then he did
jump<00:03:51.650> in<00:03:52.209> and<00:03:53.209> we<00:03:53.959> do<00:03:54.110> get<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.410> kill<00:03:54.560> on<00:03:54.590> him

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
jump in and we do get the kill on him

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.470 
jump in and we do get the kill on him
and<00:03:54.980> then<00:03:55.070> we<00:03:55.160> just<00:03:55.340> run<00:03:55.520> away<00:03:55.610> because<00:03:56.180> we're

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
and then we just run away because we're

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.780 
and then we just run away because we're
both<00:03:56.720> out<00:03:56.959> of<00:03:56.989> mana<00:03:59.860> so<00:04:00.860> this<00:04:01.010> cannon<00:04:01.340> is<00:04:01.459> going

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
both out of mana so this cannon is going

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.610 
both out of mana so this cannon is going
around<00:04:02.030> to<00:04:02.239> a<00:04:02.270> barren<00:04:02.780> but<00:04:02.900> annie<00:04:03.110> is<00:04:03.230> coming

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
around to a barren but annie is coming

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.070 
around to a barren but annie is coming
his<00:04:03.709> way<00:04:03.890> I<00:04:04.180> bullet<00:04:05.180> time<00:04:05.360> through<00:04:05.690> the<00:04:05.870> path

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
his way I bullet time through the path

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.070 
his way I bullet time through the path
so<00:04:06.380> that<00:04:06.410> she<00:04:06.739> slows<00:04:07.100> and<00:04:07.420> alt<00:04:08.420> here<00:04:08.690> and<00:04:08.930> then

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
so that she slows and alt here and then

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.229 
so that she slows and alt here and then
if<00:04:09.170> you<00:04:09.260> look<00:04:09.410> closely<00:04:09.650> i<00:04:09.830> put<00:04:10.190> double<00:04:10.970> up<00:04:11.120> the

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
if you look closely i put double up the

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.960 
if you look closely i put double up the
ante<00:04:11.570> and<00:04:11.810> it<00:04:11.989> gets<00:04:12.290> the<00:04:12.470> gragas<00:04:12.890> in<00:04:13.130> the<00:04:13.730> bush

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
ante and it gets the gragas in the bush

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.330 
ante and it gets the gragas in the bush
and<00:04:14.239> then<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:15.350> movement<00:04:15.650> gets<00:04:15.920> to<00:04:16.040> kill<00:04:16.220> on

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
and then the movement gets to kill on

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.130 
and then the movement gets to kill on
any

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.650 

so<00:04:22.140> I<00:04:22.170> see<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:22.530> Scion<00:04:22.970> is<00:04:23.970> going<00:04:24.330> around<00:04:24.420> near

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
so I see the Scion is going around near

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.870 
so I see the Scion is going around near
the<00:04:24.690> Wolfcamp<00:04:25.260> and<00:04:25.500> I<00:04:25.590> try<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:25.830> cut<00:04:26.580> them<00:04:26.700> off

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
the Wolfcamp and I try to cut them off

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.340 
the Wolfcamp and I try to cut them off
with<00:04:27.060> this<00:04:27.210> Karthus<00:04:27.690> and<00:04:30.080> we're<00:04:31.080> kind<00:04:31.260> of

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
with this Karthus and we're kind of

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.530 
with this Karthus and we're kind of
surrounding<00:04:31.830> him<00:04:31.950> here<00:04:32.220> the<00:04:32.490> eve<00:04:32.700> is<00:04:33.000> behind

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
surrounding him here the eve is behind

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.330 
surrounding him here the eve is behind
the<00:04:33.690> tower<00:04:33.870> I'm<00:04:34.260> in<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.500> middle<00:04:34.680> of<00:04:34.770> tower<00:04:35.010> and

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
the tower I'm in the middle of tower and

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.220 
the tower I'm in the middle of tower and
the<00:04:35.390> Karthus<00:04:36.390> is<00:04:36.540> coming<00:04:36.810> in<00:04:36.900> from<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.140> middle

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
the Karthus is coming in from the middle

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.060 
the Karthus is coming in from the middle
brush<00:04:37.560> I<00:04:38.300> slowed<00:04:39.300> them<00:04:39.390> down<00:04:39.450> with<00:04:39.900> a<00:04:40.380> make<00:04:40.890> it

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
brush I slowed them down with a make it

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.700 
brush I slowed them down with a make it
rain<00:04:41.310> ability<00:04:41.790> and<00:04:41.970> then<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.050> e<00:04:43.080> comes<00:04:43.470> in<00:04:43.620> to

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
rain ability and then the e comes in to

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.160 
rain ability and then the e comes in to
stun<00:04:43.920> him<00:04:44.010> and<00:04:44.220> we<00:04:44.640> have<00:04:44.760> enough<00:04:44.970> time<00:04:45.150> to<00:04:46.140> just

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
stun him and we have enough time to just

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.660 
stun him and we have enough time to just
get<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.710> kill<00:04:46.890> on<00:04:46.920> him<00:04:47.930> so<00:04:49.310> now<00:04:50.310> it's<00:04:50.460> probably

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
get the kill on him so now it's probably

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.490 
get the kill on him so now it's probably
a<00:04:50.730> good<00:04:50.760> time<00:04:50.970> to<00:04:51.030> talk<00:04:51.270> about<00:04:51.450> the<00:04:52.170> build<00:04:52.410> i

here<00:05:37.920> it's<00:05:37.950> 3<00:05:38.160> be<00:05:38.520> one<00:05:38.730> with<00:05:38.940> a<00:05:38.970> moo<00:05:39.150> moo<00:05:39.180> and<00:05:39.540> I

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
here it's 3 be one with a moo moo and I

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.080 
here it's 3 be one with a moo moo and I
ulti<00:05:42.600> on<00:05:42.750> top<00:05:42.990> of<00:05:43.140> them<00:05:43.260> and<00:05:43.700> once<00:05:44.700> again<00:05:44.820> the

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
ulti on top of them and once again the

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.600 
ulti on top of them and once again the
silent<00:05:45.510> just<00:05:45.660> sticks<00:05:46.410> around<00:05:46.560> gets<00:05:47.340> killed

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
silent just sticks around gets killed

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.250 
silent just sticks around gets killed
for<00:05:47.910> it<00:05:47.940> and<00:05:48.290> then<00:05:49.290> the<00:05:49.470> mumu<00:05:49.860> gets<00:05:50.070> that<00:05:50.250> Corky

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
for it and then the mumu gets that Corky

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.950 
for it and then the mumu gets that Corky
so<00:05:52.260> now<00:05:52.620> we<00:05:52.680> can<00:05:52.860> just<00:05:52.920> push<00:05:53.420> the<00:05:54.420> bottom<00:05:54.780> line

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
so now we can just push the bottom line

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.920 
so now we can just push the bottom line
all<00:05:55.890> the<00:05:55.950> way<00:05:56.190> in<00:05:56.460> get<00:05:57.030> their<00:05:57.180> bottom<00:05:57.540> tower

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.890 
chasing down this Scion and it gets a
good<00:06:25.020> bandage<00:06:25.380> toss<00:06:25.560> and<00:06:26.120> then<00:06:27.120> I<00:06:27.480> get<00:06:27.750> the

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
good bandage toss and then I get the

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.390 
good bandage toss and then I get the
double<00:06:28.200> kill<00:06:28.380> on<00:06:28.650> Annie

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
double kill on Annie

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.379 
double kill on Annie
and<00:06:30.979> either<00:06:31.979> that's<00:06:32.340> yeah<00:06:32.910> I<00:06:32.970> think<00:06:33.120> that's

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:33.389 
and either that's yeah I think that's

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:36.800 
and either that's yeah I think that's
four<00:06:33.660> of<00:06:33.780> them<00:06:33.900> dead<00:06:34.110> so<00:06:34.979> now<00:06:35.790> it's<00:06:35.970> a<00:06:36.060> four<00:06:36.540> or

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
four of them dead so now it's a four or

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.249 
four of them dead so now it's a four or
five<00:06:37.560> e1<00:06:37.979> and<00:06:38.360> we<00:06:39.360> can<00:06:39.479> just<00:06:39.600> push<00:06:39.840> in<00:06:40.020> this

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:40.259 
five e1 and we can just push in this

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:43.219 
five e1 and we can just push in this
middle<00:06:40.500> tower<00:06:40.800> and<00:06:41.570> probably<00:06:42.570> even<00:06:42.690> get<00:06:43.080> the

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:43.229 
middle tower and probably even get the

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:48.140 
middle tower and probably even get the
inhibit<00:06:43.710> we<00:06:43.889> have<00:06:44.070> enough<00:06:44.310> time<00:06:46.910> Greg's<00:06:47.910> he's

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
inhibit we have enough time Greg's he's

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:49.460 
inhibit we have enough time Greg's he's
just<00:06:48.330> trying<00:06:48.539> to<00:06:48.570> throwing<00:06:48.870> barrels<00:06:49.050> to<00:06:49.320> get

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.470 
us there if he does too much then we'll

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.850 
us there if he does too much then we'll
just<00:06:55.710> charge<00:06:55.979> him<00:06:56.160> and<00:06:57.440> he'll<00:06:58.440> just<00:06:58.470> get

killed<00:07:00.020> so<00:07:01.020> at<00:07:01.440> this<00:07:01.500> point<00:07:01.800> I<00:07:01.919> have<00:07:02.070> enough

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.370 
killed so at this point I have enough

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.550 
killed so at this point I have enough
gold<00:07:02.580> to<00:07:02.699> buy<00:07:02.880> my<00:07:03.090> last<00:07:03.449> whisper<00:07:03.750> and<00:07:04.139> then<00:07:04.530> I

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 
gold to buy my last whisper and then I

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.219 
gold to buy my last whisper and then I
could<00:07:04.800> just<00:07:04.919> go<00:07:05.130> in<00:07:05.340> and<00:07:05.660> mess<00:07:06.660> some<00:07:06.870> more

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:07.229 
could just go in and mess some more

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:09.050 
could just go in and mess some more
up<00:07:07.440> but<00:07:08.039> the<00:07:08.160> team<00:07:08.370> ends<00:07:08.550> up<00:07:08.699> surrendering

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 
up but the team ends up surrendering

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.200 
up but the team ends up surrendering
because<00:07:10.250> we're<00:07:11.250> just<00:07:11.460> dominating<00:07:11.940> them<00:07:12.090> too

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.210 
because we're just dominating them too
