00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:17.380
 and therefore after 4 fucking months we are 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.019
 returned with the twelfth need to 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.140
 mythbusters subjects to incredible online 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:24.999
 myth number 1 up to question to walter se 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.789
 you approach the burned place of the fighter 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:30.310
 military the character catches fire at 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.890
 reason of logic should catch fire 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.340
 but we are on gta and therefore it comes 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.930
 simply tossed by the power of 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.390
 area but no fire bouncers 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.920
 fiano me does not catch fire dies dies but 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.680
 now it does not catch fire then and suffice e 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.090
 master and I will stop 2 bob you can 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.670
 insert one car into another 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.940
 enabling machine then disabling from 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.510
 we passive to explain for those who 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.949
 like you, they don't understand an exact fuck 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.019
 practically when ability the coin 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.910
 passive you can't practically be 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.589
 disturbed by no one before you 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.309
 can shoot is not yours does 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:04.930
 jump in the air 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.230
 on the other hand you can park 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.450
 however, on a truck the question now is whether 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.190
 visibility while only inside the 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.990
 truck 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.470
 what should happen now you see it 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.440
 stay in it and then do a lot 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.700
 of glik strafighi in my opinion goodbye fi 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.920
 ie for the institution 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.650
 the Romans weigh the Spartans all 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.370
 tortoise training shields we do it 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.120
 also on cod 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:33.070
 in short, one thing seemed to be made of paper 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.650
 used by nothing I am convinced 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.880
 why take a tank in gta 5 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.710
 when you can do this though when you go out 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.270
 there is no lashes left and then there is sex 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.750
 they go to love each other always says inside 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.760
 then he sees caravaggio with the number 3 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.830
 ce sends to Luke you can survive 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.360
 a grateful gas wearing the mask 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.880
 antigas or similar stuff 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.630
 and also here for reasons of logic one 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:02.080
 mask that is precisely antigas should 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.090
 protect yourself from the exact gar then us 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.280
 we pull the smoke bombs that can be overcome 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:11.240
 poison poisonissime anti poison 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.060
 line 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:18.010
 so many campers you understand is a bit this 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.920
 colloquial Italian works great 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.940
 understand if you hear from the 320 will order 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.630
 the trident is known is still convinced no 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.150
 we find another time maybe 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.370
 will pull out the underwater respirator 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.900
 exact well then if no longer find 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.070
 the one set up for the gas does not work 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.770
 surely a king silvio the interest 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.530
 opaque and apparently they are just objects 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.180
 of aesthetics that do not need a cock 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.630
 the question is all about celestini with 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.210
 this has therefore after free however with 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.210
 gas is predominantly not gas must 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:54.050
 be an acid to also remember the 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.460
 skin if busted over piles 14 you can 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.290
 kill a player inside the 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.810
 his apartment shooting from the outside 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.670
 with a helicopter 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.140
 ergo translated into plain words you can 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.270
 fucking breaking people too 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.950
 rope in the apartment 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.340
 so we are slaughtering the glass but it is 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.120
 super anti-bullet anti missile 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.610
 nuclear explosion anti allahu akbar 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.740
 mom can be selective she crashes 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.750
 orlando barranco remains intact that the 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:25.220
 glass because it would be understood that it is 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.170
 indestructible busted vito number 5 s 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.210
 I put 6 bombs on a motorcycle then 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.520
 I go in and out of the mechanic the bombs 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.370
 the bombs of Syria disappear snoop smokes 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.260
 dogg disappear 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.810
 therefore Mr. final our mind 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.640
 mechanic will surely be from the ghetto a 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.730
 those with gold teeth the catenazzi 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.360
 look I will watch them leave us there vote 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.190
 beautiful padded we enter inside waiting 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.980
 deserves with twenty is more or if it is 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.100
 already smoked meant that tense linkra 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.780
 empty the bombs that factor writing 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.330
 a theme for mechanic of why it is 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.210
 a thief to steal bombs what 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:06.170
 indecent cheated by the mechanic a 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:09.310
 so a comparison acab bike 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.140
 even today the episode is 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.230
 incredibly finished no one ever has 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.079
 said no exact video a arrived 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.209
 at the end the second the timeline e 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.519
 we reach 7 thousand I like for a 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.050
 next episode commented 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.169
 suggesting the next myth to dispel 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.979
 from the camper and expose everything there 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.750
 let's see where when how how there is no 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:36.990
 fishing can not make the closure that 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.990
 sucks sleeping camper does not catch fish
