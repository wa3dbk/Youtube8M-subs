having another helper because well one

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.330 
having another helper because well one
piece<00:02:15.670> is<00:02:15.910> running<00:02:16.360> I<00:02:17.320> can<00:02:17.710> be<00:02:17.830> over<00:02:18.070> there<00:02:18.250> at

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.880 
the router table and wrap these around
it<00:02:21.970> over<00:02:22.180> some<00:02:22.360> edges<00:02:22.750> or<00:02:22.930> sanding<00:02:23.410> or<00:02:23.560> or

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
it over some edges or sanding or or

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.160 
it over some edges or sanding or or
doing<00:02:24.130> something<00:02:24.460> else<00:02:24.610> so<00:02:24.760> machine<00:02:25.720> runs<00:02:26.020> by

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
doing something else so machine runs by

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.100 
doing something else so machine runs by
itself<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:27.270> so<00:02:28.270> it's<00:02:28.510> kind<00:02:28.660> of<00:02:28.720> like<00:02:28.840> having<00:02:28.989> a

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
itself and so it's kind of like having a

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.420 
itself and so it's kind of like having a
helper<00:02:29.260> so<00:02:29.620> that's<00:02:29.830> that's<00:02:30.040> one<00:02:30.280> of<00:02:30.340> the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
helper so that's that's one of the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.660 
helper so that's that's one of the
things<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:30.730> like<00:02:30.940> about<00:02:30.970> using<00:02:31.600> a<00:02:31.780> CNC<00:02:32.050> router

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.730 
right off and keep it clean so that's
that's<00:05:04.889> the<00:05:05.099> next<00:05:05.280> step<00:05:05.550> and<00:05:05.849> I'll<00:05:06.659> be<00:05:07.530> back

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
that's the next step and I'll be back

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:18.629 
that's the next step and I'll be back
when<00:05:07.949> I<00:05:08.009> get<00:05:08.250> that<00:05:08.639> finished

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.790 

okay<00:05:19.330> I've<00:05:19.449> got<00:05:19.629> a<00:05:19.659> coat<00:05:19.990> of<00:05:20.020> this<00:05:20.289> spar

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
okay I've got a coat of this spar

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.480 
okay I've got a coat of this spar
urethane<00:05:21.370> on<00:05:21.939> here<00:05:22.270> to<00:05:22.449> help<00:05:23.250> waterproof<00:05:24.250> it<00:05:24.430> a

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
urethane on here to help waterproof it a

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.610 
urethane on here to help waterproof it a
little<00:05:24.669> bit<00:05:24.849> and<00:05:25.689> it's<00:05:25.990> going<00:05:26.050> to<00:05:26.169> take<00:05:26.379> about

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
little bit and it's going to take about

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.379 
little bit and it's going to take about
probably<00:05:26.680> about<00:05:27.099> four<00:05:27.490> hours<00:05:27.610> of<00:05:27.849> God<00:05:28.060> most

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
probably about four hours of God most

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:29.670 
probably about four hours of God most
likely<00:05:28.750> they'll<00:05:28.870> take<00:05:29.050> a<00:05:29.080> little<00:05:29.349> longer<00:05:29.500> than

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
likely they'll take a little longer than

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.409 
likely they'll take a little longer than
that<00:05:29.949> because<00:05:30.340> it's<00:05:30.520> raining<00:05:30.759> here<00:05:31.150> today

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
that because it's raining here today

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:35.909 
that because it's raining here today
it's<00:05:31.719> very<00:05:31.960> humid<00:05:32.409> so<00:05:34.229> I'll<00:05:35.229> have<00:05:35.409> to<00:05:35.560> wait<00:05:35.710> for

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
it's very humid so I'll have to wait for

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.360 
it's very humid so I'll have to wait for
that<00:05:36.009> to<00:05:36.069> dry<00:05:36.219> and<00:05:36.759> then<00:05:37.500> see<00:05:38.500> if<00:05:38.590> I<00:05:38.740> probably
