yeah pose stuff like that it's perfect

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.309 
yeah pose stuff like that it's perfect
why<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.250> recommend<00:02:29.030> moving<00:02:29.300> stuff<00:02:29.630> into<00:02:29.959> jars

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
why I recommend moving stuff into jars

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.920 
why I recommend moving stuff into jars
and<00:02:31.040> we<00:02:31.220> can<00:02:31.400> seal<00:02:31.700> it<00:02:32.200> because<00:02:34.780> I'll<00:02:35.780> let

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
and we can seal it because I'll let

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.330 
and we can seal it because I'll let
