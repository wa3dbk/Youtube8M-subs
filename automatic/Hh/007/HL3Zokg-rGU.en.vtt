00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
know this is where I've got to get to

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.530 
know this is where I've got to get to

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
and more importantly it acknowledges

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.510 
and more importantly it acknowledges
that<00:01:45.570> he<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.110> Kobe<00:01:46.470> their<00:01:46.890> working

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
that he and Kobe their working

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.120 
that he and Kobe their working
relationship<00:01:47.750> isn't<00:01:48.750> nearly<00:01:49.170> as<00:01:49.320> bad<00:01:49.439> as<00:01:49.950> it

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.190 
relationship isn't nearly as bad as it
once<00:01:50.340> was<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.119> think<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.420> combination<00:01:51.659> of

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
once was and I think the combination of

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.080 
once was and I think the combination of
all<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.439> those<00:01:52.680> things<00:01:53.070> would<00:01:53.460> lend<00:01:53.729> itself

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
all of those things would lend itself

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.240 
all of those things would lend itself
towards<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.570> white<00:01:54.750> Howard<00:01:55.200> realized<00:01:55.680> that

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
towards the white Howard realized that

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.730 
towards the white Howard realized that
LA<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.820> probably<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.540> best<00:01:57.810> fit<00:01:58.049> for<00:01:58.110> him<00:01:58.560> and

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
LA is probably the best fit for him and

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.469 
LA is probably the best fit for him and
that<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.189> where<00:01:59.399> he<00:01:59.579> will<00:01:59.759> remain<00:02:02.240> that's<00:02:03.240> good

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
that is where he will remain that's good
