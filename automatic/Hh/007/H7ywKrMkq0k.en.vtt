00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.310

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:00.110

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:05.750
 small tribute that I made the camacho 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.870
 I leave this reflection that there is always 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:11.479
 that help others help others 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.909
 I never had the pleasure of meeting the 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:16.550
 ahli camacho and yours but I did know 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:18.889
 people that he met him in person and I 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.900
 They said that he was a very good person 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:23.569
 He treated others with respect at all times 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.370
 his songs taught what he knew only 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:27.349
 that's how I learn that I like 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:31.039
 share what I know how little I know what 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:33.229
 that we are learning so isolated 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:34.940
 He ordered that the song that 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:38.330
 live happy because you never know 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:40.580
 how far will it go I hope 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:44.620
 this will be a reflection for you as well 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.620
 that we see each other goodbye
