beautiful<00:00:42.450> cut<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.440> we<00:00:43.980> were<00:00:44.309> able<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.579> do

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
beautiful cut and we were able to do

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.750 
beautiful cut and we were able to do
that<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.059> about<00:00:45.270> three<00:00:45.840> seconds<00:00:46.399> whereas<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.550> a

that in about three seconds whereas on a
conventional<00:00:48.360> saw<00:00:48.660> we'd<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.350> set<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.620> up

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
conventional saw we'd have to set it up

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.970 
conventional saw we'd have to set it up
find<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.300> power<00:00:51.510> for<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.320> then<00:00:52.620> go<00:00:52.829> ahead

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
find the power for it and then go ahead

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.279 
find the power for it and then go ahead
and<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.090> worry<00:00:54.270> about<00:00:54.480> finding<00:00:54.960> water

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
and have to worry about finding water

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.979 
and have to worry about finding water
and<00:00:55.559> all<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.430> other<00:00:56.579> things<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.030> we<00:00:57.180> were<00:00:57.329> able

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
and all the other things so we were able

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.290 
and all the other things so we were able
to<00:00:58.170> achieve<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.949> same<00:00:59.190> goal<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.030> matter<00:01:00.210> of

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
to achieve the same goal in a matter of

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.310 
to achieve the same goal in a matter of
seconds<00:01:01.340> another<00:01:02.340> added<00:01:02.760> benefit<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.960> TX

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
seconds another added benefit to the TX

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.469 
seconds another added benefit to the TX
is<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.860> does<00:01:05.010> very<00:01:05.280> well<00:01:05.460> on<00:01:05.519> what

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
is that it does very well on what

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.130 
is that it does very well on what
everybody<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.080> using<00:01:07.680> today<00:01:08.330> glass<00:01:09.330> glass

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
everybody is using today glass glass

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.830 
everybody is using today glass glass
tiles<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.920> right<00:01:11.880> here<00:01:12.150> what<00:01:12.330> we're<00:01:12.510> doing<00:01:12.540> is

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
tiles and right here what we're doing is

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.710 
tiles and right here what we're doing is
we're<00:01:13.049> showing<00:01:13.229> how<00:01:13.530> how<00:01:14.310> wonderful<00:01:15.000> this

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
we're showing how how wonderful this

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.710 
we're showing how how wonderful this
will<00:01:15.990> score<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.619> snap<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.100> 2<00:01:17.280> by<00:01:17.460> 2<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.659> is

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
will score and snap a 2 by 2 and this is

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.499 
will score and snap a 2 by 2 and this is
1<00:01:19.020> lineal<00:01:19.409> foot<00:01:20.180> typically<00:01:21.180> we're<00:01:21.330> going<00:01:21.450> to

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
1 lineal foot typically we're going to

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.410 
1 lineal foot typically we're going to
set<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.900> up<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> saw<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.580> it's<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.240> very

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
set this up on a saw and it's a very

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.210 
set this up on a saw and it's a very
flimsy<00:01:24.689> mesh<00:01:25.140> mount<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.680> we're<00:01:25.830> going<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.979> we

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
flimsy mesh mount so we're going to we

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.039 
flimsy mesh mount so we're going to we
would<00:01:26.340> have<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.670> hold<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.360> place<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.960> it's

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
would have to hold it in place and it's

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.569 
would have to hold it in place and it's
going<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.259> take<00:01:28.439> us<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.710> couple<00:01:28.740> minutes

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
going to take us a couple minutes

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.850 
going to take us a couple minutes
probably<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.270> cut<00:01:30.420> through<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.020> here

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
probably to cut through this and here

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.080 
probably to cut through this and here
we're<00:01:31.979> going<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.159> do<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.490> just<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.820> few

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
we're going to do it in just a few

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.039 
we're going to do it in just a few
seconds<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.500> again<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.009> score<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:36.049> snap

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
seconds so again it's a score and snap

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.149 
seconds so again it's a score and snap
and<00:01:37.680> real<00:01:38.670> simple<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.770> think<00:01:41.009> we've

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
and real simple and I think we've

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.510 
and real simple and I think we've
probably<00:01:41.570> done<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.899> less<00:01:43.079> than<00:01:43.520> 30

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
probably done that in less than 30

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.990 
probably done that in less than 30
seconds<00:01:45.229> and<00:01:46.229> we<00:01:46.350> have<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.500> nice<00:01:46.649> clean<00:01:47.040> clean

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
seconds and we have a nice clean clean

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.710 
seconds and we have a nice clean clean
score

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
score

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.530

didn't<00:01:50.380> chip<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.710> back<00:01:50.860> and<00:01:51.790> we've<00:01:52.180> done<00:01:52.360> this

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
didn't chip the back and we've done this

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.170 
didn't chip the back and we've done this
several<00:01:52.869> times<00:01:53.350> and<00:01:53.799> we<00:01:54.759> were<00:01:54.850> able<00:01:54.970> to<00:01:55.090> do

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
several times and we were able to do

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.840 
several times and we were able to do
that<00:01:55.299> with<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.570> Ruby<00:01:55.810> TX<00:01:56.170> in<00:01:57.159> just<00:01:57.580> a<00:01:57.700> matter

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
wonderful machine is its time-saving

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.680 
wonderful machine is its time-saving
ability<00:02:05.740> and<00:02:06.190> so<00:02:06.850> a<00:02:06.880> lot<00:02:07.060> of<00:02:07.090> times<00:02:07.330> we'll<00:02:07.509> do<00:02:07.659> a

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
ability and so a lot of times we'll do a

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.440 
ability and so a lot of times we'll do a
diagonal<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.860> here<00:02:09.340> we've<00:02:09.489> pre-cut<00:02:09.759> a<00:02:10.000> 20

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
diagonal and here we've pre-cut a 20

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.400 
diagonal and here we've pre-cut a 20
inch<00:02:10.600> tile<00:02:10.959> on<00:02:11.170> a<00:02:11.200> diagonal<00:02:11.620> in<00:02:12.959> my<00:02:13.959> setters

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
inch tile on a diagonal in my setters

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.070 
inch tile on a diagonal in my setters
upstairs<00:02:14.950> on<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.190> second<00:02:15.670> floor<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.720> he

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
upstairs on the second floor and he

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.610 
upstairs on the second floor and he
needs<00:02:17.319> me<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.560> do<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.920> diagonal<00:02:18.370> cut<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:20.170> we

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
needs me to do a diagonal cut and we

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.550 
needs me to do a diagonal cut and we
didn't<00:02:20.860> bring<00:02:20.980> our<00:02:21.130> wet<00:02:21.340> saw<00:02:21.580> today<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:23.170> he

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
didn't bring our wet saw today so he

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.770 
didn't bring our wet saw today so he
needs<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:23.980> 12<00:02:24.250> inch<00:02:24.989> triangular<00:02:25.989> cut<00:02:26.260> from<00:02:27.220> our

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
needs a 12 inch triangular cut from our

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.710 
needs a 12 inch triangular cut from our
our<00:02:28.780> 20<00:02:29.170> inch<00:02:29.319> piece<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:30.700> we<00:02:30.880> that<00:02:31.390> we<00:02:31.540> laid

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
our 20 inch piece that we that we laid

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.059 
our 20 inch piece that we that we laid
out<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:33.700> so<00:02:34.000> let's<00:02:34.380> let's<00:02:35.380> go<00:02:35.590> back<00:02:35.620> let's

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
out and so let's let's go back let's

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.580 
out and so let's let's go back let's
make<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.459> 6<00:02:36.790> inch<00:02:37.030> triangle<00:02:37.630> because<00:02:38.410> we're

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
make it a 6 inch triangle because we're

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.500 
make it a 6 inch triangle because we're
measuring<00:02:38.769> from<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.310> wall<00:02:39.489> to<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:40.180> tip<00:02:40.390> of

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
measuring from the wall to the tip of

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.080 
measuring from the wall to the tip of
the<00:02:40.569> corner<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:42.069> what<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.819> beauty<00:02:43.000> of

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
the corner and so what the beauty of

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.050 
the corner and so what the beauty of
this<00:02:43.330> size<00:02:43.540> is<00:02:43.810> it<00:02:43.959> has<00:02:44.140> two<00:02:44.410> levels<00:02:44.560> of

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
this size is it has two levels of

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.759 
this size is it has two levels of
measurement<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.390> top<00:02:46.630> gauge<00:02:46.930> is<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.350> one<00:02:47.530> for

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
measurement the top gauge is the one for

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.770 
measurement the top gauge is the one for
our<00:02:47.980> diagonal<00:02:48.580> cuts<00:02:48.819> so<00:02:49.060> we<00:02:49.239> don't<00:02:49.420> have<00:02:49.600> the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
our diagonal cuts so we don't have the

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.130 
our diagonal cuts so we don't have the
pre<00:02:50.140> pre<00:02:51.010> measure<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.670> layout<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.480> diet<00:02:52.720> the

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
pre pre measure and layout the diet the

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.710 
pre pre measure and layout the diet the
diagram<00:02:53.620> we<00:02:54.340> know<00:02:54.519> we<00:02:54.700> need<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:54.940> six<00:02:55.239> inch<00:02:55.450> cut

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
diagram we know we need a six inch cut

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.229 
diagram we know we need a six inch cut
so<00:02:55.959> we<00:02:56.079> lay<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.290> on<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.590> diagonal<00:02:57.400> we<00:02:58.180> score<00:02:58.540> it

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
so we lay it on the diagonal we score it

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:07.730 
so we lay it on the diagonal we score it
snap<00:03:01.239> it

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.120 

and<00:03:08.370> we<00:03:08.580> should<00:03:08.790> have<00:03:08.970> six<00:03:09.240> inches<00:03:09.600> from<00:03:10.130> the

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
and we should have six inches from the

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.450 
and we should have six inches from the
