00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.140
 Hello, welcome to a new video 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.729
 of professor day they will remember that 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.030
 our website we have thousands and thousands 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:12.559
 and thousands and thousands of exercise data 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.870
 to try and get very good grades in 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.190
 physical math and current cinema we are going to 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.480
 start with this good exercise 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.910
 remember that down there you have the link 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.650
 the blog where we are developing everything 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.050
 the agenda and you have in the statements of 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.540
 all exercises well a satellite 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.850
 artificial 500 kilograms mass in 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.710
 rise from the earth's surface to 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.079
 place it in a circular orbit located 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.060
 at a height of 1,200 kilometers above 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.650
 the surface of the earth determine to 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.960
 the intensity of the gravitational field 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.700
 land at any point of the 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.410
 orbit described by the satellite what 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.990
 connects asking the seriousness true 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.730
 yes and see the satellite speed when 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.100
 is located in said orbit the paragraph 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.960
 b asked the orbital speed 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.290
 we have the land there we throw 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.670
 a satellite if we put it orbiting 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.190
 around 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.109
 from the earth 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.879
 Gravity asks me first and foremost 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.789
 important is the radius of orbit is 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.070
 remember how the radio gives me height 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:09.340
 of orbit in this case is going to be the king 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.670
 from the earth plus the height or July very 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.890
 heavy be believe its embers yes 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.860
 but it's the typical error to read because 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.020
 they give us the height above the surface the 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.240
 ground well another important thing or 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.860
 interesting is that we so far 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.020
 we have put the ground radio to another 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.090
 number but good we have to 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.890
 use what the statement gives us 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.050
 teacher in this case is an exercise 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.360
 exam when they gave you these results 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.840
 these data then I'm going to use those 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:41.740
 It is worth using what you always get this 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.170
 for something they will give it hate 6400 if more 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:49.810
 Earth network 1200 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.810
 valuable of 7,600 yes 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.710
 km is ok and we pass it to meters we know 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.100
 that a kilometer is a thousand meters eyes 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.420
 to spend it seven million meters 600 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.939
 thousand 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.810
 meters would be around let's calculate 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:09.090
 the gravity g equals ag for the mass 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.300
 uppercase match the orbital radius 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.630
 square is what we already know that 6 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:20.060
 67 for 10 at least they are for the m that is 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:24.530
 the mass of the earth that are 5 97 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:27.370
 for 10 to 24 match the radius is 7 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.370
 million 600 thousand 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.849
 it is clear we know it is also 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.890
 very interesting we are the earth 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.560
 ok we know that gravity in the 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.140
 surface of the earth is 98 according to 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.599
 we are moving away from the land of that 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.360
 gravity decreases worth has to 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.239
 decrease yes or yes fixed because it decreases 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.160
 the gravitational interaction that the 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.560
 earth with the body that means 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.430
 that this result has to give me 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.489
 less than 98 but fixed as is greater 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:05.330
 of 9 as 8 are wrong very badly 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:07.610
 okay so care for me gave me 689 that 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.040
 you realize that if it is less than 9.8 of 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.880
 just as normal is that it is good it is very 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.380
 important self check them worth and give 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.790
 coherent solutions it is worth that we have 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.099
 I mean with coherent solutions and here 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.110
 novelty 12 meters squared is a 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.270
 incoherent solution because I know that I 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.820
 has to give less than 9.2 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.230
 ok and the units metro second to 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.120
 square because gravity is a 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.150
 acceleration but good can also be 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.060
 measure and I will remember newtons match 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.660
 kilogram has brought me to what we have 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.180
 all right 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.069
 well, there is a good 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.020
 section separated from the speed of 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.270
 satellite when it is in orbit 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.860
 then they ask us the speed of 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.900
 habitat then let's do the 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.490
 show down here we have 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.250
 a force is we know that they are matter of 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.670
 forces equal the mass by speed 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.410
 squared split the radius of orbit 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.340
 because we are in circular dynamics and the 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.730
 force that we have the strength 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.400
 gravitational that is g per m per m 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.200
 radio match is equal to 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.810
 so the square radio match 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.060
 plate plate the radio here is the 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.020
 square sergio and plate plate and I do not 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.470
 you advise 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.570
 it gives us orbit capacity is that 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:22.109
 we put capital letter match the radio then 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.570
 the orbital orbit speed if it is 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.760
 equal to the square root of g per m 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.540
 capital match around vital 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:34.660
 square root row of 6.67 porticada 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:37.510
 minus 11 x 5.97 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:41.950
 by 10 to 24 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:45.720
 party the radio radio the radio would be 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.720
 that are seven million 

00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:54.009
 we take the calculator and that gave me 

00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:58.280
 seven thousand 238 47 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:05:01.210
 38 4 meters second match 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.100
 we have already finished, I get very well 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:08.740
 we finalize exercise and move on to 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.740
 next come do not feel exercise
