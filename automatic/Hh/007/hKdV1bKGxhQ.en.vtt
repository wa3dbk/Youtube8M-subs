00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.030
 hours of sport and currently has the theme 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.769
 tennis and because we are not always in 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.299
 want to play our little athletes 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.580
 For once we have one today 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.070
 tennis hall rented the approximately on 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.180
 the other end of the city is and 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.560
 I only have five minutes with the 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.449

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.920
 I was allowed to do what I the stairs hour 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.500
 drive there where I first thought 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.789

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.369

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.430
 Tail but then a colleague has more 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.780
 offer me to go there and motto 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.520
 Svenja and the physical education was just 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.410
 also classic normal but completely 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.879
 unimportant that we quickly tell that 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.739
 what would like to tell is that 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.329
 a total of three classmates then with 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.100
 drove the car and of course 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.570
 then the people break around who with 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.370
 back to the classmates 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.140
 School drives that was not the main 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.730
 discussion if you must know us 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.770
 only one girl has one with us 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.449
 great and these three car drivers this 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.230
 cars have been arguing about with 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.370
 How to create this girl with understand 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.420
 my god my moment the feeling 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.920
 understand me if i am wrong 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.720
 it was not about the victory 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.400
 mitfÃ¤hrt it came not berlin 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.590
 hate with vettel she has that 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.909
 she can not be that way with me 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.530
 drive away my doors are all broken 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.700
 you have to with colors with me, the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.350
 I do not ride, I already have it 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.850
 many people with me in the car that must 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.830
 go with you and so on and so on 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.240
 It was very funny and if you are 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.740
 Now ask why we hate them all 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.960
 I'll give you a reason 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.970
 1,000,000 she is teaching 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.430
 not because they are religious or headscarf 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.740
 something no it is a blue costume with 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.439
 dolphin on it where a net underneath 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.390
 sewn is that warded off cell phone radiation 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.400
 or often it should be so in the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.850
 can concentrate better on teaching 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.130
 yes, such people are surrendered as 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.689
 existent but not only gives as 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.880
 existence no sense but also the 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.380
 people who make our representation plan 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.119
 in advance you have to know we have 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.590
 meanwhile our last english 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.299
 klausur wrote we never write 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.829
 more an english klausur and now 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.930
 We had in the last two hours 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.950
 today english then plus hours 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.390
 because our teacher was not 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.080
 now is the question most come 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.730
 Of course, what are plus hours now 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.560
 there used to be an eleventh class only 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.899
 representation and the case when the teacher 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.420
 was not there sometime to twelve and 23 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.190
 10 plus hours is that if one 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.690
 Teacher is not there I have none 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.430
 representation can be found 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.140
 but still be present 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.600
 but to learn for myself I said 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.190
 the eleventh grade is nothing for English 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.960
 Not learned because it is in the classroom 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.890
 not me at once i was in english 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.450
 I just always have the exams 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.490
 somehow intuitively written and the 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.230
 was never worse than two and then 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.820
 so comes a planner about the 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.460
 corner and think we are in the last 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.320
 hours of our lessons during the day 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.730
 spend independently English like that 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.740
 because even though we no longer have a clue 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.850
 write yes there are of course totally 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.800
 a lot are out on martys yes and there was 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.450
 quite a few discussions because all 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.530
 Students from our class at blues 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.030
 always just go home 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.260
 Dangers are sure a few days 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.850
 later the class teacher of the 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.410
 had somehow heard about it 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.150
 Excited and hours long 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.800
 Discussions have led us there 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.600
 do not have to go home but 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.709
 to stay there because of this eternal 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.450
 Of course we are now discussing 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.459
 today all in this plus hour 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.990
 had not stayed 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.430
 We do not care what the teacher is 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.930
 says we are just all evaporated 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.030
 And it will be a discussion again 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.980
 but I can give more of these 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.880
 beautiful exciting day also not 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.800

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.330
 I hope you liked the video 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.370
 and I'm sure we'll meet 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.090
 then again sometime then 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.090
 See you
