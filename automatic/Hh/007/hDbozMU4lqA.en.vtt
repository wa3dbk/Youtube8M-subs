00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:10.840
 This is the second part we like this. 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:17.140
 ours here 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:20.140
 Our assembly here we put 2 on 2 and here 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.590
 on our one more assembly this pilot 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.470
 the hole must still show through here 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.980
 and there should be so smooth here 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.739
 line so well and then do on the finger 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.409
 just such an assembly if we donâ€™t 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:40.030
 I can do the assembly immediately and leave already 

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:44.350
 on the gun itself and so do we understand the trial 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.420
 year to deploy 14 grams of salt per hole 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.379
 on the ring 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:56.350
 the detail is so small black because 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:01:05.159
 that's us like one ten 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:08.130
 and 1 and we should get such a detachment 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.869
 yes by the way you can use this up 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.079
 14, instead of it to stand for 1 2 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:17.909
 she just lacks the details so here 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:21.039
 take one and two here is such a black part 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.829
 such stand for them will be fastened 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:31.869
 gum that's the radius of the bushes 16 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:37.119
 terrible separately 10 so here so that 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:49.530
 Now this mechanism, our moving and 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:49.530
 we finish here so 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.510
 so here is all our row is ready and so 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.750
 further to us panzer 4 on 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:10.149
 to 4 by 6 and then his then courses one by 6 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.149
 thin and we have to leave here like this 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:25.760
 here so we fingers just do 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:32.050
 here is such a thin layer and so here here 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:42.680
 that we insert another one on one thin and 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:47.269
 here blowing on 6 and 11 meters like this 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.080
 like that sour and so on we will be 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.250
 make the roof 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:56.290
 I'm using this two by four 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:03:00.019
 smoothed for beauty 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.560
 the stage is such an assembly for me 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:08.239
 My sight is already three to four eyes 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:15.320
 on and still put 2 on 4 perfectly done 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:19.880
 such an amount and so it is 8 by 4 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:26.390
 here is 84 fat i took from thin plates 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:28.970
 and we have to put 2 1 on 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:36.769
 1 can be rounded can any general 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:40.010
 so here we retreat 11 and we stand it 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:50.049
 already here that is in detail h should 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:50.049
 remember now that's where the black trigger table 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:57.840
 and so on we will need three rubber bands 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.830
 well first we take 1 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:06.370
 we twist in half and we have to 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:15.370
 first you start to go trunk 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:17.170
 pull and you have to pull from here 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:23.050
 we have this just in case 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:25.690
 the pen didn't fall off right now and that's it 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.190
 our pen will hold on so on we 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:33.940
 We insert this one here so that the assembly 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:36.870
 it was like that 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.930
 Well, in general, look 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.710
 that was not here this here is such a 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:48.250
 because she sticks out more then less 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.930
 should this necessarily and stretch 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.790
 rubber bands 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.690
 I take a gum from me personally, it is very 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:58.980
 so long so I reeled 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.980
 as I stretch myself 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.150
 that is, heroes 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:17.820
 here and so here and so so good 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:33.510
 so on a finger network is somewhat 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:38.230
 rezinochek and here insert here 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:40.750
 preferably look like this 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:47.140
 put the trigger hold and so much 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:49.830
 more comfortable yes so here and take 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.830
 rezinochki 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:06:01.539
 here and when by the way I am these rubber bands and here 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:04.189
 here, just in case, I stretch 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:09.620
 so that this item from not 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:14.020
 fell off and now you can already can 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:16.129
 move but he won't be showing after all 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:23.360
 now we need to charge 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:30.229
 take this item still take the cartridge so 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:34.430
 I'm tired necessarily better here now this 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:37.370
 part of a smooth how to arrange them here 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:43.969
 so here and then it will not fly badly 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:48.279
 It seems like we are putting in and this one is very 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:48.279
 towards the wand should look back and 

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:59.750
 we stretch more rezinochki so here is all 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:03.529
 as he sows if you are just shades 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:08.389
 I will do nothing no faster than air 

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:21.319
 pull the score then 0 until it clicks and already 

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:23.599
 let go and then he is evicted in general then 

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:25.759
 here's a gun to everyone thanks for 

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:28.310
