yt piece can you get a one-piece or what

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.260 
yt piece can you get a one-piece or what
you<00:01:43.950> can<00:01:44.130> get<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> one-piece<00:01:44.729> but<00:01:44.939> we<00:01:45.060> like<00:01:45.240> a

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
you can get a one-piece but we like a

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
two-piece because when we get hot we're

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.580 
two-piece because when we get hot we're
not<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.790> water<00:01:48.060> all<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.750> time<00:01:48.780> right<00:01:49.290> when

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
not in the water all the time right when

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.530 
not in the water all the time right when
we<00:01:49.710> get<00:01:49.799> hot<00:01:50.040> we<00:01:50.460> may<00:01:50.700> need<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.000> take<00:01:51.149> gear<00:01:51.390> off

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
we get hot we may need to take gear off

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.569 
we get hot we may need to take gear off

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
and take it away okay and that's why we

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.130 
and take it away okay and that's why we
have<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.729> separate<00:01:54.060> vest<00:01:54.360> for<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.659> top<00:01:54.840> part<00:01:55.079> of

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
have a separate vest for the top part of

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.600 
have a separate vest for the top part of
the<00:01:55.229> body<00:01:55.409> all<00:01:55.680> right<00:01:55.950> beautiful

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
the body all right beautiful

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.039 
the body all right beautiful
now<00:01:56.820> we<00:01:56.880> need<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.329> vest<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.689> protect

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
now we need that vest to protect

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.899 
now we need that vest to protect
ourselves<00:01:58.170> from<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.680> wind<00:01:58.920> winds<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.640> most

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
ourselves from the wind winds the most

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.340 
ourselves from the wind winds the most
important<00:02:00.360> aspect<00:02:00.659> when<00:02:00.840> we're<00:02:00.960> on<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> jet<00:02:01.320> ski

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
important aspect when we're on a jet ski

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.230 
important aspect when we're on a jet ski
right<00:02:02.040> because<00:02:02.340> we're<00:02:02.460> getting<00:02:02.549> water<00:02:02.909> spray

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
right because we're getting water spray

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.910 
right because we're getting water spray
over<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.570> front<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.020> craft<00:02:04.259> yeah<00:02:04.680> and

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
over the front of the craft yeah and

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.590 
over the front of the craft yeah and
then<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.399> picks<00:02:05.640> up<00:02:05.850> with<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.119> wind<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.479> we're

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
then it picks up with the wind and we're

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.419 
then it picks up with the wind and we're
traveling<00:02:06.780> along<00:02:07.079> with<00:02:07.229> anywhere<00:02:07.560> up<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.770> 120

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
traveling along with anywhere up to 120

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.180 
traveling along with anywhere up to 120
kilometers<00:02:08.729> now

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
kilometers now

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.250 
kilometers now
so<00:02:09.790> we're<00:02:09.940> going<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.120> get<00:02:10.240> quite<00:02:10.450> chilled<00:02:10.780> we

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
so we're going to get quite chilled we

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.660 
so we're going to get quite chilled we
need<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.500> two-piece<00:02:11.890> so<00:02:12.280> we<00:02:12.370> put<00:02:12.550> the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
need the two-piece so we put the

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.790 
need the two-piece so we put the
two-piece<00:02:13.060> on<00:02:13.240> when<00:02:13.450> we<00:02:13.570> start<00:02:13.870> yep<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.590> then

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
two-piece on when we start yep and then

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.410 
two-piece on when we start yep and then
as<00:02:14.890> we<00:02:14.980> get<00:02:15.100> too<00:02:15.310> hot<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:15.760> we've<00:02:16.030> been<00:02:16.210> riding

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
as we get too hot and we've been riding

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.160 
as we get too hot and we've been riding

for a while

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.110 
for a while
we<00:02:17.410> then<00:02:17.620> may<00:02:17.770> take<00:02:18.010> that<00:02:18.160> gear<00:02:18.400> off<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:18.790> go

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
we then may take that gear off and go

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.940 
we then may take that gear off and go
back<00:02:19.300> to<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.510> one-piece<00:02:19.960> now<00:02:20.530> as<00:02:20.680> you<00:02:20.770> can<00:02:20.890> see

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
back to the one-piece now as you can see

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.210 
back to the one-piece now as you can see
that<00:02:21.280> suit<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:21.970> very<00:02:22.240> light<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:23.650> is<00:02:23.800> isn't<00:02:24.040> it

wasn't using so you get good wear out of

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.870 
wasn't using so you get good wear out of
it<00:05:56.169> as<00:05:56.290> well<00:05:56.470> which<00:05:56.650> absolutely<00:05:57.280> yeah<00:05:57.580> you're

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
are one two and three class PFDs which

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.260 
are one two and three class PFDs which
are<00:06:23.830> suitable<00:06:24.190> wrong<00:06:24.729> we<00:06:24.880> don't<00:06:25.030> want

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
are suitable wrong we don't want

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.969 
are suitable wrong we don't want
anything<00:06:25.510> loose<00:06:25.900> whilst<00:06:26.530> we're<00:06:26.710> traveling

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:26.979 
anything loose whilst we're traveling

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:28.140 
anything loose whilst we're traveling
along<00:06:27.099> 100

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
along 100

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.610 
along 100
yep<00:06:28.420> so<00:06:28.600> what<00:06:28.780> we're<00:06:28.960> looking<00:06:28.990> for<00:06:29.500> is

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
yep so what we're looking for is

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.380 
yep so what we're looking for is
something<00:06:29.800> that's<00:06:29.950> tight-fitting<00:06:30.730> yep

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.390 
something that's tight-fitting yep

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.450 
something that's tight-fitting yep
I'll<00:06:31.690> see<00:06:31.900> it<00:06:31.960> snug<00:06:32.260> like<00:06:32.740> something<00:06:33.190> a<00:06:33.250> water

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
I'll see it snug like something a water

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.640 
I'll see it snug like something a water
skier<00:06:33.760> might<00:06:34.000> wear<00:06:34.240> absolutely<00:06:34.990> so<00:06:35.320> we<00:06:35.470> don't

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
skier might wear absolutely so we don't

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:36.750 
skier might wear absolutely so we don't
want<00:06:35.800> anything<00:06:36.010> flapping<00:06:36.460> around<00:06:36.550> in<00:06:36.700> the

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.760 
want anything flapping around in the

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.340 
want anything flapping around in the
wind<00:06:36.880> yes<00:06:37.420> so<00:06:37.570> that's<00:06:37.720> why<00:06:37.930> we<00:06:38.110> look<00:06:38.260> at

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
wind yes so that's why we look at

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.930 
wind yes so that's why we look at
something<00:06:38.560> like<00:06:38.680> this<00:06:39.010> which<00:06:39.190> has<00:06:39.370> a<00:06:39.400> zip<00:06:39.730> and

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:39.940 
something like this which has a zip and

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.780 
something like this which has a zip and
also<00:06:40.510> the<00:06:40.660> velcro<00:06:40.870> line<00:06:41.260> is<00:06:41.470> very<00:06:42.100> important

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:42.790 
also the velcro line is very important

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.940 
also the velcro line is very important
that<00:06:42.850> it<00:06:43.000> has<00:06:43.030> two-way<00:06:43.630> effect<00:06:44.380> of<00:06:44.530> holding<00:06:44.710> us

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:44.950 
that it has two-way effect of holding us

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.770 
that it has two-way effect of holding us
tight<00:06:45.190> we<00:06:45.370> okay<00:06:45.910> so<00:06:45.970> a<00:06:46.060> bit<00:06:46.180> like<00:06:46.210> a<00:06:46.330> dirt<00:06:46.570> blow
