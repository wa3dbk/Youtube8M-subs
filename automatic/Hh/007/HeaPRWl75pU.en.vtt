00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.890
 the favorite garment of all jeans 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.540
 let's see what are the ideals for 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.639
 each type of body and also what 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.499
 have to have for this season not 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.660
 they are going to lose him I am chantal and 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:19.660
 this is risk your life to wear 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.439
 these are some washed-out jeans that 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.720
 they are going to cover up in many stores because 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.970
 They come very fashionable right now but I do not know 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.440
 worry that if they do not find 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.790
 pending of my programs because 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.730
 soon we will make some 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.110
 igualitos only jeans to arrive 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.059
 or less at the waist so you 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.100
 they are all types of body since the 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.110
 hides in the belly and the little witches 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.059
 the sides is a straight cut though 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.460
 I decided to fold it so it can still be seen 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.890
 more original I put it on with a shirt 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.809
 of pictures tied but you can 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.940
 use the one that has either stamped 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.400
 pictures or even stripe still motion 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.839
 I'm wearing a white shirt underneath though 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.720
 if they like to be seen a little bit 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.150
 the perfect navel use the thin given 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.700
 a large bag to use during the 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.290
 day and shoes vehicles that had already 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.360
 commented on the last program that 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.100
 they returned and still more of these that 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.170
 have the metal tip or even the 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.299
 tip even in another color my 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.430
 accessories are bracelets in different 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.130
 colors and patterns and I'm ready 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.369
 from to go to breakfast shopping at 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.730
 movies to take a good ice cream let's go to the 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.750
 following 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.740
 ah 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.740
 now 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.479
 I change sides and now I bring some 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.280
 much more basic jeans is the typical 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.630
 color of the denim so if not 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.520
 you have some jeans I still 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.320
 would advise to buy ones like these 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.149
 since they are going to take advantage of it a lot because 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.000
 perform them in the afternoon or evening 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.549
 so these are some jeans with 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.580
 Different cut of butko cuts or cut 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.520
 cowboy that looks great because stage 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.899
 the boot or the shoe this type of jeans 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.420
 it favors people who have 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.460
 more hip or big thighs since what 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.390
 which makes the cut below is lengthen 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.459
 fabrics 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.590
 I want to use it with a white shirt 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.390
 This shirt has the success that gives it more 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.790
 fun to my look but you could 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.739
 use it with the shirt you have a 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.239
 This vest if I recommend it buy 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.670
 they are going to take advantage of it a lot 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.069
 autumn-winter is a warm vest 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.099
 They could use some beige or some coffee 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.440
 Have a big bag with shoes 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.930
 platform that if you are going to have a very day 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.840
 active are ideal since it allows them 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.690
 walk and be comfortable my accessories 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.480
 only a ring and a bracelet 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.930
 golden and so you can go perfect to 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.939
 eat to throw the gossip with 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.319
 what remains and what you think if now 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.319
 we see an option for the night 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.659
 and this is a look for the night are about 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.730
 jeans type leggings are very tube 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.650
 then they favor people with 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.469
 Thin legs is one more color 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.329
 dark ideal for the floor again this 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:10.889
 it's a white basic shirt with what 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.079
 benefited with the one that surely the 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:14.670
 they have and a jacket the jacket is the 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.549
 touch of colors of a jacket very 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.319
 flashy and shine and a small bag 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.319
 since during the night we opted for 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.900
 small bags or handbags shoes 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.120
 of black patent leather and as an accessory this 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.359
 necklace is a very striking necklace in 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.359
 neon pink and so we can follow I do not know 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:35.639
 to a meeting at a party or any 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.379
 event in which something so 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.760
 formal since this is still elegant 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.760
 but it's a little more house 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.750
