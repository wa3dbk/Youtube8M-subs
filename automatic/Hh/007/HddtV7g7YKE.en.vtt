00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:08.470
 now let's see how to multiply 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:10.910
 two-digit numbers between 90 and 99 is 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.400
 the fastest way to find the 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.070
 result in this group of numbers 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:21.160
 specific we are going to see it for example 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:25.230
 let's start with the number 90 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.230
 for 93 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:32.470
 with the trick or with the technique that we're going 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.470
 to study they can do it in 5 seconds 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.370
 Let's see 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.490
 good let's solve what 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.520
 the technique in the next 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:49.170
 let's take 100 as a reference how much you 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:53.000
 missing 93 to get to 100 7 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:58.050
 how much is 90 to get to 110 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:04.150
 very well now in a cross way 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:08.800
 93 - 10 83 not very well 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:12.730
 and 90 minus 7 also matches 83 what 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.400
 which gives us the first 2 numbers for 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.600
 the first two figures of the result 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.500
 the following figures are obtained 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:27.120
 easily only multiplying 10 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:27.120
 by 7 or 70 that is the result 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.950
 incredibly fast 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.710
 But let's go to 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.130
 do other operations with others 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.690
 numbers of the same characteristics 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.480
 so they can see how easy it is 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:52.979
 As you know how to do it I will hurry 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:54.950
 the rhythm for example the number 92 x 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.909
 97 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.630
 the result which would be very good to 97 him 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:06.200
 3 missing to reach 100 and 92 it 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.340
 lack cross-8 is now 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:15.050
 we know the following 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:19.460
 92 - 3 89 the same goes out 97 minus 8 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:23.170
 ok 89 is the first number the second 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:28.580
 number or the following two figures 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:32.740
 of the result would be 8 by 324 this is the 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.740
 result that we were looking for 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.980
 and another example more 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.819
 well let's delete this the other example that 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:49.870
 let's show them consists of the 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:52.489
 numbers 91 x 98 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:57.219
 quickly what is the result how much 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:59.569
 lacks 98 to get to 102 to 91 9 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:04.400
 91 22 89 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:07.280
 98 - 9 89 means that 89 are the 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.010
 first two figures of the result 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.349
 primitive forgiveness that is 89 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.500
 are the first two figures of 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:19.810
 result 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.500
 ok the second ones would be 9 for 2 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.780
 18 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.780
 this is the final result 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.760
 last let's give you one more example 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.340
 one more example 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.550
 of easy multiplication in 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:45.670
 two figures from 90 to 99 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:48.110
 suppose we have a 95 by 92 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.819
 quickly this one is missing 8 for 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.739
 reach 100 or this one is missing 5 for 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:57.319
 get to 195 minus 8 87 does it mean the 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:01.030
 first numbers 87 and the second of the 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:04.129
 series 5 by 840 this is the result 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:07.180
 quickly what do you think about nothing else 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:09.780
 learn will surprise your friends 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.780
 bye
