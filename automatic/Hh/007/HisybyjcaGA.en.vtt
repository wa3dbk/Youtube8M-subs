00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.700
 it's personal it 's just that musical popcorn already 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:11.160
 not only of storekeeper of the year and the father then 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.929
 Dad's shopkeeper was released with the dark 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.940
 side books this year he the book I 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.560
 I really liked it and it's there all serelepe 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.060
 content and over time I 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.590
 I realized that some people did not have 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.150
 very tanned the reading experience 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.769
 of the book and I was not understanding that 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.930
 was likely to trust and I had found 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.090
 super cool end so i started some 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.380
 discussions in forums and everything else and I 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.330
 I realized that people have a 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.250
 very different understanding of the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.380
 The end is that the people who fight do not 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.750
 anyway whenever I was fighting and people who 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.969
 shines as you only pay 10 will make one 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.920
 spoilers with respect to whom 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.360
 do not like this kind of detail in 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.340
 reviews they find out there obviously 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.739
 I'll signal when the spoilers 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.960
 start but if you are the ones you like 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.579
 of jumping video a little bit can 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.170
 fall a spoiler then take a peek 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.300
 in the video description will have the time 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.800
 right where it begins and where it ends 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.140
 area of coimbra is full of logistics 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.750
 We have an incredible player called 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.000
 davi is a professor of literature and 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.710
 is specialized in a lost paradise of 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.340
 1 thousand for those who do not know the book 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.189
 citizen was published in 1667 in ten 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.110
 songs and poetically tells the fall 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.729
 of man through the temptation of Adam and 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.619
 eva by light was what caused the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.570
 expulsion from enem or living a 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.729
 character a little bitter enough this 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.549
 bark have difficulty coping with the 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.110
 his wife but has a facility 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.509
 to connect with the daughter until the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.340
 if you are 12 years old, I work there 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.259
 receives the visit of a woman whom he 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.180
 calls a woman thin because she does not 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.640
 with the name and it already arrives 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.920
 quoting lost paradise and offers to 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.840
 he work is a trip that he 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.909
 would have to do to venice in the next 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.740
 days to witness a phenomenon that 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.689
 help her boss a kind of 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.700
 mission and he then decides to leave 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.710
 this trip that takes the daughter June and there 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.810
 they prepare a very very 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.820
 sinistra if it were me I grew up running in the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.860
 hour but the bug actually picks up when 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.240
 he separates himself from his daughter he puts 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.460
 head that he has to rescue her 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.159
 at all costs whether the unit is the 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.110
 marriage to the soul his life whatever 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.149
 on the surface of the shopkeeper a story 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.320
 a psychological thriller but 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.690
 under rain 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.520
 buys a really cool story about a 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.500
 neighborhood that defies one's beliefs 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.090
 to try to save his daughter from 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.160
 claws of hell are not always 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.290
 sensible but always in a passionate way 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.450
 while reading we get more in 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.610
 The book is already narrated by 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.709
 he but he is opening doors to 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.060
 few and bring back memories that help 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.440
 people to compose a little more 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.420
 some of his personality 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.310
 Year features and father because I 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.380
 I found it very interesting to share 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.480
 with you, he does not wrap it up 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.190
 really goes straight to the point has a 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.840
 scene at the beginning of the book as it is 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.850
 airplane coming out to see it and he's 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.070
 talking face and suddenly dying 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.900
 ceni is already in venice and everything that is not 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.390
 necessary to understand the history of 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.190
 between the cuts and this is cool because 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.170
 seeing the story ahead something else 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.360
 which is also due to these cuts 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.489
 Sick the parent is that the book has a rhythm 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.620
 quite frantic david not for him 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.810
 has a deadline to comply 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.790
 then the whole story if it gets a 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.680
 short period of days and something else 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.870
 very cool is that in this devil book 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.850
 There is no way for a moment. 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.800
 looks like the devil figure that people 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.110
 is accustomed to see he always speaks 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.000
 with david through someone's body and 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.680
 if you look between the lines a beautiful 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.940
 metaphor to say that evil is 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.890
 inside the people 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.630
 do not wait for moments that full of 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.370
 horror movies involving the April 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.170
 terror where it will tighten between the lines 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.880
 I like this expression because I think 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.040
 that literature is more engaging 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.500
 when she says something and the message in the 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.420
 between lines reinforces that he does this in 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.970
 various parts of the book and it scares 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.220
 quite the devil's perspective trapped 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.540
 a person I love and persuade myself to 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.940
 do what he wants by using the 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.489
 of his wiles more of the 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.010
 that simply an anna hollywood scene 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.660
 from a demonic cabal possession to 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.820
 people talking against the dripping soup 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.130
 Pound knows it only shocks me not 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.019
 It convinces sushi, though. 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.269
 I mean that the mother's family 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.519
 father who is not bad because if it were he would have 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.200
 right since but not it goes undermining the 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.820
 person he loves the most in this world. 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.010
 his daughter and when it involves 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.019
 creates guy I know has no father in 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.940
 world wanted differently 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.890
 now let's go to the spoiler zone and I 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.840
 I have a little piece of paper that she will not 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.000
 the end of the video so if you want there 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.130
 just this part of spoilers click here 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.430
 to continue 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.050
 at the right time without fear of tomorrow 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.030
 First of all I know that there are three types 

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.890
 of readers are watching this video here 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.510
 What I do not accept is the end, what you accept 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.370
 The end is here to see what is 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.390
 not my spoiler work just wants to know 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.070
 Why the hell is not he talking? 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.680
 so when I finished reading the book 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.150
 feel that the end was mass but the network 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.950
 last chapter to see if you had 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.390
 let anything happen 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.790
 because to feel that everything was enough 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.250
 and when I did this re-reading I 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.260
 until I found a former machine in history but 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.330
 which did not change my perception of the 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.890
 book as a whole david's journey 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.840
 with this stop of the demons and such 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.850
 begins when he talks to his wife 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.890
 lean for the first time she has a 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.480
 different smell and the 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.610
 enough to quote the lost paradise 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.230
 to get his attention she was 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.210
 apparently disappeared in the plot after 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.430
 But it returns in the end and people 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.920
 understands that she is relieved by the 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.690
 better you were trying to stay active until 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.850
 It is better to negotiate if what he 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.740
 I wanted with him to Ellen who is a friend of 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.750
 die a few pages before she turns 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.640
 a kind of angel in the story she says 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.860
 betrayal brand woman said the duty to 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.170
 boarding a specific train from 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.060
 to hired in their proof that they 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.950
 history and work attesting the same 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.860
 smell of the thin woman for having 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.530
 I spend so much time with her and I believe 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.640
 he says in the end it would be a test 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.620
 prolator that deivid believe now 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.600
 in his hell after all that he 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.520
 happened the same well wins no 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.410
 necessarily a non-audi- 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.670
 necessarily also what happens 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.920
 with the desire to achieve the goal 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.120
 of him and not with his presence 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.550
 if you are the type that prefers a 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.410
 more effective conclusion I found more 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.210
 two theories for you simpler is 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.340
 who even died and it's all a head thing 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.650
 of his that is shaken by the divorce 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.870
 with the loss of the daughter and begins to mix 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.670
 reality with all that he has already 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.710
 studied the paradise lost since 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.390
 probably he knows more about it 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.340
 than the city where you live and a 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.590
 The more stretch theory involves the right to 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.210
 To doubt that the best has a daughter's soul. 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.710
 he can really bring her out of 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.230
 back that everything is just a 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.090
 manipulation and the best then release it 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.610
 to find even in training and when 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.650
 David speaks I believe this would be a 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.660
 His response is that he 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.620
 finally believes in the devil but 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.970
 unless he has 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.860
 it does not matter what it will cost 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.960
 I say she would have more criticism because 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.820
 involves believing that evil always wins 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.770
 and the love and the right attitudes or 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.419
 always win any of these 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.490
 I really think that 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:36.350
 it is not that end from the father 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.540
 is very open and gives you the possibility of 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.880
 several interpretations the line between 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.410
 reality insanity blurred but I think 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.090
 that this is one of the beauties of the 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.889
 spoilers ending I guess 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.260
 It's important to note that this video has no 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:49.910
 intention to teach anyone about nothing 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.680
 the book or interpret it for 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.110
 You're not even really worth the intention. 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.699
 share my understanding of the

 spoilers 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.139
 I really liked the writing of Pedro. 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.419
 I downloaded a very interesting book. 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:07.400
 because it has scenes so really 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:09.740
 This thing 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.479
 subtleties of the pan more psychological or 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.280
 that attracts me a lot in history the book 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:15.169
 it's not very thick you end up talking 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.000

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:19.460
 have the opportunity to read the book and 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.229

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:33.320
 demoniac to catch all the time 

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.389
 while reading the worn sides all the 

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.120

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:38.960

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.430
 speed bump 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.440
 I already talked so much about the camcorder and 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:45.110
 mainly this crazy question of the 

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.030
