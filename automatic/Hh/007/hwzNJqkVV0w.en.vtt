hi then alec from vacuumspot just

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.139 
hi then alec from vacuumspot just
showing<00:00:06.529> you<00:00:06.680> how<00:00:06.710> to<00:00:06.830> fix<00:00:07.129> a<00:00:07.279> lack<00:00:07.759> of<00:00:07.939> suction

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:08.149 
showing you how to fix a lack of suction

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.379 
showing you how to fix a lack of suction
on<00:00:08.480> your<00:00:08.750> Volta<00:00:09.139> you<00:00:09.469> 18:51<00:00:10.430> now<00:00:11.210> this

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
on your Volta you 18:51 now this

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:12.940 
on your Volta you 18:51 now this
particular<00:00:11.690> machine<00:00:12.230> has<00:00:12.259> been<00:00:12.500> brought<00:00:12.799> in

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
particular machine has been brought in

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:20.650 
particular machine has been brought in
for<00:00:13.160> that<00:00:13.280> exact<00:00:13.639> reason<00:00:18.880> it's<00:00:19.880> straining<00:00:20.480> and

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
for that exact reason it's straining and

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.820 
for that exact reason it's straining and
it<00:00:21.020> has<00:00:21.199> zero<00:00:21.980> suction<00:00:23.320> most<00:00:24.320> of<00:00:24.560> these<00:00:24.650> little

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
it has zero suction most of these little

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.160 
it has zero suction most of these little
bagless<00:00:25.279> machines<00:00:25.699> are<00:00:25.939> very<00:00:26.330> much<00:00:26.869> the<00:00:27.019> same

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
bagless machines are very much the same

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.470 
bagless machines are very much the same
very<00:00:27.470> easy<00:00:27.680> to<00:00:27.830> fix<00:00:28.039> but<00:00:28.849> let's<00:00:29.090> just<00:00:29.269> have<00:00:29.420> a

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
very easy to fix but let's just have a

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.979 
very easy to fix but let's just have a
bit<00:00:29.630> of<00:00:29.660> a<00:00:29.779> look<00:00:30.789> first<00:00:31.789> place<00:00:32.119> I'm<00:00:32.419> going<00:00:32.870> to

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
bit of a look first place I'm going to

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.390 
bit of a look first place I'm going to
be<00:00:33.080> seeing<00:00:33.379> is<00:00:33.680> that<00:00:33.710> the<00:00:34.100> filter<00:00:34.760> which<00:00:35.269> is

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
be seeing is that the filter which is

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.000 
be seeing is that the filter which is
placed<00:00:37.400> here<00:00:37.900> that's<00:00:38.900> not<00:00:39.049> really<00:00:39.110> clean<00:00:39.769> but

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
placed here that's not really clean but

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.180 
placed here that's not really clean but
you<00:00:40.040> can<00:00:40.370> see<00:00:40.699> I<00:00:41.030> mean<00:00:41.870> there's<00:00:42.080> bits<00:00:42.350> of<00:00:42.530> bits

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
you can see I mean there's bits of bits

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.469 
you can see I mean there's bits of bits
and<00:00:43.280> pieces<00:00:43.489> there<00:00:43.790> but<00:00:43.970> that<00:00:44.120> wouldn't

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:44.479 
and pieces there but that wouldn't

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:46.930 
and pieces there but that wouldn't
totally<00:00:44.900> stop<00:00:45.409> your<00:00:45.559> suction<00:00:45.769> we<00:00:46.460> will<00:00:46.640> clean

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
totally stop your suction we will clean

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.079 
totally stop your suction we will clean
that<00:00:46.970> or<00:00:47.299> possibly<00:00:47.690> replace<00:00:48.080> it<00:00:48.820> let's<00:00:49.820> have<00:00:50.030> a

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
that or possibly replace it let's have a

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:53.530 
that or possibly replace it let's have a
look<00:00:50.269> the<00:00:50.780> next<00:00:51.080> filter<00:00:52.150> you<00:00:53.150> do<00:00:53.269> find<00:00:53.510> a

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
look the next filter you do find a

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.880 
look the next filter you do find a
pillar<00:00:53.720> and<00:00:53.839> that's<00:00:53.989> not<00:00:54.199> really<00:00:54.500> good<00:00:54.710> I'm

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
pillar and that's not really good I'm

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.920 
pillar and that's not really good I'm
probably<00:00:55.699> going<00:00:56.059> to<00:00:56.150> want<00:00:56.330> to<00:00:56.360> change<00:00:56.659> that

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
probably going to want to change that

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.259 
probably going to want to change that
although<00:00:57.369> if<00:00:58.369> you<00:00:58.519> get<00:00:58.699> that<00:00:58.820> early<00:00:59.089> enough

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
although if you get that early enough

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.619 
although if you get that early enough
you<00:00:59.420> can<00:00:59.629> wash<00:00:59.869> it<00:00:59.900> but<00:01:00.890> still<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:02.180> be<00:01:02.299> honest

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
you can wash it but still to be honest

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.429 
you can wash it but still to be honest
it's<00:01:02.809> not<00:01:02.869> too<00:01:03.290> bad<00:01:04.960> let's<00:01:05.960> have<00:01:06.170> a<00:01:06.200> look

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
it's not too bad let's have a look

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:13.660 
it's not too bad let's have a look
inside<00:01:09.280> and<00:01:10.280> here's<00:01:11.000> our<00:01:11.180> problem<00:01:12.190> okay<00:01:13.220> just

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
inside and here's our problem okay just

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:37.649 
inside and here's our problem okay just
clean<00:01:13.940> that<00:01:13.970> up

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.350 

now<00:01:38.659> these<00:01:38.840> things<00:01:39.729> these<00:01:40.729> are<00:01:40.970> in<00:01:41.060> most

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
now these things these are in most

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.020 
now these things these are in most
bagless<00:01:42.250> machines<00:01:43.250> they're<00:01:43.520> just<00:01:43.700> a<00:01:43.820> very

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
bagless machines they're just a very

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.200 
bagless machines they're just a very
simple<00:01:44.330> plastic<00:01:44.780> filter<00:01:45.440> and<00:01:45.650> the<00:01:46.400> idea<00:01:46.790> is<00:01:46.970> is

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
simple plastic filter and the idea is is

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.180 
simple plastic filter and the idea is is
that<00:01:47.240> you<00:01:47.990> know<00:01:48.110> having<00:01:48.409> this<00:01:48.619> perforated

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
that you know having this perforated

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.950 
that you know having this perforated
here<00:01:49.340> means<00:01:49.580> it<00:01:49.759> will<00:01:49.850> stop<00:01:50.149> most<00:01:50.450> material

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
here means it will stop most material

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.840 
here means it will stop most material
but<00:01:51.080> not<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.290> fine<00:01:51.500> dust<00:01:51.740> so<00:01:52.490> anything<00:01:52.820> that

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
but not the fine dust so anything that

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.639 
but not the fine dust so anything that
gets<00:01:53.060> through<00:01:53.390> this<00:01:53.540> ends<00:01:53.899> up<00:01:54.020> on<00:01:54.170> your<00:01:54.409> foam

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
gets through this ends up on your foam

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.490 
gets through this ends up on your foam
filter<00:01:55.159> or<00:01:55.670> in<00:01:56.030> your<00:01:56.180> HEPA<00:01:56.330> filter<00:01:56.780> but<00:01:57.380> you

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
filter or in your HEPA filter but you

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.219 
filter or in your HEPA filter but you
need<00:01:57.680> to<00:01:57.830> pay<00:01:57.979> attention<00:01:58.009> to<00:01:58.490> this<00:01:58.670> guy<00:01:59.229> clean

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
need to pay attention to this guy clean

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.870 
need to pay attention to this guy clean
that<00:02:00.409> out<00:02:00.440> every<00:02:00.830> time<00:02:01.009> you<00:02:01.190> empty<00:02:01.759> the

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
that out every time you empty the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.880 
that out every time you empty the
machine<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:02.630> your<00:02:02.810> performance<00:02:03.140> will<00:02:03.770> be

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
machine and your performance will be

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.639 
machine and your performance will be
drastically<00:02:04.310> improved<00:02:05.140> over<00:02:06.140> what<00:02:06.289> we<00:02:06.440> just

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
drastically improved over what we just

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.279 
drastically improved over what we just
saw<00:02:06.860> then<00:02:07.600> so<00:02:08.600> I'm<00:02:08.720> just<00:02:08.869> going<00:02:09.020> to<00:02:09.110> quickly

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
saw then so I'm just going to quickly

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:20.330 
saw then so I'm just going to quickly
clean<00:02:09.709> this

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.830 

that's<00:02:21.340> not<00:02:21.670> actually<00:02:22.030> cleaning<00:02:22.330> very<00:02:22.629> well

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
that's not actually cleaning very well

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.449 
that's not actually cleaning very well
so<00:02:23.410> what<00:02:23.650> we're<00:02:23.800> going<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:23.980> do<00:02:24.069> is<00:02:24.190> replace

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
so what we're going to do is replace

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.330 
so what we're going to do is replace
that<00:02:25.349> there's<00:02:26.349> no<00:02:26.560> point<00:02:26.860> if<00:02:27.069> it's<00:02:27.250> not

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
that there's no point if it's not

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.070 
that there's no point if it's not
becoming<00:02:28.239> clean

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
becoming clean

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.930 
becoming clean
there's<00:02:29.620> no<00:02:29.860> point<00:02:30.099> continuing<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.760> try

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
there's no point continuing to try

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.490 
there's no point continuing to try
because<00:02:31.300> after<00:02:31.599> a<00:02:31.629> while<00:02:31.690> material<00:02:32.349> gets

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
because after a while material gets

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.430 
because after a while material gets
embedded<00:02:32.890> deep<00:02:33.340> into<00:02:33.640> those<00:02:33.790> grooves<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.440> you

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
embedded deep into those grooves and you

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.640 
embedded deep into those grooves and you
just<00:02:35.650> want<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.860> get<00:02:36.010> a<00:02:36.069> good<00:02:36.310> result<00:02:37.650> fine

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
just want to get a good result fine

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.800 
just want to get a good result fine
filter<00:02:38.980> just<00:02:39.849> make<00:02:40.090> sure<00:02:40.239> it<00:02:40.330> sits<00:02:40.510> nice<00:02:40.780> and

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
filter just make sure it sits nice and

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.839 
filter just make sure it sits nice and
smooth<00:02:41.319> inside<00:02:41.709> then<00:02:42.840> close<00:02:43.840> that<00:02:45.480> same<00:02:46.480> here
