00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.810
 hello to all of you today 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.650
 I will make you a very simple tutorial 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.140
 it's going to be changing a fire 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.800
 crossing on a clio 3 so first 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.630
 thing to do is the hood so 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.160
 it's a simple tutorial that fast 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.680
 done but he who still asks for a 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.680
 certain skill with his hands what 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.160
 you'll see it's very restricted to 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:51.690
 passage level to work with 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:54.360
 the hand so we open the hood on a 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.550
 clio iii phase iii that I do more 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.079
 early so if we look at the back of 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.969
 optics 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.039
 we have a first cash here 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.600
 there behind the washer tank 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.180
 so that 's going to be for the fires of 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.170
 cross the position lights and we have a 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.640
 second cache on his right 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.830
 this one has 1 that the little tongue 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.950
 at the end of my finger so that's the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.640
 crossover so it's hiding 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:24.780
 we will remove once we removed the 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.030
 hide a hen's hiding 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.540
 behind the first thing to do is 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.560
 to disconnect his connection 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.409
 you are what the coste looks like 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.789
 Because of the year that's chicken 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.359
 so to remove it in fact have to shoot 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:44.869
 on files rearwardly those of 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:49.189
 clips without forcing too much 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:52.020
 then we will come and take the hen year 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:55.700
 have seized the pellet of their hen and we 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:03.770
 pulls back it comes without forcing 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:05.750
 and I'm trying to get it out here is my pool 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.039
 so this one 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.670
 it's a light bulb it's an ax 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.150
 wish nash is this one it's a 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.819
 hatchet 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.970
 now we take the new 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.010
 light bulb so a hatchet is seized 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.690
 the same by the base especially it is necessary not 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.150
 touch the green allow impurities 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.459
 it's because otherwise she's going 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.400
 grilling prematurely and put the 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.310
 deceptive so here as we see around 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.010
 cerons officiate the key we have but 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:42.260
 upwards then we lead in hens 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:44.609
 in place like you hand over 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.579
 as I said we mix deceivers 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:49.290
 up and we can look through 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.829
 optics to see if we position 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.829
 well in hen 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.500
 then he'll have to reel is slow 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.480
 hen with her 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.660
 the phase I'm filming 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.660
 there is the phase that will side hen 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.510
 and the two ergo so here at the end of my 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.180
 finger and on the other side it caesar or there 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:20.990
 you have to orient them horizontally 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.990
 so I put it up like these 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.720
 once lacoste is installed on the 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.810
 hen 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.910
 that's what it's all about 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.070
 hear the clips when we push back the 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.230
 qos for good clip that in hens in 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.890
 do that's what keeps the hen in 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.300
 his housing 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:48.540
 I do not know if we'll see the camera 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:51.570
 then we omit the rubber cash 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.910
 with the tongue 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:58.260
 motor side that this will have more 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:00.600
 simple if a day and needs cash and 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.480
 of course we check the good 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.519
 operation of the dipped beam 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.459
 replaced so it seems to work 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.720
 the operation is over I hope that 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.940
