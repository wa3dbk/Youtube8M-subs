i<00:01:21.840> don't<00:01:22.650> really<00:01:22.799> like<00:01:23.280> big<00:01:23.820> bags<00:01:24.060> because<00:01:24.330> i

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
i don't really like big bags because i

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.109 
i don't really like big bags because i
have<00:01:24.810> nothing<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.380> put<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.650> big<00:01:25.830> bags<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
bags don't always look as nice because

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.580 
bags don't always look as nice because
they're<00:01:29.040> basically<00:01:29.460> empty<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.470> just
