the<00:00:24.920> first<00:00:25.190> time<00:00:25.340> I<00:00:25.400> heard<00:00:25.490> of<00:00:25.610> Pantone<00:00:26.150> was

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
the first time I heard of Pantone was

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.830 
the first time I heard of Pantone was
when<00:00:26.930> I<00:00:26.960> was<00:00:27.230> designing<00:00:27.650> for<00:00:28.040> Prince<00:00:28.580> and<00:00:29.000> I

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
when I was designing for Prince and I

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.240 
when I was designing for Prince and I
discovered<00:00:30.350> how<00:00:30.530> I<00:00:30.560> needed<00:00:30.860> these<00:00:30.980> little

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
discovered how I needed these little

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.300 
discovered how I needed these little
paper<00:00:31.430> chips<00:00:31.850> to<00:00:32.210> do<00:00:32.360> anything<00:00:33.040> don't<00:00:34.040> give<00:00:34.220> us

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.310 
paper chips to do anything don't give us

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.730 
paper chips to do anything don't give us
color<00:00:34.490> form<00:00:34.910> it<00:00:35.270> gives<00:00:35.480> shape<00:00:35.750> system

organization<00:00:37.520> to<00:00:37.760> color<00:00:38.150> and<00:00:38.990> we<00:00:39.140> all<00:00:39.290> need

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
organization to color and we all need

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.790 
organization to color and we all need
color<00:00:39.920> for<00:00:40.160> everything<00:00:41.020> color<00:00:42.020> is<00:00:42.230> infinite

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
color for everything color is infinite

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.650 
color for everything color is infinite
you<00:00:43.220> can<00:00:43.400> always<00:00:43.640> split<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.210> difference

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
you can always split the difference

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.960 
you can always split the difference

on the streets and pointed the cap and
