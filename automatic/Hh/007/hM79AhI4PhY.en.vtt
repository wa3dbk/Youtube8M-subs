00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.180
 hello my club about a new out came back 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.420
 alain 324 rc2 to 327 rc2 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.220
 which will replace there 222 human activity recedes vertical 

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:14.339
 who is over 20 years old now 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:19.189
 and then there at 322 which was also a horizontal handle recoil with a 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.769
 design a bit more because they occupy mandate something 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.900
 thursday m 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.740
 so for those who do not know the patella rustic is very nice 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.169
 specific 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:30.399
 unlock 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:32.100
 the handle 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.070
 with germany who is here 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.480
 and you find the position you want in a few words 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.140
 there we see that the device is heavily loaded 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.500
 see it in all positions 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.970
 and in the specific case of these models 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.340
 bellegarde 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.760
 no problem either to support it three and a half pounds on the lot 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.620
 model less than 324 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.840
 but in addition you have just below here to adjustment of cause of friction 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.880
 stadium athur text 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.310
 that's tightening 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.280
 the more obviously you will be 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.860
 skepticism to release the handle in the cluster constantly having 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.360
 some sudden movements when wanting to let go 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.580
 we are not obliged to this info all the time 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.760
 but with a relatively light fiction 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.120
 some of them were accurate 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.080
 we feel that the camera what his daughter 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.160
 so to release the fast turntable you have if a lever that is 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.780
 locked by a little snack below 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.140
 so 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.870
 we can surprise with a finger or even with a single finger if we want that 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.790
 guys very easily 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.600
 this security 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.610
 the jet can stay in position to block it like that or poor we 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.010
 do not have to have to 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.470
 to manipulate the island which he knows when we come 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.070
 put the camera 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.540
 now we will see a little worry 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.510
 three fast boats this one 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.700
 with this organization they will allow to drink 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.820
 the strength to hunt though this week it's 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.560
 that's happiness 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.160
 the lyrics are written 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
 so make sense to put these next sessions a week 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.209
 on the other hand 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:16.469
 on a tripod collar 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.249
 and then start 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:22.249
 no what happens when we come back here he continues 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.499
 his camera our clothes are related 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:28.429
 and therefore not why for its part 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:31.179
 concert 

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:34.179
 coutras by a small stream 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:38.889
 of tourcoing 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.929
 and after we play left 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:43.979
 me as you can see i just born 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:46.329
 the path of fast here is 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.129
 and therefore the flow and are sometimes quite alone you have to move a little bit 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:50.790
 possibly to tighten 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.989
 for that these hearings 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.549
 that's a bit of a shame it's the same for the input model of 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:56.620
 range
