helpful was the list about look at what

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.760 
helpful was the list about look at what
problem<00:00:34.780> the<00:00:34.870> other<00:00:34.989> person<00:00:35.320> could<00:00:35.440> have<00:00:35.470> and

problem the other person could have and

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.440 
problem the other person could have and

how are you going to need a solution to

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.900 
how are you going to need a solution to
those<00:00:37.690> problems<00:00:37.950> which<00:00:38.950> kind<00:00:39.280> of<00:00:39.340> takes<00:00:39.520> the

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
those problems which kind of takes the

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.819 
those problems which kind of takes the
audience<00:00:40.180> focus<00:00:40.809> just<00:00:41.260> on<00:00:41.410> a<00:00:41.470> more<00:00:41.680> concrete

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
audience focus just on a more concrete

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.680 
audience focus just on a more concrete
level<00:00:42.309> I'm<00:00:42.610> not<00:00:42.910> just<00:00:43.090> saying<00:00:43.210> well<00:00:43.420> yeah<00:00:43.629> you

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
level I'm not just saying well yeah you

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.000 
level I'm not just saying well yeah you
should<00:00:43.929> engage<00:00:44.050> with<00:00:44.289> the<00:00:44.350> other<00:00:44.469> person<00:00:44.890> well

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
should engage with the other person well

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.439 
should engage with the other person well
you<00:00:45.129> can<00:00:45.250> engage<00:00:45.399> in<00:00:45.609> a<00:00:45.670> lot<00:00:45.820> of<00:00:45.910> ways<00:00:46.059> but<00:00:46.329> this

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
you can engage in a lot of ways but this

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.240 
you can engage in a lot of ways but this
is<00:00:46.539> actually<00:00:46.660> something<00:00:46.949> really<00:00:47.949> concrete

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
is actually something really concrete

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.220 
is actually something really concrete
and<00:00:48.489> how<00:00:48.579> to<00:00:48.640> do<00:00:48.850> it<00:00:48.969> just<00:00:49.600> having<00:00:49.960> something

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
and how to do it just having something

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.750 
and how to do it just having something
structured<00:00:50.890> that<00:00:51.010> you<00:00:51.100> can<00:00:51.219> actually<00:00:51.370> not

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
structured that you can actually not

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.660 
structured that you can actually not
only<00:00:52.710> think<00:00:53.710> through<00:00:54.010> they'll<00:00:54.190> actually<00:00:54.309> work

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
only think through they'll actually work

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.650 
only think through they'll actually work
through<00:00:55.120> an<00:00:55.359> experiment<00:00:56.019> with<00:00:57.089> so<00:00:58.089> it's<00:00:58.420> kind

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
through an experiment with so it's kind

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.840 
through an experiment with so it's kind
of<00:00:58.690> the<00:00:58.809> whole<00:00:58.929> process<00:00:59.170> and<00:00:59.670> this<00:01:00.670> is

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
of the whole process and this is

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.489 
of the whole process and this is
definitely<00:01:00.999> going<00:01:01.269> to<00:01:01.359> inform<00:01:01.719> how<00:01:02.170> I<00:01:02.199> think

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:02.499 
definitely going to inform how I think

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:04.439 
definitely going to inform how I think
about<00:01:02.710> that<00:01:02.859> and<00:01:03.010> in<00:01:03.309> a<00:01:03.399> big<00:01:03.519> way<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:04.239> key

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
about that and in a big way the key

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.060 
about that and in a big way the key
thing<00:01:04.480> I<00:01:04.750> think<00:01:04.839> that<00:01:05.140> the<00:01:05.379> session<00:01:05.560> is<00:01:05.830> to

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
thing I think that the session is to

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.120 
thing I think that the session is to
help<00:01:06.700> people<00:01:06.790> to<00:01:07.150> unlock<00:01:07.750> that<00:01:07.930> value<00:01:08.200> and<00:01:08.650> to

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
help people to unlock that value and to

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.830 
help people to unlock that value and to
think<00:01:09.340> about<00:01:09.640> their<00:01:09.850> experience<00:01:10.480> and<00:01:10.720> what

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
think about their experience and what

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.060 
think about their experience and what
they<00:01:10.960> offer<00:01:11.110> either<00:01:11.380> person<00:01:11.800> who<00:01:11.860> was<00:01:11.950> an

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
they offer either person who was an

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.520 
they offer either person who was an
organization<00:01:12.640> differently<00:01:13.360> but<00:01:14.230> then<00:01:14.380> also

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
organization differently but then also

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.370 
organization differently but then also
to<00:01:15.240> infuse<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.360> whole<00:01:16.570> session<00:01:16.840> with<00:01:17.140> very

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
to infuse the whole session with very

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.560 
to infuse the whole session with very
practical<00:01:18.130> steps<00:01:18.549> so<00:01:18.790> that<00:01:18.820> it's<00:01:19.090> clear<00:01:19.540> to

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
practical steps so that it's clear to

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.050 
practical steps so that it's clear to
people<00:01:19.869> what<00:01:20.680> the<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.399> steps<00:01:21.640> are<00:01:21.759> what<00:01:21.939> the

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
people what the the steps are what the

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.240 
people what the the steps are what the
process<00:01:22.360> is<00:01:22.570> to<00:01:22.810> go<00:01:22.960> through<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.649> the<00:01:24.040> session

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
process is to go through and the session

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.240 
process is to go through and the session
runs<00:01:24.490> along<00:01:24.909> a<00:01:24.939> pitch<00:01:25.659> process<00:01:25.930> P<00:01:26.290> I<00:01:26.320> TCH<00:01:27.009> and

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
runs along a pitch process P I TCH and

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.819 
runs along a pitch process P I TCH and
each<00:01:27.340> is<00:01:27.579> a<00:01:28.000> different<00:01:28.570> step<00:01:29.290> in<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:29.619> process

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
each is a different step in the process

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.039 
each is a different step in the process
it<00:01:30.520> was<00:01:30.670> great<00:01:30.820> i<00:01:30.939> thought<00:01:31.299> it<00:01:31.420> was<00:01:31.540> it<00:01:31.840> was

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
it was great i thought it was it was

really good it was I love the I love the
space<00:01:36.990> good<00:01:37.990> length<00:01:38.229> of<00:01:38.439> time<00:01:38.649> it<00:01:38.950> was<00:01:39.130> kind<00:01:39.340> of

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
space good length of time it was kind of

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.490 
space good length of time it was kind of
long<00:01:39.850> enough<00:01:40.119> to<00:01:40.329> get<00:01:40.509> into<00:01:40.780> something<00:01:41.409> and

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
long enough to get into something and

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440
