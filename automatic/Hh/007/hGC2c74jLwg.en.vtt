00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.066
Load the Piercing reference included with HDT 
Body v1.3+

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:34.033
Load your piercing mesh

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:46.033
Name the outfit Appropriately

00:00:46.033 --> 00:01:06.033
Proceed with moving your mesh onto the blocks

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:18.033
I chose to unselect connected vertices mode to 
move both sets of rings together

00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:43.033
The green circle is the nipple, the red circle is 
the extended nipple/aerola

00:01:43.033 --> 00:01:49.033
You'll want to have the ring slightly above the 
surface of the box and centered for 'perfect' 
positioning

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Now time to add correct weighting for HDT Body 
(or TBBP)

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000
First delete the unnecessary Clavicle and Spine 
weights

00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:51.033
Make sure you copy the Bone weights for Each 
mesh in the Mesh tab!

00:04:00.066 --> 00:04:04.066
Now just go to Slider -&gt; Conform All!

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.033
Make sure to check your sliders and double 
check it's all in working order.

00:04:36.066 --> 00:04:53.066
Make adjustments if you need to and make sure 
you save the adjustments!

00:05:20.033 --> 00:05:24.033
Grab your save as data for the project

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:50.033
Make sure you uncheck 'Automatically copy 
reference'!

00:05:50.033 --> 00:06:09.066
Outfit Studio crashes sometimes, but don't 
worry your files were still saved!
