00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.400 
going to plant them about a foot apart
all<00:00:58.020> through<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.680> area<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.600> next<00:01:00.600> spring

strawberries and so when you want to get

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.380 
strawberries and so when you want to get
too<00:01:07.890> crowded<00:01:08.159> they<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:08.670> don't<00:01:08.850> bare<00:01:09.120> much

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
too crowded they just don't bare much

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.640 
too crowded they just don't bare much
anymore<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:12.920> that's<00:01:13.920> pretty<00:01:14.460> much<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.880> story

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
anymore and that's pretty much the story

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.530 
anymore and that's pretty much the story
you<00:01:16.650> just<00:01:16.860> carefully<00:01:17.400> dig<00:01:17.790> them<00:01:17.970> up<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.330> then

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
digging strawberry plan out we're going

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.400 
digging strawberry plan out we're going
to<00:02:11.470> send<00:02:11.740> these<00:02:11.950> plants<00:02:12.580> to<00:02:12.880> about<00:02:13.810> one<00:02:14.080> foot

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
to send these plants to about one foot

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.570 
to send these plants to about one foot
for<00:02:14.830> a<00:02:15.040> one<00:02:15.880> per<00:02:16.090> square<00:02:16.390> foot<00:02:17.580> because

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
for a one per square foot because

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.040 
for a one per square foot because
they're<00:02:18.970> too<00:02:19.120> crowded<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.750> they're<00:02:19.930> not

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
they're too crowded and they're not

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.130 
they're too crowded and they're not
going<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.470> do<00:02:21.340> so<00:02:22.090> much<00:02:22.980> growing<00:02:24.360> or<00:02:25.360> producing

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
going to do so much growing or producing

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.460 
going to do so much growing or producing
the<00:02:26.200> strawberries<00:02:26.770> anyway<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:28.330> so<00:02:28.540> we<00:02:28.660> try<00:02:29.440> to

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
the strawberries anyway and so we try to

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.080 
the strawberries anyway and so we try to
get<00:02:29.709> as<00:02:29.830> much<00:02:30.010> root<00:02:30.310> out<00:02:30.520> as<00:02:30.700> we<00:02:30.850> can<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:33.090> then

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
get as much root out as we can and then

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.640 
get as much root out as we can and then
we're<00:02:34.209> going<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.390> plant<00:02:34.660> those<00:02:34.900> plant<00:02:35.440> these

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
we're going to plant those plant these

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.930 
we're going to plant those plant these
and<00:02:36.400> same<00:02:36.910> same<00:02:37.480> ratio<00:02:37.959> one<00:02:38.260> one<00:02:39.160> per<00:02:39.400> foot<00:02:39.640> and

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
and same same ratio one one per foot and

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.570 
and same same ratio one one per foot and
hopefully<00:02:42.940> these<00:02:43.420> will<00:02:43.480> produce<00:02:43.900> better<00:02:44.020> and

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
hopefully these will produce better and

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.190 
hopefully these will produce better and
the<00:02:45.580> new<00:02:45.730> ones<00:02:45.940> will<00:02:46.150> produce<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:48.989> keeps<00:02:49.989> on

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
the new ones will produce so keeps on

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.880 
the new ones will produce so keeps on
moving<00:02:51.989> now<00:02:52.989> when<00:02:53.230> you<00:02:53.350> plant<00:02:53.680> the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
moving now when you plant the

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.830 
moving now when you plant the
strawberries<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:55.420> plant<00:02:55.840> them<00:02:56.110> right<00:02:57.810> up<00:02:58.810> to

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
strawberries you plant them right up to

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.860 
strawberries you plant them right up to
the<00:02:59.380> there's<00:03:00.010> a<00:03:00.130> kind<00:03:00.820> of<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:01.000> place<00:03:01.360> between

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
the there's a kind of a place between

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.490 
the there's a kind of a place between
the<00:03:02.080> root<00:03:02.320> and<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.790> stem<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.480> you<00:03:04.959> try<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.290> get

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
the root and the stem and you try to get

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.039 
the root and the stem and you try to get
that<00:03:05.650> level<00:03:06.100> with<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.370> ground<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:07.750> put<00:03:07.780> them

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
that level with the ground you put them

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.180 
that level with the ground you put them
too<00:03:08.200> low<00:03:08.440> it<00:03:08.830> will<00:03:08.920> rot<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.400> head<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:11.190> area

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
too low it will rot the head that area

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.680 
too low it will rot the head that area
where<00:03:12.340> all<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.670> leaves<00:03:12.850> are<00:03:13.090> coming<00:03:13.269> out<00:03:13.540> at

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
where all the leaves are coming out at

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.229 
where all the leaves are coming out at
the<00:03:13.780> bottom<00:03:14.010> it'll<00:03:15.010> rock<00:03:15.190> that<00:03:15.489> and<00:03:15.790> if<00:03:16.120> you

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
the bottom it'll rock that and if you

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.500 
the bottom it'll rock that and if you
put<00:03:16.450> them<00:03:16.570> too<00:03:17.470> high<00:03:17.799> it<00:03:18.670> drives<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.269> roots

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
put them too high it drives the roots

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.440 
put them too high it drives the roots
and<00:03:19.750> they'll<00:03:19.930> die<00:03:20.110> so<00:03:21.100> it's<00:03:21.549> fairly<00:03:22.120> critical

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
and they'll die so it's fairly critical

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.470 
and they'll die so it's fairly critical
