fun<00:04:02.310> we<00:04:03.310> version<00:04:03.760> works<00:04:03.970> well<00:04:04.270> but<00:04:04.600> the<00:04:05.200> 361<00:04:05.950> is

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
fun we version works well but the 361 is

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.740 
fun we version works well but the 361 is
really<00:04:06.490> responsive<00:04:07.090> this<00:04:07.210> is<00:04:07.330> good

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
really responsive this is good

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.410 
really responsive this is good
oh<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:10.690> once<00:04:10.840> again<00:04:11.020> I'd<00:04:11.410> be<00:04:11.440> raised<00:04:11.890> score<00:04:12.420> by

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
oh and once again I'd be raised score by

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.229 
oh and once again I'd be raised score by
1500<00:04:14.350> points<00:04:14.530> that's<00:04:15.160> like<00:04:15.370> what<00:04:15.640> they<00:04:15.820> are<00:04:15.880> in

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
1500 points that's like what they are in

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:25.790 
1500 points that's like what they are in
your<00:04:16.359> store<00:04:16.720> one<00:04:17.140> there

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.800 

and<00:04:26.220> I<00:04:26.310> assume<00:04:26.580> that<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.819> ps3<00:04:27.300> version<00:04:27.330> was

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
and I assume that the ps3 version was

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.290 
and I assume that the ps3 version was
identical<00:04:28.289> so<00:04:29.129> there<00:04:29.280> you<00:04:29.370> have<00:04:29.400> it<00:04:29.490> ps3<00:04:29.819> and

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
identical so there you have it ps3 and

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.029 
identical so there you have it ps3 and
360<00:04:30.449> together<00:04:31.080> holding<00:04:31.500> hands<00:04:31.740> like<00:04:31.860> the

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
360 together holding hands like the
