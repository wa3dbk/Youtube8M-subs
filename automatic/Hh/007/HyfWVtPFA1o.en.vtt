00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
really helps the resale value the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.049 
really helps the resale value the
biggest<00:00:41.160> problem<00:00:41.550> with<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.000> never

pretty<00:02:33.040> awesome<00:02:33.220> experience<00:02:33.989> I've<00:02:34.989> had<00:02:35.050> other

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
pretty awesome experience I've had other

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.229 
pretty awesome experience I've had other
trips<00:02:35.680> where<00:02:35.860> I<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:36.160> tried<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.760> ride<00:02:37.030> my

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
trips where I I tried to ride my

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.360 
trips where I I tried to ride my
motorcycle<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:38.230> this<00:02:38.380> waterfall<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.310> I

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
motorcycle to this waterfall that I

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.130 
motorcycle to this waterfall that I
thought<00:02:39.670> would<00:02:39.820> be<00:02:39.880> like<00:02:40.390> really<00:02:40.600> easy<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:40.989> get

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
thought would be like really easy to get

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.920 
thought would be like really easy to get
to<00:02:41.290> but<00:02:41.590> turned<00:02:42.250> out<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.519> be<00:02:42.700> really<00:02:43.630> difficult

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
to but turned out to be really difficult

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.650 
to but turned out to be really difficult
to<00:02:44.290> get<00:02:44.410> to<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:45.970> it's<00:02:46.090> kind<00:02:46.330> of<00:02:46.360> about<00:02:46.600> my

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
to get to and so it's kind of about my

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.290 
to get to and so it's kind of about my
struggle<00:02:47.320> to<00:02:48.070> get<00:02:48.190> to<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:48.430> waterfall<00:02:48.940> and

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
struggle to get to this waterfall and

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.590 
struggle to get to this waterfall and
got<00:02:50.170> some<00:02:50.319> good<00:02:50.470> shots<00:02:50.500> there<00:02:50.830> too<00:02:51.239> so<00:02:52.239> you

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
got some good shots there too so you

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.240 
got some good shots there too so you
really<00:02:52.930> put<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.290> bike<00:02:53.470> through<00:02:53.860> its<00:02:54.010> paces

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
really put the bike through its paces

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.690

turtle place or like the waterfall then
I<00:05:45.770> usually<00:05:45.950> put<00:05:46.250> all<00:05:46.430> those<00:05:46.580> videos<00:05:46.940> into<00:05:47.180> a

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
I usually put all those videos into a

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.659 
I usually put all those videos into a
playlist<00:05:48.020> so<00:05:48.440> if<00:05:48.590> people<00:05:48.710> want<00:05:49.040> to<00:05:49.130> watch<00:05:49.310> a

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
playlist so if people want to watch a

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:51.430 
playlist so if people want to watch a
longer<00:05:50.270> video<00:05:50.419> they<00:05:50.810> can<00:05:50.990> just<00:05:51.140> watch<00:05:51.290> the

longer video they can just watch the

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.290 
longer video they can just watch the
playlist<00:05:51.860> and<00:05:52.010> it<00:05:52.100> automatically<00:05:52.700> goes<00:05:52.970> to

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
playlist and it automatically goes to

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.969 
playlist and it automatically goes to
the<00:05:53.780> next<00:05:54.020> video<00:05:54.260> they<00:05:54.380> can<00:05:54.530> watch<00:05:54.680> them<00:05:54.890> all
