worthless affected people to do it at
one<00:05:13.830> time<00:05:13.860> I<00:05:14.520> would<00:05:15.029> have<00:05:15.150> thought<00:05:15.360> investors

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
one time I would have thought investors

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.809 
one time I would have thought investors
and<00:05:16.110> people<00:05:16.169> was<00:05:16.710> only<00:05:16.979> a<00:05:17.009> stamp<00:05:17.339> for<00:05:17.610> best

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:17.819 
and people was only a stamp for best

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:20.839 
and people was only a stamp for best
practice<00:05:18.389> but<00:05:18.900> now<00:05:19.139> I<00:05:19.169> think<00:05:19.379> the<00:05:19.919> younger

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849 
practice but now I think the younger

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:23.929 
practice but now I think the younger
generation<00:05:21.389> actually<00:05:21.839> look<00:05:22.080> for<00:05:22.439> proof<00:05:23.339> that

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:23.939 
generation actually look for proof that
