00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.069
 today I will again bake in an 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:10.199
 So I have not planned anything 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.360
 I'll just show you like me 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:14.580
 You will be able to decorate my pie 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.310
 any cake soil and lie arbitrarily 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.200
 Every cream filling is there 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.539
 Going a little faster today 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.320
 I just want you to times like you 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.600
 then you can decorate a cake 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.680
 I know that , I have always been 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.879
 my floor with juice or coffee a then 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.109
 it always tastes better 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:39.420
 Today I have a light filling 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:41.640
 taken the course has itself 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.039
 I will tell you something about this 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.649
 also last longer, namely a 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:50.460
 very easy fulfillment which I very much 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:53.219
 likes to like and I love bananas in one 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.670
 pie was it is not me planned 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.979
 just let my ideas run free 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.120
 leave and you can just watch 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:06.110
 I did not need to be great here 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.110
 explain that you already see 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.490
 I will become a light pie 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.430
 Of course no cream to take 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.160
 spread my actions but simply 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.500
 the filling you have prepared and 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.630
 then give the cake for about half an hour 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.479
 hour chocolate with 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.670
 strawberry flavor with cream for melting 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:49.430
 brought chocolate with strawberry flavor 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:51.740
 you 'll find yourself deeper at pah then 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.190
 Just the sides nice and smooth again 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.190
 to brush 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.570
 the pages will be my pie then 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.429
 very light with strawberry chocolate 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.429
 So maybe not only brush 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.170
 give the pies apparently for about one 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.170
 half an hour in the kitchen 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:34.310
 and then I'll just go with strawberry here 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.310
 pulling chocolate circles 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:50.819
 then you can just use one 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:53.360
 toothpicks so take off the motive 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.360
 takes 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.350
 refrigerate 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.870
 and then the pie decorated and finished 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.730
 chilled out i hope the recipe 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.640
 I like you, I still have cream 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.800
 filling and hoarding bode usual and with it 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.830
 I will then come up with something more 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.320
 the pie is now cold and me 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.750
 I still have cake soil left over 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.100
 I've done too much, I believe 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.660
 I'll make chocolate with it now 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.060
 I do not want them either 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.540
 throw away and I'll just go now 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.100
 let's try to make something out of it 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.000
 Just let me surprise you 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.000
 hand me over 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.450
 the remaining floors just small 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.530
 cut and with the cream what me 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:01.560
 No matter if the chocolate or 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.500
 here white cream is filled 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.590
 that looks beautiful was with me and 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.630
 then this will just be in chocolate 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:14.160
 Simply I have here 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:17.280
 chocolate with a bit of milk or 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.940
 cream you can take to melt 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:25.470
 brought and which then it simply in 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:27.450
 Coconut shaving does not make you so inventive 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.910
 like I said I'm not a dream of 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.919
 wegschmeiÃŸen and taste which determines 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.919
 I have never tasted delicious 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.370
 No cream filling left 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.710
 I have these simply with marzipan 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.350
 and nougat stuffed I have 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.300
 Users had at home was in marzahn 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.580
 I then put some pistachios in it 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.340
 given and I can well imagine 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.100
 that it tastes so delicious 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.550
 and of course just like that 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:12.729
 just dip it into chocolate 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:16.400
 and grated coconut simply roll 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:19.660
 Sprinkle congregational about I order 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.250
 also knows which now with marzipan and 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.580
 which without was that then natural 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.830
 a fiction in last minute 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.620
 throw it away because I'm not in 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.740
 I had to find something quickly 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.620
 start where you are with me 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.900
 means the recovery from I hope that 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.849
 you also like this recipe you like 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.830
 must not now make use of the residues 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:45.530
 You can do that just like that 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.389
 So just bake a cake 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.699
 a look and then in square 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.830
 either you can cut the buffalo 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:54.919
 or not touched these are the ones 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.500
 I filled with marzipan and nougat 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:01.300
 which I then with my remaining 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.300
 cream filling has filled
