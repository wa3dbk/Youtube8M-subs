and<00:00:36.450> not<00:00:36.899> using<00:00:37.380> primers<00:00:37.850> but<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:39.210> my<00:00:39.390> clients

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
and not using primers but on my clients

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.979 
and not using primers but on my clients
I<00:00:40.079> definitely<00:00:40.770> have<00:00:41.100> been<00:00:41.309> using<00:00:41.989> typical

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
I definitely have been using typical

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.020 
I definitely have been using typical
primers<00:00:43.710> like<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:45.020> Smashbox<00:00:46.020> primer<00:00:46.140> or<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
primers like the Smashbox primer or the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.750 
primers like the Smashbox primer or the
original<00:00:48.629> Mac<00:00:48.840> skin<00:00:49.170> base<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.399> was<00:00:50.579> really

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
original Mac skin base so I was really

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.459 
original Mac skin base so I was really
excited<00:00:51.300> when<00:00:51.329> they<00:00:51.570> came<00:00:51.719> out<00:00:51.870> with<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.199> one

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
excited when they came out with this one

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.220 
excited when they came out with this one
because<00:00:52.680> it's<00:00:53.449> definitely<00:00:54.449> more<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.050> a

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
because it's definitely more of a

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.740 
because it's definitely more of a
hydrating<00:00:55.860> primer<00:00:56.160> but<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:57.030> also<00:00:57.300> good<00:00:57.719> for

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
hydrating primer but it's also good for

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.740 
hydrating primer but it's also good for
all<00:00:58.020> skin<00:00:58.050> types<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:59.760> if<00:00:59.789> you<00:01:00.149> have<00:01:00.270> oily<00:01:00.719> skin

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
all skin types so if you have oily skin

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.810 
all skin types so if you have oily skin
it's<00:01:01.440> gonna<00:01:01.559> help<00:01:01.829> kind<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.160> calm<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.670> soothe

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
it's gonna help kind of calm and soothe

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.840 
it's gonna help kind of calm and soothe
the<00:01:02.850> oils<00:01:03.379> but<00:01:04.379> another<00:01:04.949> big<00:01:05.220> thing<00:01:05.430> about<00:01:05.580> it

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
the oils but another big thing about it

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.660 
the oils but another big thing about it
is<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.060> it's<00:01:06.890> gonna<00:01:07.890> leave<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.220> skin<00:01:08.460> with<00:01:08.640> a

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
is that it's gonna leave the skin with a

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.080 
is that it's gonna leave the skin with a
really<00:01:09.119> nice<00:01:09.330> healthy<00:01:09.930> glow<00:01:10.700> it's<00:01:11.700> super

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
really nice healthy glow it's super

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.870 
really nice healthy glow it's super
lightweight<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.869> doesn't<00:01:12.900> really<00:01:13.409> have<00:01:13.740> that

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
lightweight it doesn't really have that

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.050 
lightweight it doesn't really have that
tacky<00:01:14.880> feel<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> lot<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.840> primers<00:01:16.259> do<00:01:16.610> so<00:01:17.610> I

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
tacky feel that a lot of primers do so I

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.570 
tacky feel that a lot of primers do so I
have<00:01:18.869> noticed<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.619> wear<00:01:19.770> time<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.340> not

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
have noticed that the wear time is not

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.580 
have noticed that the wear time is not
as<00:01:20.880> good<00:01:21.150> as<00:01:21.390> some<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> other<00:01:21.900> ones<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:22.560> I

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
as good as some of the other ones but I

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.310 
as good as some of the other ones but I
definitely<00:01:23.130> like<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:24.420> has<00:01:24.659> caffeine<00:01:24.990> in

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
definitely like that it has caffeine in

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.320 
definitely like that it has caffeine in
it<00:01:25.619> which<00:01:25.830> helps<00:01:25.860> kind<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.520> soothe<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.119> calm

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
it which helps kind of soothe and calm

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.929 
it which helps kind of soothe and calm
the<00:01:27.540> skin<00:01:28.100> I've<00:01:29.100> been<00:01:29.250> using<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.610> for<00:01:29.640> about<00:01:29.820> a

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
the skin I've been using it for about a

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.609 
the skin I've been using it for about a
week<00:01:30.150> now<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.479> I've<00:01:30.750> definitely<00:01:30.960> noticed<00:01:31.290> a

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
week now and I've definitely noticed a

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.219 
week now and I've definitely noticed a
difference<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.189> my<00:01:32.759> skin<00:01:33.270> quality<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.049> doesn't

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
difference in my skin quality it doesn't

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.819 
difference in my skin quality it doesn't
seem<00:01:34.560> as<00:01:34.740> dry<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.720> I<00:01:36.720> try<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.259> wear<00:01:37.409> as<00:01:37.560> little

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
seem as dry and I try and wear as little

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.560 
seem as dry and I try and wear as little
makeup<00:01:38.220> as<00:01:38.369> possible<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.090> do<00:01:39.210> get

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
makeup as possible but I do get

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.780 
makeup as possible but I do get
occasional<00:01:40.140> breakouts<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.920> generally<00:01:41.549> wear

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
occasional breakouts so I generally wear

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.870 
occasional breakouts so I generally wear
powder<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.680> this<00:01:43.680> has<00:01:43.860> been<00:01:44.100> really<00:01:44.729> nice

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
powder and this has been really nice

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.200 
powder and this has been really nice
under<00:01:45.329> my<00:01:45.450> Studio<00:01:45.810> Fix<00:01:46.049> powder<00:01:46.670> that<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.729> wear

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
under my Studio Fix powder that I wear

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.289 
under my Studio Fix powder that I wear
pretty<00:01:48.509> much<00:01:48.720> on<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.899> daily<00:01:48.960> basis<00:01:49.759> it<00:01:50.759> does<00:01:51.060> lay

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
pretty much on a daily basis it does lay

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.560 
pretty much on a daily basis it does lay
really<00:01:51.600> nicely<00:01:51.990> under<00:01:52.640> liquids<00:01:53.640> as<00:01:53.850> well<00:01:54.119> but

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
really nicely under liquids as well but

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.660 
really nicely under liquids as well but
I<00:01:54.780> definitely<00:01:55.590> have<00:01:55.710> been<00:01:55.829> liking<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.399> with

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
I definitely have been liking it with

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.160 
I definitely have been liking it with
powder<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.810> better<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.939> think<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.600> if<00:02:00.960> you're

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
powder is better I think that if you're
