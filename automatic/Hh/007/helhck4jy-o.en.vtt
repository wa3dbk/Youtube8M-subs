00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.420
 hello all weeks oddly enough 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.179
 continues and therefore continues our 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.470
 stands video about book adaptations 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.900
 today we want to tell you about 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.640
 books that you would love to see 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.680
 on the screens 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.350
 probably most likely if someone is very 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.510
 well all of course the first thing this 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.390
 the book is a protocol of the dream I already give you 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.990
 all ears buzzed for nevertheless it 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.180
 detective 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.140
 this is a love story this is a note 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.840
 traveler 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.500
 This is basically some kind of adventure. 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.350
 not on the head and on everything else 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.110
 less this is exactly what should be on 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.800
 large screens although of course the meters for 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.120
 a large amount that the director can all 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.180
 pereinach and it will be 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.449
 full it 's impossible to watch but 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:02.870
 no less the main role I have preferred 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:05.369
 julia roberts i see her starring 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.430
 chance on screen from my point of view 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.950
 has works of juliet and worked 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.900
 this is a continuation of the story romeo giulietta 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.200
 twenty first century or rather their 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.930
 descendants who must break the evil 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.180
 vicious circle of curses and again here 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.340
 there is an asset here is a love affair 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.990
 here are the traveler notes here 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.580
 there are again such adventures and 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.500
 I think it is too 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.200
 perfect book and perfect script 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.689
 which must be filmed proceeding 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.930
 from what may be interesting to the viewer 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.960
 I made such a strange choice 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.270
 but this trilogy of burrow roberts keys 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.490
 First of all, you can earn extra money on 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.930
 three films if itâ€™s good to take them off 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.409
 the second is to see what you need and 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.649
 among 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.049
 This is a story about three goddesses who can 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.299
 from bed like three girls from behind the railing 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.159
 century and this will be one of those rare 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.490
 cases when the whole world 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.920
 saves only 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.960
 and women also I would love to 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.450
 watched the film shot in Ukrainian 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.200
 works of three coins still and others 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.899
 amenities 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.959
 and girls see glasses and not about adventures 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.670
 in the school of magic guess what we are 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.650
 such already heard and prominent 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.560
 who knows where then why not 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.989
 repeat moreover this book is based 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.940
 on Slavic folklore and therefore will 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.220
 closer to us in spirit 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.500
 and I would love to see 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.090
 the film is based on the book theater history 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.080
 arthur sola monova 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.470
 it tells about the life of the theater and 5 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.569
 our life wedges a lot well 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.000
 described and discharged from such heroes 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.519
 history places around to just proper 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.910
 everything and the main thing is theirs 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:49.209
 it seems very well you can beat on 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.730
 the screen besides this is a super sleep book and 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.519
 the film is very relevant nowadays and in 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.549
 This book has a place and vanity and 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.530
 desire to put oneself above everything and everyone 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.920
 and desire to play 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:06.250
 god on earth is not about the masks that are worn 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.829
 even the righteous but hypocrites and 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.140
 here intrigue and crave all the same in 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.299
 banal power hiding behind the good 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.570
 intentions understandable besides 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:19.900
 there is also a place of love from love 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.359
 still very blind love here such 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.850
 here we have books turned out and we have them 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.769
 in principle, really would like to 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.769
 watch these movies on these books 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.720
 but then again we really 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:35.530
 fear that as a director 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:38.590
 fantasy can beat it all 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.250
 book separately all too 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.079
 can beat well in general we want 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.090
 and do not want such films 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:49.150
 at the same time tell me whether you have 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.519
 favorite book you just crave 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.330
 see on screen them really 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.490
 love 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.050
 squeeze the killing days my book on the screen 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.640
 and construction and comments below 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.530
 fell down our channel 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.600
 but while we are with you panda say thank you 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.330
 Great for all the attention of a good day and 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.600
 great mood and hope to new 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.600
 meeting
