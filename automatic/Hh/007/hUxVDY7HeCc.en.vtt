00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:04.129
 preventive maintenance on your vehicle is the best option. 

00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:07.129
 way to avoid problems especially for your pocket 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.549
 My executioner in the TV always practical stage know why 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.059
 with the improper use of the vehicle as well as the evidence route corrections of 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.360
 passageway to increase the premature wear of the initial phase 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.300
 which compromises credibility to save on fuel and also 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.320
 the essential basic safety services for the vehicle 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.730
 contributes to a fuel station because he could not 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.160
 do the repair 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.470
 also increases safety in day-to-day use by ensuring that the 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.340
 appreciation at the time of the exchange now know the main state services 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.960
 can not fail to perform 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.719
 happily balancing 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.550
 you know different regions the alignment and balancing placement 

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:49.769
 because the suspension system and the first 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.339
 exposed to a normal wear process in accordance with the conditions of 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:54.480
 vehicle use 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.440
 ensure a longer tire life than the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.900
 passengers as mobile presence balancing 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.070
 Eli really the balance between rebel accounts 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.670
 it needs to be done 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.070
 every living being 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.670
 I have my mind planning he organized the degree of opening kisses 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.670
 within the route according to this government 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.710
 alves gartner leaps on tip 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.340
 I to my mind 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.670
 direction when you are out of your dream 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.590
 3 when you lost the first game 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.710
 and it should be done every 7 thousand I did not see 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.280
 are recommended by manufacturing 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.280
 pierre professionals go take care of it is to calibrate the car tires once per 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.200
 Each week, each vehicle has a specific number that must be respected for 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.240
 the calibration is not more than the value specified by the manufacturer 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.900
 driver avoidance deviations too much that has its 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.700
 impaired performance beyond its shortened lifespan 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.870
 space function the function of the suspension of your car and the 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.909
 steerability stability 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.880
 besides providing comfort to passengers 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.650
 like this 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.400
 the suspension is responsible for resolving the irregularities of the ground one 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.419
 apple for example 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:17.639
 causes the wheel to move up and down without drastically changing the 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.019
 bodywork the car suspension was built 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.669
 with several components that integrate the very efficient system for generation 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:28.599
 this safety skill in driving the car 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.160
 suspension system 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.309
 in the fundamental vehicle 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:34.149
 now cut a vehicle 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:37.709
 the increase over April if not stop with the industry as a whole 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.589
 the question are lovers of the springs both teams of benfica and sporting 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:43.959
 came back 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.069
 however makes a suspension delivery is a vehicle 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.419
 for greater durability comfort and safety should be 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.349
 both in the city and on the road 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.639
 with regard to prior maintenance 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:57.899
 about door 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:59.690
 and it's still the cheapest 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.849
 you have to stay between 20 and 40 thousand 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.689
 every suspension contest with shock absorbers 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:08.419
 so in the launching of saw 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:11.209
 with two more accidents can happen 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.069
 the brake system version 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.359
 it is impossible to check whether 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.109
 the patients who also want to 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.330
 maintenance of the car's brake system 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.589
 is one of the cheapest to make 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:25.429
 because it has an excellent cost-benefit ratio 

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:27.849
 the brake system is very important 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:28.790
 suddenly he 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.149
 he has to be checked 

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:32.659
 carried out every 10,000 kilometers 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.839
 now you will know more about the importance 

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:39.839
 the prosecution over time the eye of the motorcycle road should be 

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:43.190
 discussed said that the main lubricant characteristic 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.390
 who is charged with making the eye stay longer and wearing the 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.200
 tristan contact parts within the motu perina viscosity the friction may 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.320
 compromise the operation of the engine and thus the service life, in addition to 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.879
 the performance that greatly increase consumption 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.109
 many people who love 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:01.970
 to just complete the level of the river 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.679
 today it's recommended to look completely 

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:08.709
 if it is not replaced today it is but only coming to an end since, in addition to 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.439
 lubricate it also has the function of eliminating certain beginning of this 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:13.259
 convulsion 

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:14.779
 the burning of fuel 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:18.060
 this compromises the viscosity causing problems in the motorcycle 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.600
 to find out which is the correct notation for your vehicle see the 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.000
 owner's manual for maintenance is 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.259
 expire 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:29.479
 talk about keeping an eye on this party made on a motorcycle 

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:31.580
 because each car 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.389
 won off the ground 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.009
 it is worth remembering that even with the whole group it must also be the consumption of 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:37.460
 oil 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.199
 so level monitoring is required for any car 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.819
 regardless of the type of fuel used than the time of use 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.870
 you must also check the electronic injection system 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.500
 with the rapid evolution of car engines 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.080
 the starter carburetor ferry can not meet the needs of the new 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.340
 vehicles with regard to the emission of 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.840
 fuel savings can be 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.350
 quick responses to accelerations and many other benefits for the 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.600
 engine and its economic view and do not contaminate the environment 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.990
 environment they need received perfect fuel air mixture 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:13.499
 in all ranges of rotation 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:18.049
 electronic injection systems has this feature ie it allows 

00:05:18.049 --> 00:05:21.749
 the driver only volumes of fuel he needs you 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:24.520
 want to see and speak what is very popular to be 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.210
 but requires maintenance 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.939
 and preventive maintenance is the winter for every 20 thousand young people 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:31.710
 It's coming 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.129
 so your country 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:36.599
 for those who will travel, it is recommended to do a general review of the v 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:39.710
 the goal is to avoid problems in a period when most people 

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:42.289
 You really do want to be in good spirits. 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.990
 the rate at which it was arriving 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.749
 to exemplify 

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:53.229
 and here we do that review and if there is not any repair we do the 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:54.879
 repair immediately 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:58.949
 for these reasons as the bbc caravan recommends the periodic maintenance in the 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:02.189
 your vehicle was a French selection in the use of 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:04.050
 special equipment 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.289
 specialized professionals who make an assessment of the 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:08.410
 correct 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.570
 she was quietly preserved prey
