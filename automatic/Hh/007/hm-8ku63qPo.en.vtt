00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hello, I have my passion today 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.560
 favorites for the april for you and 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.360
 I really have so many in april 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.010
 people I do not know 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.110
 Why, but I have it somehow 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.820
 finally enjoyed the weather 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.789
 it was a bit milder and you got so 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.430
 Whole people could wear the open 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.050
 because often it is so great 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.570
 super fast and that's why I had to 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.310
 Winter always matches up here too 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.250
 go and still scarf and gloves 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.619
 and cap and anyway and anyway 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.739
 now it's finally so warm 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.540
 that I at least wool coats or too 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.950
 The thinner mental can easily carry 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.570
 open and there I have some but 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.640
 one who does not like to wear 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.140
 has and I also very many 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.840
 I did not get compliments 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.750
 would have thought because I find it so in 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.230
 my head is her son fifty fifty the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.629
 this neoprene coat and that is now 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.539
 So I do with my city 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.280
 would not say that longer than it does now 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.589
 Short coat but also no cellar 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.590
 maxi length and what I hold especially 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.600
 just think this fabric is it 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.540
 really so neoprene fabric and that is 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.520
 also without straight cut and has 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.100
 two bags what you think is really great 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.590
 I cramp the ever so a coloring book because 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.380
 he is so gray or black lining 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.990
 behind and so beautiful stitching behind 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.549
 So it just looks super cool 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.100
 So a little balloon goes out for me 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.140
 and just has something very very modern 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.299
 and especially if, like me more like 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.130
 simple clothes and history 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.650
 he then lifts somehow 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.180
 the whole on totally and me 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.060
 forgetting to say where he is here 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.079
 I was born of rompuy 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.700
 every day without exception my absolute 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.229
 spring bag so I think so 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.570
 find if this bag is not spring 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.610
 Summer writes then no one else does 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.170
 namely the stories of another is the 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.180
 is from last year and 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.759
 I ran after a very long time 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.540
 and she always wanted to give it up 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.100
 as i button 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.590
 the first time she saw that she believed 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.180
 I lookbook in the last spring or 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.880
 so showed and i found that made me so 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.420
 a picnic basket or something like that reminds you 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.520
 emi super sweet actually you would now 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.080
 not all my style because it is 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.300
 already very playful and I have 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.489
 usually rather simple classic 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.220
 and especially black things wear and 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:27.780
 This hell of brown do cognac do it 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.790
 is really something different and somehow 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.430
 I'm almost more beautiful now 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.120
 just moment and that is vegan 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.040
 leather 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.450
 I do not know if it still exists 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.360
 maybe someday dress circles 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.010
 or so yes me and the super super nice 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.590
 because everything fits in well what you 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.519
 So somehow my glasses are needed 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.319
 my portmonee lipsticks everything 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.380
 possible and should rooted times 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.600
 away update doing yes I think that 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.370
 just super super cool and you can 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.080
 I also wear the straps I wear them 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.600
 always can cross over and also so 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.730
 wear or as gossip so I think 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.280
 just now for spring 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.269
 awesome and the third favorite in things 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.320
 fashion are my two newcomers and the 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.180
 has been here for the past 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.340
 had videos somehow around and I like 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.170
 very very happy I'm used to 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.820
 not so the silver person but been 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.410
 now so you can see also Sun 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.299
 both poor men also has in my 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.269
 i like to wear gold and silver 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.450
 mixed and these rings are from here 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.160
 a designer who is called madeleine 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.769
 and I somehow found quite cool is 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.019
 So geometric shape was that's what 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.459
 very simple but somehow 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.890
 not too bad either 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.990
 just a band like that 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.660
 somehow also something on it but not around 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.090
 bring this view to sound off at 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:49.530
 I loved music this month 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:52.080
 to hear janet jackson's 90s music 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.830
 I love the music of her and what I love 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.380
 heard up and down is the more 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.959
 So that's just how it works for me 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.270
 so full of the spring song and so targeted 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.640
 but at some point can sing along nicely and 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.830
 You can hear that in minute in the car 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.350
 or somehow fitting just go 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.340
 super nice and calms somehow 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.720
 make a good mood 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.670
 my last favorite is a youtube 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.100
 channel writes me in the comments 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.200
 if you are in the month always a youtube 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.030
 favorite recommendations from me know 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.060
 of course I want to see for myself 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.560
 also totally like youtuber and this 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.900
 month I wanted you paula's choice 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.850
 skin care against youtube channel many 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.400
 full load choice is a brand that 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.169
 he now makes care 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.380
 also a little make-up too 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.360
 somehow so selbstbrÃ¤uner etc but before 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.140
 In particular, they have focused on themselves 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.280
 skin care 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.229
 you know that I am in the 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.090
 very much for six whole years 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.070
 dealt with ingredients and that 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.200
 always such a focus with viva in the 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.729
 videos that I not only as cdu that 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.479
 looks nice but what does it matter 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.490
 just really 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.740
 and of course there is a lot 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.690
 changes have learned to read a lot 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.660
 and I have so much too 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.970
 That's why I helped you 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.740
 but do not just recommend the job too 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.470
 give something to buy because there is 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.720
 Extremely much choice and you can do a lot 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.090
 Much wrong right now because fuller 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.160
 proudly works a lot with yours and 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.350
 because you have to know why you what 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.270
 used but I find the videos the 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.979
 as they produce you have a bit 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.590
 we bring patience, they are often very 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:24.600
 long but if you want to learn something then 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.850
 I think the channel is great I watch how 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.860
 super awesome, maybe, sure 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.620
 the one or the other question that had 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.110
 on the subject of skincare in the videos because 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.530
 I think they do that very well 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.360
 Also shampoos on skincare for oily 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.610
 Skin dry skin with dry skin 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.010
 acne and so on really everything 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.110
 possible, I think really great and the 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.910
 people who make youtube videos are 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.800
 also really very personable and were 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.670
 you my passion can be favorites for the 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.980
 april so the crusher I hope the 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.430
 You liked and liked favorites 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.430
 next time
