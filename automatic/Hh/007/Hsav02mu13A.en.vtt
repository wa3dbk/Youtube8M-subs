what<00:00:02.010> we<00:00:02.159> are<00:00:02.280> trying<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:02.850> do<00:00:03.179> here<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:04.049> setup

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:05.480 
what we are trying to do here the setup

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.810 
what we are trying to do here the setup
for<00:00:06.480> identical<00:00:07.319> tank<00:00:08.840> more<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:09.990> come<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.820> we

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
for identical tank more to come and we

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.780 
for identical tank more to come and we
are<00:00:11.940> going<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.650> compare<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:14.250> filtration

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
are going to compare the filtration

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.779 
are going to compare the filtration
system<00:00:15.000> because<00:00:16.279> everything<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.490> same

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
system because everything is the same

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.080 
system because everything is the same
including<00:00:18.690> coal<00:00:19.080> including<00:00:20.070> fish<00:00:20.430> including

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
including coal including fish including

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.009 
including coal including fish including
light<00:00:21.539> including<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:23.340> top<00:00:23.730> included<00:00:24.539> lice<00:00:24.689> on

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
light including on top included lice on

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.439 
light including on top included lice on
the<00:00:25.170> main<00:00:25.350> thing<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:26.550> only<00:00:26.670> difference<00:00:26.849> is

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
the main thing the only difference is

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.839 
the main thing the only difference is
going<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.840> be<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.199> filtration<00:00:28.680> system<00:00:28.830> let<00:00:29.699> me

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
going to be the filtration system let me

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.950 
going to be the filtration system let me
introduce<00:00:30.210> you

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.990 

each<00:00:36.500> tank<00:00:37.059> is<00:00:38.059> about<00:00:38.770> sixty<00:00:39.770> gallon<00:00:40.370> that's

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
each tank is about sixty gallon that's

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.080 
each tank is about sixty gallon that's
include<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:41.840> water<00:00:42.320> in<00:00:42.559> the<00:00:42.680> sums<00:00:43.040> so<00:00:43.640> the

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
include the water in the sums so the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.340 
include the water in the sums so the
main<00:00:44.329> thing<00:00:44.660> itself<00:00:45.379> is<00:00:45.559> about<00:00:46.870> 2<00:00:47.870> feet<00:00:48.110> by<00:00:48.320> 2

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
main thing itself is about 2 feet by 2

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.700 
main thing itself is about 2 feet by 2
feet<00:00:48.649> by<00:00:49.640> 22<00:00:50.360> inch<00:00:50.690> high

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
feet by 22 inch high

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.380 
feet by 22 inch high
so<00:00:52.670> this<00:00:53.329> about<00:00:53.949> 55<00:00:54.949> gallons<00:00:55.519> of<00:00:55.790> water<00:00:56.030> what

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
so this about 55 gallons of water what

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.030 
so this about 55 gallons of water what
not<00:00:56.629> then<00:00:56.899> so<00:00:57.320> in<00:00:57.769> each<00:00:58.280> tank<00:00:59.350> this<00:01:00.350> tank<00:01:00.680> is

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
not then so in each tank this tank is

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.139 
not then so in each tank this tank is
gonna<00:01:01.220> run<00:01:01.640> by<00:01:02.530> what<00:01:03.530> is<00:01:03.649> known<00:01:04.159> as<00:01:04.820> the

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
gonna run by what is known as the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:08.740 
gonna run by what is known as the
boolean<00:01:05.600> system<00:01:06.200> is<00:01:07.070> just<00:01:08.000> a<00:01:08.119> protein<00:01:08.390> skimmer

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
boolean system is just a protein skimmer

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.570 
boolean system is just a protein skimmer
there<00:01:09.259> and<00:01:10.360> in<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.960> sump<00:01:12.289> diffusion<00:01:13.070> some<00:01:13.340> but

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
there and in the sump diffusion some but

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.680 
there and in the sump diffusion some but
we're<00:01:13.759> not<00:01:13.970> gonna<00:01:14.149> add<00:01:14.630> anything<00:01:15.110> in<00:01:15.470> here<00:01:15.800> and

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
we're not gonna add anything in here and

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:24.130 
we're not gonna add anything in here and
the<00:01:17.690> next<00:01:17.990> thing<00:01:20.170> there<00:01:21.170> will<00:01:21.350> be<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:23.140> refugium

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
the next thing there will be a refugium

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.730 
the next thing there will be a refugium
we<00:01:24.830> can't<00:01:25.429> find<00:01:25.670> a<00:01:25.789> miracle<00:01:26.000> much<00:01:26.500> glass<00:01:27.500> the

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
we can't find a miracle much glass the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.830 
we can't find a miracle much glass the
same<00:01:27.979> protein<00:01:28.490> skimmer<00:01:28.819> and<00:01:29.179> the<00:01:29.450> protein

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
same protein skimmer and the protein

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.490 
same protein skimmer and the protein
skimmer<00:01:29.929> going<00:01:30.500> to<00:01:30.619> be<00:01:30.740> running<00:01:31.750> 24<00:01:32.750> hour<00:01:32.929> and

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
skimmer going to be running 24 hour and

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.230 
skimmer going to be running 24 hour and
this<00:01:34.429> is<00:01:34.490> also<00:01:34.819> known<00:01:35.270> as<00:01:35.630> a<00:01:36.100> letter<00:01:37.100> a<00:01:37.490> letter

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
this is also known as a letter a letter

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.990 
this is also known as a letter a letter
method<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:42.590> thing<00:01:42.920> is<00:01:43.160> also<00:01:43.399> the<00:01:43.759> same

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000
