00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.369
 a first 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.320
 but this autumn we are now in 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.580
 big fat prince that you 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.840

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.990

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.420

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.219
 starvation vitamin c best friend 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.870
 our hair because it is 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.219
 essential to the formation of collagen 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.070
 that's what gives structure and 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.550
 our hair so there we think in time the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.379
 strawberries 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:58.980
 in front of the platform and yes I'd like to see 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.270
 the blues and number three teachers and not 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.850
 your hair when you come out of the 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.880
 shower season damage use rather a 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.670
 comb like that and a detangler without 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.810
 rinsing trucks number 4 and I found 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.939
 your snack of the next weeks 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.740

 of vitamins gets done improves the flow 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.009
 blood to the scalp 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.780
 it pushes number 5 we do not abuse 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.490
 tools heating the lighthouse crying a 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.880
 once in a while to tame our 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.159
 hair is ok but the dryer the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.750
 less possible and air dry them and 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.210
 this stuff the one that puts the most up 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.500
 but what nireus is another thing and 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.479
 rational is to bring to our 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.340
 hair a good protein intake and then 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.400
 a 6-speed leap pushing his turn 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.909
 in avocados the legumes the 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.260
 number 7 nuts for our hair 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.580
 push must stop washing them 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.780
 space a little washing to make sure 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.220
 that our scalp keeps its 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.190
 Protective oil layer natural case 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.140
 a very good all this but finally 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.030
 last thing is 6 and the vinegar ones 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.830
 apples in dressage gesture and the 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.420
 cofosa luxury rhymes he really cleans himself 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.980
 although the hairy that it favors the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.660
 circulation the nutrients up to our 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.229
 hair follicles what we have to do 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.550
 it is that we put 4 tablespoons of 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.290
 apple vinegar in a bottle 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.520
 contains about 1 liter of water one is 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.920
 now in the shower and then we'll see 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.630
 after shampooing at first doing 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.130
 another is wise is always more 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.590
 effective when it's cold so put 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.420
 your mixture in the fridge before the girls 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.040
 be patient because it can take 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.420
 up to six weeks before you see 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.150
 results but with all that stuff 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.500
 really going to see a difference I 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.940
 measure my hair one seizes in 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.940
