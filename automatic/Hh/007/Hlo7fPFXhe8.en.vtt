00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
don't know if you remember I made a

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.220 
don't know if you remember I made a
video<00:00:45.809> or<00:00:46.789> probably<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:48.090> year<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.750> half<00:00:48.780> ago

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
video or probably a year and a half ago

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.529 
video or probably a year and a half ago
maybe<00:00:50.070> maybe<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.760> little<00:00:50.910> bit<00:00:51.090> longer<00:00:51.300> than

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
maybe maybe a little bit longer than

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.799 
maybe maybe a little bit longer than
that<00:00:51.660> not<00:00:51.930> quite<00:00:52.170> sure<00:00:52.219> from<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.550> guy<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> soldier

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.630 
that not quite sure from a guy a soldier
I<00:00:54.989> think<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> video<00:00:55.770> if<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.160> can't<00:00:56.370> ever<00:00:56.520> look

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
I think the video if you can't ever look

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.029 
I think the video if you can't ever look
at<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.879> was<00:00:57.390> cool<00:00:57.660> mail<00:00:57.989> from<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.500> soldier<00:00:59.010> I

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
at it was cool mail from a soldier I

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.130 
at it was cool mail from a soldier I
think<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.270> was<00:01:00.359> from<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.600> guy<00:01:00.780> called

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140
