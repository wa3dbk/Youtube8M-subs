0 to 32 as the default color settings
are<00:01:24.319> so<00:01:24.530> let's<00:01:24.710> make<00:01:25.009> 10<00:01:25.250> for<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.640> black<00:01:25.819> and

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
are so let's make 10 for the black and

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.109 
are so let's make 10 for the black and
white<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:27.380> initial<00:01:27.890> start<00:01:28.280> bonus<00:01:28.729> is<00:01:28.909> the

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
white the initial start bonus is the

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.950 
white the initial start bonus is the
armored<00:01:29.539> echo<00:01:29.929> you<00:01:30.140> can<00:01:30.319> choose<00:01:31.330> it<00:01:32.330> if<00:01:32.780> you

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
armored echo you can choose it if you

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.080 
armored echo you can choose it if you
want<00:01:33.200> this<00:01:33.710> is<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:33.979> basic<00:01:34.310> Kevlar<00:01:34.729> so<00:01:34.970> the

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
want this is the basic Kevlar so the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.050 
want this is the basic Kevlar so the
options<00:01:35.450> are<00:01:35.630> between<00:01:35.960> number<00:01:36.319> 67<00:01:37.039> and<00:01:37.369> 79

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
options are between number 67 and 79

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.300 
options are between number 67 and 79
however<00:01:38.479> you<00:01:38.780> must<00:01:38.959> remember<00:01:39.200> that<00:01:39.379> a<00:01:39.590> 67

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
however you must remember that a 67

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.790 
however you must remember that a 67
option<00:01:40.640> as<00:01:40.819> it<00:01:41.270> also<00:01:41.450> says<00:01:41.780> in<00:01:41.959> longer<00:01:42.379> red<00:01:42.649> in

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
option as it also says in longer red in

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.330 
option as it also says in longer red in
the<00:01:42.860> file<00:01:43.069> is<00:01:43.840> a<00:01:44.840> little<00:01:45.500> buggy<00:01:45.800> so<00:01:46.069> you<00:01:46.129> could

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
the file is a little buggy so you could

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.309 
the file is a little buggy so you could
if<00:01:46.610> you<00:01:46.729> want<00:01:46.910> the<00:01:47.030> 67<00:01:47.660> which<00:01:47.869> is<00:01:47.989> the<00:01:48.110> standard

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
if you want the 67 which is the standard

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.650 
if you want the 67 which is the standard
deco<00:01:48.979> hidden<00:01:49.369> you<00:01:49.489> just<00:01:49.700> basically<00:01:50.000> put<00:01:50.360> the

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
deco hidden you just basically put the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.919 
deco hidden you just basically put the
minus<00:01:50.989> 1<00:01:51.170> and<00:01:51.349> it<00:01:51.440> works<00:01:51.649> all<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.009> same<00:01:52.929> so

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
minus 1 and it works all the same so

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.490 
minus 1 and it works all the same so
let's<00:01:54.170> put<00:01:54.410> it<00:01:54.560> there<00:01:54.860> I<00:01:55.129> don't<00:01:55.640> know<00:01:55.819> maybe

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
let's put it there I don't know maybe

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.779 
let's put it there I don't know maybe
let's<00:01:57.500> choose<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.220> deco<00:02:00.039> 69<00:02:01.039> because<00:02:01.580> that's

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
let's choose the deco 69 because that's

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.990 
let's choose the deco 69 because that's
a<00:02:01.879> very<00:02:02.000> nice<00:02:02.209> number<00:02:02.479> and<00:02:02.920> I<00:02:03.920> will<00:02:04.399> soon<00:02:04.789> show

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
a very nice number and I will soon show

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.419 
a very nice number and I will soon show
you<00:02:05.060> have<00:02:05.269> the<00:02:05.450> DVD<00:02:05.929> the<00:02:06.379> difference<00:02:06.769> is<00:02:07.009> next

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
you have the DVD the difference is next

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.130 
you have the DVD the difference is next
show<00:02:07.700> you<00:02:07.879> a<00:02:07.910> force<00:02:08.239> on<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:08.479> mission<00:02:08.899> is

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
show you a force on a mission is

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.949 
show you a force on a mission is

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
minus one is the standard random set

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.970 
minus one is the standard random set
that<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.120> get<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:15.410> can<00:02:15.440> change<00:02:15.709> it<00:02:15.860> to

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
that you get and you can change it to

anything else
and<00:02:17.500> basically<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.920> numbers<00:02:19.220> are<00:02:19.489> between

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
and basically the numbers are between

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.640 
and basically the numbers are between
let<00:02:22.310> me<00:02:22.700> see<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:23.269> cannot<00:02:23.569> remember<00:02:23.930> now<00:02:24.440> I'm

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
let me see I cannot remember now I'm

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.770 
let me see I cannot remember now I'm
going<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:25.160> put<00:02:25.519> it<00:02:25.640> on<00:02:25.760> screen<00:02:26.030> for<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:26.450> the

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
going to put it on screen for you the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.809 
going to put it on screen for you the
arranged<00:02:27.230> numbers

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.610 

but<00:02:30.480> for<00:02:30.900> now<00:02:31.049> let's<00:02:31.290> make<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.920> 460<00:02:32.849> and<00:02:33.620> that

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
but for now let's make it a 460 and that

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.740 
but for now let's make it a 460 and that
should<00:02:34.829> be<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.010> fedora<00:02:35.400> because<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.450> nothing

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
should be a fedora because the nothing

you want in the standard range and so on
with<00:02:56.879> any<00:02:57.239> other<00:02:58.519> cluster<00:02:59.519> is<00:02:59.819> it's<00:03:00.450> this

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
with any other cluster is it's this

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.979 
with any other cluster is it's this
piece<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.040> file<00:03:02.220> over<00:03:02.549> here<00:03:02.579> I<00:03:03.030> just

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
piece of the file over here I just

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.360 
piece of the file over here I just
remember<00:03:04.500> if<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:04.680> change<00:03:04.859> something<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:05.250> the

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
remember if you change something to the

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.720 
remember if you change something to the
right

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
right

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.390 
right
the<00:03:06.269> sniper<00:03:06.629> :<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:07.170> heard<00:03:07.530> girls<00:03:07.709> might<00:03:07.950> ask<00:03:08.280> out

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
the sniper : I heard girls might ask out

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.300 
the sniper : I heard girls might ask out
color<00:03:08.639> and<00:03:08.879> so<00:03:09.000> on<00:03:09.030> eight<00:03:09.690> basic<00:03:10.440> T<00:03:10.799> changes

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
color and so on eight basic T changes

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.399 
color and so on eight basic T changes
absolutely<00:03:11.519> nothing<00:03:12.510> because<00:03:12.659> it's<00:03:13.079> after

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
absolutely nothing because it's after

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.199 
absolutely nothing because it's after
the<00:03:13.590> semicolon<00:03:13.799> so<00:03:14.280> it's<00:03:14.430> just<00:03:14.549> a<00:03:14.639> comment<00:03:15.000> so

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
the semicolon so it's just a comment so

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.119 
the semicolon so it's just a comment so
we<00:03:15.389> don't<00:03:15.540> care<00:03:15.690> about<00:03:15.720> that<00:03:16.139> so<00:03:16.799> with<00:03:17.010> the

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
we don't care about that so with the

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.589 
we don't care about that so with the
changes<00:03:17.459> we've<00:03:17.489> already<00:03:17.760> made<00:03:18.090> we<00:03:18.329> are<00:03:18.389> going

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
changes we've already made we are going
