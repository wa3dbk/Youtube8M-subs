00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
two fives and same for the rest like if

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.789 
two fives and same for the rest like if
you<00:01:17.189> buy<00:01:17.840> two<00:01:18.840> 20s<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:20.150> not<00:01:21.150> as<00:01:21.360> much<00:01:21.600> as<00:01:21.900> a

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
you buy two 20s it's not as much as a

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.060 
you buy two 20s it's not as much as a
fifty-dollar<00:01:23.869> obviously<00:01:24.869> actually<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:26.009> a

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
fifty-dollar obviously actually it's a

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.210 
fifty-dollar obviously actually it's a
bad<00:01:26.220> example<00:01:26.369> if<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.180> buy<00:01:27.350> two<00:01:28.350> ten<00:01:28.890> dollar

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
bad example if you buy two ten dollar

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.510 
bad example if you buy two ten dollar
ones<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:30.090> not<00:01:30.450> as<00:01:30.659> much<00:01:30.900> as<00:01:31.100> 1<00:01:32.329> $20<00:01:33.329> one<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.520> so

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
ones it's not as much as 1 $20 one so so

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.179 
ones it's not as much as 1 $20 one so so
you'd<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.759> wasting<00:01:35.909> your<00:01:36.210> money<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:37.040> you<00:01:38.040> want

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
to get as much donuts for the same

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.100
