00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
with that curse is this tree is about

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.140 
with that curse is this tree is about
30%<00:00:26.869> dead<00:00:27.349> and<00:00:27.619> the<00:00:28.369> majority<00:00:28.970> of<00:00:29.000> the

that's light that's very light wood over
there<00:00:33.620> lane<00:00:34.040> of<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:34.190> trees<00:00:34.430> over<00:00:34.700> here<00:00:34.910> right

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:35.240 
there lane of the trees over here right

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.390 
there lane of the trees over here right
the<00:00:35.630> chance<00:00:35.900> there<00:00:36.410> is<00:00:36.500> a<00:00:36.530> reasonable<00:00:37.160> chance

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
the chance there is a reasonable chance

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.730 
the chance there is a reasonable chance
that<00:00:37.580> she<00:00:37.820> started<00:00:38.180> cutting<00:00:38.410> dropped<00:00:39.410> a<00:00:39.530> tree

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:39.740 
that she started cutting dropped a tree

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.530 
that she started cutting dropped a tree
that<00:00:39.920> way<00:00:40.190> the<00:00:40.490> tree<00:00:40.700> would<00:00:40.790> actually<00:00:41.180> pivot

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
that way the tree would actually pivot

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.170 
that way the tree would actually pivot
on<00:00:41.690> her<00:00:41.810> twist<00:00:42.650> and<00:00:42.920> fall<00:00:43.430> right<00:00:43.670> over<00:00:43.730> on<00:00:44.030> the

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
on her twist and fall right over on the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.380 
on her twist and fall right over on the
house<00:00:45.340> and<00:00:46.340> that's<00:00:46.610> an<00:00:46.730> insurance<00:00:47.150> claim

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
house and that's an insurance claim

Willie<00:00:48.200> this<00:00:48.380> tree<00:00:48.650> has<00:00:48.920> been<00:00:49.190> chopped<00:00:49.610> in<00:00:49.820> the

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
Willie this tree has been chopped in the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.160 
Willie this tree has been chopped in the
past<00:00:50.150> that's<00:00:50.540> caused<00:00:50.750> some<00:00:51.020> of<00:00:51.050> these

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
past that's caused some of these

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.780 
past that's caused some of these
problems<00:00:51.410> now<00:00:51.710> hasn't<00:00:52.070> it<00:00:52.130> yeah<00:00:52.430> probably

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
problems now hasn't it yeah probably

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.300 
problems now hasn't it yeah probably
about<00:00:53.090> 10-15<00:00:53.750> years<00:00:53.780> ago<00:00:54.170> if<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:54.950> look<00:00:55.130> at<00:00:55.220> the

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.310 
about 10-15 years ago if you look at the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.620 
about 10-15 years ago if you look at the
other<00:00:55.430> trees<00:00:55.700> in<00:00:55.820> the<00:00:55.880> neighborhood<00:00:56.300> you<00:00:56.480> can

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
other trees in the neighborhood you can

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.080 
other trees in the neighborhood you can
see<00:00:56.810> that<00:00:56.990> a<00:00:57.020> lot<00:00:57.200> of<00:00:57.230> these<00:00:57.440> have<00:00:57.620> been<00:00:57.650> topped

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
see that a lot of these have been topped

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.220 
see that a lot of these have been topped
somebody<00:00:59.090> came<00:00:59.240> through<00:00:59.270> told<00:01:00.140> the

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
somebody came through told the

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.390 
somebody came through told the
homeowners<00:01:00.590> they<00:01:00.710> need<00:01:00.890> to<00:01:00.980> do<00:01:01.130> it<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:01.340> they

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
homeowners they need to do it and they

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.940 
homeowners they need to do it and they
all<00:01:01.520> did<00:01:01.760> it<00:01:01.810> what's<00:01:02.810> happening<00:01:03.320> is<00:01:03.590> when<00:01:03.860> you

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
all did it what's happening is when you

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.150 
all did it what's happening is when you
do<00:01:04.070> come<00:01:04.280> in<00:01:04.460> top<00:01:04.640> a<00:01:04.670> tree<00:01:05.380> the<00:01:06.380> new<00:01:06.740> branches

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
do come in top a tree the new branches

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.430 
do come in top a tree the new branches
that<00:01:07.280> grow<00:01:07.430> out<00:01:07.780> have<00:01:08.780> a<00:01:08.810> very<00:01:09.170> weak

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
that grow out have a very weak

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.500 
that grow out have a very weak
attachment<00:01:10.040> so<00:01:10.160> they<00:01:10.250> can<00:01:10.370> actually<00:01:10.550> they're

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
attachment so they can actually they're

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.940 
attachment so they can actually they're
not<00:01:11.540> as<00:01:11.810> strong<00:01:12.050> as<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:12.320> original<00:01:12.620> tree<00:01:12.800> would

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
not as strong as the original tree would

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.410 
not as strong as the original tree would
be<00:01:13.070> so<00:01:13.250> you<00:01:13.310> have<00:01:13.550> a<00:01:13.580> potential<00:01:14.090> for<00:01:14.120> failure

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
be so you have a potential for failure

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.420 
be so you have a potential for failure
there<00:01:14.870> so<00:01:15.500> you're<00:01:15.680> going<00:01:15.770> to<00:01:15.830> be<00:01:15.950> roping

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
there so you're going to be roping

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.130 
there so you're going to be roping
yourself<00:01:16.760> into<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:17.090> tree<00:01:17.270> yeah<00:01:17.810> we'll<00:01:18.020> be

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
yourself into the tree yeah we'll be

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.350 
yourself into the tree yeah we'll be
roped<00:01:18.320> in<00:01:18.530> we'll<00:01:18.680> be<00:01:18.800> tied<00:01:18.980> in<00:01:19.190> most<00:01:20.150> of<00:01:20.270> the

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
roped in we'll be tied in most of the

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.970 
roped in we'll be tied in most of the
tree<00:01:20.570> branches<00:01:21.020> that<00:01:21.140> work<00:01:21.260> nerded<00:01:21.620> branches

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
tree branches that work nerded branches

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.470 
tree branches that work nerded branches
up<00:01:22.130> when<00:01:22.400> we<00:01:22.520> take<00:01:22.700> them<00:01:22.820> out<00:01:22.910> we<00:01:23.240> will<00:01:23.390> do

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
up when we take them out we will do

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.110 
up when we take them out we will do
control<00:01:23.810> drops<00:01:24.110> on<00:01:24.320> them<00:01:24.470> so<00:01:25.430> that<00:01:25.610> we<00:01:25.940> can

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
control drops on them so that we can

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.430 
control drops on them so that we can
control<00:01:26.360> which<00:01:26.690> direction<00:01:27.020> they're<00:01:27.230> going<00:01:27.380> to

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
control which direction they're going to

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.260 
control which direction they're going to
fall<00:01:27.650> and<00:01:27.680> output<00:01:28.430> weight<00:01:28.700> tip<00:01:28.940> Interphone

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
fall and output weight tip Interphone

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.180 
fall and output weight tip Interphone
okay<00:01:29.900> and<00:01:30.050> the<00:01:30.140> other<00:01:30.260> factor<00:01:30.680> is<00:01:30.710> something

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
okay and the other factor is something

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.520 
okay and the other factor is something
like<00:01:31.280> this<00:01:31.460> it's<00:01:31.700> important<00:01:32.240> that<00:01:32.530> especially

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
like this it's important that especially

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.560 
like this it's important that especially
because<00:01:33.950> of<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.280> hazards<00:01:34.730> that<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.240> person

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
because of the hazards that the person

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.110 
because of the hazards that the person
who's<00:01:35.750> doing<00:01:35.900> this<00:01:36.080> be<00:01:36.350> insured<00:01:36.890> yeah<00:01:37.670> anytime

really one of the problems you've got

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.210 
really one of the problems you've got
here<00:01:50.810> is<00:01:50.930> you've<00:01:51.200> got<00:01:51.350> vehicles<00:01:51.590> parked<00:01:52.100> here

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
here is you've got vehicles parked here

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.800 
here is you've got vehicles parked here
on<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.400> street<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:52.909> they're<00:01:53.300> within<00:01:53.510> range

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
on the street and they're within range

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.030 
on the street and they're within range
of<00:01:53.960> these<00:01:54.080> branches<00:01:54.500> even<00:01:54.620> though<00:01:54.830> they're

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
of these branches even though they're

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.130 
of these branches even though they're
parked<00:01:55.430> at<00:01:55.580> least<00:01:55.760> one<00:01:55.940> house<00:01:56.150> away<00:01:56.180> yeah

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
parked at least one house away yeah

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.210 
parked at least one house away yeah
that's<00:01:57.380> one<00:01:57.530> of<00:01:57.620> the<00:01:57.680> things<00:01:57.890> people

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
that's one of the things people

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.280 
that's one of the things people
underestimate<00:01:59.030> is<00:01:59.210> health<00:01:59.540> when<00:02:00.110> they<00:02:00.229> see

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
underestimate is health when they see

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.780 
underestimate is health when they see
these<00:02:00.560> branches<00:02:01.010> they<00:02:01.100> think<00:02:01.310> they<00:02:01.400> can<00:02:01.580> drop

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
these branches they think they can drop

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.550 
these branches they think they can drop
them<00:02:02.000> fairly<00:02:02.299> easily<00:02:02.420> out<00:02:02.930> into<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.260> street

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
them fairly easily out into the street

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.320 
them fairly easily out into the street
problem<00:02:04.310> is

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
problem is

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.810 
problem is
couple<00:02:06.170> these<00:02:06.260> branches<00:02:06.770> could<00:02:06.890> easily<00:02:07.130> reach

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
couple these branches could easily reach

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.210 
couple these branches could easily reach
almost<00:02:08.630> two<00:02:08.780> houses<00:02:09.200> down<00:02:09.229> if<00:02:09.740> you<00:02:09.890> took<00:02:10.100> them

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
almost two houses down if you took them

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.460 
almost two houses down if you took them
down<00:02:10.369> in<00:02:10.610> hole<00:02:10.850> and<00:02:11.120> if<00:02:11.810> your<00:02:11.959> neighbors<00:02:12.260> got<00:02:12.440> a

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
down in hole and if your neighbors got a

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.840 
down in hole and if your neighbors got a
nice<00:02:12.680> new<00:02:12.860> car<00:02:13.100> parked<00:02:13.400> out<00:02:13.520> there<00:02:13.550> they're

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
nice new car parked out there they're

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.850 
nice new car parked out there they're
not<00:02:13.970> going<00:02:14.120> to<00:02:14.150> be<00:02:14.270> real<00:02:14.450> happy<00:02:14.630> with<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:14.990> okay

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
well these have to be moved in or at

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.610 
well these have to be moved in or at
least<00:02:17.390> what<00:02:17.540> candy<00:02:17.870> move<00:02:18.050> needs<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.319> be<00:02:18.380> moved

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
least what candy move needs to be moved

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.740 
least what candy move needs to be moved
right<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:19.250> lot<00:02:19.760> of<00:02:19.880> people<00:02:20.060> don't<00:02:20.150> realize<00:02:20.390> how

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
right a lot of people don't realize how

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.330 
right a lot of people don't realize how
tall<00:02:20.810> these<00:02:21.200> trees<00:02:21.470> really<00:02:21.770> are<00:02:21.920> here<00:02:22.190> we've

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
tall these trees really are here we've

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.220 
tall these trees really are here we've
got<00:02:22.550> Adam<00:02:22.940> up<00:02:23.090> there<00:02:23.270> taking<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.690> picture<00:02:23.900> down

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
to show what it looked like once you're

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.850 
to show what it looked like once you're
up<00:02:25.760> there<00:02:25.790> that's<00:02:26.120> a<00:02:26.239> long<00:02:26.480> ways<00:02:26.780> down<00:02:26.860> yeah

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
up there that's a long ways down yeah

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.880 
up there that's a long ways down yeah
he's<00:02:28.100> up<00:02:28.280> about<00:02:28.520> 20<00:02:28.850> 25<00:02:29.239> feet<00:02:29.600> right<00:02:29.870> now<00:02:29.930> as

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
he's up about 20 25 feet right now as

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.380 
he's up about 20 25 feet right now as
you<00:02:31.010> can<00:02:31.130> see<00:02:31.310> he's<00:02:31.550> not<00:02:31.700> even<00:02:31.970> up<00:02:32.090> near<00:02:32.270> the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
you can see he's not even up near the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.530 
you can see he's not even up near the
top<00:02:32.420> of<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:32.840> tree<00:02:33.730> but<00:02:34.730> yeah<00:02:34.940> that's<00:02:35.209> one<00:02:35.480> of

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
top of the tree but yeah that's one of

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.640 
top of the tree but yeah that's one of
the<00:02:35.630> things<00:02:35.780> people<00:02:35.840> don't<00:02:36.170> realize<00:02:36.440> in<00:02:36.560> the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
the things people don't realize in the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.410 
the things people don't realize in the
ground<00:02:36.890> once<00:02:37.340> you<00:02:37.430> get<00:02:37.550> up<00:02:37.670> there<00:02:37.700> it's<00:02:38.060> a<00:02:38.150> long

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
ground once you get up there it's a long

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.540 
ground once you get up there it's a long
fall<00:02:38.930> back<00:02:39.170> down<00:02:39.350> these<00:02:39.650> ropes<00:02:39.890> are<00:02:40.100> important

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
fall back down these ropes are important

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.190 
fall back down these ropes are important
these<00:02:40.850> ropes<00:02:41.060> are<00:02:41.300> very<00:02:41.540> important<00:02:41.959> it's<00:02:42.080> what

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
these ropes are very important it's what

00:02:42.200 --> 00:03:14.900 
these ropes are very important it's what
our<00:02:42.320> lives<00:02:42.530> depend<00:02:42.890> on

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:39.010 

you

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:04:00.610 

you

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.260 

what<00:04:01.620> we<00:04:01.740> see<00:04:01.920> here<00:04:02.160> is<00:04:02.280> not<00:04:02.550> pruning<00:04:03.090> what

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
what we see here is not pruning what

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.120 
what we see here is not pruning what
we're<00:04:03.420> seeing<00:04:03.600> is<00:04:03.810> removal<00:04:04.410> of<00:04:04.500> branches<00:04:04.980> so

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
we're seeing is removal of branches so

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.260 
we're seeing is removal of branches so
the<00:04:05.250> tree<00:04:05.400> can<00:04:05.430> be<00:04:05.640> cut<00:04:05.850> down<00:04:05.880> without

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
the tree can be cut down without

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.900 
the tree can be cut down without
damaging<00:04:06.960> things<00:04:07.230> around<00:04:07.560> it<00:04:07.830> this<00:04:08.520> is<00:04:08.760> not

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
damaging things around it this is not

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.120 
damaging things around it this is not
pruning<00:04:09.450> this<00:04:09.660> might<00:04:10.200> be<00:04:10.350> called<00:04:10.590> topping<00:04:11.010> but

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
pruning this might be called topping but

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.010 
pruning this might be called topping but
this<00:04:11.280> is<00:04:11.400> not<00:04:11.550> what<00:04:11.730> we<00:04:11.820> recommend<00:04:12.270> doing<00:04:12.390> to

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
this is not what we recommend doing to

00:04:13.020 --> 00:05:19.270 
this is not what we recommend doing to
prune<00:04:13.350> a<00:04:13.530> tree

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.740 

I'm<00:05:20.280> standing<00:05:20.670> here<00:05:20.820> where<00:05:21.150> a<00:05:21.180> cottonwood

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
I'm standing here where a cottonwood

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.750 
I'm standing here where a cottonwood
tree<00:05:21.990> stood<00:05:22.200> not<00:05:22.440> long<00:05:22.620> ago<00:05:22.800> and<00:05:23.220> thanks<00:05:23.550> to

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
tree stood not long ago and thanks to

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.070 
tree stood not long ago and thanks to
Willie<00:05:24.000> and<00:05:24.150> his<00:05:24.300> crew<00:05:24.540> we've<00:05:24.720> seen<00:05:24.930> how

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
Willie and his crew we've seen how

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.470
