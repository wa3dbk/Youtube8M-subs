00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.380
 it was better 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.360
 this is the moment of intervention at 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.440
 well-known doctor thomas porta conductor 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.440
 of a television program 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.140
 no problem the squadron police 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.360
 emergency department intervenes after the 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.460
 request for support from colleagues 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.640
 they performed an operation in block 4 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.530
 of the avenue as dictators in health 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.629
 they intervened to ask for his permission 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.980
 of polarized moons only there 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.710
 they realized that the driver of 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.780
 television was driving his truck 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.980
 visibly drunk the shock confirms 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.980
 his statements 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.670
 I was not in my house four blocks 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.050
 I admit ten thousand apologies because 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.339
 I have to comply with what the 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.460
 police 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.170
 they have gone a little bit of no 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.909
 I think the police should be or mouth 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.079
 other things that instead of being 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.149
 doing this the police claim that in 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.350
 first instance the doctor resisted 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.280
 to the intervention 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.280
 the Bourbons 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:35.789
 but then he agreed to go to the 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.789
 Police station 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:52.120
 that's what the police are saying 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.750
 before getting in here 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:02:01.570
 already asked for the press to come and that's 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:06.160
 a very suspicious thing for me that no 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.810
 I have an idea if it takes or not 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.340
 today is my last day of program and we have 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.780
 celebrated with the whole world and has been 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.220
 something nice funny 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.530
 entertaining and also this car was 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.110
 waiting for us to get out of the 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.600
 bar where we agreed and 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.480
 just when we left , the 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.340
 two policemen and arrogantly we 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.330
 They asked a lot of information will 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.420
 we gave everything 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.610
 - the technical review he was taken to 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.830
 pass the ethyl dosage his lawyer 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.950
 He also arrived at the San police station 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.950
 isidro 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.040
 with the doctor has accepted
