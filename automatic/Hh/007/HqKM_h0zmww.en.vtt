if it down in there there's a stream

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.610 
if it down in there there's a stream
that<00:00:51.440> runs<00:00:51.880> comes<00:00:52.880> ultimately<00:00:53.720> from<00:00:54.230> the

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
that runs comes ultimately from the

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.979 
that runs comes ultimately from the
mountains<00:00:54.980> down<00:00:55.550> into<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.210> foothills<00:00:56.450> in<00:00:56.870> the

you<00:01:39.130> can<00:01:39.250> actually<00:01:39.429> see<00:01:39.759> from<00:01:39.909> here<00:01:40.289> kind<00:01:41.289> of

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
you can actually see from here kind of

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.059 
you can actually see from here kind of
funny<00:01:41.560> actually<00:01:42.429> got<00:01:42.729> some<00:01:42.880> foam<00:01:43.119> going<00:01:43.390> on

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:47.069 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:49.380 

but<00:01:48.069> this<00:01:48.189> is<00:01:48.310> what<00:01:48.490> we<00:01:48.610> saw<00:01:48.789> when<00:01:49.090> we<00:01:49.149> came

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
but this is what we saw when we came

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.969 
but this is what we saw when we came
down<00:01:49.659> in<00:01:49.929> March<00:01:52.289> because<00:01:53.289> this<00:01:53.500> was<00:01:53.619> running

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
down in March because this was running

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.160 
down in March because this was running
and<00:01:54.189> it<00:01:54.399> hasn't<00:01:54.579> run<00:01:55.000> since<00:01:55.299> we've<00:01:55.750> been<00:01:55.929> here

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
and it hasn't run since we've been here

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.230 
and it hasn't run since we've been here
because<00:01:56.500> of<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.679> drought<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.939> has<00:01:58.060> actually

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
because of the drought this has actually

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.609 
because of the drought this has actually
been<00:01:58.479> dry<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.780> so<00:02:02.560> if<00:02:02.740> normal<00:02:03.250> rains<00:02:03.549> keep<00:02:03.939> up

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
been dry and so if normal rains keep up

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.870 
been dry and so if normal rains keep up
snows<00:02:05.619> in<00:02:05.829> the<00:02:05.860> mountains<00:02:06.250> that<00:02:06.429> melt<00:02:06.640> and

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
snows in the mountains that melt and

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.229 
snows in the mountains that melt and
stuff<00:02:07.090> this<00:02:07.479> would<00:02:07.630> be<00:02:07.750> running<00:02:08.019> all<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.289> time

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
stuff this would be running all the time

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.809 
stuff this would be running all the time
but<00:02:10.260> then<00:02:11.260> with<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.530> drought<00:02:11.739> then<00:02:12.610> it<00:02:12.700> goes

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
but then with the drought then it goes

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.039 
but then with the drought then it goes
under<00:02:13.090> that<00:02:13.120> drain<00:02:14.400> in<00:02:15.569> that<00:02:16.569> drain<00:02:16.810> rather

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
under that drain in that drain rather

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.339 
under that drain in that drain rather
goes<00:02:17.950> over<00:02:18.220> our<00:02:18.370> road<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.810> then<00:02:19.959> it<00:02:20.049> goes<00:02:20.170> back

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
goes over our road and then it goes back

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:32.350 
goes over our road and then it goes back
in<00:02:20.590> there<00:02:20.769> where<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.640> stream<00:02:21.940> continues

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:42.710
