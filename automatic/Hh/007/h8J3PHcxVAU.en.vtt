00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 Hi, people, my name is on this sneaker. 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.930
 here to record the first challenge of 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.179
 video stream 2014 then I go 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.340
 show you my top three best 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.230
 books read because of other channels 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.799
 literary because of this world 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.330
 youtube 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.400
 Let me create a blog and keep a 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.859
 always up to date list of all 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.630
 books that I 'll have in 2013 and so 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.699
 I have exactly control of those 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.880
 books I read because of referrals 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.460
 other blogs and other channels it was 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.800
 very difficult to choose only three 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.050
 I was among the 15 best but I got 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.880
 and I also realized that I never saw 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.980
 no classic book because of 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.860
 indications of other channels all 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.390
 books I read because of referrals 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.309
 were best sellers but I did not 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.230
 I see no problem with this. 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.670
 just for you to have a sense of the kind of 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.270
 book that I'm going to show you here 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.469
 in this team 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.930
 The first book I have to 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.559
 show then it's blood ties it's shelly 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.960
 media 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.969
 this book really would never have read and 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.100
 if it was not for my blog on the channel 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.109
 youtube this book was sent through 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.239
 a tour with the publisher because the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.070
 The key's birthday was coming and 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.380
 she came in contact with all the gifts 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.869
 partners at the time and asked to 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.000
 each blogger indicates another person 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.430
 who was not the publisher's partner for 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.470
 receive this book so that's how 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.689
 I 've known the world of algeria ever. 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.520
 there had been no other side of her and me 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.830
 I fell in love right away I liked it 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.080
 very much of this book after 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.880
 he and I immediately bought every box 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.680
 full vampire academy series 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.119
 which was already a series that was with 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.329
 willingness to read because of the quantity 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.829
 immense of good comments intimations 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.890
 that I saw on the other youtube channels 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.350
 but I always had that fear of series 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.270
 The vampire prejudice itself and thanks to 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.700
 God and I conquered this prejudice because of 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.079
 of the indications that I had of everything then 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.320
 I was very happy, I think this is a 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.570
 of the best indications I received 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.640
 Since I started to do 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.070
 here my channel after another indication 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.370
 which is also very similar is today a 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.260
 mechanic of the series the pieces of truth 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.900
 cassandra cléa the books of the holy house 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.340
 clear they are one of the most 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.110
 commented on this world everyone speaks 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.570
 from the series of deadly instruments 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.450
 world loves pantanal malls 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.220
 hunters of the works of the house andrea and not 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.250
 It has as you enter this world you 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.110
 do not be at least curious to read a 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.390
 book should know if it really is everything 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.430
 This is what people say and it's people. 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.490
 everything here is much more and was already much 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.560
 commented that the end pieces are better 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.150
 people have liked more than the 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.920
 mortal instruments I think the house 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.350
 of time it has a very mature 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.570
 great as a writer as the author 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.700
 she has no fault free her story 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.010
 despite its completely new world and 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.290
 extremely complex it does not offer 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.060
 misses in the plot at least one angel 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.980
 mechanic does not do not know how to 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.500
 city ​​of bones she pays attention to 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.320
 every detail the characters of them 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.640
 are very well built not only have 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.340
 main margins to be of concern 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.020
 with all the secondary characters 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.910
 story extras each 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.920
 adds a new important element 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.080
 for the story and I think the writing 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.880
 I do not think I really admire the 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.060
 our life as a writer I think she 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.610
 is an example in this genre that he 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.380
 write is a reference so I like 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.450
 much of it and I intend to read 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.340
 other books you wrote and lastly 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.160
 in third place and I'll show him 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.250
 several incidents of eesc I read this 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.340
 book case of ebserh which is even the 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.980
 creator of volks boston 2014 and this is the 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.840
 her favorite writer since I 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.320
 I think it's for all tastes inclusive 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.810
 only I felt that I saw videos of her 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.850
 indicating this book so well others 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.250
 channels I saw did not like it so much 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.620
 They were afraid to like but has 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.570
 caveats by elements realism 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.340
 fantastic and a lot of people do not have contact 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.410
 with this genre there are people who are 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.870
 lost that is not well known by the 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.660
 history and even confesses that there are 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.770
 clichés elements and the main subject 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.390
 of the book is the issue of bullying 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.400
 I'm a little tired of books about 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.580
 this subject but despite all this 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.320
 this special book he got 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.120
 impact enough I cried so much I 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.090
 I loved that presented to the new style 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.010
 of young adult literature that is the focus 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.420
 of this book I liked to see 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.640
 a literature aimed at this audience 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.590
 which is not totally fantastic is not 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.239
 totally contemporary silly one 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.000
 literature that achieves these two 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.980
 worlds without turning a thing too much just to 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.680
 adults knows but to maintain the language of 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.920
 so I think this book is a 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.210
 reference to anyone looking for something 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:34.350
 completely different from what comes 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:36.120
 And there 's something special about my stock 30 videos 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.820
 I hope you 're pretty enough because 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.050
 button that I see you should me at 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.050
 light heavyweight jap
