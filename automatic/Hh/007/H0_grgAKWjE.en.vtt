00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:02.500
 I'll tell you how to produce 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.149
 intercepts development issues 

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:05.830
 He speaks 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.050
 at this point he cheated intercepted 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.789
 radio contact this target 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:12.789
 which is heading 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.799
 here's okinawa 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.079
 and is with speed all knots 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:20.609
 our actions 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.609
 we carry out direct from our vodka 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.019
 our boats 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.019
 to the point of the ship 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.540
 caliper april 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.540
 on course department 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.060
 around the circumference 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.210
 radius 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.230
 all units of any that is it can 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.230
 be 700 meters it can be 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.740
 seven kilometers it could be 700 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.460
 kilometers it could be anything 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.420
 the main thing so that it was seven 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.600
 i.e. speed 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.600
 ship that can all mass media nodes 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.330
 half a year supposed point 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.920
 interception 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.180
 however thousand 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.420
 next we know that our boat is on 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.620
 certain 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.860
 can move with speed 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.860
 15 knots 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.720
 from the interception point 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.720
 and we draw a circle with a radius 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.310
 equal to 15 of our units ie if it was 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.050
 700 meters in the case of a ship then this should 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.050
 be a mile away 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.450
 one and a half kilometers 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.450
 if it happened 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.450
 Seven meters it should be 15 tanks 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.480
 we succeeded 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.480
 triangle 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.270
 which shows us the angle at which 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.760
 we will have to intercept the target 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.290
 for admission 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.290
 this parallel transfer is being done 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.730
 at our point, that is, this point should 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.980
 coincide with the point of view of the author 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.980
 fuse 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.580
 all we do 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.819
 nevertheless that it was extended 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:22.919
 estimated interception point 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:23.859
 This is true 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:25.359
 the point at which we will have to 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.749
 move at 15 knots 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:30.139
 to intercept a ship going by this 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:31.169
 by question 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:32.689
 with speed all knots 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:34.539
 since here is this point I can 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:36.379
 so clearly intersected 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.109
 on trial 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.869
 most reasonable for example 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:43.509
 intercept point do on 

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:46.509
 moon 4 kilometers more 

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:50.299
 is it already her real denis and 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.089
 projectile 4 kilometers 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:55.029
 we think that we are on the firing position 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:57.919
 come out here is stress 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.169
 respectively 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.679
 our forum should be 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:05.679
 like that 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:09.199
 calculations
