it<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:04.000> I<00:02:04.360> was<00:02:04.899> thinking<00:02:05.110> we<00:02:05.440> could<00:02:05.500> have<00:02:06.149> one

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
it so I was thinking we could have one

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.540 
it so I was thinking we could have one
verse<00:02:07.390> like<00:02:07.720> the<00:02:07.869> way<00:02:07.990> I<00:02:08.020> did<00:02:08.319> it<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:08.619> then<00:02:08.800> we

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
verse like the way I did it and then we

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.580 
verse like the way I did it and then we
could<00:02:09.700> like<00:02:09.940> loop<00:02:10.450> that<00:02:10.690> for<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.110> second<00:02:11.470> time

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
could like loop that for a second time

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.050 
could like loop that for a second time
and<00:02:11.650> then<00:02:11.950> I'll<00:02:12.040> like<00:02:12.459> come<00:02:12.700> in<00:02:12.730> with<00:02:12.970> the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060
