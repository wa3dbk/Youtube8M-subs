00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 to the sister youtube range we have the 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.960
 samsung galaxy 10 53 60 in this short me 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.269
 I will teach you a trick trick consist 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.030
 also it also has to do with 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.070
 the use of an application then as 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.190
 turn off or lock the phone of a 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.840
 very simple way very useful without having 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.359
 to be always using the button 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.550
 right of each side of a button 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.710
 mechanical but we can turn off a 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.560
 forward is not a cell phone using the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.960
 touch screen 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.910
 in the word with the touch screen 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.350
 it will give more life is everything 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.500
 that we use every day to 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.160
 learn to turn off the screen 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.530
 basically what we should do is 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.420
 enter the discharge pistol of this 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.420
 application that is called turn off screen 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.769
 free of Roberto Gil is very 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.410
 easily if we give it here in the 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.820
 finder turn off screen and we're going to 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.650
 pay screen the mind program 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.720
 then several options will come out but in 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.519
 this the best option which I already have 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.890
 installed turn off screen for free 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:02.199
 Roberto Gil basically the first time 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.199
 that the initial hoist will ask us 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.940
 although it is phone x performs the line 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.730
 started outside the play store 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.870
 how the application looks where it was 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.470
 usually be in the last screen 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:18.230
 of applications we enter it and in 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.130
 this way we activate it let's activate 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.650
 and that's how simple it remains active here 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.880
 there is usually the button on the 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.790
 application that if she is going to 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.370
 pay and also for six days is not going to 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.200
 have to test this little button I think 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.440
 you can not see is a little button like 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.330
 like a black I think black in that 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.400
 moment is as clarito give me a 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.100
 little circle on top of that can be 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.060
 change color if you sunk 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:51.620
 and I put it suddenly yellow not having 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:54.230
 red or yellow looks 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.120
 have made him red is the botoncito 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.820
 and through that little button which does not 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.770
 we only want to move a little bit 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.900
 because it's very much on top of the 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.230
 application to mold a little bit more to 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.230
 above 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.149
 I will say what is left there has gone 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.830
 well onwards I no longer have to 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.739
 use the side button to pay 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.050
 but you can use this little button and 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.080
 so automatically the screen goes off 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.030
 or you can also use the icon on 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.490
 icon you want I think it says you have to 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.800
 to turn off 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.990
 to turn off the screen 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.170
 I can not accommodate that icon on another side 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.330
 and good for the home screen better 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.160
 around here and so we can continue to turn off 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.990
 our screen with just touching 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.390
 the screen learns that using 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.890
 this button is mostly for this video 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.980
 I think it's a little application 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.200
 useful pretty useful and it will give you a little 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.150
 more life to the cell phone since we will be 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.180
 turn off the cell phone in a tactile way and not 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.290
 using this side button and on 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.120
 everything for this video 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.740
