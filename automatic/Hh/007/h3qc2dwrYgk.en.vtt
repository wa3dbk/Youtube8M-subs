00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.850
 hello how about you very welcome 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.860
 coches.net we are going to give us a return in 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.060
 this seventh generation volkswagen golf 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.060
 come with us please 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.920
 all right 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.570
 we started 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.070
 you have not seen it outside 4 meters 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.340
 25 centimeters 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.130
 volkswagen golf seventh generation the 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.950
 myth has been reborn and has not only 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.540
 reborn but he has done it 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.010
 Well, if we were talking about everything 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.220
 we would go that by the big door 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.400
 because well we had it already more or 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.010
 less clear seeing the new a3 of how 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.020
 could it be worth golf and if you do 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.390
 a look then not only already outside 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.500
 but you've already seen that out 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.729
 the truth is that a 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.130
 little bit and the truth is that it is much more 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.580
 aesthetic than before but inside that 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.820
 has kept the level even the rise of 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.790
 a way then let's say brilliant in 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.540
 this particular case we are talking about the 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:49.080
 1400 engine of that and 140 horses change 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.900
 seven-speed automatic dsg 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.870
 the dsg change you already know of many 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.320
 other occasions impeccable and in this case 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.270
 concrete good in a finish that 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.490
 Carry carries extras to put a store 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.610
 of extras that is brutal everything 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.890
 takes from adaptive speed or be 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.680
 adaptive cruise speed up 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.020
 well, up to paddles on the steering wheel 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.690
 until this ceiling that you see above carries 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.750
 even 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.600
 fatigue detector and carries detector 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.540
 consistent possible collision carries in line 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.850
 so if you get out of the way they're going 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.020
 to find my things and above all, look 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.600
 in this browser screen 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.270
 fantastic that as you see it is there such 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.040
 which and as soon as he put his hand 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.540
 displays a menu below that 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.070
 makes things very much easier and that 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.230
 it seems like I'm not going to tell you that it has 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.080
 addiction but many awards would like 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.330
 have this this system is incredible to 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.210
 I love it and obviously in this 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.300
 touch screen you can find thousand and 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.770
 one things you have from a fast one or 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.540
 from a reversing camera that 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.240
 works wonders and that has a 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.250
 incredible sharpness up to good so power 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.000
 see a lot of parameters and of 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.160
 stories that you could not see in 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.620
 nothing more than in this kind of thing like 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.460
 you can see good as there are partial 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.930
 from total calculation from the refueling 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.490
 from the exit or has it improved 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.490
 even more what already seemed incredible 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.080
 can improve 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.840
 a computer on board the group 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.310
 volkswagen that is amazing in terms of 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.750
 space well there are times squares 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.700
 back we are in a three doors 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.230
 always conditions a little the entrance 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.120
 the rear seats are correct 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.340
 normal for a compact boot of 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.950
 380 liters the same there is neither shines 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.340
 correct normal well with a space 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.080
 extra if you do not have a spare wheel 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.240
 otherwise as good as ever in 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.190
 the group volkswagen engines to put 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.870
 shop now no more than 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.320
 five but obviously they will be coming out more 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.620
 and in this case we are talking about 140 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.930
 gasoline horse that is right in this 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.610
 finished at 22 thousand 800 euros and 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.880
 we add the dsg change 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.130
 we are talking about 24,600 deserves the 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.840
 sorry, the truth is that if I had 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.880
 24 thousand euros would not hesitate to buy me 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.760
 they get honestly because 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.280
 apart from that, not only does it start 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.430
 button and easy entry but in this 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.890
 modem button you can see that it has five 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.440
 driving selection modes in 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.639
 these modes you can see that too 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.060
 change the 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.520
 the adjustment system then from the 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.159
 chassis up to the hardness of the steering 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.810
 of engine power delivery as 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:32.360
 the air conditioner would work if it works 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.919
 with dynamic curved lights and so on everything 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.569
 in combination with the start and stop that 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.629
 works great and as you can see 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:40.129
 you can completely regulate the car 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:42.710
 four pre-adjusted ways plus one 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:44.240
 fifth you can mix parameters with 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.350
 this is because you can get 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.300
 travel on the highway, be this one obviously 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.130
 pure silk or that you go to a port of 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.360
 mountain and with the 140 horses of this 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.190
 gasoline engine that are going pretty well 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.540
 You can enjoy a suspension 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:00.040
 harder and a power delivery 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.540
 much better otherwise, you're going to 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.920
 read in the extensive analysis that we have 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.030
 done for maybe it's punctuality page 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.620
 world reference web the engine 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.170
 where we have analyzed this volkswagen 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.060
 golf this dominator from the segment of 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.470
 the compact ones and where are you going to 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.090
 be very few doubts after reading

 everything we have everything we have 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.110
