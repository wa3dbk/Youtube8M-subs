00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.659
 in the universe of trophic interactions between organisms 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:24.089
 traditionally it has been considered that lizards based their diet almost 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.390
 exclusively in the ingestion of insects 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.010
 and really like that in most analysts and experts 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.010
 the occupants 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.360
 but nevertheless 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.190
 in cold environments 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.190
 the availability of this resource from betis 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.030
 Blonde has performed in the national park of 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.840
 the case of galicia shows that the lizards ocelados in ecstasy 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.870
 different 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.930
 the oscar are not simple 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.750
 this change in diet 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.009
 has important consequences in the dynamics of the total of these ecosystems 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.570
 the aligators 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.570
 scatter the seeds at considerable distances 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.509
 while they go through the digestive tract of the lizards 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.490
 During this trip, which sometimes lasts up to three days, the seeds are 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.329
 undergoing a scarification process that will facilitate day 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.329
 will accelerate its completion 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.910
 Conversely 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.880
 the seeds that fall 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.660
 lives in the fleshy fruit below the mother plant 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.660
 they have a probability 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.270
 the presence of art 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.940
 running to the aston villa 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.840
 and the shadows 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.980
 exercised by your 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.120
 conditional 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.120
 formally its completion 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:12.959
 but the lizards 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.839
 can scatter these seeds that far from the mother plant 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:20.359
 to places where they will have less competition to survive 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.139
 the studies carried out show that the seeds that have crossed 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.519
 that the females that fall directly from the mother plant 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:40.579
 the results obtained in these studies 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:41.549
 put on it 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.610
 I felt that the ocellated lizards constitute 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.960
 a key component in the landscape configuration 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:52.899
 and dynamics of shrub ecosystems in the Atlantic islands of 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.939
 Galicia
