the most important things though is to
get<00:00:25.830> your<00:00:25.920> white<00:00:26.070> balance<00:00:26.250> right<00:00:26.640> if<00:00:27.060> your

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
get your white balance right if your

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.910 
get your white balance right if your
pictures<00:00:27.990> looking<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.289> bit<00:00:28.380> blue<00:00:28.560> what<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.769> see

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
pictures looking a bit blue what you see

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.140 
pictures looking a bit blue what you see
pictures<00:00:29.279> where<00:00:29.429> they've<00:00:29.550> got<00:00:29.640> snow<00:00:29.939> on<00:00:30.000> it

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
pictures where they've got snow on it

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.120 
pictures where they've got snow on it
and<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.330> snows<00:00:30.570> below<00:00:30.929> simply<00:00:31.650> because<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
and the snows below simply because the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.639 
and the snows below simply because the
white<00:00:32.279> balance<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.700> offset<00:00:33.059> now<00:00:33.870> if<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.380> can

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
white balance is offset now if you can

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.170 
white balance is offset now if you can
control<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.100> white<00:00:35.309> balance<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.820> camera

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
control the white balance in the camera

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.560 
control the white balance in the camera
what<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.540> need<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.840> do<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:38.010> point<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.239> at<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
what you need to do is point it at the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.410 
what you need to do is point it at the
snow<00:00:40.010> not<00:00:41.010> where<00:00:41.190> you've<00:00:41.340> got<00:00:41.460> sunlight<00:00:41.910> if

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
snow not where you've got sunlight if

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.510 
snow not where you've got sunlight if
you<00:00:42.570> can<00:00:42.750> find<00:00:42.989> an<00:00:43.170> area<00:00:43.379> which<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.219> something

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
you can find an area which is something

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.240 
you can find an area which is something
alike<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:46.500> will<00:00:46.680> set<00:00:46.920> your<00:00:47.070> white

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
alike that that will set your white

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.430 
alike that that will set your white
balance<00:00:47.309> go<00:00:48.149> into<00:00:48.300> your<00:00:48.390> auto<00:00:48.570> menu<00:00:49.020> going<00:00:49.289> to

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
balance go into your auto menu going to

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.920 
balance go into your auto menu going to
your<00:00:49.559> set<00:00:49.710> white<00:00:49.890> balance<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.430> then<00:00:51.360> point<00:00:51.690> an

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
your set white balance and then point an

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.139 
your set white balance and then point an
area<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.949> want<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.280> call<00:00:53.579> white<00:00:53.850> and

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
area that you want to call white and

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.569 
area that you want to call white and
then<00:00:54.449> use<00:00:54.600> something<00:00:55.020> like<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.430> stay<00:00:56.430> away

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
then use something like that stay away

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.400 
then use something like that stay away
from<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.850> sunlight<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.480> confuses<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.079> you

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
from the sunlight that confuses it you

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.439 
from the sunlight that confuses it you
know<00:00:58.559> anywhere<00:00:59.070> where<00:00:59.370> you've<00:00:59.489> got<00:00:59.670> nice<00:00:59.879> dark

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
know anywhere where you've got nice dark

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.460 
know anywhere where you've got nice dark
even<00:01:01.760> without<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:03.750> know<00:01:03.870> any<00:01:03.899> kinda

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
even without you know any kinda

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.620 
even without you know any kinda
interfering<00:01:05.159> light<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.390> will<00:01:06.479> do

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
interfering light on it and that will do

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.469 
interfering light on it and that will do
it<00:01:06.659> once<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.799> set<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.180> going<00:01:09.270> to

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
it once you set that on that is going to

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.050 
it once you set that on that is going to
give<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:10.439> proper<00:01:11.159> white<00:01:11.369> balance<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.880> it's

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
give you a proper white balance and it's

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.460 
give you a proper white balance and it's
going<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.240> get<00:01:12.330> your<00:01:12.479> snow<00:01:12.689> looking<00:01:12.960> white<00:01:13.229> as

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
going to get your snow looking white as

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.340 
going to get your snow looking white as
it<00:01:13.619> should<00:01:13.799> be<00:01:13.979> it's<00:01:14.130> not<00:01:14.250> blue<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.790> white

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
it should be it's not blue it's white

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.950 
it should be it's not blue it's white
the<00:01:16.350> other<00:01:16.409> thing<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:18.090> exposure<00:01:18.509> now

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
the other thing is the exposure now

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.260 
the other thing is the exposure now
because<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.439> light<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.830> very<00:01:19.860> bright<00:01:20.270> there's

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
because the light is very bright there's

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.490 
because the light is very bright there's
lots<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.540> sunlight<00:01:21.900> reflecting<00:01:22.439> off

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
lots of sunlight reflecting off

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.840 
lots of sunlight reflecting off
everything<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> camera<00:01:23.369> thinks<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:23.759> a

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
everything the camera thinks it's a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.810 
everything the camera thinks it's a
brighter<00:01:24.710> it<00:01:25.710> needs<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.009> damnit<00:01:26.460> because<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
brighter it needs to damnit because the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.910 
brighter it needs to damnit because the
scenes<00:01:27.030> appearing<00:01:27.479> very<00:01:27.630> bright<00:01:27.869> now<00:01:28.740> what

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
scenes appearing very bright now what

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.740 
scenes appearing very bright now what
you<00:01:29.009> need<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.310> do<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.700> if<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.150> can<00:01:30.299> controlling

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
you need to do is if you can controlling

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.109 
you need to do is if you can controlling
an<00:01:30.810> exposure<00:01:31.200> what<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.130> exposure<00:01:32.490> give<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.090> a

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
an exposure what the exposure give it a

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.760 
an exposure what the exposure give it a
little<00:01:33.270> bit<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.600> longer<00:01:33.869> exposure<00:01:34.079> maybe

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
little bit of a longer exposure maybe

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.740 
little bit of a longer exposure maybe
not<00:01:34.979> got<00:01:35.220> one<00:01:35.369> stops<00:01:35.759> one<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.299> half<00:01:36.390> to

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
not got one stops one and a half to

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.710 
not got one stops one and a half to
maybe<00:01:36.990> or<00:01:37.740> what<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.400> like<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.820> do<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.390> forget

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
maybe or what I like to do is forget
