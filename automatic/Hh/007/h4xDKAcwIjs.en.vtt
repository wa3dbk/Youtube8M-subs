00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
in a lot of these matches you can even

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.100 
in a lot of these matches you can even
see<00:03:38.050> the<00:03:38.920> lag<00:03:39.130> like<00:03:39.519> on<00:03:39.910> a<00:03:39.970> replay<00:03:40.600> or<00:03:40.870> whatever

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
to be played dead or alive is a

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.809 
to be played dead or alive is a
fast-paced<00:03:48.560> really<00:03:49.560> reactive<00:03:50.160> three

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
fast-paced really reactive three

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.640 
fast-paced really reactive three
fighters<00:03:51.270> so<00:03:51.690> like<00:03:51.959> when<00:03:52.890> you're<00:03:53.310> muddled<00:03:54.650> for

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
fighters so like when you're muddled for

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.979

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
like a better word it's pretty hard to

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.820 
like a better word it's pretty hard to
play<00:03:58.260> this<00:03:58.410> game<00:03:58.650> at<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.880> competitive<00:04:00.300> level

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
play this game at a competitive level

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.890

let<00:04:01.830> alone<00:04:01.860> get<00:04:02.370> angry<00:04:02.760> about<00:04:02.970> it<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.390> you

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
let alone get angry about it and you

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.600 
let alone get angry about it and you
know<00:04:03.959> throw<00:04:04.290> tantrums<00:04:04.800> about<00:04:05.040> people<00:04:05.340> beating

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
know throw tantrums about people beating

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.360 
know throw tantrums about people beating
you<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:05.849> went<00:04:06.030> on<00:04:06.150> it's<00:04:06.540> just<00:04:07.160> ridiculous<00:04:08.160> but

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
you and went on it's just ridiculous but

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.100 
you and went on it's just ridiculous but
um<00:04:09.260> my<00:04:10.260> question<00:04:10.319> is<00:04:10.860> before<00:04:11.730> you<00:04:12.510> even<00:04:12.690> get<00:04:13.050> to

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
um my question is before you even get to

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.710 
um my question is before you even get to
the<00:04:13.290> lag<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:13.680> got<00:04:13.830> to<00:04:13.950> get<00:04:14.040> a<00:04:14.069> match<00:04:14.310> right

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
the lag you got to get a match right

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.690 
the lag you got to get a match right
finding<00:04:15.720> a<00:04:15.780> match<00:04:15.989> is<00:04:16.260> even<00:04:16.799> worse<00:04:17.040> at<00:04:17.639> least

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
finding a match is even worse at least

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.949 
finding a match is even worse at least
for<00:04:18.060> me<00:04:18.709> in<00:04:19.820> the<00:04:20.820> two<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:21.269> a<00:04:21.299> half<00:04:21.450> hours<00:04:21.810> it

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
for me in the two and a half hours it

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.770 
for me in the two and a half hours it
took<00:04:22.109> me<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.740> give<00:04:23.580> you<00:04:23.729> these<00:04:23.910> got<00:04:24.210> these

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
took me to give you these got these

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.590 
took me to give you these got these
three<00:04:25.020> matches<00:04:25.590> that<00:04:25.770> I<00:04:25.889> was<00:04:26.100> able<00:04:26.190> to<00:04:26.340> find<00:04:26.639> I
