00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
things we're going to have a couple of

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.590 
things we're going to have a couple of
wets

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
wets

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.410

one that's small that will be one egg

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.480 
one that's small that will be one egg
and<00:01:13.259> we'll<00:01:13.500> get<00:01:13.590> into<00:01:13.800> that<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.190> middle

problem

00:06:22.489 --> 00:06:22.499 
problem

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:27.080 
problem
we're<00:06:23.159> going<00:06:23.400> to<00:06:23.490> take<00:06:23.669> our<00:06:25.789> bowl<00:06:26.789> scraper

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
we're going to take our bowl scraper

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:32.540 
we're going to take our bowl scraper
here<00:06:27.629> and<00:06:28.020> use<00:06:28.740> that<00:06:28.770> to<00:06:29.810> remove<00:06:30.810> the<00:06:31.550> extra

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
here and use that to remove the extra

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.439 
here and use that to remove the extra
dough<00:06:33.029> that's<00:06:33.479> on<00:06:33.779> the<00:06:34.110> panel<00:06:34.379> right<00:06:34.529> now<00:06:34.589> and

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:35.449 
dough that's on the panel right now and

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:39.649 
dough that's on the panel right now and
what<00:06:36.449> we're<00:06:36.629> going<00:06:36.810> to<00:06:36.870> do<00:06:37.610> next<00:06:38.610> is<00:06:39.089> let<00:06:39.449> the

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:39.659 
what we're going to do next is let the

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:41.540 
what we're going to do next is let the
dough<00:06:39.839> rest<00:06:40.169> for<00:06:40.560> about<00:06:40.620> ten<00:06:41.009> minutes

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
dough rest for about ten minutes

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.529 
dough rest for about ten minutes
why<00:06:42.270> because<00:06:43.050> the<00:06:44.039> flour<00:06:44.310> is<00:06:44.699> still<00:06:45.089> being

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 
why because the flour is still being

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:49.399 
why because the flour is still being
incorporated<00:06:45.900> into<00:06:46.499> the<00:06:46.620> dough<00:06:46.889> and<00:06:48.409> it's

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:49.409 
incorporated into the dough and it's

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:52.999 
incorporated into the dough and it's
very<00:06:49.770> sticky<00:06:50.219> as<00:06:50.610> you<00:06:51.089> can<00:06:51.270> see<00:06:51.830> like<00:06:52.830> it's

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:53.009 
very sticky as you can see like it's

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:55.100 
very sticky as you can see like it's
going<00:06:53.189> to<00:06:53.219> be<00:06:53.339> a<00:06:53.370> little<00:06:53.669> less<00:06:53.849> sticky<00:06:54.210> after

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110 
going to be a little less sticky after

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.589 
going to be a little less sticky after
ten<00:06:55.319> minutes<00:06:55.650> I'm<00:06:56.009> going<00:06:56.550> to<00:06:56.639> cover<00:06:56.909> this<00:06:57.300> bowl

00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599

minutes
we'll<00:07:03.029> see<00:07:03.330> how<00:07:03.719> the<00:07:03.779> dough<00:07:04.229> has<00:07:04.620> progressed
