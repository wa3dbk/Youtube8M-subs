00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.609
 what's up kids like this or this 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.800
 same new theories of wampis like this 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:11.290
 by symbols tutorials of my ethnic group 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.780
 won takes the theories with interesting 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.550
 what is this saga the world is in this 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:23.159
 video I'll talk a little about my 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:23.159
 tournament theories let's start 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:42.039
 in the final of the tournament we have five 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:45.190
 finalists who are saved in burgos 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:47.379
 diamond bartolomeo and 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.870
 from the 5 personally I think that you 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.670
 they like the cardigan although it is a character 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.280
 pretty weak and this is something 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.140
 contradictory and although cardigan is a 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.719
 character that I like very much I think that 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.049
 he will win it and good because I believe this 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.100
 I think that or if the average and the final is 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:06.159
 because he is going to play an important role 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.680
 because he's a much more character 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.119
 weaker than the other finalists and if 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.560
 I wanted to put a character something more 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.100
 strong I think it can improve 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.950
 cavendish 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.420
 so if I put cardigans because it's going to 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.429
 play an important role in the final 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.080
 I think the bad guys so to speak of 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:24.909
 tournament that are in bourgeois diamond 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.670
 going to the win and the desire to 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.420
 bourgeois would surely be given to ship 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.560
 black and if this one gets is the way 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.259
 inside another fruit and having three 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.970
 it would be previously powerful and it would be 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.909
 very unbalanced story in the future 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.399
 diamond I do not think I win it either because 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.409
 I do not see such a powerful character to 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.600
 less as I go out fourth is not a 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.240
 powerful character but I do not think that the 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.899
 win because it is not so powerful 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.659
 as he knows and I think if he wins 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.869
 bartolomé or that will not win 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.960
 I would try lupit and we would stay rebbeca 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.240
 is something are very powerful characters or 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.640
 at least that seems and it would be a bit 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.300
 I miss that after so long without 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.819
 appear appear now and do not win the 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.769
 tournament because we can be 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.680
 pressing and believing he was dead 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.650
 appears now and it would be a bit absurd 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.900
 that the tournament novás and its first 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.209
 battle I lost but I think that 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.720
 will be quite busy trying 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.850
 stop bourgeois diamond and 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.950
 protecting the cardigan I think that protect 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.840
 Rebeca next to barceló meo and cardigan 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.260
 will be a little probing 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.810
 dodging blows and in a moment of 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.670
 carelessness could catch the mere mere not 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.840
 mile that will be free and will not have a 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.970
 fixed enemy 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.400
 and for these reasons I think it's rebbeca 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.230
 the standard to the mere looking at me though 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.099
 personally I would like it to win 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.830
 I know not rule this but do not know anymore 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.379
 that as I say the mind a character like 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.840
 cardigan in the final I think he will play 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:05.319
 an important role and possibly the 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.319
 win and I up here carry this little 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:11.349
 theory about who I think the 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.930
 end of the tournament we liked it 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.060
 forget to leave like i subscribe to 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.160
 channel and the comments you can leave 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.590
 your opinions theories what 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.180
 You want to know who you think will win the 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.180
 until the next tournament
