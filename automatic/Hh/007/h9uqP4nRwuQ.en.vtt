00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
everything so now the unit is closed /

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.690 
everything so now the unit is closed /
three<00:01:37.619> times<00:01:37.830> and<00:01:37.979> normally<00:01:38.250> then<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.490> found

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
three times and normally then I found

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:54.440 
three times and normally then I found
the<00:01:38.850> percent

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:01.880 

I<00:01:59.119> close<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.329> now<00:02:00.420> i<00:02:00.450> open<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.990> just<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.770> little

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
I close and now i open it just a little

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.319 
I close and now i open it just a little
bit<00:02:02.039> again<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.430> i<00:02:02.460> don't<00:02:02.729> get<00:02:02.880> any<00:02:03.030> over

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
bit again so i don't get any over

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.529 
bit again so i don't get any over
pressure<00:02:03.600> on<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.869> system<00:02:05.030> you<00:02:06.030> look<00:02:06.210> at<00:02:06.329> the

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
pressure on the system you look at the

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.620 
pressure on the system you look at the
after<00:02:06.929> hurts<00:02:07.289> i<00:02:07.580> switch<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.759> on<00:02:08.910> one<00:02:09.599> two<00:02:10.440> three

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
after hurts i switch it on one two three

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.059 
after hurts i switch it on one two three
look<00:02:13.280> splash<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.430> two<00:02:14.640> times<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.209> will<00:02:15.780> beat<00:02:16.069> 12

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
look splash is two times I will beat 12

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.960 
look splash is two times I will beat 12
I<00:02:17.550> know<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.209> starts<00:02:19.050> 1<00:02:19.560> 2<00:02:19.830> 3<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:20.340> was<00:02:20.549> difficult

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
I know it starts 1 2 3 I was difficult

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.120 
I know it starts 1 2 3 I was difficult
to<00:02:21.000> see<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:22.290> now<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.500> shows<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.709> value<00:02:23.099> of

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
to see you and now it shows a value of

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.300 
to see you and now it shows a value of
both<00:02:23.340> cells<00:02:24.379> 99<00:02:25.379> of<00:02:25.560> course<00:02:25.739> I<00:02:25.830> don't<00:02:25.890> have<00:02:26.190> to

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
both cells 99 of course I don't have to

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.729 
both cells 99 of course I don't have to
calibrate<00:02:26.549> this<00:02:26.940> e<00:02:27.150> I'd<00:02:27.840> read<00:02:28.170> on<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.440> unit

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
calibrate this e I'd read on the unit

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.789 
calibrate this e I'd read on the unit
and<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:29.069> put<00:02:29.340> on<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.780> boat<00:02:30.780> both<00:02:31.140> so<00:02:31.380> units<00:02:31.680> and

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
and I put on the boat both so units and

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.800 
and I put on the boat both so units and
I<00:02:31.860> see<00:02:32.160> if<00:02:32.310> we<00:02:32.400> all<00:02:32.519> track<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.120> all<00:02:33.329> three<00:02:33.540> cells

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
I see if we all track to all three cells

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.990 
I see if we all track to all three cells
together<00:02:33.989> I<00:02:34.230> don't<00:02:34.470> calibrate<00:02:34.890> okay<00:02:35.280> cuz<00:02:35.610> it's

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
together I don't calibrate okay cuz it's

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.509 
together I don't calibrate okay cuz it's
pretty<00:02:36.329> unlikely<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:37.319> three<00:02:37.620> cells<00:02:37.920> would

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
pretty unlikely that three cells would

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.440 
pretty unlikely that three cells would
go<00:02:38.760> wrong<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.420> exactly<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.989> same<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:41.450> although

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
go wrong I exactly the same so although

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.059 
go wrong I exactly the same so although
I've<00:02:42.660> heard<00:02:42.810> three<00:02:42.989> politicians<00:02:43.530> like<00:02:43.739> same

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
I've heard three politicians like same

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.800 
I've heard three politicians like same
time<00:02:44.280> yeah<00:02:44.549> yeah<00:02:44.819> yeah<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.150> if<00:02:45.390> they<00:02:45.510> told<00:02:45.720> the

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
time yeah yeah yeah and if they told the

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:56.780 
time yeah yeah yeah and if they told the
same<00:02:46.019> life<00:02:46.230> that's<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.310> same<00:02:47.489> way<00:02:55.670> need<00:02:56.670> it

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
same life that's it the same way need it

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.740 
same life that's it the same way need it
open<00:02:57.060> at<00:02:57.180> night<00:02:57.360> good<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.290> can<00:02:58.349> it<00:02:58.500> dries<00:02:58.709> out

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
open at night good you can it dries out

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.590 
open at night good you can it dries out
so<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.810> cell<00:03:01.049> stay<00:03:01.319> drier<00:03:01.620> otherwise<00:03:02.600> salad

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
so the cell stay drier otherwise salad

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.780 
so the cell stay drier otherwise salad
is<00:03:03.780> not<00:03:04.260> so<00:03:04.410> good<00:03:04.560> when<00:03:04.739> they<00:03:04.829> keep<00:03:05.040> Yuma<00:03:05.579> to

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
is not so good when they keep Yuma to

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.349 
is not so good when they keep Yuma to
another<00:03:06.389> feeling<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.810> plastic<00:03:07.139> bag<00:03:07.290> again<00:03:07.560> it's

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
another feeling a plastic bag again it's

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.750
