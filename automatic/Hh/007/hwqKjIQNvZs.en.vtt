this<00:02:01.530> pretty<00:02:01.740> much<00:02:01.920> impossible<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.700> need<00:02:02.790> to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
this pretty much impossible you need to

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.520 
this pretty much impossible you need to
play<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.060> game<00:02:03.240> literally<00:02:03.630> perfectly<00:02:04.320> and

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
all that sort of stuff and it's like

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.030 
all that sort of stuff and it's like
they<00:02:14.210> literally<00:02:14.630> played<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.350> game<00:02:15.500> perfectly

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
they literally played the game perfectly

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.290 
they literally played the game perfectly
people<00:02:16.400> stayed<00:02:16.580> in<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.790> game<00:02:16.940> they<00:02:17.210> were

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
people stayed in the game they were

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.730 
people stayed in the game they were
constantly<00:02:17.540> getting<00:02:17.930> kills<00:02:18.170> or<00:02:18.350> constantly

constantly getting kills or constantly
getting<00:02:18.890> streaks<00:02:19.250> there's<00:02:19.820> pretty<00:02:20.030> much

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
getting streaks there's pretty much

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.550 
getting streaks there's pretty much
nothing<00:02:20.420> that<00:02:20.810> they<00:02:20.840> could<00:02:20.990> improve<00:02:21.380> on

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
nothing that they could improve on

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
nothing that they could really do better

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.550 
nothing that they could really do better
so<00:02:23.540> I<00:02:23.570> honestly<00:02:23.960> don't<00:02:24.110> know<00:02:24.200> if<00:02:24.290> that<00:02:24.410> three

I've<00:03:21.290> been<00:03:21.410> noticing<00:03:21.710> in<00:03:21.890> a<00:03:21.950> lot<00:03:22.070> of<00:03:22.190> game

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
I've been noticing in a lot of game

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.860 
I've been noticing in a lot of game
places<00:03:22.730> of<00:03:22.850> reason<00:03:23.240> is<00:03:23.360> that<00:03:23.390> some<00:03:23.660> people

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
places of reason is that some people

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.240 
places of reason is that some people
have<00:03:23.900> been<00:03:24.080> throwing<00:03:24.380> worship<00:03:24.860> on<00:03:24.980> rather

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
have been throwing worship on rather

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.770 
have been throwing worship on rather
their<00:03:25.490> dogs<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:25.970> I'm<00:03:26.390> honestly<00:03:26.690> thinking

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
their dogs and I'm honestly thinking

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.510 
their dogs and I'm honestly thinking
like<00:03:27.110> I<00:03:27.170> play<00:03:27.350> backups<00:03:27.710> to<00:03:27.740> the<00:03:27.890> other<00:03:28.040> day<00:03:28.310> and

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
like I play backups to the other day and

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.460 
like I play backups to the other day and
I<00:03:28.550> was<00:03:28.700> wondering<00:03:29.120> if<00:03:29.300> honestly<00:03:29.780> worship

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
I was wondering if honestly worship

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.200 
I was wondering if honestly worship
would<00:03:30.710> actually<00:03:31.100> maximize<00:03:31.430> your<00:03:31.730> kills<00:03:32.000> and

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
would actually maximize your kills and

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.240 
would actually maximize your kills and
when<00:03:32.810> I<00:03:32.840> was<00:03:33.020> using<00:03:33.200> it<00:03:33.410> it<00:03:33.530> really<00:03:33.710> does<00:03:33.980> kill

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
when I was using it it really does kill

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.010 
when I was using it it really does kill
people<00:03:34.520> quickly<00:03:34.700> but<00:03:35.030> it<00:03:35.060> gets<00:03:35.210> taken<00:03:35.480> out<00:03:35.690> so

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
people quickly but it gets taken out so

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.080 
people quickly but it gets taken out so
fast<00:03:36.350> compared<00:03:36.920> to<00:03:37.010> actually<00:03:37.640> like<00:03:37.760> everyone

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
fast compared to actually like everyone

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.670 
fast compared to actually like everyone
killing<00:03:38.390> all<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.630> dogs<00:03:38.900> so<00:03:39.440> when<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:39.620> have

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
killing all the dogs so when you have

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.530 
killing all the dogs so when you have
dogs<00:03:39.950> and<00:03:40.160> swarm<00:03:40.460> out<00:03:40.670> at<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.030> exact<00:03:41.390> same

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
dogs and swarm out at the exact same

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.420 
dogs and swarm out at the exact same
time<00:03:41.840> when<00:03:42.200> I<00:03:42.230> honestly<00:03:42.830> think<00:03:43.010> that<00:03:43.130> those

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
time when I honestly think that those

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.800 
time when I honestly think that those
would<00:03:43.610> get<00:03:43.790> more<00:03:43.940> kills<00:03:44.210> than<00:03:44.390> having<00:03:44.660> like<00:03:44.780> a

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
would get more kills than having like a

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.690 
would get more kills than having like a
warship<00:03:45.320> up<00:03:45.470> and<00:03:45.620> then<00:03:46.010> calling<00:03:46.280> a<00:03:46.340> swarm<00:03:46.580> or

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
warship up and then calling a swarm or

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.920 
warship up and then calling a swarm or
something<00:03:46.970> light<00:03:47.090> along<00:03:47.420> those<00:03:47.660> lines

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
something light along those lines

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.050 
something light along those lines
because<00:03:48.260> you<00:03:48.920> don't<00:03:49.070> have<00:03:49.160> to<00:03:49.610> kill<00:03:49.850> streaks

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
because you don't have to kill streaks

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.550 
because you don't have to kill streaks
going<00:03:50.120> habit<00:03:50.630> once<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:50.990> the<00:03:51.050> worship<00:03:51.350> is<00:03:51.410> just

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
going habit once and the worship is just

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.320 
going habit once and the worship is just
so<00:03:51.770> easy<00:03:52.010> you're<00:03:52.220> taken<00:03:52.580> out<00:03:52.700> and<00:03:52.880> it<00:03:53.210> usually

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
so easy you're taken out and it usually

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.460 
so easy you're taken out and it usually
gets<00:03:53.570> taken<00:03:53.750> out<00:03:53.900> every<00:03:54.080> single<00:03:54.320> time<00:03:54.440> you

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
gets taken out every single time you

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.200 
gets taken out every single time you
call<00:03:54.710> it<00:03:54.830> in<00:03:54.920> so<00:03:55.190> that's<00:03:55.700> one<00:03:55.850> thing<00:03:55.970> I<00:03:56.090> was

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
call it in so that's one thing I was

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.700 
call it in so that's one thing I was
kind<00:03:56.390> of<00:03:56.480> planning<00:03:56.630> about<00:03:56.990> I<00:03:57.020> didn't<00:03:57.530> really

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
kind of planning about I didn't really

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:58.870 
kind of planning about I didn't really
know<00:03:57.890> I<00:03:57.920> was<00:03:58.070> mixing<00:03:58.220> up<00:03:58.460> the<00:03:58.490> killstreaks

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
know I was mixing up the killstreaks

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.220 
know I was mixing up the killstreaks
just<00:03:59.000> trying<00:03:59.150> to<00:03:59.210> go<00:03:59.360> in<00:03:59.570> I<00:03:59.750> hadn't<00:03:59.960> played<00:04:00.080> in

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
just trying to go in I hadn't played in

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.870 
just trying to go in I hadn't played in
like<00:04:00.260> a<00:04:00.410> month<00:04:00.650> so<00:04:01.220> I<00:04:01.250> was<00:04:01.490> just<00:04:01.520> trying<00:04:01.820> to

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
like a month so I was just trying to

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.370 
like a month so I was just trying to
just<00:04:02.090> experiment<00:04:02.360> with<00:04:02.570> things<00:04:02.660> and<00:04:02.960> see<00:04:03.140> if<00:04:03.290> I

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
just experiment with things and see if I

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.660 
just experiment with things and see if I
could<00:04:03.440> get<00:04:03.650> on<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:03.770> grind<00:04:04.040> with<00:04:04.190> any<00:04:04.340> different

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
could get on a grind with any different

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.790 
could get on a grind with any different
sorts<00:04:04.970> of<00:04:05.060> setups<00:04:05.390> and<00:04:05.480> stuff<00:04:05.750> but<00:04:05.960> honestly<00:04:06.710> I

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
sorts of setups and stuff but honestly I

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.770 
sorts of setups and stuff but honestly I
don't<00:04:06.950> really<00:04:07.100> know<00:04:07.460> but<00:04:07.940> basically<00:04:08.270> to<00:04:08.750> sum
