particularly useful for understanding
diffraction<00:02:36.629> and<00:02:36.810> interference<00:02:38.480> for<00:02:39.480> example

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
diffraction and interference for example

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.680 
diffraction and interference for example
when<00:02:40.500> this<00:02:40.739> plane<00:02:41.129> wave<00:02:41.400> traveling<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.569> the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
when this plane wave traveling to the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.920 
when this plane wave traveling to the
right<00:02:42.959> hits<00:02:43.560> this<00:02:43.920> obstacle<00:02:44.489> we<00:02:45.239> can<00:02:45.450> say<00:02:45.690> that

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
right hits this obstacle we can say that

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.009 
right hits this obstacle we can say that
every<00:02:46.709> point<00:02:47.099> on<00:02:47.430> this<00:02:47.730> wavefront<00:02:48.390> is<00:02:48.599> a<00:02:48.690> new

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
every point on this wavefront is a new

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.680 
every point on this wavefront is a new
wave<00:02:49.260> source<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.489> wavelets<00:02:51.060> travel

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
wave source so the wavelets travel

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.920 
wave source so the wavelets travel
forward<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.530> that's<00:02:53.129> why<00:02:53.489> we<00:02:53.730> end<00:02:53.940> up<00:02:54.209> with<00:02:54.480> a

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
forward and that's why we end up with a

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.830 
forward and that's why we end up with a
wave<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:56.459> can<00:02:56.819> reach<00:02:57.120> behind<00:02:57.599> the<00:02:58.230> obstacle

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
wave that can reach behind the obstacle

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.410 
wave that can reach behind the obstacle
as<00:03:00.840> for<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:01.470> plane<00:03:01.829> wave<00:03:02.129> reaching<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.970> small

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
as for this plane wave reaching a small

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.229 
as for this plane wave reaching a small
gap<00:03:03.720> over<00:03:04.140> here<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:05.280> point<00:03:05.670> on<00:03:05.970> the

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
gap over here this point on the

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.720 
gap over here this point on the
wavefront<00:03:06.780> produces<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.590> new<00:03:07.920> wavelet<00:03:08.459> and

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
wavefront produces a new wavelet and

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.170 
wavefront produces a new wavelet and
this<00:03:09.540> new<00:03:09.810> wavelet<00:03:10.319> is<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:11.220> new<00:03:11.430> wave<00:03:11.790> that

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
this new wavelet is the new wave that

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.020 
this new wavelet is the new wave that
gets<00:03:12.510> through<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.230> spreads<00:03:13.889> to<00:03:14.579> reach<00:03:14.790> behind

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
gets through and spreads to reach behind

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.190 
gets through and spreads to reach behind
the<00:03:15.389> obstacle<00:03:16.579> in<00:03:17.579> the<00:03:17.819> next<00:03:18.090> few<00:03:18.329> lessons<00:03:18.540> we

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
the obstacle in the next few lessons we

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.409 
the obstacle in the next few lessons we
will<00:03:19.349> study<00:03:19.680> how<00:03:19.950> Huygens<00:03:20.489> principle<00:03:20.730> can<00:03:21.299> be

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
will study how Huygens principle can be

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.659 
will study how Huygens principle can be
used<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:22.049> explain<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.560> interference<00:03:23.370> in<00:03:23.579> the

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669 
used to explain the interference in the

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:27.200 
used to explain the interference in the
diffraction<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.419> light<00:03:24.510> waves
