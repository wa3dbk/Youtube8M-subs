more now we have an IND we know both

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.429 
more now we have an IND we know both
here<00:01:06.659> we<00:01:07.590> have<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> temperature<00:01:08.189> display<00:01:09.439> so

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
here we have a temperature display so

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.870 
here we have a temperature display so
that's<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.040> remote<00:01:11.280> temperature<00:01:11.729> it's

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
that's the remote temperature it's

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.510 
that's the remote temperature it's
displaying<00:01:14.060> this<00:01:15.229> XP<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.680> queried<00:01:16.920> for

lot of information about the other XP

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.109 
lot of information about the other XP
like<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.979> analog<00:01:26.369> pin<00:01:26.700> which<00:01:26.880> we<00:01:27.030> have

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
like the analog pin which we have

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.160 
like the analog pin which we have
configured<00:01:27.740> that<00:01:28.740> sends<00:01:29.130> about<00:01:29.780> 2<00:01:30.780> bytes<00:01:31.020> of

configured that sends about 2 bytes of
data<00:01:32.659> corresponding<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.930> value<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
data corresponding to the value of the

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.450 
data corresponding to the value of the
temperature<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:37.439> based<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.100> we've

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
temperature so based on that we've

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.609 
temperature so based on that we've
danced<00:01:38.670> certain<00:01:39.299> calculations<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:40.110> are

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
danced certain calculations and are

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.069 
danced certain calculations and are
displaying<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.159> temperature<00:01:41.579> here<00:01:42.079> now

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
displaying the temperature here now

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.530 
displaying the temperature here now
let's<00:01:43.680> see<00:01:43.950> let's<00:01:44.399> light<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> fire<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.240> see<00:01:45.479> if

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
let's see let's light a fire and see if

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:55.960 
let's see let's light a fire and see if
the<00:01:45.659> temperature<00:01:46.020> raises<00:01:53.329> you<00:01:54.329> can<00:01:54.509> see

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
the temperature raises you can see

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.100 
the temperature raises you can see
you<00:01:56.420> can<00:01:56.540> see<00:01:56.720> it's<00:01:56.990> going<00:01:57.260> up<00:01:58.390> it's<00:01:59.390> going<00:01:59.840> up

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
you can see it's going up it's going up

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:08.320 
you can see it's going up it's going up
and<00:02:00.940> yeah<00:02:01.940> it's<00:02:02.270> okay<00:02:04.450> so<00:02:05.710> so<00:02:06.910> using<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.030> API

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
and yeah it's okay so so using the API

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.580 
and yeah it's okay so so using the API
mode<00:02:08.630> with<00:02:08.960> an<00:02:09.050> XP<00:02:09.920> is<00:02:10.220> very<00:02:11.000> interesting<00:02:11.690> you

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
mode with an XP is very interesting you

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.840 
mode with an XP is very interesting you
don't<00:02:12.770> actually<00:02:13.220> require<00:02:13.430> another

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
don't actually require another

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.900 
don't actually require another
microcontroller<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.780> other<00:02:15.170> end<00:02:15.380> so<00:02:16.070> if<00:02:16.730> you

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
microcontroller the other end so if you

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.670 
microcontroller the other end so if you
hook<00:02:17.090> up<00:02:17.270> if<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:17.600> want<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:17.990> do<00:02:18.320> this<00:02:18.440> with<00:02:18.620> the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680
