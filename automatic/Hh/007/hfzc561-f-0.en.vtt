00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
there is a wire runs to the turn signal

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.190 
there is a wire runs to the turn signal
down<00:00:44.090> this<00:00:44.330> tube<00:00:44.660> down<00:00:45.590> and<00:00:45.980> in<00:00:46.690> down<00:00:47.690> backing

down this tube down and in down backing
into<00:00:48.350> here<00:00:48.740> see<00:00:49.460> there<00:00:49.640> right<00:00:49.820> in<00:00:49.970> here<00:00:50.210> now

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
into here see there right in here now

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.920 
into here see there right in here now
they're<00:00:50.750> all<00:00:50.870> bunched<00:00:51.079> up<00:00:51.320> I<00:00:51.579> failed<00:00:52.579> to

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.660 
right there my pinkies point is a boat
there<00:01:03.620> that's<00:01:03.829> it<00:01:04.009> and<00:01:04.220> then<00:01:04.339> there's<00:01:04.519> too

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.609 
there that's it and then there's too
little<00:01:04.699> pegs<00:01:05.119> once<00:01:05.360> that's<00:01:05.570> come<00:01:05.750> off<00:01:05.899> the

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
little pegs once that's come off the

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:07.870 
little pegs once that's come off the
connector<00:01:07.009> switches<00:01:07.340> are<00:01:07.460> back<00:01:07.579> there<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:07.850> I

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
connector switches are back there so I

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.760 
connector switches are back there so I
could<00:01:08.000> have<00:01:08.120> easily<00:01:08.240> disconnected<00:01:08.960> them<00:01:09.050> what

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
could have easily disconnected them what

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.219 
could have easily disconnected them what
I<00:01:09.800> did<00:01:10.040> however<00:01:10.220> like<00:01:10.880> a<00:01:10.909> douche<00:01:11.210> bag<00:01:11.450> is<00:01:11.720> cut

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
through cuz it doesn't connect on the

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.469 
through cuz it doesn't connect on the
inside<00:01:15.770> so<00:01:16.010> like<00:01:16.250> a<00:01:16.280> dickhead<00:01:16.550> I<00:01:16.820> cut<00:01:17.030> them<00:01:17.210> and

necessary tools that I think I can use I

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.380 
necessary tools that I think I can use I
had<00:01:49.100> a<00:01:49.130> bunch<00:01:49.250> of<00:01:49.369> tools<00:01:49.549> off<00:01:49.760> my<00:01:49.909> rack<00:01:50.119> here

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390
