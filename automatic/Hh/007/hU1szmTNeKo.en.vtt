put it on the back of the bicycle here

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.580 
put it on the back of the bicycle here
it<00:02:05.040> will<00:02:05.130> add<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.280> little<00:02:05.430> more<00:02:05.610> weight<00:02:06.590> back

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
it will add a little more weight back

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.840 
it will add a little more weight back
here<00:02:07.920> but<00:02:08.250> if<00:02:08.820> it's<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:10.220> relatively<00:02:11.220> evenly

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
here but if it's a relatively evenly

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.390 
here but if it's a relatively evenly
distributed<00:02:13.490> it's<00:02:14.490> not<00:02:14.640> really<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:14.940> problem

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
distributed it's not really a problem

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.780 
distributed it's not really a problem
so<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:18.500> also<00:02:19.500> got<00:02:19.800> these<00:02:19.980> bar<00:02:20.250> ends<00:02:20.550> here

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
so that also got these bar ends here

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.390 
so that also got these bar ends here
just<00:02:21.600> want<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.840> mention<00:02:22.200> these<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:23.040> allow<00:02:23.220> an

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
just want to mention these to allow an

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.199 
just want to mention these to allow an
alternative<00:02:24.060> way<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:25.700> holding<00:02:26.700> on<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.120> the

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
alternative way of holding on to the

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.000 
alternative way of holding on to the
bicycle<00:02:27.660> so<00:02:28.080> if<00:02:28.170> you're<00:02:28.320> writing<00:02:28.500> for<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.860> while

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
bicycle so if you're writing for a while

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.340 
bicycle so if you're writing for a while
you<00:02:29.190> can<00:02:29.250> move<00:02:29.430> back<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.820> forth<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.450> also<00:02:30.930> find

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
you can move back and forth I also find

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.210 
you can move back and forth I also find
it<00:02:31.590> gripping<00:02:32.280> up<00:02:32.400> here<00:02:33.830> positions<00:02:34.830> my<00:02:34.980> body

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
it gripping up here positions my body

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.470 
it gripping up here positions my body
more<00:02:35.900> aerodynamically<00:02:37.040> with<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.190> bicycle

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.449 

and<00:02:42.480> then<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:43.140> also<00:02:43.380> have<00:02:43.680> some<00:02:43.709> reflectors

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
and then I also have some reflectors

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.060 
and then I also have some reflectors
down<00:02:44.700> here<00:02:46.040> that<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.100> added<00:02:47.400> on<00:02:48.860> when<00:02:49.860> light

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
down here that I added on when light

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.270 
down here that I added on when light
hits<00:02:50.100> those<00:02:50.550> they<00:02:50.820> are<00:02:51.270> relatively<00:02:51.720> bright

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
hits those they are relatively bright

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.460 
hits those they are relatively bright
and<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:54.150> kickstand<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.660> have<00:02:54.959> an<00:02:55.140> aluminum

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
kickstand it came with a steel kickstand

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.150 
kickstand it came with a steel kickstand
but<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.870> put<00:03:00.870> on<00:03:00.959> an<00:03:01.080> aluminum<00:03:01.500> one<00:03:01.650> because<00:03:02.040> the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
but I put on an aluminum one because the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.690 
but I put on an aluminum one because the
