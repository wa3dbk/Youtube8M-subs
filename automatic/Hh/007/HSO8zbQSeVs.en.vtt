00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
a little bit different here it's more

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:48.160 
a little bit different here it's more
plain<00:02:12.370> here<00:02:13.370> at<00:02:13.520> us<00:02:13.730> like<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.090> shadow<00:02:14.510> on<00:02:14.630> over

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.000 

you

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.470 

okay<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.700> was<00:02:52.879> six<00:02:54.280> phone<00:02:55.280> here<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:56.180> was<00:02:56.450> a

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
okay the I was six phone here it was a

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.780 
okay the I was six phone here it was a
little<00:02:56.719> bit<00:02:56.840> quicker<00:02:57.219> in<00:02:58.219> terms<00:02:58.459> of<00:02:58.549> booting

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
little bit quicker in terms of booting

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.360 
little bit quicker in terms of booting
up<00:02:58.909> but<00:02:59.209> it<00:02:59.480> wasn't<00:02:59.780> really<00:02:59.900> big<00:03:00.439> big<00:03:00.890> massive

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
up but it wasn't really big big massive

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.849 
up but it wasn't really big big massive
difference<00:03:01.780> actually<00:03:02.780> they<00:03:02.959> think<00:03:03.260> that<00:03:03.530> it

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
difference actually they think that it

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:05.770 
difference actually they think that it
would<00:03:03.980> be<00:03:04.129> a<00:03:04.159> bigger<00:03:04.400> difference<00:03:04.609> but<00:03:05.030> it's

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
would be a bigger difference but it's

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.629 
would be a bigger difference but it's
not<00:03:05.900> really<00:03:06.079> super<00:03:06.620> big<00:03:06.829> difference<00:03:07.280> there<00:03:07.489> in

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:07.639 
not really super big difference there in

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.089 
not really super big difference there in
terms<00:03:07.879> of<00:03:08.299> that<00:03:09.230> so<00:03:09.620> that<00:03:09.650> could<00:03:09.950> definitely

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
terms of that so that could definitely

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.699 
terms of that so that could definitely
be<00:03:10.400> good<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:11.090> know<00:03:11.359> so<00:03:11.810> you<00:03:12.019> just<00:03:12.349> want<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.590> make

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
be good to know so you just want to make

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.160
