hideous front yard area so that's
awesome<00:02:47.069> and<00:02:47.690> here<00:02:48.690> I<00:02:48.720> am<00:02:48.900> trying<00:02:49.109> to<00:02:49.440> decide

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
awesome and here I am trying to decide

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.590 
awesome and here I am trying to decide
where<00:02:50.370> I<00:02:50.430> want<00:02:50.549> to<00:02:50.579> put<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.790> flowers<00:02:51.150> it's<00:02:51.480> a

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
where I want to put the flowers it's a

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.849 
where I want to put the flowers it's a
little<00:02:51.870> difficult<00:02:52.019> because<00:02:52.319> there<00:02:52.470> was<00:02:52.590> so

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
little difficult because there was so

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.530 
little difficult because there was so
many<00:02:52.980> people<00:02:53.100> walking<00:02:53.489> by<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.000> it's<00:02:54.209> just

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
many people walking by and it's just

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.809 
many people walking by and it's just
super<00:02:54.810> crowded<00:02:55.200> I<00:02:55.980> guess<00:02:56.400> that's<00:02:56.579> what<00:02:56.670> I<00:02:56.730> get

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
super crowded I guess that's what I get

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.250 
super crowded I guess that's what I get
for<00:02:56.970> living<00:02:57.209> downtown<00:02:57.359> and<00:02:57.630> I<00:02:57.900> guess<00:02:58.079> that's

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
for living downtown and I guess that's

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.809 
for living downtown and I guess that's
another<00:02:58.380> reason<00:02:58.680> why<00:02:58.920> this<00:02:58.980> is<00:02:59.160> friend<00:02:59.459> areas

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
another reason why this is friend areas

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.479 
another reason why this is friend areas
