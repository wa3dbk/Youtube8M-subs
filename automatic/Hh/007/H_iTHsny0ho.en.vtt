00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.399
Emanuele Scarello, from"Gli Amici" a restaurant
that has been in Udine since 1887 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:30.309
Today I'd like to show you Amatriciana
our own Amatriciana recipe

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:34.769
a contemporary recipe. The ingredients are:
white onion cut in julienne strips

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:36.340
very thin strips

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.500
pork rinds, a bay leaf,
minced guanciale /pork cheek

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.949
tomato purée

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:45.240
ground red pepper flakes /cayenne

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.910
a whole onion

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.040
pasta

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.930
extra virgin olive oil, cold

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.549
some mutli-colored cherry tomatoes
basil 

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:59.429
and the essential ingredient: Pecorino cheese.
First thing, let's take an onion and

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.640
bake it 
in a convection oven preheated to 220°C

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.090
for  at least 1 hour and 20 minutes 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.900
Meantime, let's start preparing our
Amatriciana sauce.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.230
With pork rinds, let's just

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.210
very slightly grease
the bottom of a nonstick skillet.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.780
We're giving a great fragrance

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.190
to the onion that we’ll
 slowly brown.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.490
Add a little oil
and  continue

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.450
cooking over a low flame. Meanwhile,
let's also brown the guanciale “pork cheeks.”

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.410
Stir the onion carefully.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.000
Personally, I like to add a bit
of bay leaf for fragrance.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.440
Fine, the skillet is hot.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.850
Add all the pork cheeks
and distribute them around 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:43.820
the skillet.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.510
Let's add a bit more salt,

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.230
Put the pasta in,

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.930
let's go on stirring

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.770
the onion carefully

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.270
and the pork cheeks as well.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.560
Remove

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.620
the pork rinds

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.220
and the bay leaf.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:09.849
The pork cheeks are perfectly browned.
Now let's add them to the onion.

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.189
Mix in

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:15.549
the tomato purée until well combined.

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.119
Add salt

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:19.279
and a touch of red pepper

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:22.019
and some more extra virgin olive oil.

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.620
Now we'll let it thicken and
then we'll blend it.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.390
When it’s well blended, put it
into a pastry bag.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.109
We'll need this for our Amatriciana.
Wonderful, the pasta is ready.

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.619
Strain it very well,
then

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:40.539
quickly toss it
into the cold oil.

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:45.179
Why? Because it immediately stops the cooking process

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:49.389
Cover the pasta and set aside,
so it stays perfectly al dente

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.999
just as it should be for a true
Italian pasta.

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:55.259
Now onto our Amatriciana:

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:56.100
let's

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.629
fill the pasta shells.

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.529
As in all true Amatricianas, we have
to add a delicate coating of

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:08.389
Pecorino cheese. Using tweezers to avoid
crushing it, we'll lay it onto every shell.

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:13.480
Our Amatriciana looks ready:
some freshly ground black pepper

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.620
Do you remember about the onion I baked
in the oven? Good.  I blended it

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.029
to get a “cream” that we're going to
add to the dish.

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:26.299
Let's finish with two basil leaves

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.389
and a drop of oil

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.259
My Amatriciana.

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:32.719
Everybody,

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:40.999
Enjoy your pasta!
