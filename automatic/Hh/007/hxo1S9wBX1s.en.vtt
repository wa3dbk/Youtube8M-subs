00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119

and I usually put my finger sort of in

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.970 
and I usually put my finger sort of in
the<00:00:32.840> like<00:00:33.840> right<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.079> front<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> front

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the like right in front of the front

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.450 
the like right in front of the front
truck<00:00:35.130> pulls<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:36.600> big<00:00:36.780> fingers<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.710> may

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
truck pulls I have big fingers so it may

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.060 
truck pulls I have big fingers so it may
be<00:00:38.489> different<00:00:38.940> for<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.270> but<00:00:39.710> this<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.920> how<00:00:41.040> i

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
be different for you but this is how i

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.549 
be different for you but this is how i
did<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:42.059> then<00:00:42.270> pretty<00:00:42.930> much<00:00:42.989> like<00:00:43.350> right

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
did it and then pretty much like right

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.750 
did it and then pretty much like right
there<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:45.300> usually<00:00:45.570> my<00:00:45.780> front<00:00:46.680> finger<00:00:47.340> sort

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
there and I usually my front finger sort

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.240 
there and I usually my front finger sort
of<00:00:47.880> like<00:00:47.970> that<00:00:48.210> almost<00:00:49.080> flush<00:00:49.290> with<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.530> other

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
of like that almost flush with the other

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.600 
of like that almost flush with the other
side<00:00:50.550> forward<00:00:51.560> and<00:00:53.060> that's<00:00:54.060> probably<00:00:55.610> that's

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
side forward and that's probably that's

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.190 
side forward and that's probably that's
why<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.880> could<00:00:57.180> put<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.480> for<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.930> have<00:00:58.079> your

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
why I could put it for you to have your

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.510 
why I could put it for you to have your
fingers<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.980> know<00:00:59.100> everyone's

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
fingers but you know everyone's

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:08.370 
fingers but you know everyone's
different<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.860> just<00:01:02.810> find<00:01:03.810> your<00:01:04.019> placement

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.370 

now<00:01:09.380> when<00:01:09.920> it<00:01:10.009> comes<00:01:10.070> time<00:01:10.580> to<00:01:10.610> doing<00:01:11.060> them<00:01:11.380> you

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
now when it comes time to doing them you
