00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.339
 hello again i would like 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.569
 to demonstrate 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.870
 interesting experiment too 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.799
 which I already spent last year in 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:19.470
 this year we continue this bush 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:22.199
 sort of cache and tenge will be decided in this 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.720
 last year there was no 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:32.309
 practicing harvest but it was done 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:34.260
 it means the work of growing it was 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.809
 adopted and all these non skinner to have seams 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.250
 lithuania investigating the powerful bush that we are in 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:45.980
 last year made the same year 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:50.399
 loaded in full he 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:54.930
 that is, practically the view is everywhere 20 on it 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:58.410
 I have once again the edge of the bush is here on these 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.800
 people stamp bush just second year 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.820
 from the family 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.890
 but with good agrotechnology 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:12.810
 I speak in the second year we get already 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:15.630
 over 20 and even mud grapes 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:20.920
 translation to him provided of course with us 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.840
 growing pretty pretty for that 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.759
 need agrotechnology features that 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.759
 appropriate fertilizer fields highlights 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.750
 I ask to pay attention sort of cache 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:40.119
 it is only now the fifth day of her today 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:44.920
 months and 14 years and how it grows 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:48.880
 and this year and last year we could 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.660
 from my videos see what's his 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.280
 formed 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:58.119
 pony traditional pattern and here it is in this 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:03.060
 year has grown over two 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.060
 half a meter today and 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:14.790
 No, I think it will be a good indicator 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:16.420
 have both vines and harvests 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.610
 berries 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:24.450
 how can it be from the other side 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.450
 see more quality here 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:37.930
 clusters as far as her 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:41.800
 great now they have them also 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:46.100
 contemplate seeing more than a month and a half 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:52.780
 varieties full of quite good shows 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.780
 the result can be seen very well 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.090
 load was 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.030
 practically unregulated but also for the sake of 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:08.840
 experiment that is, he instructed all that 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:12.239
 he gave we will further observe him by 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:16.280
 maturity and so on again 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:20.670
 even he left see the harvest on the parcel 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:24.420
 already cache she is pretty good too 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.780
 matures in the month of October in November 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.250
 you can have a good harvest 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.299
 true clusters of course will be from Odessa 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.810
 less but thanks nevertheless for 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.810
 Attention
