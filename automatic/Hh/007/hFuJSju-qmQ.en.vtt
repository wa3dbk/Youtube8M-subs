00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
with them and that in itself just

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.589 
with them and that in itself just
creates<00:02:56.200> this<00:02:56.379> whole<00:02:56.859> nother<00:02:57.420> level<00:02:58.420> of

one-to-one teaching model really differ

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.030 
one-to-one teaching model really differ
from<00:03:07.540> a<00:03:07.689> student's<00:03:08.049> experience<00:03:08.590> at<00:03:08.769> any<00:03:08.889> of

answer<00:03:14.200> that<00:03:14.349> with<00:03:14.500> an<00:03:14.620> example<00:03:14.980> so<00:03:15.189> first<00:03:15.849> I'm

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
answer that with an example so first I'm

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.580 
answer that with an example so first I'm
gonna<00:03:16.180> explain<00:03:16.569> how<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.049> then<00:03:17.170> I'll<00:03:17.290> give<00:03:17.470> an

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
gonna explain how and then I'll give an

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.849 
gonna explain how and then I'll give an
example<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:18.069> I<00:03:18.189> think<00:03:18.250> really<00:03:18.730> really

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
example that I think really really

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.849 
example that I think really really
drives<00:03:20.859> at<00:03:21.040> home<00:03:21.280> is<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:23.170> relationship<00:03:23.829> that

my<00:03:45.849> training<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:47.709> was<00:03:47.889> either<00:03:48.370> in<00:03:48.519> their

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
my training it was either in their

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.050 
my training it was either in their
office<00:03:49.090> hours<00:03:49.209> it<00:03:50.019> was<00:03:50.370> in<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.459> hallway<00:03:51.639> maybe

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
office hours it was in the hallway maybe

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.330 
office hours it was in the hallway maybe
if<00:03:52.299> I<00:03:52.419> could<00:03:52.479> try<00:03:52.720> to<00:03:52.780> catch<00:03:53.049> them<00:03:53.560> between

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
if I could try to catch them between

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.369 
if I could try to catch them between
classes<00:03:54.940> yes<00:03:55.180> exactly<00:03:55.870> or<00:03:55.959> you<00:03:56.049> know<00:03:56.109> maybe<00:03:56.260> a

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
classes yes exactly or you know maybe a

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:57.599 
classes yes exactly or you know maybe a
few<00:03:56.500> minutes<00:03:56.709> after<00:03:56.979> class<00:03:57.099> but<00:03:57.190> they're<00:03:57.489> off

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
few minutes after class but they're off

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
to another class and so there's very

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.680 
to another class and so there's very
limited<00:03:59.169> time<00:03:59.760> this<00:04:00.760> one<00:04:01.090> to<00:04:01.209> one<00:04:01.359> mentor

that's one specific way that I think
that<00:05:05.469> it's<00:05:06.279> very<00:05:06.549> different<00:05:06.819> than<00:05:07.089> what<00:05:07.149> I

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:07.829 
that it's very different than what I

00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:11.909 
that it's very different than what I
encountered<00:05:09.059> so<00:05:10.259> another<00:05:11.259> another<00:05:11.559> thing

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
encountered so another another thing

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.349

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:13.359 
before I get the example is that the

00:05:13.359 --> 00:05:14.729 
before I get the example is that the
relationships<00:05:14.019> that<00:05:14.139> we<00:05:14.229> build<00:05:14.259> with<00:05:14.529> our

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 
and so that really brings it a

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:04.749 
and so that really brings it a
completely<00:07:03.559> different<00:07:03.770> level<00:07:04.099> because<00:07:04.580> it

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:04.759 
completely different level because it

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:07.859 
completely different level because it
just<00:07:04.909> it's<00:07:05.389> not<00:07:05.539> just<00:07:05.779> about<00:07:05.990> the<00:07:06.589> the

00:07:07.859 --> 00:07:07.869 
just it's not just about the the

00:07:07.869 --> 00:07:10.059 
just it's not just about the the
individual<00:07:08.869> relationship<00:07:09.619> but<00:07:09.770> it's<00:07:09.919> now

00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:10.069 
individual relationship but it's now

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:11.950 
individual relationship but it's now
create<00:07:10.550> what<00:07:10.759> we<00:07:10.909> do<00:07:11.089> when<00:07:11.270> MFG<00:07:11.689> is<00:07:11.749> about

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 
create what we do when MFG is about

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.689 
create what we do when MFG is about
systems<00:07:12.379> and<00:07:12.499> this<00:07:12.649> is<00:07:12.770> my<00:07:12.919> entire<00:07:13.309> sister

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:13.699 
systems and this is my entire sister

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:15.309 
systems and this is my entire sister
whole<00:07:13.879> system<00:07:14.270> because<00:07:14.449> you<00:07:14.629> need<00:07:14.809> that<00:07:14.839> they

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:15.319 
whole system because you need that they

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:17.019 
whole system because you need that they
need<00:07:15.499> that<00:07:15.529> support<00:07:16.099> to<00:07:16.249> make<00:07:16.399> it<00:07:16.550> work

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:17.029 
need that support to make it work

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:18.579 
need that support to make it work
they're<00:07:17.180> all<00:07:17.330> part<00:07:17.629> of<00:07:17.779> it<00:07:17.899> so<00:07:18.080> bringing<00:07:18.409> them

00:07:18.579 --> 00:07:18.589 
they're all part of it so bringing them

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:20.439 
they're all part of it so bringing them
in<00:07:18.770> just<00:07:18.949> makes<00:07:19.249> the<00:07:19.430> whole<00:07:19.459> a<00:07:19.819> complete

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:20.449 
in just makes the whole a complete

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:22.299 
in just makes the whole a complete
picture<00:07:20.629> exactly<00:07:21.169> and<00:07:21.589> I<00:07:21.649> think<00:07:21.889> it<00:07:21.979> just<00:07:22.129> it

00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:22.309 
picture exactly and I think it just it

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:24.070 
picture exactly and I think it just it
really<00:07:22.639> it<00:07:22.759> just<00:07:22.789> enhances<00:07:23.449> their<00:07:23.629> learning

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 
really it just enhances their learning

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.109 
really it just enhances their learning
absolutely<00:07:25.009> and<00:07:25.459> you<00:07:25.610> wouldn't<00:07:25.849> really<00:07:25.939> get

00:07:26.109 --> 00:07:26.119 
absolutely and you wouldn't really get

00:07:26.119 --> 00:07:27.429 
absolutely and you wouldn't really get
that<00:07:26.330> like<00:07:26.509> you<00:07:26.629> said<00:07:26.839> and<00:07:27.080> a<00:07:27.139> brick<00:07:27.319> and

00:07:27.429 --> 00:07:27.439 
that like you said and a brick and

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:28.689 
that like you said and a brick and
mortar<00:07:27.499> school<00:07:27.800> if<00:07:28.009> you're<00:07:28.129> trying<00:07:28.339> to<00:07:28.369> travel

00:07:28.689 --> 00:07:28.699 
mortar school if you're trying to travel

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:30.159 
mortar school if you're trying to travel
between<00:07:28.849> classes<00:07:29.509> you're<00:07:29.689> trying<00:07:29.899> to<00:07:29.990> catch

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:30.169 
between classes you're trying to catch

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:32.409 
between classes you're trying to catch
somebody<00:07:30.469> this<00:07:31.039> just<00:07:31.369> brings<00:07:31.639> the<00:07:31.939> human

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:32.419 
somebody this just brings the human

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:34.839 
somebody this just brings the human
element<00:07:32.869> that<00:07:33.020> connection<00:07:33.559> to<00:07:34.369> a<00:07:34.399> whole<00:07:34.669> new

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:34.849 
element that connection to a whole new

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:36.699 
element that connection to a whole new
level<00:07:34.999> where<00:07:35.360> it's<00:07:35.569> so<00:07:36.050> much<00:07:36.199> almost<00:07:36.469> more

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:36.709 
level where it's so much almost more

00:07:36.709 --> 00:07:38.469

00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479 
convenient which some people may not

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:40.089 
convenient which some people may not
