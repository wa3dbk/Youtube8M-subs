00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.210
 is simon from the youtube channel will be there 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.069
 again its news only in these 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.540
 hans destiny infos run so no 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.240
 afraid if you look the other videos 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.559
 i have just followed new imperion of 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.839
 The let's play, for example, finished 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.180
 but today in this video it's about 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.730
 broke new exotic items from the counter 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.390
 or announced obsessed the bungie 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.350
 yes instagram has now introduced that 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.570
 once a day long instagram 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.310
 have taken over five new items and 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.210
 an old item with a little bit more 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.430
 info posted 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.430
 I will liszt these for you now 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.020
 First, we have the imperial here 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.550
 valley great that an exotic titan 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.970
 helmet the inside of the look like this 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.320
 little 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.420
 Well, I do not know if it knows 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.130
 rocketeer so a little bit a little 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.720
 bit down the park is too 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.920
 they are similar to every item 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.740
 also a bit of the skills 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.480
 the thing says fly like the 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.730
 shadows probably for imperial valley course 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.440
 wrote it that way and he did it in 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.240
 principle you know the personnel 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.640
 maybe from the borehole if you are in 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.920
 the air is and aim downside does so 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.800
 by his impression one stays briefly in 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.690
 are in the air and also become places 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.760
 which one collects when the super meter 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.530
 is already full in the direction of your milieu 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.960
 bielecki put that is the last 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.920
 Just say yalook is pretty 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.540
 cool that seems so a bit 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.890
 to be transparent one sees it to him 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.270
 here are the gears 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.070
 However, the park is not like that 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.130
 spectacular I always find myself 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.479
 example in pvp if somehow long 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.200
 time stands still one is just a stop 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.670
 easy goal 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.380
 as well is also shared somewhere 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.810
 the class anyway not so much 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.190
 mobility I might have had me 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.100
 rather what you want when sharing more 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.289
 mobility is instead of holding on 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.670
 a place but yes we go it 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.500
 directly next the next thing is one 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.170
 weapon and the always alternating weapons 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.789
 armor gtc made that is the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.770
 chaperone that's such a shotgun one 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.259
 may have seen before 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.869
 and the shoots has only one shot 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.399
 yes a slapshot is here so me 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.550
 take on her really fat projectile 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.530
 and gives a genie boost if you can 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.420
 she has equipped the is of text 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.520
 mechanic if you are with the l'or 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.170
 or the story is busy 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.480
 as well as the weapon manufacturer has the 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.790
 example also made the last word and 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.990
 Maybe that 's the one you creak 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.150
 already seen in some trailers 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.220
 this shotgun the eso with reversal 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.900
 reload by having those around them 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.360
 swinging looks fun in any case 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.050
 glass is also a unique 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.480
 animation 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.750
 in addition, they provide precision skills 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.670
 the thing better handling better range 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.860
 bike and stability so if you 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.660
 just a headset kids is involved 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.190
 it's kinda 0 and beyond moderately 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.950
 then zack zack reloaded directly the 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.200
 next could google for 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.930
 pvp montage or so in any case 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:51.200
 Keep the next thing is a hole 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:53.420
 exotic chefs peace train and yes and there 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.060
 it's just that the thing is 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.580
 quasi primary weapons ammo if you 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.010
 So they collect the parcels 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.209
 transformed in the climate that means you get 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.220
 only ammo but also has one 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.930
 chance to get mica as well 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.760
 your victim with the load so if your 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.069
 super already full when you again 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.319
 extra collects your grenades loads 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.150
 and your ilie is here on i find 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.220
 they look pretty cool on the model 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.400
 I have to say that they are 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.130
 the other probably the most exotic 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.660
 two others those of the form at least 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.989
 So that's different now from the form 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.250
 at least are totally similar and yes know 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.049
 I do not think so cool in any case 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.370
 I know how much this looks very much 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.260
 cheap brings but that is mine 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.420
 opinion of the very first farming 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.400
 Exotic really or what you guys 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.470
 somehow just more materials exist 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.730
 we will get something like that more often now 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.709
 most of them, therefore 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.510
 different scourges are yes too 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.280
 the ability somehow have you more 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.600
 to give up your materials 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.090
 would have to drive planet and so on 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.239
 But first of all, come for the thing 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.700
 is a fusion rifle called a telescope 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.980
 looks like I'm pretty cool and spacey 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.450
 off and has even cooler park so that 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.260
 I was very happy when I did that 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.989
 have read 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.090
 the thing is a fusion gun what just 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.299
 the projectile shoots at the enemy 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.790
 get stuck and then delay the 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:13.250
 tournaments with a world exclusive 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.540
 immediately reminded me of halo am one 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.039
 big halo threads and there I have 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.049
 I immediately thought of all the idlers 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:20.539
 waited a long time that bungie down 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.840
 that's what I think is the coolest 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.430
 Announcement of the exoticism here so yes 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.410
 that means you were almost on it soon 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.669
 and then it explodes 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.539
 to hurt oneself that would be total 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.110
 Great 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:35.419
 besides, it still has the ability to do that 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.639
 multi cache with this weapon more ops 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.680
 on light drop for you and yours 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.300
 Friends, so to speak, necessarily now 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.950
 Of course, the best in pvp, too 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.630
 be really cool and whole groups control 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.590
 or so to do away with, but of course 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:51.260
 rather so for the pvp pve pvp suitable 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.750
 last exotic item are the goals 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.070
 grips those are for hunter these are these 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.900
 Bone gloves you might 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.790
 have seen the right way 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.550
 Good we do not have one anymore 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:04.690
 silvery shine somehow and give you 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.920
 just an extra milicic and 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.710
 military you always have one 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.020
 chance to reload your primary weapon 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.390
 yes, it's pretty cool I do not know if 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.860
 you can get three jerks though 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.600
 one the appropriate shield with the 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.310
 hunter but you can definitely two 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.800
 Smoke booms get him the new one 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.200
 mini of the new so great that it 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.390
 Could give a lot of crass combos 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.520
 this part looks just right 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.590
 cool is definitely one of 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.570
 where yes I'll look right after 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.210
 Lastly , it's such a bonus 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.350
 I said at the beginning of five just because 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.450
 the next one has already been seen 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.650
 that prefer single and the happy fusion 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.230
 rifle I do not have to tell it again 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.480
 but we already know what he is doing 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.030
 is just a mail then almost shoots 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.640
 through the opponents and just bounces 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.220
 on other surfaces from that will be 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.540
 item will be what you get over this long 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.130
 Collect quest series in the North drake 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.810
 you have to collect the items 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.490
 that needs to reassemble and so on 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.160
 In any case, it sounds natural 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.240
 also pretty cool maybe many 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.280
 speculation may be the next 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.510
 I do not want gala horn or something like that right now 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.130
 be sure to say but is definitely 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.990
 a weapon that feels pretty cool 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.930
 I'll find an art rail for everyone 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.310
 a good idea is a good idea 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.410
 but that was all I have 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.120
 so easy now for you 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.710
 summarized for those of you 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.330
 who did not hear that 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.550
 I hope you liked it 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.280
 otherwise you know more of the 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.300
 if there are videos on my channel 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.800
 you liked it I would 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.630
 of course also taken to the top 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.890
 that keeps helping me keep that up 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.330
 my videos also seen by me people 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.280
 otherwise all that remains is to 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.880
 Say, see you in the next video 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.880
 take care
