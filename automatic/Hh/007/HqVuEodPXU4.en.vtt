00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.810
 Hi, I'm MarÃ­a Lizarraga, Interior Designer 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:09.040
 ikea for Spain 'and I'll tell you how 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.040
 assemble a Christmas table 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.529
 and in this case we were inspired by a 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.450
 I tell in a story that comes from a 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.910
 enchanted forest that's why we're going to have 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.980
 the colors the materials even the 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.480
 animals of that forest we started with the 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.520
 materials that we have chosen 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.400
 we have a traditional room with a 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.980
 white table and one of some chairs in 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.620
 patinated wood is essential the tablecloth 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.360
 in this case we have chosen a tablecloth that 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.640
 is inspired by the soil that 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.970
 we can find a forest with the type 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.190
 of colorful in green rim and 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.600
 different shades simulating the 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.309
 colors that we can find with the 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.620
 lichen pineapples and all 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.200
 natural materials of the forest we are going to 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.329
 set up a table for four people and 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.399
 let's mark the site of each one with 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.010
 an individual in this case we have the 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.629
 hue and texture of the chestnuts 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.670
 of the pineapples and these colors that we 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.920
 They remind so much of nature 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.320
 the protocol is decided by the organizer 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.830
 dinner in this case we have chosen a 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.409
 ceramic crockery in terracotta we go to 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.840
 mix the green with the purple of this 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.790
 shape we make a seat of one color and 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.020
 another seat of another mixing and playing 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.119
 always with the same tones 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.920
 Now we will work with our 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.899
 centerpiece in a more magical way 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.140
 the plants that remind us of 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:33.240
 mistletoe the color of lichens with 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.670
 this garland of light we can support what 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.560
 what is the vegetation 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.030
 more in natural and give it a point of light 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.520
 so that our centerpiece can 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.079
 shine this garland is inspired by 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.549
 the mistletoe the mistletoe that is the 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.549
 tradition that the one who kisses under 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.370
 of the wall has eternal happiness 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:53.350
 then we are going to 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.240
 putting around our vegetation 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.759
 has the transparent cable so that it does not 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.380
 look and this helps us to hide what 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.810
 it would simply be enlightenment and 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.820
 decoration let's go for the glassware in 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.740
 the cutlery on our table in this 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.360
 case we have chosen something original an 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.130
 light green cutlery that gives you more 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.470
 luminosity there is a bit of carelessness to 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.090
 our table a glassware in green 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.450
 which may be the water color 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.459
 forest as you see we already have the table then 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.800
 is practically in detail now 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.830
 missing the touch of fun and sleep 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.630
 in this magical forest we are going to put in 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.630
 each one of the diners a little bird 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.060
 it can be a memory to be taken from 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.430
 our Christmas dinner and we're also going 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.900
 to put next to a little bird house 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.730
 in which we will customize with the 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.730
 name of each of our guests 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.220
 all these ornaments have come out of the 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.019
 Christmas tree decoration we 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.470
 can serve to also give a touch 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.430
 nice and a gift detail for 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.829
 our guests 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.989
 Well, nothing more than show you the 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:58.180
 table that we have made inspired by 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.590
 our enchanted forest we hope that 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.849
 you can enjoy it and that I inspired you 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.849
