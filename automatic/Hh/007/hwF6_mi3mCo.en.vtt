 access 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.480
 Do you want to be the sebrae? 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:25.369
 It was actually people, it's okay to be there. 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.189
 here but here in this video Amanda and I 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.349
 I'll recommend some books for you. 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.710
 but it will be a kiss of recommendations 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:37.700
 a little different today from October 11 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.870
 of 2014 completes 18 years of the death of 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.700
 Renato Russo 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.370
 I think it very likely that most of 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.920
 You knew him because that's the name of 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.379
 a lot of weight inside the rock scene 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.510
 good national but my proposal with 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.910
 this video is not talking about the life of the 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.370
 renato or about his career 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.429
 in this video I'll recommend some 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.719
 books he recommended in 2006 was 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:03.109
 exhibited a report of the fantastic 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:05.659
 renato on Russian and in this report the 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:09.050
 Renato's own mother says it was common 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.600
 that some fans or people who admired the 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.460
 renato's work that they also wanted 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.280
 you will start with why not start 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.190
 write him where he got it from 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.430
 inspiration from where inspiration comes 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:26.270
 to write the letters he wrote and 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.430
 one answer he used to give is read 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.649
 books in this report 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.619
 they released a letter that renato 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:36.110
 sent to a fan and in that letter of a 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.039
 list of books and authors that renato 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.380
 recommends 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.539
 I decided to make this video about these 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.899
 books because some books and authors 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:47.329
 From this list I already read and I like 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.609
 I also concurrently recommend two 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.649
 list books are books that are 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:54.530
 currently reading and has several other 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.840
 books on the list I already have here 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.390
 I have not read it yet but I really want to read it. 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.960
 obviously we only have here it 's because I 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.789
 I want to see 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.100
 so here in the video I'm going to talk about 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.530
 the books on the list that I've read that I 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.479
 I'm reading and I intend to read, I'll go. 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.710
 start the command within the list that I 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.480
 I've read the 1984 george orwell analyst 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.670
 I was going to remember the two years that it was 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.560
 an incredible reading experience your 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.750
 book that when 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.420
 miner that is a precise sensation 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.880
 kings many times in life and need 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.980
 recommend for the maximum number of people 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.770
 I got a sensational book, you guys. 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.510
 need to read 1984 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.670
 another book on the list is admirable world 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.040
 new from aldous huxley these two books 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.280
 they are dystopias and they are 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.640
 distopias then considered classic 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.190
 If you've read some recent hot 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.170
 Do you like this genre you have interest in? 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.300
 be sure to read these two books here 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.819

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.750

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.730
 interest to take a little leap there that day 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.980

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.680
 I have a feeling of the world and the clear 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.069
 The puzzle of the two between clear and rhyme 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.299
 feeling as I recommend more 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.900

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.519
 of that challenge that I imposed on me with 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.690
 It's a joke and a challenge that I 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.430
 I decided to attend 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.980
