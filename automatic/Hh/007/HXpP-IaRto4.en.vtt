00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
challenge I thought it's going to be one

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.219 
challenge I thought it's going to be one
of<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> items<00:01:32.280> that's<00:01:32.700> going<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.420> hard<00:01:33.869> to

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
of the items that's going to be hard to

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.520 
of the items that's going to be hard to
get<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.710> video<00:01:35.630> because<00:01:36.630> all<00:01:36.869> these<00:01:37.020> drops<00:01:37.290> has

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
get on video because all these drops has

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.789 
get on video because all these drops has
to<00:01:37.680> be<00:01:37.770> gotten<00:01:38.100> on<00:01:38.220> video<00:01:38.630> in<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.900> how<00:01:40.259> my

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
to be gotten on video in just how my

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.060 
to be gotten on video in just how my
mindset<00:01:41.400> works<00:01:41.759> anyway<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:43.290> third<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.860> final

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
mindset works anyway the third and final

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.120 
mindset works anyway the third and final
