 through something like a career crisis 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.429
 poke new other areas you know where 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.050
 you can feel meaningful 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.030

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:17.490
 I want to say that you listened to me attention 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.470
 well leave if you are worried about and 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:26.369
 distribution by authorship can 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:29.420
 be the first to go one and so this is the department 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.219
 engineering d I'll talk to you later 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.809
 engineering department where noble but 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.710
 inexperienced lab technician performs 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:42.090
 representations of those who think and dream 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:44.520
 hello to you lab technician river shield what 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.620
 are you doing here just come 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.969
 say hello I'm in this lab already 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.860
 three years you never came 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.129
 I would say hello to the current moment 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.199
 were more important and classes well what are we 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.550
 Today we are creating 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.440
 small support design useful 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.850
 load or European scientific and 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.530
 mental load that is sent 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.359
 on the space shuttle truth like this 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.470
 works 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.750
 when everything is ready she will 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.710
 attached to the compartment useful questions well 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.549
 it will not be located sensors so 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.549
 the same shelf 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.860
 no you don't understand during acceleration 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.780
 it should be located on the exact 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.600
 level provide horde okay this regiment 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.250
 and noticed that you use 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.619
 titan you didn't think about carbon 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.979
 fireboxes for example they are easier and cheaper in 2 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.720
 times stronger and more elastic 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.830
 sheldon in my office cum which 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.440
 it says that I have a master's degree 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.940
 engineered to feel a note from your 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.110
 the hotel that say i love you 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.850
 loot but nothing of them is 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:51.869
 a compelling argument for titanium 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:57.539
 they are nanotubes and for us according to your coat 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:59.850
 tell me where you yourself thought it up 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.920
 can be no coincidence no 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.700
 there must be some connection reasons 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.700
 which I missed 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.060
 get away 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.620
 everything is curious more curious 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.810
 get away 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.810
 maybe it's all about me
