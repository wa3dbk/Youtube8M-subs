being that happens with my career bit
earlier<00:00:52.150> when<00:00:52.270> I<00:00:52.390> was<00:00:52.510> setting<00:00:52.809> up<00:00:53.580> and<00:00:54.580> all

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
earlier when I was setting up and all

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.299 
earlier when I was setting up and all
this<00:00:55.030> that<00:00:55.480> these<00:00:56.050> are<00:00:56.230> the<00:00:56.410> vintage<00:00:56.620> Kirby<00:00:57.160> so

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
this that these are the vintage Kirby so

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.040 
this that these are the vintage Kirby so
this<00:00:57.550> little<00:00:57.850> pins<00:00:58.059> like<00:00:58.449> that<00:00:58.629> over<00:00:58.900> time

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
this little pins like that over time

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.890 
this little pins like that over time
this<00:00:59.739> handle<00:01:00.160> is<00:01:00.309> loose<00:01:00.519> right<00:01:00.760> here<00:01:00.970> so<00:01:01.600> I<00:01:01.629> had

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
this handle is loose right here so I had

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.119 
this handle is loose right here so I had
to<00:01:02.019> do<00:01:02.170> it<00:01:02.320> line<00:01:02.530> it<00:01:02.680> up<00:01:02.710> with<00:01:02.830> the<00:01:02.949> hole<00:01:03.100> and

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
to do it line it up with the hole and

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.770 
to do it line it up with the hole and
hammered<00:01:03.640> that<00:01:03.790> back<00:01:03.970> in<00:01:04.320> now<00:01:05.759> which

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
hammered that back in now which

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.260 
hammered that back in now which
categories<00:01:08.910> Angela<00:01:10.080> wait<00:01:12.000> okay

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
categories Angela wait okay

categories Angela wait okay
I<00:01:13.300> didn't<00:01:14.170> make<00:01:14.259> a<00:01:14.320> robotics<00:01:15.009> one<00:01:15.340> but<00:01:15.880> I<00:01:15.910> think

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
I didn't make a robotics one but I think

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
I didn't make a robotics one but I think
I<00:01:16.300> did<00:01:16.360> like<00:01:16.810> let<00:01:17.020> me<00:01:17.140> check

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.880

no I did it so I'll just show you the

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.080 
no I did it so I'll just show you the
robotic<00:01:33.430> ones<00:01:34.140> these<00:01:35.140> are<00:01:35.290> my<00:01:35.440> -<00:01:35.500> all<00:01:36.090> this

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
robotic ones these are my - all this

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.760 
robotic ones these are my - all this
series<00:01:37.540> will<00:01:37.720> buy<00:01:37.869> through<00:01:38.290> robot<00:01:39.479> goombas

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
series will buy through robot goombas

series will buy through robot goombas
made<00:01:41.770> by<00:01:41.920> our<00:01:42.130> robot<00:01:42.520> and<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:44.200> one<00:01:44.409> has<00:01:44.590> a

made by our robot and this one has a
broken<00:01:44.890> speaker<00:01:45.520> but<00:01:45.759> this<00:01:45.940> one<00:01:46.119> doesn't<00:01:46.330> have

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
broken speaker but this one doesn't have

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.350 
broken speaker but this one doesn't have
to<00:01:47.080> try<00:01:47.350> it<00:01:47.409> because<00:01:47.560> this<00:01:47.890> one's<00:01:48.070> no<00:01:48.360> really

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
to try it because this one's no really

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.100 
to try it because this one's no really
new<00:01:49.540> one<00:01:49.720> and<00:01:50.440> this<00:01:50.530> one's<00:01:50.770> really<00:01:50.860> old<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.720> see

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
new one and this one's really old so see

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:12.430 
new one and this one's really old so see
look<00:01:53.320> no<00:01:54.190> sound<00:01:54.840> if<00:01:55.840> I<00:01:55.990> try<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.290> other<00:01:56.440> one

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.110 

it<00:02:13.440> doesn't<00:02:13.800> work<00:02:13.920> on<00:02:14.100> this<00:02:14.250> carpet<00:02:14.550> but<00:02:14.910> it

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
it doesn't work on this carpet but it

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.940 
it doesn't work on this carpet but it
will<00:02:15.390> work<00:02:15.600> on<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.930> carpet

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
and on the side of the battery there are

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.520 
and on the side of the battery there are
two<00:02:45.880> little<00:02:46.150> clips<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:47.800> push<00:02:48.040> them<00:02:48.190> in<00:02:49.470> on<00:02:50.470> the

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
two little clips you push them in on the

00:02:50.530 --> 00:03:00.000 
two little clips you push them in on the
older<00:02:51.040> batteries<00:02:51.220> you<00:02:51.520> just<00:02:51.700> push<00:02:51.910> in<00:02:59.010> mm

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
older batteries you just push in mm

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.910 
older batteries you just push in mm
there's<00:03:00.490> a<00:03:00.550> little<00:03:00.820> tab<00:03:01.030> right<00:03:01.210> here<00:03:01.240> on<00:03:01.570> the

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
there's a little tab right here on the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.360 
there's a little tab right here on the
bus<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.970> just<00:03:04.150> pull<00:03:04.960> that<00:03:04.990> back<00:03:05.290> you<00:03:06.220> have

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
bus you just pull that back you have

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
bus you just pull that back you have
access<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.300> dirty<00:03:07.810> areas<00:03:08.850> as<00:03:09.850> a<00:03:09.970> fan<00:03:10.210> right

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390

access to the dirty areas as a fan right
here<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:12.580> spins<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:15.730> you<00:03:16.240> get<00:03:16.390> back<00:03:16.630> in

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
here that spins and you get back in

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.430 
here that spins and you get back in
there<00:03:16.990> are<00:03:17.080> two<00:03:17.260> new<00:03:17.470> tabs<00:03:19.200> careful<00:03:20.200> not<00:03:20.290> to

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
there are two new tabs careful not to

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.420 
there are two new tabs careful not to
break<00:03:20.590> these<00:03:20.800> tabs<00:03:21.130> they<00:03:22.090> are<00:03:22.240> fragile<00:03:23.430> now

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
break these tabs they are fragile now

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.360 
break these tabs they are fragile now
for<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.880> open<00:03:25.450> this<00:03:25.600> one<00:03:25.870> is<00:03:26.230> one<00:03:26.680> screw<00:03:27.010> right

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
for the open this one is one screw right

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.510 
for the open this one is one screw right
here<00:03:27.570> we<00:03:28.570> just<00:03:28.750> pull<00:03:29.050> up<00:03:31.830> this<00:03:32.830> model<00:03:33.250> is

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
here we just pull up this model is

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.590 
here we just pull up this model is
called<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.850> rhombus<00:03:34.150> age<00:03:36.150> now<00:03:37.150> just<00:03:37.420> two

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
called the rhombus age now just two

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.240 
called the rhombus age now just two
little<00:03:37.780> yellow<00:03:37.930> or<00:03:38.290> abs<00:03:38.500> and<00:03:38.920> you<00:03:38.980> see<00:03:39.130> it's

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
little yellow or abs and you see it's

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.130 
little yellow or abs and you see it's
very<00:03:39.340> different<00:03:39.850> on<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.210> bottom<00:03:40.510> compared<00:03:40.900> to

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
very different on the bottom compared to

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.490 
very different on the bottom compared to
this<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:42.330> this<00:03:43.330> is<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.570> difference<00:03:43.930> two

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
this and this is the difference two

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.349 
this and this is the difference two
Clips<00:03:44.800> right<00:03:44.950> here
