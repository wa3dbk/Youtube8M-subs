 Come with me to know the ingredients 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.490
 We passed our cake with the flour 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.850
 chocolate flavor devils food by betty 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:41.950
 grable a cup with water half a cup with 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.950
 vegetable oil and two eggs 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.239
 for decorating our cake 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.790
 farm 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.350
 We're going to need two bitumen cans 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.129
 betty crocker 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.590
 and food coloring red 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.380
 pretzels square sweet cookies coconut 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.970
 grated color food coloring 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.970
 yellow and green colors 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.890
 and to begin with the decoration of the 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.630
 farm I'm going to put in a container a 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.020
 little betty vanilla bitumen 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.020
 crocker 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.340
 and to produce the pink hue I'm going to 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.649
 take some gel 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.250
 and I'm going to mix it up 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.250
 with freedom 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.600
 i 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.420
 on the other hand I'm going to use a container 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.670
 medium to paint the vanilla bitumen 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.310
 with the color red until you get the color 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.979
 desired for the farm and I reserve it 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.680
 let's cut one side of the cake to 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.930
 form the roof of the farm we decorate 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.280
 the facade of our farm with the 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.280
 red bitumen that I have here 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.340
 and to give it consistency once 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.630
 let's finish what I'm going to take to 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.810
 30 to 60 minute refrigerator 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.760
 so that it is very firm to get 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.580
 an effect of planks on the facade 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.610
 we draw lines in the bitumen using 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.730
 a spatula or a toothpick 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.430
 let's use full pretzels for 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.159
 simulate texas on the roof 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.920
 to form a window we split two 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:37.230
 Pretzel sticks in two parts and 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.659
 we place in the upper part forming 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.209
 a square to form the windows 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:45.180
 let's use the square cookies 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.150
 on each side for the entry I will use 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.689
 three pretzel sticks and two cookies 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.900
 rectangular to simulate the doors and 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.969
 to make some straw I will put coconut 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.340
 grated inside a plastic bag 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:02.669
 and I will add two drops of dye 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.189
 yellow we close very well and shake 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:07.620
 until you get the tone you want for the 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:10.290
 grass repeating the same previous step 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.859
 but now using green dye 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.500
 for the little pigs we need sparks 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.870
 decorative red and sparks 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.329
 round chocolate for the eyes for 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.099
 decorating the chicks we need coconut 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.439
 grated yellow color of which 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.439
 previously we removed from the preparation 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:30.569
 of the farm chocolate sparks 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:33.150
 round for the eyes and gummies of 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.010
 small orange and finally for 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.530
 our lambs 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.680
 We are going to need decorative sparks 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.640
 red color round chocolate sparks 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.319
 for eyes and marshmallows miniature 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.110
 let's start decorating our cupcakes 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.290
 of little animals we decorated the cupcakes with 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.659
 vanilla flavor bitumen 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.760
 we form the mouth placing a 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:04:00.359
 teaspoon of pink bitumen in the form of 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.609
 circles our final touch is to simulate 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.870
 the fur of the sheep with 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:07.299
 miniature marshmallows 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.360
 and we are going to use chocolate sparks 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.790
 to make the eyes we form the nose 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.189
 with red sparks 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.440
 for our chicks we are going to take 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:20.340
 our cupcakes and decorate them with 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.080
 vanilla bitumen and with yellow coconut 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.449
 for the eyes we use the sparks of 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.580
 round chocolate I will cut the gummies 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:30.160

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.100

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.490
 triangle shape and we will place them 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.400

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.260
