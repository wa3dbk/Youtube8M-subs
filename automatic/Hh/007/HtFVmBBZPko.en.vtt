term long duration workouts like running

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.220 
term long duration workouts like running
we<00:00:44.460> have<00:00:44.670> glycogen<00:00:45.480> which<00:00:45.780> comes<00:00:46.140> from

we have glycogen which comes from

and then finally we have creatine which

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.709 
and then finally we have creatine which
gives<00:00:52.710> our<00:00:52.860> muscles<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.280> strength<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.090> ATP

level crazy and phosphate is what's

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.420 
level crazy and phosphate is what's
actually<00:01:09.930> found<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.979> cells<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.369> our

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
actually found in the cells of our

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.429 
actually found in the cells of our

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.660 
they spin it as like this creatine
that's<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:52.619> much<00:01:52.770> more<00:01:52.979> absorbent<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:53.549> much

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
that's so much more absorbent so much

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.910 
that's so much more absorbent so much
more<00:01:53.820> soluble<00:01:54.240> when<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.899> reality<00:01:55.020> although<00:01:55.649> it

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
more soluble when in reality although it

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.709 
more soluble when in reality although it
is<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> good<00:01:56.280> creatine<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.210> difference

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
is a good creatine the difference

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.330 
is a good creatine the difference
between<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.469> regular<00:01:58.770> monohydrate

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
between that and a regular monohydrate

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.880 
between that and a regular monohydrate
is<00:01:59.520> really<00:02:00.270> minimal<00:02:00.719> if<00:02:00.930> not<00:02:01.590> non-existent

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
is really minimal if not non-existent

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.490 
is really minimal if not non-existent
water<00:02:02.640> retention<00:02:03.000> they<00:02:03.659> only<00:02:03.960> cause

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
water retention they only cause

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.560 
water retention they only cause
intracellular<00:02:05.280> water<00:02:05.820> retention<00:02:06.119> for<00:02:06.450> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
intracellular water retention for the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.479 
intracellular water retention for the
most<00:02:06.780> part<00:02:07.049> which<00:02:07.290> basically<00:02:07.619> means<00:02:07.920> they

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
most part which basically means they

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.270 
most part which basically means they
hydrate<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.270> cells<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.899> your<00:02:09.929> muscles<00:02:10.590> which

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
hydrate the cells of your muscles which

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.580 
hydrate the cells of your muscles which
is<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.489> good<00:02:11.700> thing<00:02:12.379> it's<00:02:13.379> all

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
is a good thing it's all

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.559 
is a good thing it's all
all<00:02:13.739> cell<00:02:14.069> mass<00:02:14.340> cell<00:02:14.790> volume<00:02:15.000> eyes<00:02:15.330> it's

all cell mass cell volume eyes it's

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.509 
all cell mass cell volume eyes it's
basically<00:02:15.930> going<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.140> allow<00:02:16.410> for<00:02:16.519> your

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
basically going to allow for your

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.660 
basically going to allow for your
muscles<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.360> maximize<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.739> it's<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.129> good<00:02:20.400> thing

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
muscles to maximize so it's a good thing

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.190

it's<00:02:20.940> going<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.090> add<00:02:21.269> two<00:02:21.300> overall<00:02:21.720> strength
