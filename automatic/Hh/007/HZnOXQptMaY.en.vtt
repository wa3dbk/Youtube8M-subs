00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
your head as well as working with your

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.590 
your head as well as working with your
tools<00:02:06.330> okay<00:02:06.899> that's<00:02:07.890> not<00:02:08.009> loud<00:02:08.160> let's<00:02:09.030> go

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
tools okay that's not loud let's go

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.590 
tools okay that's not loud let's go
then<00:02:11.600> what<00:02:11.780> token<00:02:12.080> about<00:02:12.460> why<00:02:13.480> there's<00:02:14.480> no

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
then what token about why there's no

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.020 
then what token about why there's no
nothing<00:02:15.140> against<00:02:15.380> hurry<00:02:15.730> Justin<00:02:16.730> gonna<00:02:16.880> bet

timings not right Tommy yeah I would

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.180 
timings not right Tommy yeah I would
love<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:38.900> look<00:02:39.050> at<00:02:39.140> a<00:02:39.200> Tony<00:02:39.440> maratona<00:02:39.980> like

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
love a look at a Tony maratona like

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.070 
love a look at a Tony maratona like
there<00:02:40.400> what<00:02:40.820> else<00:02:40.970> you've<00:02:41.270> some<00:02:41.540> come<00:02:41.810> across

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
there what else you've some come across

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.170 
there what else you've some come across
some<00:02:42.260> other<00:02:42.350> provision<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:43.460> if<00:02:43.700> you<00:02:43.940> feel

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
some other provision and if you feel

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.790 
some other provision and if you feel
that<00:02:44.330> no<00:02:44.450> photo<00:02:44.720> yeah<00:02:44.990> so<00:02:45.110> what<00:02:45.230> are<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.590> fuel

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
that no photo yeah so what are the fuel

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.550 
that no photo yeah so what are the fuel
filler<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:46.310> can<00:02:46.700> get<00:02:46.850> well<00:02:47.390> flogged<00:02:48.140> okay<00:02:48.410> so

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
filler I can get well flogged okay so

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.520 
filler I can get well flogged okay so
what<00:02:48.710> does<00:02:48.800> that<00:02:48.860> do<00:02:49.750> means<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:50.990> you<00:02:51.230> can't

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
what does that do means that you can't

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.380 
what does that do means that you can't
get<00:02:51.740> Posey's<00:02:52.280> we're<00:02:52.550> not<00:02:52.700> enough<00:02:52.910> fuel<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.150> run

the town you really know anything you
want<00:02:56.210> under<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.600> park<00:02:57.170> al<00:02:57.440> gets<00:02:57.770> the<00:02:57.920> boys<00:02:58.040> to

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
want under the park al gets the boys to

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.190 
want under the park al gets the boys to
check<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.730> spark<00:02:59.030> plugs<00:02:59.330> first<00:02:59.630> make<00:03:00.170> sure

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
check the spark plugs first make sure

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.690 
check the spark plugs first make sure
you<00:03:00.470> grab<00:03:00.650> that<00:03:00.710> make<00:03:01.190> sure<00:03:01.340> you<00:03:01.430> got<00:03:01.580> the

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
you grab that make sure you got the

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.190 
you grab that make sure you got the
rubber<00:03:01.880> not<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.270> lid<00:03:02.480> like<00:03:02.690> you<00:03:02.840> did<00:03:03.020> that's

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
rubber not the lid like you did that's

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.610 
rubber not the lid like you did that's
good

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
good

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:10.620 
good
otherwise<00:03:04.160> there's<00:03:04.880> no<00:03:05.030> wiring<00:03:05.360> here

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.030 

hey<00:03:11.630> God<00:03:11.870> you<00:03:12.650> did<00:03:12.830> that<00:03:12.980> on<00:03:13.010> purpose<00:03:15.040> once

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
hey God you did that on purpose once

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.130 
hey God you did that on purpose once
James<00:03:16.370> pulls<00:03:16.670> out<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.030> spark<00:03:17.330> plug<00:03:17.600> al

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
James pulls out the spark plug al

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.740 
James pulls out the spark plug al
inspects<00:03:18.800> it<00:03:18.890> for<00:03:19.100> damage<00:03:22.540> okay

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
inspects it for damage okay

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.030 
inspects it for damage okay
the<00:03:23.870> gap<00:03:24.170> should<00:03:24.410> be<00:03:24.560> around<00:03:24.740> about<00:03:25.010> a

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
the gap should be around about a

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.740 
the gap should be around about a
millimeter<00:03:25.430> that's<00:03:25.610> pretty<00:03:25.880> good<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:26.360> it's

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
millimeter that's pretty good and it's

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.540 
millimeter that's pretty good and it's
not<00:03:26.930> all<00:03:27.080> all<00:03:27.440> worn<00:03:27.770> away<00:03:27.890> I<00:03:28.010> just<00:03:28.310> put<00:03:28.460> that

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
not all all worn away I just put that

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.990 
not all all worn away I just put that
back

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
back

you<00:03:29.270> know<00:03:29.390> fiddle<00:03:29.690> really<00:03:29.900> too<00:03:30.170> much<00:03:30.350> they<00:03:30.770> got

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
you know fiddle really too much they got

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.830 
you know fiddle really too much they got
carbon<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.790> cutting<00:03:32.150> in<00:03:32.240> there<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:32.630> if<00:03:32.750> you

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
carbon and cutting in there and if you

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.720 
carbon and cutting in there and if you
move<00:03:33.050> it<00:03:33.230> around<00:03:33.290> it'll<00:03:33.980> loosen<00:03:34.130> that<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:34.490> the

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
move it around it'll loosen that and the

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.920 
move it around it'll loosen that and the
resistor<00:03:35.030> will<00:03:35.210> go<00:03:35.330> through<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.660> roof<00:03:35.840> and

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
resistor will go through the roof and

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.630 
resistor will go through the roof and
you<00:03:36.020> have<00:03:36.170> a<00:03:36.230> misfire<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:37.130> boys<00:03:37.340> use<00:03:37.610> a

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
you have a misfire the boys use a

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.180 
you have a misfire the boys use a
multimeter<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.720> test<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:39.290> resistance<00:03:39.650> of<00:03:40.100> the

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
multimeter to test the resistance of the

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.280 
multimeter to test the resistance of the
spark<00:03:40.490> plug<00:03:40.550> lead<00:03:41.050> 4.38

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
spark plug lead 4.38

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.199 
spark plug lead 4.38
but<00:03:43.010> you'll<00:03:43.160> generally<00:03:43.370> find<00:03:43.490> around<00:03:43.910> four

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
but you'll generally find around four

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.750 
but you'll generally find around four
five<00:03:44.450> six<00:03:45.140> seven<00:03:45.620> like<00:03:45.740> then<00:03:45.950> when<00:03:46.430> you<00:03:46.490> get<00:03:46.610> to

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
five six seven like then when you get to

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.600 
five six seven like then when you get to
ten<00:03:46.970> fifteen<00:03:47.500> Charlie<00:03:48.500> on<00:03:48.590> ok<00:03:48.860> as<00:03:49.310> it<00:03:49.459> will

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
ten fifteen Charlie on ok as it will

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.410 
ten fifteen Charlie on ok as it will
make<00:03:49.760> a<00:03:49.790> big<00:03:50.030> difference

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
make a big difference

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.420 
make a big difference
all<00:03:51.050> right<00:03:51.200> so<00:03:51.440> that's<00:03:51.590> that's<00:03:52.040> pretty<00:03:52.220> good

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
all right so that's that's pretty good

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.580 
all right so that's that's pretty good
now<00:03:52.700> it's<00:03:52.880> time<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.420> move<00:03:53.660> on<00:03:53.840> to<00:03:54.020> testing<00:03:54.500> the

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
now it's time to move on to testing the

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.310 
now it's time to move on to testing the
timing<00:03:54.980> of<00:03:55.070> the<00:03:55.190> FJ<00:03:55.580> so<00:03:56.330> just<00:03:56.690> when<00:03:57.020> anybody

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
timing of the FJ so just when anybody

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.290 
timing of the FJ so just when anybody
starts<00:03:57.590> a<00:03:57.650> motor<00:03:57.830> or<00:03:58.280> a<00:03:58.340> stand<00:03:58.730> just<00:03:58.820> down<00:03:59.150> the

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
starts a motor or a stand just down the

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.370 
starts a motor or a stand just down the
back<00:03:59.480> just<00:03:59.750> in<00:03:59.810> case<00:03:59.959> I<00:04:00.080> make<00:04:00.230> a<00:04:00.260> mistake

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
back just in case I make a mistake

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.250 
back just in case I make a mistake
because<00:04:01.040> it's<00:04:01.340> very<00:04:01.610> hard<00:04:01.850> to<00:04:02.260> certainly

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
because it's very hard to certainly

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:12.160 
because it's very hard to certainly
underneath<00:04:03.890> occur

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.600 

now<00:04:13.170> look<00:04:13.470> this<00:04:13.620> little<00:04:13.800> induction<00:04:14.340> seeing<00:04:14.520> on

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
now look this little induction seeing on

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.039 
now look this little induction seeing on
this<00:04:14.700> will<00:04:14.880> pick<00:04:15.030> up<00:04:15.210> the<00:04:15.300> spark<00:04:15.600> Allen

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
this will pick up the spark Allen

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.990 
this will pick up the spark Allen
connects<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.709> number<00:04:17.010> one<00:04:17.160> cylinder<00:04:17.549> yeah

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
connects to the number one cylinder yeah

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.340 
connects to the number one cylinder yeah
just<00:04:18.299> hook<00:04:18.420> it<00:04:18.480> over<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:18.900> thing<00:04:19.049> that<00:04:19.230> I'll

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
just hook it over the thing that I'll

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.080 
just hook it over the thing that I'll
pick<00:04:19.500> it<00:04:19.530> up<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:20.190> we<00:04:20.310> get<00:04:20.430> some<00:04:20.580> power<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:20.970> run

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
pick it up and we get some power to run

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.280 
pick it up and we get some power to run
this<00:04:21.299> okay<00:04:22.140> so<00:04:22.200> we're<00:04:22.470> good<00:04:22.590> right<00:04:22.770> there

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
this okay so we're good right there

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.810 
this okay so we're good right there
there<00:04:25.290> and<00:04:25.530> if<00:04:25.590> we<00:04:25.620> press<00:04:25.950> this<00:04:26.130> little<00:04:26.610> flash

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
there and if we press this little flash

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.600 
there and if we press this little flash
don't<00:04:27.180> look<00:04:27.270> at<00:04:27.360> it<00:04:27.480> okay<00:04:28.370> that'll<00:04:29.370> flash

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
don't look at it okay that'll flash

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.060 
don't look at it okay that'll flash
every<00:04:30.060> time<00:04:30.240> there's<00:04:30.420> a<00:04:30.480> spark<00:04:30.890> every<00:04:31.890> time

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
every time there's a spark every time

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.040 
every time there's a spark every time
fires<00:04:32.430> on<00:04:32.640> there<00:04:32.850> we<00:04:33.180> want<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.450> win<00:04:33.660> it<00:04:33.810> for<00:04:33.840> us

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
fires on there we want to win it for us

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.570 
fires on there we want to win it for us
okay<00:04:34.320> so<00:04:35.070> there's<00:04:35.520> a<00:04:35.610> little<00:04:35.760> ball<00:04:36.060> in<00:04:37.050> the

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
okay so there's a little ball in the

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.650 
okay so there's a little ball in the
flywheel<00:04:38.580> down<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.090> bottom<00:04:39.360> and<00:04:39.540> a<00:04:39.630> little

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
flywheel down the bottom and a little

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:46.400 
flywheel down the bottom and a little
hole<00:04:39.990> for<00:04:40.260> you<00:04:40.320> to<00:04:40.380> watch<00:04:40.530> it<00:04:44.870> but<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:45.990> timing

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
hole for you to watch it but the timing

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.650 
hole for you to watch it but the timing
to<00:04:46.560> be<00:04:46.590> correct<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.760> ball<00:04:47.970> you<00:04:48.210> can<00:04:48.390> see

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
to be correct the ball you can see

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.810 
to be correct the ball you can see
should<00:04:48.930> be<00:04:49.020> right<00:04:49.320> next<00:04:49.590> to<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:49.980> pointer<00:04:50.220> it

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
should be right next to the pointer it

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.480 
should be right next to the pointer it
is<00:04:51.030> in<00:04:51.210> fact<00:04:51.480> too<00:04:51.810> far<00:04:52.080> down<00:04:52.410> so<00:04:52.950> Allen<00:04:53.250> moves

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
is in fact too far down so Allen moves

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.780 
is in fact too far down so Allen moves
the<00:04:53.670> ball<00:04:53.880> into<00:04:54.270> it's<00:04:54.420> correct<00:04:54.480> positioning

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
the ball into it's correct positioning

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.460 
the ball into it's correct positioning
Allen<00:04:56.790> adjusts<00:04:57.270> the<00:04:57.360> ball<00:04:57.540> by<00:04:57.780> loosening<00:04:58.230> and

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
Allen adjusts the ball by loosening and

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.020 
Allen adjusts the ball by loosening and
tightening<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:59.160> clamp<00:04:59.430> on<00:04:59.580> the<00:04:59.700> distributor

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
tightening the clamp on the distributor

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.630 
tightening the clamp on the distributor
to<00:05:00.570> be<00:05:00.660> top<00:05:00.930> dead<00:05:01.170> center<00:05:01.620> or<00:05:02.070> to<00:05:02.340> where<00:05:02.520> the

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
to be top dead center or to where the

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.150 
to be top dead center or to where the
manual<00:05:03.000> suggests<00:05:03.320> this<00:05:04.320> will<00:05:04.530> now<00:05:04.740> ensure

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
manual suggests this will now ensure

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:13.980 
manual suggests this will now ensure
optimum<00:05:05.880> power<00:05:06.180> is<00:05:06.450> supplied<00:05:06.720> to<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:07.110> vehicle

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.540 

well<00:05:14.990> what<00:05:15.260> do<00:05:15.320> you<00:05:15.410> guys<00:05:15.620> reckon<00:05:16.130> there's<00:05:16.340> not
