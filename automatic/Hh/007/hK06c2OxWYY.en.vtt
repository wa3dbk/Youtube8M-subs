00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
tutorial here on engine startup and take

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.700 
tutorial here on engine startup and take

for<00:00:10.710> illustration<00:00:11.219> purposes<00:00:11.610> I'm<00:00:11.820> going<00:00:11.880> to

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
for illustration purposes I'm going to

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.310 
for illustration purposes I'm going to
keep<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.740> clickable<00:00:13.740> cockpit<00:00:14.780> icon<00:00:15.780> on<00:00:15.990> so

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
keep the clickable cockpit icon on so

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.750 
keep the clickable cockpit icon on so

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
radiator open some reason it only opens

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.120 
radiator open some reason it only opens
up<00:01:03.190> to<00:01:03.340> 50<00:01:03.550> percent<00:01:03.699> not<00:01:04.330> sure<00:01:04.570> why<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.979> want

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
up to 50 percent not sure why you want

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.230 
up to 50 percent not sure why you want
to<00:01:06.190> open<00:01:06.250> up<00:01:06.460> your<00:01:06.520> oil<00:01:06.700> radiator<00:01:07.210> all<00:01:07.690> the<00:01:07.780> way

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
to open up your oil radiator all the way

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.810 
to open up your oil radiator all the way
and<00:01:10.240> you<00:01:10.360> want<00:01:10.570> to<00:01:10.690> set<00:01:10.869> your<00:01:11.020> trim<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:14.340> 0.1<00:01:15.340> so

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
and you want to set your trim to 0.1 so

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:24.630 
and you want to set your trim to 0.1 so
zero<00:01:16.330> two<00:01:21.180> zero<00:01:22.180> one<00:01:22.210> okay<00:01:22.630> I<00:01:23.020> know<00:01:23.860> it<00:01:24.460> says

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
zero two zero one okay I know it says

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.139 
zero two zero one okay I know it says
flaps<00:01:25.440> 220<00:01:26.440> so<00:01:27.840> there<00:01:28.840> we<00:01:29.140> go<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.790> mint<00:01:31.060> the

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
flaps 220 so there we go the mint the

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.050 
flaps 220 so there we go the mint the
flaps<00:01:31.509> can<00:01:31.690> only<00:01:31.869> be<00:01:32.050> done<00:01:32.200> manually<00:01:32.979> in<00:01:33.220> this

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
flaps can only be done manually in this

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.650 
flaps can only be done manually in this
plane<00:01:34.660> so<00:01:35.080> as<00:01:35.440> you<00:01:36.220> can<00:01:36.369> see<00:01:36.670> it's<00:01:37.210> pretty<00:01:38.050> slow

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
plane so as you can see it's pretty slow

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.180 
plane so as you can see it's pretty slow
I'm<00:01:40.660> not<00:01:40.869> sure<00:01:41.050> if<00:01:41.170> this<00:01:41.259> plane<00:01:41.530> has<00:01:41.740> combat

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
I'm not sure if this plane has combat

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
I'm not sure if this plane has combat
flaps<00:01:42.429> because<00:01:43.420> so<00:01:43.630> far<00:01:43.840> I<00:01:43.899> have<00:01:44.850> yet<00:01:45.850> to<00:01:45.880> find

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
flaps because so far I have yet to find

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.460 
flaps because so far I have yet to find
it

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
it

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:54.090 
it
I<00:01:48.659> see<00:01:49.659> control<00:01:50.440> for<00:01:50.770> extend<00:01:52.740> leading<00:01:53.740> edges

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
I see control for extend leading edges

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.550 
I see control for extend leading edges
but<00:01:54.310> they<00:01:54.850> don't<00:01:55.090> seem<00:01:55.330> to<00:01:55.450> do<00:01:55.569> anything<00:01:55.780> all

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
but they don't seem to do anything all

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.790 
but they don't seem to do anything all
right<00:01:56.679> looks<00:01:56.860> like<00:01:56.890> we're<00:01:57.130> about<00:01:57.360> 10%<00:01:58.360> there<00:01:58.569> a

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
right looks like we're about 10% there a

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.440 
right looks like we're about 10% there a
little<00:01:59.800> bit<00:01:59.979> further

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.230 

and

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.180 

go<00:02:05.720> go<00:02:05.990> go<00:02:06.260> go<00:02:07.119> okay<00:02:08.119> close<00:02:08.720> enough<00:02:09.110> all<00:02:10.039> right

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
go go go go okay close enough all right

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:17.350 
go go go go okay close enough all right
so<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:11.690> recap<00:02:13.210> prop<00:02:14.210> pitch<00:02:14.480> at<00:02:14.870> 100%<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:16.360> don't

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
so to recap prop pitch at 100% you don't

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.090 
so to recap prop pitch at 100% you don't
have<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:17.510> worry<00:02:17.690> about<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.140> mixture<00:02:18.710> control

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100

is<00:03:08.269> the<00:03:09.269> answer<00:03:09.720> amorphic<00:03:10.430> control<00:03:11.430> realism

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
is the answer amorphic control realism

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.860 
is the answer amorphic control realism
seems<00:03:12.629> to<00:03:12.750> be<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.900> bit<00:03:13.170> buggy<00:03:13.620> so<00:03:14.510> turn<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:15.540> off

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
seems to be a bit buggy so turn that off
