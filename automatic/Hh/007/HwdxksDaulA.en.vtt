00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
the picture has shorter hair than I do

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.819 
the picture has shorter hair than I do
so<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.579> really<00:01:44.820> difficult<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.500> copy<00:01:46.500> it

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
so it's really difficult to copy it

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.889 
so it's really difficult to copy it
exactly<00:01:47.130> it's<00:01:48.030> gonna<00:01:48.180> look<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.540> little<00:01:48.630> bit

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
exactly it's gonna look a little bit

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.969 
exactly it's gonna look a little bit
bigger<00:01:49.829> on<00:01:50.159> my<00:01:50.670> hair<00:01:51.200> but<00:01:52.200> basically<00:01:52.740> all<00:01:52.950> of

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
bigger on my hair but basically all of

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.359 
bigger on my hair but basically all of
the<00:01:53.220> curls<00:01:53.549> are<00:01:53.729> pinned<00:01:54.170> from<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.710> her<00:01:56.100> left

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the curls are pinned from the her left

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.760 
the curls are pinned from the her left
side<00:01:56.670> all<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.060> way<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.479> right<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.020> all<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
side all the way to the right so all the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.469 
side all the way to the right so all the
rolls<00:01:58.979> are<00:01:59.159> facing<00:01:59.579> like<00:01:59.759> so<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.210> here<00:02:00.390> I'm

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
I'm gonna start working on the back part

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.990 
I'm gonna start working on the back part
of<00:02:33.060> my<00:02:33.180> hair<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.650> I'm<00:02:34.650> just<00:02:34.860> rolling<00:02:35.730> all<00:02:35.970> the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
of my hair and I'm just rolling all the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.009 
of my hair and I'm just rolling all the
sections<00:02:36.870> from<00:02:37.230> left<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.860> right<00:02:38.870> pinning<00:02:39.870> them

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
sections from left to right pinning them

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.280 
sections from left to right pinning them
down<00:02:40.050> in<00:02:40.470> place<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:41.630> highly<00:02:42.630> recommend<00:02:43.080> using

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
down in place I highly recommend using

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.979 
down in place I highly recommend using
two<00:02:43.650> mirrors<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.370> do<00:02:44.519> this<00:02:44.730> or<00:02:45.060> having

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
two mirrors to do this or having

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.380 
two mirrors to do this or having
somebody<00:02:46.500> help<00:02:46.830> you<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.550> direct<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.060> as<00:02:48.269> you

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
somebody help you to direct you as you

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.840 
somebody help you to direct you as you
can<00:02:48.540> see<00:02:48.630> I'm<00:02:48.810> not<00:02:49.050> using<00:02:49.260> any<00:02:49.530> mirrors<00:02:49.920> so<00:02:50.190> I'm

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
can see I'm not using any mirrors so I'm

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.910 
can see I'm not using any mirrors so I'm
just<00:02:51.180> going<00:02:51.420> by<00:02:51.600> what<00:02:51.810> I<00:02:51.840> think<00:02:52.170> will<00:02:52.709> look

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
just going by what I think will look

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.559 
just going by what I think will look
good<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.280> then<00:02:53.400> occasionally<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.090> would<00:02:54.180> stand

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
good and then occasionally I would stand

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.500 
good and then occasionally I would stand
up<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.870> check<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.170> mirror<00:02:55.459> but<00:02:56.459> other<00:02:57.269> than

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
up and check the mirror but other than

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.660 
up and check the mirror but other than
that<00:02:57.600> I'm<00:02:57.959> just<00:02:58.230> guessing<00:02:58.890> where<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.489> would

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
that I'm just guessing where it would

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.229 
that I'm just guessing where it would
look<00:02:59.850> good<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:01.280> then<00:03:02.280> just<00:03:02.610> pin<00:03:02.819> it<00:03:02.850> in<00:03:03.060> place

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.559 

at<00:03:06.239> this<00:03:06.810> side<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.230> started<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.860> roll<00:03:08.100> my<00:03:08.610> pin

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
at this side I started to roll my pin

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.199 
at this side I started to roll my pin
curls<00:03:09.930> in<00:03:10.310> different<00:03:11.310> directions<00:03:11.610> just<00:03:12.090> to

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
curls in different directions just to

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.420 
curls in different directions just to
add<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.530> different<00:03:13.530> type<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.709> effect<00:03:14.220> in<00:03:14.340> the

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
add a different type of effect in the

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.949 
add a different type of effect in the
back<00:03:14.610> but<00:03:14.880> you<00:03:14.940> can<00:03:15.030> pretty<00:03:15.299> much<00:03:15.450> roll<00:03:15.810> them

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
back but you can pretty much roll them

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.569 
back but you can pretty much roll them
in<00:03:16.080> any<00:03:16.230> direction<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:16.769> you'd<00:03:17.010> like<00:03:17.250> and

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
in any direction that you'd like and

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.640 
in any direction that you'd like and
make<00:03:20.579> sure<00:03:20.760> that<00:03:20.880> you<00:03:21.000> get<00:03:21.180> all<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.690> hair<00:03:21.930> nice

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
make sure that you get all the hair nice

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.380 
make sure that you get all the hair nice

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
and pinned here on the side you can

choose to create another pin curl or you

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.330 
choose to create another pin curl or you
can<00:03:27.420> do<00:03:27.570> what<00:03:27.720> I<00:03:27.750> did<00:03:27.900> I'll<00:03:28.739> show<00:03:29.010> you<00:03:29.070> guys<00:03:29.280> I
