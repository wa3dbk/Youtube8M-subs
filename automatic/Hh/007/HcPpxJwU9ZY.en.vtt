00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.030 
example i mean just imagine there is a
bus<00:02:12.810> which<00:02:13.319> can<00:02:13.590> take

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
bus which can take

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.869 
bus which can take
only<00:02:14.599> 128<00:02:15.599> passenger<00:02:16.409> versus<00:02:16.890> another<00:02:17.610> bus

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
only 128 passenger versus another bus

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.369 
only 128 passenger versus another bus
can<00:02:18.090> take<00:02:18.469> 256<00:02:19.469> passenger<00:02:20.099> I<00:02:20.129> mean<00:02:20.459> so<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:22.079> just

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
can take 256 passenger I mean so so just

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.530 
can take 256 passenger I mean so so just
imma<00:02:22.650> give<00:02:22.859> me<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.129> answer<00:02:23.549> which<00:02:23.790> which<00:02:24.239> bus

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
imma give me the answer which which bus

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.229 
imma give me the answer which which bus
can<00:02:24.870> transport<00:02:25.590> more<00:02:26.040> passenger<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.939> their

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
can transport more passenger to their

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.220 
can transport more passenger to their
destination<00:02:28.170> in<00:02:28.379> last<00:02:29.069> time<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:29.579> course<00:02:29.969> a

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
destination in last time of course a

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.229 
destination in last time of course a
256-bit<00:02:31.230> bus<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.489> of<00:02:32.609> course<00:02:32.790> right<00:02:33.030> that

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
256-bit bus that of course right that

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.500 
256-bit bus that of course right that
256<00:02:34.079> real<00:02:34.319> bus<00:02:34.590> can<00:02:35.599> AMD<00:02:36.599> r9<00:02:38.030> 270<00:02:39.030> which<00:02:39.269> goes

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
256 real bus can AMD r9 270 which goes

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.039 
256 real bus can AMD r9 270 which goes
to<00:02:39.659> 150<00:02:40.200> bucks<00:02:40.470> only<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.159> a<00:02:41.329> 256<00:02:42.329> bus<00:02:42.599> that<00:02:42.870> so

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
to 150 bucks only is a 256 bus that so

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.819 
to 150 bucks only is a 256 bus that so
it<00:02:43.230> mean<00:02:43.909> AMD<00:02:44.909> graphic<00:02:45.329> card<00:02:45.629> is<00:02:45.900> two<00:02:46.379> times

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
it mean AMD graphic card is two times

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.030 
it mean AMD graphic card is two times
faster<00:02:47.280> than<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:47.639> crappy<00:02:48.680> 128-bit<00:02:49.680> person

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
faster than this crappy 128-bit person

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.099 
faster than this crappy 128-bit person
again<00:02:50.430> again<00:02:50.760> this<00:02:50.909> is<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.120> major<00:02:51.389> drawback<00:02:51.810> I

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
again again this is a major drawback I

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.140 
again again this is a major drawback I
mean<00:02:52.290> again<00:02:52.590> let<00:02:52.829> me<00:02:52.950> explain<00:02:53.519> you<00:02:53.790> because

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
mean again let me explain you because

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.569 
mean again let me explain you because
you<00:02:54.419> know<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.439> will<00:02:55.590> never<00:02:55.799> listen<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.189> me<00:02:56.459> you

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
you know you will never listen to me you

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.759 
you know you will never listen to me you
will<00:02:56.639> let<00:02:56.819> me<00:02:56.849> just<00:02:57.209> go<00:02:57.389> to<00:02:57.450> neo<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.079> just<00:02:58.620> go

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
will let me just go to neo and just go

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.530 
will let me just go to neo and just go
to<00:02:58.829> your<00:02:58.980> local<00:02:59.159> computer<00:02:59.760> set<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:00.419> that

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
to your local computer set and that

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.399 
to your local computer set and that
order<00:03:00.959> it<00:03:01.519> the<00:03:02.519> problem<00:03:03.030> is<00:03:03.180> again<00:03:03.540> dub<00:03:03.750> just

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
order it the problem is again dub just

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.069 
order it the problem is again dub just
imagined<00:03:04.859> is<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.040> two<00:03:05.370> bus<00:03:05.730> days<00:03:06.419> I<00:03:06.480> mean<00:03:06.870> more

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
imagined is a two bus days I mean more

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:11.270 
imagined is a two bus days I mean more
than<00:03:07.260> 100<00:03:07.799> passenger<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.549> mean<00:03:08.760> waiting<00:03:09.590> ok<00:03:10.590> one

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
than 100 passenger I mean waiting ok one

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.740 
than 100 passenger I mean waiting ok one
bus<00:03:11.609> can<00:03:11.879> only<00:03:12.120> transport<00:03:13.819> 128<00:03:14.819> passenger<00:03:15.569> at

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
bus can only transport 128 passenger at

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.399 
bus can only transport 128 passenger at
a<00:03:15.780> time<00:03:16.139> in<00:03:16.349> a<00:03:16.439> single<00:03:16.889> bus<00:03:17.189> the<00:03:18.060> real<00:03:18.329> bus<00:03:18.599> the

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
a time in a single bus the real bus the

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.210 
a time in a single bus the real bus the
second<00:03:19.799> bus<00:03:19.979> n<00:03:20.250> transport<00:03:21.019> 256<00:03:22.019> percenter<00:03:22.650> so

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
second bus n transport 256 percenter so

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.729 
second bus n transport 256 percenter so
basically<00:03:23.729> it<00:03:24.030> means<00:03:24.060> that<00:03:24.810> wonderfully<00:03:25.500> six

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
basically it means that wonderfully six

128 be a bus passenger can only knit
around<00:03:36.299> it<00:03:36.569> need<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.810> take<00:03:37.139> nine<00:03:37.500> to<00:03:37.739> ten<00:03:38.040> so<00:03:38.699> it

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
around it need to take nine to ten so it

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.740 
around it need to take nine to ten so it
means<00:03:39.209> them<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.409> more<00:03:40.769> big<00:03:41.040> bus<00:03:41.340> is<00:03:41.639> it's<00:03:42.209> more

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
means them the more big bus is it's more

then I mean
and<00:04:27.310> second<00:04:27.940> thing<00:04:28.120> is<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.810> memory<00:04:29.260> per

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
and second thing is the memory per

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.190 
and second thing is the memory per
second<00:04:30.130> is<00:04:30.520> I<00:04:30.910> mean<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.390> bandwidth<00:04:32.020> per

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
second is I mean the bandwidth per

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.230 
second is I mean the bandwidth per

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
second of memory bandwidth per sec it is

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.900 
second of memory bandwidth per sec it is
only<00:04:35.010> 112<00:04:36.090> Giga<00:04:37.090> Big<00:04:37.780> per<00:04:38.290> second<00:04:38.800> versus<00:04:39.640> that

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
only 112 Giga Big per second versus that

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.240 
only 112 Giga Big per second versus that
you<00:04:40.150> take<00:04:40.390> 970<00:04:41.290> which<00:04:41.800> have<00:04:43.050> 224<00:04:44.050> gap<00:04:44.560> bit<00:04:44.980> per

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
you take 970 which have 224 gap bit per

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.560 
you take 970 which have 224 gap bit per
second<00:04:47.130> so<00:04:48.130> soon<00:04:48.490> oh<00:04:48.580> this<00:04:48.820> bloody<00:04:49.120> graphic

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570
