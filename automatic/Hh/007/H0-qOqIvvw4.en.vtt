00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.620
 second transe as this does not say hello 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:07.269
 new friends john rambo and good as 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.299
 some asked me is to share the 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:12.460
 Location of the gluteus another cave 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.350
 first it's going to be going to patrol the 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.930
 land 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.880
 and in what we got there I talk to you 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.680
 in this batch curve or is it not so 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.070
 effective as the previous one that is already 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.040
 parked but this one serves not that 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.490
 Arman I recommend you use 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.000
 a very precise weapon because it's a bit 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.879
 far 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.160
 the shots so I recommend them for 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.129
 example I have same hyper and I 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.510
 I recommend a scout rifle 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.100
 mystic put this rifle 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.560
 explorer that we see although there 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.900
 bands 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:52.390
 with that I think we're ready 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.670
 as I commented in my past video there was no 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.760
 uploaded this spot I had seen these 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.380
 boots about two or three days but as one 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.470
 was discovered by me or some of my 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:07.800
 known 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:10.170
 but why do not they leave me there was not 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.540
 uploaded because I did not discover it 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.000
 of my friends discovered it and really 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.670
 I do not know who discovered it but good and 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.950
 I did what you did not ask, I decided 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.380
 share what we found go to this part 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:30.280
 we went up here 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.280
 it is a bit far away , the area is located 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.670
 of the union the first dong jin of the game 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.909
 the first assault that is where you have to 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.530
 kill the spider we kill septic 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.230
 prime seems to me that it is called that is the 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.550
 big purple eye 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:48.110
 out there that area we do because 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.980
 we have to hurry to see 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.540
 where is the area 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.820
 he does not let me run, I do not know why sometimes 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.620
 process that does not stop you from running the 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.410
 he squeezed the stick and does not let me run 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.730
 who knows why it is right now we take 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.940
 get to an area where I can use 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.920
 the hummingbird to get faster and it's 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.890
 area 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.580
 ok let's go through this whole field 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.580
 let's go here 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.020
 you already know that in this in this kind of 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.990
 tests can train their weapons to 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.740
 go up more than some engrams and 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.740
 things like that 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.239
 let's go through all this nikkei map 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.110
 loading and almost charge a crash 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.870
 we arrived in this area 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.340
 let's work us and right here is the 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.459
 zone we have to kill all the 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.459
 enemies that we see here we are going to kill them 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.730
 if they do not kill me first truth 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.819
 much later those from above us 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.689
 we are arriving at our house 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.689
 to this 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.810
 to this 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.690
 ok band then the new deformed cave 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.330
 or very attentive because here you do not know 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.800
 a chest appears so pay attention 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.990
 The new farmers rope is just 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.250
 here are going to be enemy funds without 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.070
 But the problem is that you do not have to 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.190
 be very far I've been testing there 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:21.040
 up and it is not for a I tried here 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.700
 and they do not do it, it's a little bit there 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.560
 he killed that guy 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.690
 they are not have to kill everyone 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.840
 once they are dead they have to 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.840
 place 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.110
 they have to hurry because if it's not going to 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.110
 appear are placed in this part 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.200
 but all 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.140
 they still do not come out 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.310
 they are dead there I was 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:56.430
 I observe it is not winning 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:01.340
 right now the fast engine up we kill 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.340
 the first ones and we wait for me to get 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.880
 If I do not get angry rush enemies 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.260
 well what I said and I escaped one 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.150
 that's why it was encouraged a little bit that's why 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.650
 you need a pressure rifle 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.430
 the sniper so they can see how they appear 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.430
 there is one 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.810
 we have an improvement of the sniper 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:36.190
 we have already carried two waves practically the 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.190
 third are 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.389
 to show the 4th 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.139
 and if they see that it explodes it is for a 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.840
 same skill and for every time I give 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.240
 a critical hit a headshot the 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.460
 turns enemies into bombs 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:01.000
 for beer as an explosion and it 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.000
 one escaped 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.229
 now so much to look for it there they come 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.910
 we were to continue with this rifle and 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.910
 they saw like 100 spam comics one from the other 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.750
 ah 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:23.160
 what I was telling you look there is a chest 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.140
 just spam 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.670
 do not count alone and bomb not be 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.390
 here about five minutes to see that they are not 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.390
 five minutes 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:39.020
 there we see already a green I think and as 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.180
 in the in the other curve of the uterus between 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:46.289
 more better I do not know because among more people 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:48.029
 gives you better objects of your worst 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.659
 we are able to because you see recharge 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:50.659
 before I paint 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.490
 then band I'm going to stay here a 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:59.409
 I 'm nurturing and now I'm back 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.770
 then say how long I was 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:04.759
 and what they gave me right now they will see 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.759
 and we return band 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.500
 ah 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.080
 good when I've been shooting for 10 minutes 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.920
 I barely have bullets 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:22.690
 let's see what they gave me 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:26.650
 Let's see if we get more 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:30.320
 ok I put like some green things 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:33.520
 we collect bullets that we have the first 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.520
 they heard about the green 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.220
 5 green 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.440
 good in 10 minutes they gave me 5 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:45.280
 green for the purchase from up here 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.280
 I bring 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:53.560
 if we open the chest 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:56.169
 and then for the green bullets 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.840
 we will recharge in the semis and they 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:02.110
 and then nothing more band as I say no 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.060
 It is as effective as the other cave but 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:07.210
 because with the thickness you will have things there 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:09.009
 they saw that they gave me 5 greens to me I did not 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:12.279
 They really serve but well hopefully 

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:13.900
 after creating something better I do not eat 

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:14.919
 it works just like the other cave between 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.770
 much better 

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:21.129
 so are his comrades and bring 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:24.460
 I hope it helps them and 

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:26.169
 I repeat I am not author of this of this 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.819
 I saw it on the internet, I do not know either 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:29.740
 who found it so I can not 

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:31.419
 give them this data bands 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:35.139
 but well there's a band because I 

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:36.910
 they asked and we go for the metal spin like this 

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:38.289
 that Banesto will realize utility and that 

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.000
 I liked the video but well 

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:41.530
 give me like to subscribe and share 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.410
 with your friends bands already know that 

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:47.550
 it has a rhombus and that we see 

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.550
 the next chao
