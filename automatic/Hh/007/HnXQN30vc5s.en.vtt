but what are you said the angle what's
the<00:01:50.120> angle<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:51.020> let's<00:01:51.170> go<00:01:51.290> back<00:01:51.470> up<00:01:54.430> so<00:01:55.430> if<00:01:55.670> you

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
the angle so let's go back up so if you

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.090 
the angle so let's go back up so if you
take<00:01:55.970> a<00:01:56.000> photo<00:01:56.300> now<00:01:56.690> out<00:01:56.900> the<00:01:57.050> window<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:57.710> you

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
stops on the water drops off there and

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.140 
stops on the water drops off there and
then<00:03:43.290> we're<00:03:43.500> just<00:03:43.530> going<00:03:43.770> to<00:03:43.830> use<00:03:43.980> the

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
then we're just going to use the

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.460 
then we're just going to use the
downhill<00:03:45.150> assist<00:03:45.240> so<00:03:45.810> what<00:03:46.050> I'm<00:03:46.170> doing<00:03:46.200> is

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
downhill assist so what I'm doing is

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.500 
downhill assist so what I'm doing is
using<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.830> controls<00:03:47.220> on<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.460> wheel<00:03:47.640> to

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
using the controls on the wheel to

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.200 
using the controls on the wheel to
actually<00:03:48.780> slow<00:03:48.960> the<00:03:49.110> car<00:03:49.290> right<00:03:49.560> here<00:03:50.180> so<00:03:51.180> I

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
actually slow the car right here so I

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.240 
actually slow the car right here so I
can<00:03:51.270> slow<00:03:51.600> down<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:51.990> speed<00:03:52.110> it<00:03:52.380> up<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:53.070> it

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
can slow down and speed it up and it

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.120 
can slow down and speed it up and it
uses<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.550> break<00:03:54.170> or<00:03:55.170> whatever<00:03:55.320> I<00:03:55.500> do<00:03:55.650> so

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
uses a break or whatever I do so

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.470 
uses a break or whatever I do so
especially<00:03:56.250> if<00:03:56.610> you're<00:03:56.760> doing<00:03:56.970> formal<00:03:57.270> drive

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
especially if you're doing formal drive

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.690 
especially if you're doing formal drive
with<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.690> talk<00:03:58.110> that's<00:03:58.590> in<00:03:58.740> the<00:03:58.830> car<00:03:59.040> if<00:03:59.490> your

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
with the talk that's in the car if your

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.250 
with the talk that's in the car if your
foot<00:03:59.820> bounces<00:04:00.330> then<00:04:00.690> you<00:04:00.810> actually<00:04:00.960> launch

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
foot bounces then you actually launch

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260 
foot bounces then you actually launch
and<00:04:01.530> do<00:04:01.620> some<00:04:01.800> damage<00:04:01.980> so<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.820> big<00:04:03.030> thing<00:04:03.060> is

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
and do some damage so the big thing is

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.420 
and do some damage so the big thing is
it<00:04:03.420> keeps<00:04:03.630> account<00:04:03.930> nice<00:04:04.080> and<00:04:04.290> flat<00:04:04.470> below
