team in football however statistically

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.350 
team in football however statistically

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
football but that really wasn't the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.240 
football but that really wasn't the
upset<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> day<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.710> was<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:38.070> was<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
upset of the day it was it was the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.100 
upset of the day it was it was the
Giants<00:00:38.730> yeah<00:00:39.270> I'm<00:00:39.420> looking<00:00:39.660> at<00:00:39.780> these<00:00:39.870> games

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
I'm thinking there's some lines kind of

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.490 
I'm thinking there's some lines kind of
look<00:00:42.300> interesting<00:00:42.629> what<00:00:42.750> about<00:00:42.899> Cleveland

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
look interesting what about Cleveland

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.080 
look interesting what about Cleveland
minus<00:00:43.739> one<00:00:43.920> over<00:00:43.950> Tennessee<00:00:44.550> Cleveland's<00:00:44.940> not

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
minus one over Tennessee Cleveland's not

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.340 
minus one over Tennessee Cleveland's not

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
so bad they've been played and playing

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.930 
so bad they've been played and playing
teams<00:00:46.620> are<00:00:46.829> pretty<00:00:46.950> good<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.489> might<00:00:47.789> not<00:00:47.879> be

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
teams are pretty good that might not be

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.630 
teams are pretty good that might not be
a<00:00:48.059> bad<00:00:48.120> bet<00:00:48.510> right<00:00:48.690> there<00:00:49.129> yeah<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.430> that

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
a bad bet right there yeah that that

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.069 
a bad bet right there yeah that that
could<00:00:50.820> be<00:00:50.940> possibly<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.480> good<00:00:51.629> bet<00:00:51.840> Peter

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
could be possibly a good bet Peter

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.459 
could be possibly a good bet Peter
because<00:00:52.260> satellite<00:00:52.800> ovum<00:00:53.070> dead<00:00:53.219> pick'em<00:00:54.469> and

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
because satellite ovum dead pick'em and

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.709 
because satellite ovum dead pick'em and
now<00:00:55.620> has<00:00:55.770> gone<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.129> minus<00:00:56.460> one<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.730> one<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.570> a

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
now has gone to minus one and one and a

with<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:18.390> line<00:01:18.630> opening<00:01:18.930> at<00:01:19.020> 7i<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.590> thought

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
with this line opening at 7i I thought

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.560 
with this line opening at 7i I thought
this<00:01:20.100> was<00:01:20.250> more<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.700> four<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.090> half<00:01:21.119> five

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
this was more of a four and a half five

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.870 
this was more of a four and a half five
right<00:01:22.229> um<00:01:23.240> so<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.830> think<00:01:25.830> Caroline<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.610> agree

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
with you fear than Carolina could give

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.499 
with you fear than Carolina could give
them<00:01:28.350> big<00:01:29.340> trouble<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.970> know<00:01:30.060> when<00:01:30.180> Newton's

in history they can do it in a week and

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.759 
in history they can do it in a week and
Oakland<00:02:13.790> maybe<00:02:14.030> just<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.450> tad<00:02:14.720> over<00:02:15.230> rated

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
Oakland maybe just a tad over rated

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.640 
Oakland maybe just a tad over rated
right<00:02:16.069> now<00:02:16.250> yeah<00:02:16.989> it's<00:02:17.989> nice<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.200> see<00:02:18.470> them

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
right now yeah it's nice to see them

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.369 
right now yeah it's nice to see them
making<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:19.220> comeback<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.870> not<00:02:21.110> being<00:02:21.260> a

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
making a comeback and not being a

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.100 
making a comeback and not being a
doormat<00:02:21.769> in<00:02:21.799> the<00:02:22.069> AFC<00:02:22.519> West<00:02:23.019> but<00:02:24.019> again

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
doormat in the AFC West but again

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.690 
doormat in the AFC West but again
they're<00:02:24.439> arguably<00:02:24.799> going<00:02:25.129> against<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:25.549> best

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
they're arguably going against the best

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.940 
they're arguably going against the best
team<00:02:25.970> in<00:02:26.000> football<00:02:26.299> yeah<00:02:27.079> and<00:02:27.409> that<00:02:27.650> team<00:02:27.920> that

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
team in football yeah and that team that

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.410 
team in football yeah and that team that
best<00:02:28.340> human<00:02:28.579> football<00:02:28.849> is<00:02:28.909> coming<00:02:29.150> off<00:02:29.269> a<00:02:29.299> loss

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
best human football is coming off a loss

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.000 
best human football is coming off a loss
so<00:02:29.959> there<00:02:30.140> it's<00:02:30.409> not<00:02:30.530> like<00:02:30.709> they're<00:02:30.799> not<00:02:30.920> going

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
so there it's not like they're not going

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.100 
so there it's not like they're not going
to<00:02:31.069> be<00:02:31.159> focused<00:02:31.579> yeah<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.480> don't<00:02:32.720> know<00:02:32.900> I<00:02:32.959> I

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
to be focused yeah I don't know I I

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.809 
to be focused yeah I don't know I I
think<00:02:33.799> the<00:02:33.860> public<00:02:34.010> won't<00:02:34.250> be<00:02:34.430> able<00:02:34.579> to<00:02:34.670> help

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
think the public won't be able to help

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.819 
think the public won't be able to help
themselves<00:02:35.299> on<00:02:35.780> that<00:02:35.959> one<00:02:36.140> yeah<00:02:36.319> I<00:02:36.409> agree<00:02:36.620> if

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
themselves on that one yeah I agree if

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:37.869 
themselves on that one yeah I agree if
you<00:02:36.920> would<00:02:37.040> probably<00:02:37.310> get<00:02:37.400> that<00:02:37.579> up<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.760> around

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
you would probably get that up to around

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.849 
you would probably get that up to around
six<00:02:38.450> but<00:02:38.780> I<00:02:39.109> don't<00:02:39.409> know<00:02:39.500> if<00:02:39.620> I<00:02:39.680> would<00:02:39.739> take

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:39.859 
six but I don't know if I would take

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.500 
six but I don't know if I would take
either<00:02:40.129> side<00:02:40.430> in<00:02:40.579> that<00:02:40.730> one<00:02:40.879> anything<00:02:41.390> else

the second quarter there because

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.830 
the second quarter there because
pittsburgh<00:03:01.819> arguably<00:03:02.239> could<00:03:02.329> have<00:03:02.540> put<00:03:02.720> the

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840
