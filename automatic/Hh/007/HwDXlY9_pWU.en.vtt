 among those identified and judged art that I understand perfectly is 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.460
 there is a lot of work to be done that is true is true 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.059
 without taking away the tenure I will try 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:07.389

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.979
 and that at the time of the state dinner 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:18.099
 in tarragona the third job is true do not play sun 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.800

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.509

 the marinade remain people l have the unconditional support of serious and understand the 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:31.080
 business understand what we do 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.779
 it's something very professional 

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:35.779
 we are then not necessary because if not 

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:38.930
 added that there are 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.659
 the American player 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:41.680
 and of course 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.539
 the sector 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:45.169
 in Ciudad Juarez but when they say court 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:48.169
 we give ourselves the tenth hand how good is the antecedent 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:54.589
 when I get home 

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:56.749
 on Tuesday 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:59.409
 but let the banker do it 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:02.409
 the nba 

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:08.609
 it was demonstrated a highly qualified character facing this 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:11.330
 access 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.759
 the ties 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:16.730
 I would like to know if at the time of the concert 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.270
 your relationship to the fans but for fear of losing so much for more better 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:25.990
 not because we do not want to maintain our personal life in private is what you 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.780
 I say something very simple is like a wild card 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.089
 We said at the beginning something for us but 

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:33.719
 the fans that 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:36.050
 that for some reason not working 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.889
 do not want six artist leagues because it's found happiness in a person 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:42.180
 urgent 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.430
 or because a person comes before a person if we respect each other completely 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.509
 and we wish you the best panahi 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:52.080
 and at some point we will find ourselves as fantastic 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.460
 and for now in a statement 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.460
 but one has to be happy in life my grandfather told me 

00:06:57.999 --> 00:07:02.639
 and before passing away itself if an artist believes that success is manuela 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:04.419
 Mena good song 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:07.059
 then you will soon realize that a successful 

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:08.879
 because success also in 

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:11.879
 can come to your house and share it with the family 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:15.000
 with your husband in the pit that you
