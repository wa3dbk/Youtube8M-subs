look inspired by Bane let's get started

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.610 
look inspired by Bane let's get started
okay<00:00:35.340> first<00:00:35.610> I'm<00:00:35.790> taking<00:00:36.120> my<00:00:36.300> light<00:00:36.690> grey<00:00:37.200> face

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
okay first I'm taking my light grey face

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.350 
okay first I'm taking my light grey face
paint<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.160> I'm<00:00:38.250> spritzing<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.790> with<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> little

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
paint and I'm spritzing it with a little

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.510 
paint and I'm spritzing it with a little
bit<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.510> water<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.930> activate<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.860> then<00:00:41.399> I'm

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
bit of water to activate it and then I'm

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.000 
bit of water to activate it and then I'm
taking<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:42.000> thin<00:00:42.390> brush<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.930> drawing<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
taking a thin brush and drawing the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.850 
taking a thin brush and drawing the
entire<00:00:44.460> outline<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.660> bane<00:00:45.840> mask<00:00:46.140> now<00:00:46.680> this

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
entire outline of the bane mask now this

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.190 
entire outline of the bane mask now this
look<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.280> hard<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.910> explain<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.780> tutorial

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
look is hard to explain in a tutorial

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.900 
look is hard to explain in a tutorial
just<00:00:49.680> because<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.100> quite<00:00:50.430> difficult<00:00:50.670> to

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
just because it's quite difficult to

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.240 
just because it's quite difficult to
explain<00:00:51.120> each<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.020> shapes<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:52.980> do

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
explain each of the shapes so I do

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.580 
explain each of the shapes so I do
recommend<00:00:53.850> having<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.510> photo<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.379> bane

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
recommend having a photo of the bane

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.860 
recommend having a photo of the bane
mask<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:56.039> front<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.699> which<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.480> can<00:00:57.660> use

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
mask in front of you which you can use

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.740 
mask in front of you which you can use
