00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 that a gamer like this greets them 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.470
 mister who issues thanks for being here 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.850
 again on my channel and this day 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.519
 I bring a small video but very 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.380
 informative since supposedly it was possible 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.179
 have filtered what is going to be a date 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.070
 of launching what is the owl this 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.949
 day like when you blas as investigating 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.170
 texas that this day was today have 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.850
 had a such a meeting like this 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.250
 of companies that make accessories for 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.230
 what is the the will you then in the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.269
 presentation he closed his presentation and 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.820
 said the accessories were going to be 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.309
 ready a little before day 18 of 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.170
 November that was the departure of the wing as well 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.050
 that he in a few words said it in the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.840
 conference and I do not know if it was error or you were 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.370
 came out or did not have it did not realize what 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.070
 let it be but he said that they would be 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.500
 ready long before November 18 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.450
 that was the launch day of the wii and 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.940
 this date does not sound as something feasible 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.750
 nintendo has always preferred to launch its 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.969
 new products 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.640
 the clear Sunday example of it was the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.640
 nintendo 3ds the xl that was released on 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.620
 last August 19, also on the 18th 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.239
 November is the last Sunday before the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.250
 thanksgiving day to the usa 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.030
 as I had already told you that it is the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.680
 day where 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.380
 here purportedly purchases are made 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.450
 Christmas what you can think what 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.950
 that will benefit Nintendo in the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.900
 launch sales pride of good 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.810
 because for that time here the community 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.729
 American to do their shopping as soon 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.830
 of Christmas and everyone becomes 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.020
 even debts with all the cards like this 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.300
 that to me the truth I already had 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.430
 said had to have left before the 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.229
 black friday because it's people make their 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.119
 purchases and another one of the things also that 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.009
 I want to tell you that it is most likely 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.479
 that all this information besides the 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.390
 price the launch games are given 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.460
 to know the next September 13 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.750
 during an event that will be held 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.729
 nintendo in the city of new york 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.259
 We will be aware that it is clear that 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.780
 we will bring a video as already 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.670
 really say what it is going to be 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.789
 but as I tell you, sir, the gentleman closed 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.409
 his speech sorry and said that the 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.840
 Noise accessories are going to be ready 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.300
 a little before November 18th 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.250
 that the launching of the wii me so 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.569
 that was a curious fact that they gave me 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.080
 I want to share with you that 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.610
 we found here 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.200
 you know that when they have more 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.180
 information with pleasure we're going 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.910
 to bring and thanks again for being 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.120
