hello<00:00:07.910> I'm<00:00:08.360> MC<00:00:08.960> X<00:00:09.080> again<00:00:09.379> and<00:00:10.150> I'm<00:00:11.150> going<00:00:11.809> to

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 
hello I'm MC X again and I'm going to

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.030 
hello I'm MC X again and I'm going to
show<00:00:12.320> you<00:00:12.349> how<00:00:12.889> to<00:00:12.950> build<00:00:13.459> this<00:00:17.230> from<00:00:18.230> item<00:00:18.740> and

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:19.040 
show you how to build this from item and

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:26.470 
show you how to build this from item and
the<00:00:19.580> door<00:00:19.820> opens<00:00:20.500> close<00:00:21.500> it<00:00:21.760> okay<00:00:24.850> and<00:00:25.850> you<00:00:26.300> can

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
the door opens close it okay and you can

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:39.430 
the door opens close it okay and you can
just<00:00:26.780> throw<00:00:27.050> it<00:00:27.170> in<00:00:27.680> there<00:00:37.090> and<00:00:38.090> it<00:00:39.050> is<00:00:39.200> how<00:00:39.380> it

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
just throw it in there and it is how it

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.170 
just throw it in there and it is how it
looks<00:00:39.829> outside<00:00:41.740> there's<00:00:42.740> a<00:00:43.250> lot<00:00:43.460> of<00:00:43.670> word

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
looks outside there's a lot of word

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.720 
looks outside there's a lot of word
thing<00:00:44.540> that<00:00:45.579> minutes

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
thing that minutes

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.470 
thing that minutes
we<00:00:47.090> just<00:00:47.360> need<00:00:47.920> operates<00:00:49.360> a<00:00:51.250> comparator<00:00:52.480> D

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
we just need operates a comparator D

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.130 
we just need operates a comparator D
flip-flop<00:00:54.079> and<00:00:54.530> that's<00:00:54.950> it<00:00:55.360> so<00:00:56.360> I'm<00:00:56.810> gonna

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
flip-flop and that's it so I'm gonna

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.200 
flip-flop and that's it so I'm gonna
show<00:00:57.500> you<00:00:57.530> how<00:00:58.190> to<00:00:58.250> build<00:00:58.520> it<00:00:59.440> first<00:01:01.180> make<00:01:02.180> the

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
show you how to build it first make the

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:12.440 
show you how to build it first make the
paper<00:01:03.699> like<00:01:04.699> this

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.859 

to<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.600> normal<00:01:14.079> business<00:01:14.320> and<00:01:15.130> let<00:01:15.789> them<00:01:16.060> walk

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:28.350 

two<00:01:19.869> blocks<00:01:20.289> on<00:01:20.740> top<00:01:20.770> of<00:01:21.039> that<00:01:25.799> redstone<00:01:27.360> torch

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
two blocks on top of that redstone torch

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:37.410 
two blocks on top of that redstone torch
and<00:01:28.689> stone<00:01:30.929> and<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:34.689> cups<00:01:35.159> with<00:01:36.159> power<00:01:36.429> like

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
and stone and the cups with power like

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:46.859 
and stone and the cups with power like
this<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:39.340> you<00:01:39.909> again<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.939> compare<00:01:46.659> the

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
this and you again the it compare the

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.440 
this and you again the it compare the
dirt<00:01:47.170> and<00:01:47.409> repeater<00:01:47.979> to<00:01:50.610> get<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.849> power<00:01:52.149> out

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
dirt and repeater to get the power out

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:04.520 
dirt and repeater to get the power out
of<00:01:52.590> cutters<00:01:53.590> like<00:01:56.729> this<00:02:01.289> and<00:02:02.289> then<00:02:03.280> adjusts<00:02:04.179> to

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
of cutters like this and then adjusts to

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:12.059 
of cutters like this and then adjusts to
the<00:02:05.530> top<00:02:05.860> of<00:02:06.069> the<00:02:06.490> items<00:02:07.000> in<00:02:09.630> them<00:02:10.630> just<00:02:11.170> suits

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
the top of the items in them just suits

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:22.490 
the top of the items in them just suits
in<00:02:12.579> the<00:02:12.819> house<00:02:13.060> right<00:02:13.360> on<00:02:13.630> top<00:02:13.810> of<00:02:13.989> it

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:42.620 

like<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:26.600> there<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.720> no<00:02:28.580> wrong<00:02:29.580> item<00:02:32.390> 8a<00:02:41.630> Joe

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
like that there is no wrong item 8a Joe

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:52.030 
like that there is no wrong item 8a Joe
an<00:02:42.780> item<00:02:45.020> in<00:02:46.020> stop<00:02:50.330> stop

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
an item in stop stop

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.260 
an item in stop stop
so<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.670> can<00:02:53.959> also<00:02:54.959> do<00:02:55.350> distance<00:02:55.940> sweat

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
so you can also do distance sweat

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.490 
so you can also do distance sweat
wheats<00:02:57.959> Lada<00:02:59.420> let's<00:03:00.420> take<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.690> bucket<00:03:01.050> of<00:03:01.290> lava

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
wheats Lada let's take a bucket of lava

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:14.860 
wheats Lada let's take a bucket of lava
and<00:03:03.440> plate<00:03:04.440> it<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:05.420> then<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.959> nitrogen<00:03:09.860> power

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.930 

this<00:03:15.870> would<00:03:16.440> because<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.930> upper<00:03:19.490> it<00:03:20.490> sucks

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
this would because the upper it sucks

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.710 
this would because the upper it sucks
the<00:03:21.780> item<00:03:22.200> before<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.580> love<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.150> can<00:03:24.180> destroy

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
the item before the love I can destroy

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.949 
the item before the love I can destroy
it

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
it

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.170 
it
and<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.100> sucks<00:03:26.400> true<00:03:26.790> all<00:03:27.300> types<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.980> then<00:03:29.280> it

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
and it sucks true all types and then it

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.449 
and it sucks true all types and then it
goes<00:03:30.510> through<00:03:30.870> with<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.739> average<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:32.430> the

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
goes through with the average to the

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.440 
goes through with the average to the
test

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
test

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.370 
test
but<00:03:34.200> when<00:03:34.560> I<00:03:35.130> is<00:03:35.670> here<00:03:36.000> for<00:03:36.360> money

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
but when I is here for money

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.930 
but when I is here for money
the<00:03:38.280> comparator<00:03:39.000> will<00:03:39.269> pick<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.510> up<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:40.940> this

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
the comparator will pick it up and this

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.420 
the comparator will pick it up and this
