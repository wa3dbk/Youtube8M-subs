00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:07.140
 new round coffee major match play den 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.300
 I will destroy now we have yes 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.349
 already recorded a round 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.139
 they would not be accepted because the 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.210
 Recording did not work and there 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.699
 I was at least in the beginning in management 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:24.449
 Now you have to grant that more now 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:29.039
 I have no problems but I thought 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.900
 who is quite honest in this 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.730
 video still wanted to potentiate what 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.829
 from the recordings, though, is that 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:44.579
 the first video is what you need to 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:47.579
 heart now the first bio what you see 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.570
 what was recorded on a new computer 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.129
 The new graphics became the partial 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:06.409
 even then, bodies are playing around too 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:08.280
 to be correct in 60 frames, I think good 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.890
 It is, however, I always have 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.180
 time not the first shot that I 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.600
 made the calculator that was 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.909
 another the common hour and her 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:34.189
 you will soon see things differently now 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:35.850
 that's okay, what's never in life 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.070
 I was down there 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:43.040
 just was that was now just because 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.040
 Already the item hermann 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.260
 really good the spectator is now on 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:09.490
 every case about mainz always has to be like that 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:23.050
 say for the half center slowly 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:24.489
 no problem thank you a little bit too 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.390
 bent early 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:31.989
 really cheap commander is now 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.480
 just the round I won was there 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.019
 was 42 at the end no, what did you notice ? 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.400
 that it's not the best either 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:45.730
 Recording is lost because I'm not 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:48.459
 I would have been ahead in front of them 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.720
 chance and has the muzzle and g1 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.850
 asserts to you 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.110
 the turtle to you what that was that 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.239
 point I know that this chance I 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.549
 need to destroy yourself why should 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.230
 I want to do something you already want one 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:06.519
 size loser until this game ever 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:15.310
 has played a provider must supply ask 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:19.030
 source of new york swim the 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:22.030
 Crowns meander through the skilfully 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.440
 no anna you can get the curve 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.440
 if you give yourself a little effort 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:36.060
 I would be right up there 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.060
 become instead 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.250
 but I got worse 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.110
 I do not know why that is, I know 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.000
 I am dead 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:57.620
 but I know plaid worse 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.320
 become because it always licked before 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.040
 but now with 60 frames I can 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:18.830
 finally unpack my whole kilo 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:19.670
 Clenched cargo came that it 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:30.260
 arrived 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:31.610
 three albums everything but you are real 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.550
 not so much the crudest tip 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.540
 you used to the feeling I'm going to the lg 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.540
 pay is over 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:46.130
 thank words, the delay I know 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.910
 not even close the bag 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.210
 even if you are in front you are very violent 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:56.490
 what do you want to do 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:59.520
 the knowledge is now annoying 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.620
 that babys fed properly larger part of the 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:09.750
 space here take a bit 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:12.000
 annoyingly collect for the turtle 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.250
 Close to me because I'm so stupid too 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.080
 I'm not sorry I have one more time 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.060
 moist is in the wrong 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.560
 to weigh safety and then have zack 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.120
 I struck like the snake the 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:28.410
 you play it because it's slim it 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.580
 makes really blatant need not synonymous times 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.419
 warschau that is not so in my 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:36.169
 I am alive without losing much 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:40.259

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.870

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:06.300
 If you do not say so he would be 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.979
 maybe even if I already 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.000
 that would not have been the case 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:11.000
 but would have been good 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.690
 every time he loses 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:48.460

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:54.780

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:51.369
