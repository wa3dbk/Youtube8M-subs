00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.129
 just like that again we are here 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:08.340
 I explain android mexico and this time for 

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:12.410
 present an application that we 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.450
 asked a kid out there for a by 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.540
 youtube to avoid the bar 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.030
 notifications to put buttons because if 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.790
 they realize the bar is normal good 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.430
 without anything and he wants to put some 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.290
 attractive buttons and everything then what 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.030
 better than there is the best application in 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:35.280
 everything is called 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:39.870
 aida big band is this big band 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.940
 in click like that they look for it in a nice cake bar and 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.420
 is this one 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.059
 this is the good one they have here is free 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.730
 they install it is very good and bring and 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.430
 why a small ad I no longer 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.089
 I have the clear announcement but it brings the one 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:02.120
 ad then install it is is 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:02.120
 installing as you see sting is talking 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.290
 This application I loved, I'm going to 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:13.360
 use already I did not remember because the 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:15.900
 good status of play store 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.990
 we close them 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.310
 'we have lavrio by default here is 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.220
 the more because 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:29.060
 it's the one we're going to open 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:32.030
 and here is this complication 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.720
 you can edit make a widget like you 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.610
 want and one and the bar 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.740
 notifications this is what those who 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.980
 he asked us then here in bar 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.940
 notifications are going to go again until 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.810
 down 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:51.320
 here is this blue design this 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.250
 blue design 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.470
 shows them how their bar will be 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.470
 then here you will add all the 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.040
 buttons that you want airplane mode to 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.720
 where are you connected wi-fi networks 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.209
 synchronization automatic synchronize 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.319
 bluetooth for example I'm going to 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.769
 interesting to put 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.560
 data traffic as main after 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.690
 of data traffic 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.730
 where am I connecting or disconnecting from 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.209
 wifi after that 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.209
 we go 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.230
 and the silent ones already know that this 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.230
 button is automatic 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.090
 we're not going to remove it we're going to with mode 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.150
 vibration I use it more 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.550
 auto broken the screen I do not think I know what 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.110
 removed 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.110
 screen brightness 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:53.049
 and nothing more translation increase because 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:56.540
 when you change icsa xxxix controller 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:59.390
 playstation and good but then well 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.100
 is now you can also add a 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.380
 application to the bar if you like 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.540
 an application like that so anyone 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.409
 comfortable 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:14.379
 as a compass and so added an access 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:16.900
 direct but good in this case we give it 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:19.629
 since we have two what we want 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.640
 We go to design and in design we can 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.550
 give transparent 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.390
 or black 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.340
 another black 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.190
 another one 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.950
 another one 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.540
 another and good is that several do not 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.060
 perform 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.510
 then I, for my case, will 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.190
 paschal 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.040
 transport 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.700
 and I know of icons that are white and blue 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:55.810
 because I like the color and well 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.810
 it was in the popcorn and I give in apply 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:04.860
 and here is our buttons 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:07.860
 yes they work they work and it's fine 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.860
 works 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.690
 if I have automatic brightness 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:18.019
 as you can see 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:21.120
 For example, we can close it 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:25.040
 there are already buttons 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:29.040
 ok then I'll leave you the video there 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.639
 check it and subscribe it's worth it 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.639
 we responded
