00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.769
 push gold and welcome 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.379
 to the brand whisper with just this topic 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.840
 because today we obviously have one 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.630
 gigantic order seen here want 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.090
 pressed down and that was 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.580
 one of the highlights of today 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.859
 but other interesting things 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.289
 we had the first time 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.180
 us reporting season now in one 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.600
 slow hot phase comes along today 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.850
 banks jp morgan operational quite good though 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.530
 provisions for legal problems 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.540
 maybe the banker still has 11 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.120
 pay billions of dollars for 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.890
 a few impassable ones 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.030
 In the mortgage business, this has been achieved 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.160
 can thus be a really expensive 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.559
 the operating business was good for the share 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.879
 then just not in question 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.129
 the largest provider of mortgages and 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.590
 the a weak mortgage business 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.539
 recorded here that is of course 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.570
 the rise in mortgage rates by 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.600
 less demand for houses et cetera 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.070
 and that is a harbinger for that 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.350
 the housing market is really slow 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.210
 its limits come that the risen ones 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.979
 may really interest here 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.180
 mood have spoiled because of that 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.130
 maybe the fed no tethering 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.020
 has operated the us 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.420
 Consumer confidence as expected 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.009
 weak 75 2 this is the weakest value 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.080
 since january 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.790
 but the market has gone reasonably well 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.520
 because everything turns naturally 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.679
 around the US debt limit 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.229
 The question now is this whole 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.990
 History postponed by six weeks 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.009
 the republicans seem 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.869
 to be more willing to compromise today 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.579
 again a meeting with Obama and 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.840
 Leading republicans will see if 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.829
 What comes out of the markets 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.549
 in any case, that's already been the case 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.369
 priced 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.810
 and if it does not come so when it comes to 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.490
 say the game continues here 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.950
 draws you no unification will then 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.009
 the risk this time on the side of the bulls 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.049
 he this huge sale order in gold 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.310
 Dealers say that was about the equivalent 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.920
 of two million us in one 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.069
 gigantic folders and if we look at that 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.410
 let's see here in the chart then see 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.459
 we have this red card within 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.769
 seconds 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.540
 Here it was a short 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.130
 movement there 's really popped 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.440
 maybe a fat finger maybe 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.140
 someone too much of a few zero a 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.790
 has given or someone the deliberate 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.440
 the gold wanted to push down that 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.209
 The question is currently valid at 1268 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.410
 So this is what this deep what 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.140
 we had formed a few days ago 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.610
 at 1173 if we fell short of that 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.930
 watch whole in the longer-term chart 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.750
 we still have a bit here 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.079
 support in just this zone before then 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.180
 Here comes the area 1222 game 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.579
 worst case here then first the area 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.060
 1000 to 1020 dollars do what 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:53.370
 share indexes dax not a lot 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.510
 This morning we were around 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.100
 area 8740 came a bit 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.840
 down and determined act now 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.299
 again a bit up on exactly 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.760
 base but much is in the dax are not 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.500
 the americans are showing up here 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.950
 friendly are now here on the resistance 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.060
 at 5 10,200 points is about there 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.670
 of course, already a lot 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.650
 priced in and if we have the vix 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.329
 then look at the vola on the smp 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.060
 we see that we have two teams here 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:23.580
 but that we have formed here now 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.069
 andy come up the straight and the 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.160
 could again provide support here the 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.200
 would mean that the rally for now 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.780
 there is an end to this trend line 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.400
 keeps up a rising path is 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.050
 mostly falling or containing 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.180
 mostly falling stock prices and 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.650
 conversely what else would have wanted on the 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.510
 agenda the euro but see us still 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.670
 want to look more determined and determined 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.890
 has not really listened much 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.069
 we went upstairs this morning 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.590
 Direction 35 80 are now at 35 58 as 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.060
 not really much happening who 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.790
 expresses gold that was the question 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.890
 fat finger or someone who really the 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.110
 direct an attack on the yellow metal 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.420
 That's the question itself was here 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.690
 pressed down we believe less 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.760
 that this is the possible solution of the 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.140
 We are still in debt 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.819
 do not really believe that anymore 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.319
 not to the republicans a bit 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.440
 Showing up to come is still nothing 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.049
 here in dry towels and the 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.820
 politics sometimes goes astray 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.650
 Let's see how it goes on here 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.330
 Anyway, that seems to us the chance 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.800
 risk ratio remains at the 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.260
 top not particularly favorable too 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.200
 After all, basically everything positive 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.419
 priced in janet yellen's solution 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.070
 debt issue in the usa what should now 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.630
 actually still positive come the 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.550
 the reporting season in the usa will be fine 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.850
 Do not surrender we'll take a look 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:45.260
 wonderful what good then servus 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.260
 action the brucker experts
