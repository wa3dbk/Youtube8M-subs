and<00:01:17.880> I'm<00:01:17.940> just<00:01:18.090> kind<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.270> ascending<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> scale

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.109 

and<00:01:28.649> you<00:01:29.070> know<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.219> don't<00:01:29.369> like<00:01:29.490> sliding<00:01:29.969> into

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
and you know I don't like sliding into

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.779 
and you know I don't like sliding into
notes<00:01:30.420> from<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.719> half-step<00:01:31.079> below<00:01:31.799> or<00:01:32.250> above<00:01:32.399> it

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
notes from a half-step below or above it

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:34.999 
notes from a half-step below or above it
just<00:01:32.939> gives<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.899> a<00:01:33.990> bit<00:01:34.109> more<00:01:34.259> impact<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.920> a

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
just gives it a bit more impact and a

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.730 
just gives it a bit more impact and a
bit<00:01:35.340> more<00:01:35.490> flavour<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.030> yeah<00:01:36.409> for<00:01:37.409> our<00:01:37.500> next

00:01:51.719 --> 00:02:00.109 
ascend this sort of pentatonic lick and
B<00:01:51.869> flat<00:01:57.319> and<00:01:58.319> the<00:01:59.219> voice<00:01:59.399> thing<00:01:59.579> I'm<00:01:59.670> doing<00:01:59.970> is

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
B flat and the voice thing I'm doing is

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:42.800 
pentatonic and I'm just grouping the
notes<00:02:33.960> in<00:02:34.200> either<00:02:34.410> threes<00:02:34.710> or<00:02:34.860> fours<00:02:41.810> this

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
notes in either threes or fours this

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
very last lick is based off of a c-sharp

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:54.320 
very last lick is based off of a c-sharp
minor<00:02:46.350> seven<00:02:52.520> resolves<00:02:53.520> back<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.970> c-sharp

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
minor seven resolves back to c-sharp
