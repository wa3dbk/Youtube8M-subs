and<00:02:02.170> you<00:02:02.409> think<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.710> situation<00:02:03.670> where<00:02:03.790> he

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
and you think the situation where he

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.730 
and you think the situation where he
could<00:02:04.030> possibly<00:02:04.659> be<00:02:05.080> even<00:02:05.290> better<00:02:05.409> this<00:02:05.680> year

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
could possibly be even better this year

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.550 
could possibly be even better this year
no<00:02:06.190> he's<00:02:06.780> continued<00:02:07.780> to<00:02:07.840> work<00:02:08.020> at<00:02:08.170> everything

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
no he's continued to work at everything

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.940 
no he's continued to work at everything

playing golf you know once you you
understand<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.170> mechanics<00:02:29.319> you<00:02:29.830> can<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:30.220> can

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
understand the mechanics you can you can

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.920 
understand the mechanics you can you can
kind<00:02:30.580> of<00:02:30.640> correct<00:02:30.910> yourself<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:31.540> things<00:02:31.720> are

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
kind of correct yourself and things are

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.809 
kind of correct yourself and things are
going<00:02:32.230> right<00:02:32.440> man<00:02:32.890> I<00:02:33.190> think<00:02:33.400> he's<00:02:33.520> worked<00:02:33.730> very

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
going right man I think he's worked very

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.360 
going right man I think he's worked very
hard<00:02:34.000> all<00:02:34.480> season<00:02:34.769> to<00:02:35.769> understand<00:02:36.280> the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
hard all season to understand the

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.330 
hard all season to understand the
mechanics<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:37.330> and<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.769> really<00:02:39.070> the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
mechanics and and and really the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.229 
mechanics and and and really the
complete<00:02:39.940> offense<00:02:40.330> so<00:02:41.160> yeah<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.190> don't<00:02:43.060> think

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
complete offense so yeah I don't think

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.680 
complete offense so yeah I don't think
there's<00:02:43.540> one<00:02:43.600> area<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:45.670> he<00:02:46.180> he's

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
there's one area that that he he's

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.970 
there's one area that that he he's
really<00:02:46.930> concentrating<00:02:47.110> on<00:02:47.620> I<00:02:47.650> think<00:02:47.860> he's

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
really concentrating on I think he's

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.650 
really concentrating on I think he's
worked<00:02:48.250> on<00:02:48.370> its<00:02:48.489> toll<00:02:48.640> gate<00:02:48.850> just<00:02:49.450> talked
