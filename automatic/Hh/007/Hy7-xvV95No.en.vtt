00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
kind of man so after the voyage when

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.729 
kind of man so after the voyage when
they<00:02:26.359> get<00:02:26.540> off<00:02:26.570> we're<00:02:27.019> going<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.320> have<00:02:27.500> to

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
they get off we're going to have to

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.729 
they get off we're going to have to
repopulate<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.579> entire<00:02:29.060> planet<00:02:29.600> you<00:02:30.470> want<00:02:30.680> to

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
repopulate the entire planet you want to

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.949 
repopulate the entire planet you want to
take<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.310> younger<00:02:31.730> ones<00:02:31.910> because<00:02:32.840> they're

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
take the younger ones because they're

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.229 
take the younger ones because they're
going<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.200> live<00:02:33.290> longer<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:33.950> it<00:02:34.820> just<00:02:35.090> so

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
going to live longer and it just so

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.240

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
happens that the younger ones are

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.000 
happens that the younger ones are
smaller<00:02:37.959> just<00:02:38.959> remember<00:02:39.290> to<00:02:39.320> take<00:02:39.530> a<00:02:39.560> pink<00:02:39.890> one
