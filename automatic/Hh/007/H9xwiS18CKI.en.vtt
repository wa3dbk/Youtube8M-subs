00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.560
 Girls today I'm with these ombrÃ© nails. 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:29.650
 it will integrate from choosing two strong colors 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:32.620
 to make this shading a fingernail 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:41.800
 simple but for teaching how do you use 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:45.790
 the kitchen sponge sponge a 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:55.690
 square your green side by using the 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:01:02.829
 yellowing same base 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:09.690
 sure the breath 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:09.690
 I used a black and a fluorescent pink 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:24.060
 I passed a little silver colored little 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.060
 right 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.619
 I already passed two layers of pink 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:51.060
 now I'll put a little bit of the breastplate 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:51.060
 only on the tip was a little bit to absorb 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.710
 and I only back down half way 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.619
 light beatings 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.150
 it will stay like this 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:55.209
 I'll wait to dry a little so I can 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.629
 is passing 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.870
 the glitter you want to try to get a 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:04.180
 a little more rest can be 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.159
 passing two layers of three layers 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:11.970
 enough 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:11.970
 if you do not just do a little detail 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:27.190
 is this really simple girls well easy to 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.410

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.750
