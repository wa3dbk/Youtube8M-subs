not a pretty well you know but it's a

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.189 
not a pretty well you know but it's a

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
cast and we didn't expect it to be

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.620 
cast and we didn't expect it to be
pretty<00:00:28.349> but<00:00:29.279> we<00:00:29.369> just<00:00:29.519> did<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.820> today<00:00:29.970> and

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
pretty but we just did that today and

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.650

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
then we we cut the head so that the head

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.020 
then we we cut the head so that the head
would<00:00:33.930> fit<00:00:34.170> but<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:35.219> got<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.489> used<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.880> have<00:00:36.000> a

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
would fit but it's got it used to have a

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.119 
would fit but it's got it used to have a
funny<00:00:36.690> little<00:00:36.899> shape<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.559> wing<00:00:37.800> angle

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
funny little shape to it that wing angle

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.420 
funny little shape to it that wing angle
area<00:00:38.610> but<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.840> put<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.379> bases<00:00:40.770> on<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:40.950> bases

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
area but the put the bases on the bases

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.500 
area but the put the bases on the bases
okay<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:43.550> might<00:00:44.550> just<00:00:44.579> finished<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.210> machine

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
okay and might just finished a machine
