I<00:02:35.720> think<00:02:35.750> if<00:02:36.020> tablet<00:02:36.440> scores<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.160> then<00:02:37.700> we<00:02:38.060> can

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
I think if tablet scores and then we can

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.920 
I think if tablet scores and then we can
either<00:02:38.690> save<00:02:39.230> one<00:02:39.650> more<00:02:39.950> or<00:02:40.630> score<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.780> one

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
either save one more or score the one

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.390 
either save one more or score the one
after<00:02:42.050> and<00:02:42.290> Said's<00:02:42.530> we<00:02:42.830> can<00:02:42.980> actually<00:02:43.100> go<00:02:43.370> on

let you know matches that come up quite

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.830 
let you know matches that come up quite
quick<00:04:01.640> on<00:04:01.790> you<00:04:01.910> especially<00:04:02.090> if<00:04:02.450> you<00:04:02.540> have<00:04:02.570> cut

quick on you especially if you have cut
matches<00:04:03.140> in<00:04:03.230> between<00:04:03.500> it's<00:04:03.980> very<00:04:04.280> very<00:04:04.489> hard

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
matches in between it's very very hard

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.320 
matches in between it's very very hard
to<00:04:04.850> keep<00:04:05.000> players<00:04:05.440> energized<00:04:06.440> and<00:04:06.830> of<00:04:06.950> course

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
to keep players energized and of course

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
to keep players energized and of course
when<00:04:08.330> you<00:04:08.420> don't<00:04:08.600> have<00:04:08.660> much<00:04:08.840> debt<00:04:09.110> from<00:04:09.230> the

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
when you don't have much debt from the

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.350 
when you don't have much debt from the
squad<00:04:09.560> that<00:04:10.130> can<00:04:10.280> be<00:04:10.310> very<00:04:10.430> very<00:04:10.760> frustrating

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
squad that can be very very frustrating

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.449 
squad that can be very very frustrating
but<00:04:11.570> our<00:04:12.110> next<00:04:12.410> match<00:04:12.590> was<00:04:12.769> against<00:04:12.980> Chelsea

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
but our next match was against Chelsea

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.430 
but our next match was against Chelsea
and<00:04:13.670> we<00:04:13.850> managed<00:04:14.120> to<00:04:14.269> open<00:04:14.420> the<00:04:14.780> scoring<00:04:15.019> very

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
and we managed to open the scoring very

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.250 
and we managed to open the scoring very
early<00:04:15.920> on<00:04:15.950> and<00:04:16.280> I<00:04:16.370> believe<00:04:16.910> this<00:04:17.660> was<00:04:17.930> Steven

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
early on and I believe this was Steven

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.340 
early on and I believe this was Steven
Davies<00:04:18.620> and<00:04:18.890> this<00:04:19.370> guy<00:04:19.669> is<00:04:20.169> absolutely<00:04:21.169> bloody

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.650 
class this the one of the first times
I've<00:04:23.330> actually<00:04:23.450> used<00:04:23.630> him

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
I've actually used him

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.420 
I've actually used him
on<00:04:24.870> this<00:04:25.050> career<00:04:25.380> mode<00:04:25.560> so<00:04:25.770> far<00:04:26.040> and<00:04:26.310> I'm

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
on this career mode so far and I'm

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.830 
on this career mode so far and I'm
really<00:04:26.730> really<00:04:26.850> annoyed<00:04:27.180> at<00:04:27.300> myself<00:04:27.360> but<00:04:27.780> I

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
really really annoyed at myself but I

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.720 
really really annoyed at myself but I
haven't<00:04:28.050> actually<00:04:28.110> used<00:04:28.320> him<00:04:28.650> before<00:04:28.730> this

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
haven't actually used him before this

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.060 
haven't actually used him before this
period<00:04:30.000> because<00:04:30.540> he<00:04:30.780> is<00:04:30.900> such<00:04:31.260> a<00:04:31.470> great<00:04:31.710> player

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
period because he is such a great player

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.040 
period because he is such a great player
he<00:04:32.370> almost<00:04:33.030> feels<00:04:33.300> like<00:04:33.390> he<00:04:33.690> has<00:04:33.780> a<00:04:33.840> bit<00:04:34.020> of

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
he almost feels like he has a bit of

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.540 
he almost feels like he has a bit of
flair<00:04:34.380> to<00:04:34.560> him<00:04:34.650> even<00:04:35.010> though<00:04:35.100> it<00:04:35.130> doesn't<00:04:35.280> have

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
flair to him even though it doesn't have

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.850 
flair to him even though it doesn't have
skill<00:04:35.880> moves<00:04:36.090> I<00:04:36.360> don't<00:04:36.840> know<00:04:36.960> why<00:04:37.140> he<00:04:37.440> just<00:04:37.680> it

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
skill moves I don't know why he just it

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.850 
skill moves I don't know why he just it
just<00:04:38.040> feels<00:04:38.280> great<00:04:38.580> to<00:04:38.730> use<00:04:38.850> in<00:04:38.880> the<00:04:39.090> bull<00:04:39.300> and

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
just feels great to use in the bull and

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.960 
just feels great to use in the bull and
he's<00:04:40.860> a<00:04:40.890> player<00:04:41.160> which<00:04:41.340> I<00:04:41.490> hope<00:04:41.700> will<00:04:41.730> be

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
he's a player which I hope will be

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.690 
he's a player which I hope will be
progressing<00:04:42.570> for<00:04:43.170> us<00:04:43.260> in<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.830> coming<00:04:44.370> games

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
and season so they did get an equalizer

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.520 
and season so they did get an equalizer
and<00:04:47.910> then<00:04:48.150> bang<00:04:48.540> of<00:04:48.840> course<00:04:49.140> they're<00:04:49.320> going<00:04:49.470> to

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
and then bang of course they're going to

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.440 
and then bang of course they're going to
score<00:04:49.710> another<00:04:49.770> one<00:04:50.010> I'm<00:04:50.310> very<00:04:50.640> very<00:04:50.880> bad<00:04:51.060> at

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
score another one I'm very very bad at

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.860

you<00:04:52.170> know<00:04:52.290> conceding<00:04:53.070> late<00:04:53.730> late<00:04:54.210> goals<00:04:54.540> which

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
cost me dearly and I think when this

cost me dearly and I think when this
happens<00:04:58.800> it's<00:04:59.010> just<00:04:59.280> teens<00:04:59.580> outclassing<00:05:00.390> me

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
happens it's just teens outclassing me

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.900 
happens it's just teens outclassing me
and<00:05:00.780> it's<00:05:01.260> me<00:05:01.530> just<00:05:02.100> needing<00:05:02.430> to<00:05:02.610> kind<00:05:02.850> of

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
see the game through that's what I think

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.340 
see the game through that's what I think
I<00:05:16.410> lack<00:05:16.680> massively<00:05:17.370> and<00:05:17.810> but<00:05:18.810> yeah<00:05:18.960> that<00:05:19.170> was<00:05:19.290> a

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
I lack massively and but yeah that was a

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.990 
I lack massively and but yeah that was a
very<00:05:19.500> disappointing<00:05:20.040> result<00:05:20.370> and<00:05:20.580> then

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
very disappointing result and then

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.240 
very disappointing result and then
Fulham<00:05:21.450> was<00:05:21.810> our<00:05:21.960> next<00:05:22.320> match<00:05:22.500> in<00:05:22.800> at<00:05:23.130> the

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
Fulham was our next match in at the

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.070 
Fulham was our next match in at the
boxes<00:05:23.640> Premier<00:05:23.910> League<00:05:24.060> as<00:05:24.210> well<00:05:24.420> and<00:05:24.720> I<00:05:25.050> think

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
boxes Premier League as well and I think

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.830 
boxes Premier League as well and I think
we're<00:05:25.440> sitting<00:05:25.770> on<00:05:25.860> about<00:05:25.950> 16<00:05:26.640> you<00:05:27.180> know<00:05:27.300> 15<00:05:27.510> 16

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
spot and the league which is not ideal I

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.460 
spot and the league which is not ideal I
would<00:05:30.360> love<00:05:30.600> to<00:05:30.660> be<00:05:30.930> in<00:05:31.110> a<00:05:31.200> better<00:05:31.320> position

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
would love to be in a better position

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.880
