00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:07.590
 Latin American leader in plays 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.590
 sports presents moneymaker 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.350
 with that race that jump at the end 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.040
 they lost all the credibility that 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.840
 could have had on the link not 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.490
 they did five minutes at 40 yards 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.890
 imagine what they have to do first 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.750
 to hear them by the way I'm from 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.170
 game with black and it will be a match 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.040
 very interesting since this Sunday is 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.770
 obviously the team of the broncos of 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.720
 Favorite denver -2 but if you guys 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.730
 they want to play this weekend that is 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.450
 the weekend where more plays 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.240
 sports there are in all the 365 days of 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.820
 year then of course it's the superbowl and 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.830
 what do you think if we are going to see how 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.980
 we can open an account in bed crisis 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.230
 on betclic.com because this is too much 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.300
 simple they fill their data they get into 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.420
 betclic.com fill your data obviously 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.210
 they give you what kind of momio can they handle 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.460
 which is the most common the country you create a 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.860
 account and that's how simple they give you a 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.350
 User number and password 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.329
 course and we are talking about that in 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.659
 less than 10 minutes you already have your account 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:21.390
 on betclic.com and you can do all kinds 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.460
 of plays we are obviously Alberto 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.799
 Viktor we invite you of course to see 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.200
 as expected this Sunday will be done in 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.289
 against denver denver team 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.729
 is favorite by two points this wants 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.250
 say that you have to win by three 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.770
 points or more here is the line the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.319
 ups and downs that marked both jean 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.299
 duverger as Emilio Leon is in 47 and 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.340
 means this means that they are the 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.950
 amount of total points that is expected 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.319
 do between the two teams I like 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.409
 that emilio and that jean I suppose as the 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:54.420
 cold makes a party have many 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.549
 errors that do not notice so many points 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.860
 so I agree with Jean and with 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.349
 emilio in that there will be less than 47 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.810
 points that's a very good play and there's 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:05.549
 other options for example if you believe 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.899
 that sell will win the game without 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.590
 need that will win for more than two 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.590
 points 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.049
 well you can play at least 130 is the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.390
 line and we invite you to see the 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.519
 different propositions because they see 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.680
 something is a proposition the proposition 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.810
 is all that can happen in the 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.940
 party and that you can play it nothing else 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.930
 forget about the result of the game 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.909
 example if I close 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.489
 in summer is the first game and wins 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:32.819
 can see if there is going to be conversion of 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.439
 two points if there will be save has the game 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.840
 that it is very difficult not what he calls the 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:39.060
 self annotation worth two points all 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.409
 these are very interesting there are more than 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.849
 100 150 options on betclic.com no longer 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.319
 is among the first points as it 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.060
 they will notice the first points and for 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.859
 land by air 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.599
 let's imagine that Alberto is leading 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.310
 this super bowl and suddenly I want 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.980
 bet that they continue to broncos was going to 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.780
 remove the shirt could if it existed 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.310
 that possibility we can then 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.530
 talk to our friends Beatriz and 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:10.709
 we can say that Alberto star among 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:13.049
 pneumonia tell them and see the classic 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.480
 celebration when a coach is winning his 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.359
 team and suddenly they danced it good 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.329
 with the early morning we can say 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.909
 if it's going to be red blue yellow 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.639
 the liquid with which they will bathe 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.560
 winning coach not that is a very 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.720
 attractive although she is a bit crazy 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:36.510
 obviously because nobody knows anything 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:38.610
 main guests among anything to the 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.750
