00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.440 
the characters look like the Asian
actors<00:04:11.400> instead<00:04:11.730> about<00:04:11.820> in<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.090> manga

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
actors instead about in the manga

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.210 
actors instead about in the manga
because<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:12.780> manga<00:04:13.140> has<00:04:13.260> a<00:04:13.320> certain<00:04:13.950> look<00:04:14.100> and

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
because the manga has a certain look and

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.620 
because the manga has a certain look and
it<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.580> characters<00:04:15.060> don't<00:04:15.239> really<00:04:15.450> look

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
it the characters don't really look

it the characters don't really look
Asian<00:04:15.959> in<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.440> manga<00:04:16.799> but<00:04:16.830> they<00:04:17.070> use<00:04:17.220> Asian

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
Asian in the manga but they use Asian

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.729 
Asian in the manga but they use Asian
actors<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.570> portray<00:04:18.720> these<00:04:19.049> roles<00:04:19.350> and<00:04:19.650> in

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
decades and decades is not something

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.300 
decades and decades is not something
that<00:04:26.960> they're<00:04:27.169> intentionally<00:04:27.650> saying<00:04:28.220> you

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
that they're intentionally saying you

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.649 
that they're intentionally saying you

00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:29.659 
know gotta make this character look a

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:31.570 
know gotta make this character look a
certain<00:04:29.870> race<00:04:30.169> that's<00:04:30.590> just<00:04:30.949> the<00:04:31.069> way<00:04:31.159> anime

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
certain race that's just the way anime

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.159 
certain race that's just the way anime
has<00:04:31.759> been<00:04:31.970> for<00:04:32.180> many<00:04:32.270> years<00:04:32.419> and<00:04:32.810> it<00:04:33.080> will

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
has been for many years and it will

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.659 
has been for many years and it will
probably<00:04:33.440> continue<00:04:33.680> to<00:04:33.889> be<00:04:33.979> that<00:04:34.159> way<00:04:34.310> ready

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
probably continue to be that way ready

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.749 
probably continue to be that way ready
from<00:04:35.000> Black<00:04:35.210> Lagoon<00:04:35.419> is<00:04:35.960> supposed<00:04:36.289> to<00:04:36.349> be

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 
from Black Lagoon is supposed to be

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.439 
from Black Lagoon is supposed to be
chinese-american<00:04:37.759> but<00:04:37.970> you<00:04:38.090> wouldn't<00:04:38.360> even

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
chinese-american but you wouldn't even

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.300 
chinese-american but you wouldn't even
think<00:04:38.720> she<00:04:38.900> had<00:04:39.020> a<00:04:39.050> bit<00:04:39.319> of<00:04:39.349> Asian<00:04:39.620> in<00:04:39.949> her<00:04:40.099> and

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
think she had a bit of Asian in her and

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.770 
think she had a bit of Asian in her and
again<00:04:40.550> that's<00:04:40.759> just<00:04:40.849> anime<00:04:41.330> and<00:04:41.539> how<00:04:41.659> it

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
again that's just anime and how it

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.510 
again that's just anime and how it
probably<00:04:42.379> will<00:04:42.560> always<00:04:42.590> be<00:04:43.069> and<00:04:43.190> how<00:04:43.310> it's

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
probably will always be and how it's

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.369 
probably will always be and how it's
been<00:04:43.729> for<00:04:43.940> the<00:04:44.270> longest<00:04:44.569> time<00:04:44.690> certain

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:45.379 
been for the longest time certain

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:47.170 
been for the longest time certain
characters<00:04:45.770> sometimes<00:04:45.949> do<00:04:46.340> portray<00:04:46.699> agents

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
characters sometimes do portray agents

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.850 
characters sometimes do portray agents
such<00:04:47.300> as<00:04:47.330> a<00:04:47.509> lot<00:04:47.720> of<00:04:47.810> the<00:04:47.900> elderly<00:04:48.259> they<00:04:48.680> have

such as a lot of the elderly they have
looking<00:04:49.280> Asian<00:04:49.669> but<00:04:49.879> that's<00:04:50.210> just<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.509> way

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:50.599 
looking Asian but that's just the way

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
let's take a moment to think an entire

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.149 
let's take a moment to think an entire
country<00:05:02.300> that<00:05:02.479> one<00:05:02.810> of<00:05:02.900> the<00:05:02.990> biggest<00:05:03.259> prize<00:05:03.770> is

their anime and manga are going to take
it<00:05:06.259> upon<00:05:06.500> themselves<00:05:06.530> to<00:05:06.979> be<00:05:07.370> races<00:05:07.759> against

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
it upon themselves to be races against

it upon themselves to be races against
themselves<00:05:08.180> there<00:05:08.750> you<00:05:08.930> go<00:05:09.080> so<00:05:09.409> what<00:05:09.500> I'm

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
themselves there you go so what I'm

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.659

basically<00:05:09.770> trying<00:05:10.009> to<00:05:10.129> say<00:05:10.280> throughout<00:05:10.550> this

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
basically trying to say throughout this

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:12.369 
basically trying to say throughout this
video<00:05:10.819> is<00:05:11.150> there<00:05:11.300> are<00:05:11.479> instances<00:05:11.810> where<00:05:12.139> I<00:05:12.169> see

video is there are instances where I see

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:13.930 
video is there are instances where I see
stereotypes<00:05:12.979> and<00:05:13.159> I<00:05:13.340> do<00:05:13.400> think<00:05:13.729> to<00:05:13.819> a<00:05:13.879> certain

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
stereotypes and I do think to a certain

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.760 
stereotypes and I do think to a certain
extent<00:05:14.240> they<00:05:14.780> follow<00:05:15.020> a<00:05:15.110> certain<00:05:15.440> formula

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
extent they follow a certain formula

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.559 
extent they follow a certain formula
that's<00:05:16.099> been<00:05:16.159> going<00:05:16.460> on<00:05:16.550> for<00:05:16.759> many<00:05:16.849> years<00:05:17.000> that

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:17.569 
that's been going on for many years that

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:18.939 
that's been going on for many years that
kind<00:05:17.750> of<00:05:17.810> purposely<00:05:18.319> makes<00:05:18.590> its<00:05:18.770> own

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
kind of purposely makes its own

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:20.409 
kind of purposely makes its own
different<00:05:19.400> style<00:05:19.639> that<00:05:19.819> doesn't<00:05:20.330> necessarily

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
different style that doesn't necessarily

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.119 
different style that doesn't necessarily
look<00:05:21.020> Asian<00:05:21.560> but<00:05:21.680> I<00:05:21.740> don't<00:05:21.919> think<00:05:21.979> they're

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:22.129 
look Asian but I don't think they're

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:23.469 
look Asian but I don't think they're
trying<00:05:22.219> to<00:05:22.340> portray<00:05:22.490> a<00:05:22.669> certain<00:05:23.000> race<00:05:23.180> either

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
trying to portray a certain race either

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.240 
trying to portray a certain race either
I<00:05:23.629> think<00:05:23.690> anime<00:05:24.229> is<00:05:24.349> just<00:05:24.560> animated<00:05:25.069> it<00:05:25.130> has

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
I think anime is just animated it has

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.129 
I think anime is just animated it has
that<00:05:25.460> beautiful<00:05:25.699> look<00:05:26.180> sometimes<00:05:26.840> it<00:05:26.990> looks

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 
that beautiful look sometimes it looks

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:29.830 
that beautiful look sometimes it looks
crazy<00:05:27.409> sometimes<00:05:27.860> with<00:05:28.190> cutesy<00:05:28.759> wacky<00:05:29.300> but

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
crazy sometimes with cutesy wacky but

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.839 
crazy sometimes with cutesy wacky but
it's<00:05:29.960> anime<00:05:30.319> do<00:05:30.529> you<00:05:30.650> think<00:05:30.860> anime<00:05:31.250> as<00:05:31.460> a<00:05:31.490> whole
