00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.679
 Audi is the first manufacturer to test in 2009 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.289
 the piloted drive in the desert far 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.140
 away from civilization 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.920
 audi tts about the salt lakes near Bonn 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.779
 and set here at about 210 km h 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:30.689
 World record for self-driving vehicles 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:33.480
 on the tts 2010 mastered the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.170
 legendary pikes peak hill climb without 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.660
 driver 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.040
 the audi completed the 20 kilometers 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.700
 long climb with 156 curves in around 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.850
 27 minutes 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.489
 the topspeed was over 70 km h 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:56.460
 gps could audi his 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:58.230
 Determine position to 2 cm in 2013 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.410
 got audi as the first vehicle manufacturer 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.019
 from the nevada department for motor vehicles 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.680
 Permission is for moving vehicles 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.200
 test 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.360
 audi presented his vision of the 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.049
 Piloted driving in traffic jams and at 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.170
 park 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.270
 thanks to the pilot driving of audi can 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.430
 you in future in front of the garage or one 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.409
 tight parking space the car comfortable from 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.580
 outside with the remote key or 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.580
 operating the smartphone 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.490
 Now is the time for the 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.040
 series production 2013 was audi 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.960
 still in the pre-production stage and the 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.710
 computer technology filled the whole 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.840
 trunk 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.520
 Now the technology is as small as one 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.890
 laptop and listens to the name z 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.440
 Achieve functions of unit in total 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.300
 the processors on the z fahrsport one 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.310
 computing power of the complete 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.920
 electronics architecture of a modern day 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.380
 audi a4 corresponds to this centrally 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.050
 processes all data and controls 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.780
 all functions that makes the piloted 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.910
 drive only possible up to twelve 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.550
 Ultrasonic sensors monitor the near 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.770
 environment of the vehicle the front radar 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.290
 Detects objects in front of the car up to 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.600
 a distance of 250 meters 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.250
 monitor the rear radar sensors 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.980
 the following traffic 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.959
 the to view cameras also monitor 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.060
 the near range and work for example 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.980
 when parking with the automatic 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.980
 Ultrasonic sensors together 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.140
 the laser as well as tolerated accurate data up 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.209
 to a distance of 80 meters 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.549
 the front camera with a wide 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.390
 opening angle detects 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.970
 pavement markings as well 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.180
 pedestrian vehicles and guardrails 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.620
 that will be all this data together and 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.880
 allows piloted driving 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.880
 The future begins now 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.900
 Audi will continue its lead 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.500
 expand and use already 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.500
 production-ready technology
