00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
too I guess Ryan is kind of like the

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.390 
too I guess Ryan is kind of like the
first<00:03:15.480> one<00:03:15.720> who<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.470> started<00:03:16.859> actually<00:03:17.040> seeing

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
first one who I started actually seeing

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.129 
first one who I started actually seeing

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
bringing it to band and everything but I

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.170 
bringing it to band and everything but I
had<00:03:19.260> seen<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.620> before<00:03:19.829> like<00:03:20.069> fifa<00:03:20.340> and

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
had seen it before like fifa and

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.059 
had seen it before like fifa and
everything<00:03:21.510> like<00:03:21.629> that<00:03:21.690> but<00:03:21.959> you<00:03:22.739> know<00:03:22.769> looks

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
challenge but I did a little bit too

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.899 
challenge but I did a little bit too
late<00:03:55.650> they<00:03:55.799> had<00:03:55.889> already<00:03:56.010> patched<00:03:56.310> it<00:03:56.609> by<00:03:56.699> them

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
late they had already patched it by them

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.399 
late they had already patched it by them
but<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.120> went<00:03:57.239> ahead<00:03:57.359> and<00:03:57.479> did<00:03:57.629> the<00:03:57.780> solo<00:03:58.049> so<00:03:58.379> I

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
but I went ahead and did the solo so I

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.439 
but I went ahead and did the solo so I
would<00:03:58.620> say<00:03:58.739> go<00:03:58.859> ahead<00:03:59.010> and<00:03:59.099> do<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.370> solo<00:03:59.790> that

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
would say go ahead and do the solo that

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.509 
would say go ahead and do the solo that
way<00:04:00.629> if<00:04:00.780> EA<00:04:01.019> does<00:04:01.349> try<00:04:01.530> to<00:04:01.590> decide<00:04:02.400> to

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
way if EA does try to decide to

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:03.979 
way if EA does try to decide to
compensate<00:04:02.970> everybody<00:04:03.329> with<00:04:03.569> like<00:04:03.690> a<00:04:03.720> boss

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
card or something I don't know what

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.649 
card or something I don't know what
they'll<00:04:05.250> do<00:04:05.400> but<00:04:05.639> they<00:04:05.790> they<00:04:06.269> messed<00:04:06.510> up

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
they'll do but they they messed up

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.270 
they'll do but they they messed up
pretty<00:04:06.780> bad<00:04:06.930> so<00:04:07.440> hopefully<00:04:08.099> they'll

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
pretty bad so hopefully they'll

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.589 
pretty bad so hopefully they'll
compensate<00:04:08.639> us<00:04:08.849> with<00:04:09.060> something<00:04:09.299> they're

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
compensate us with something they're

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.000 
compensate us with something they're
probably<00:04:09.750> just<00:04:09.900> end<00:04:10.109> up<00:04:10.199> being<00:04:10.409> like<00:04:10.500> 10<00:04:10.739> Pro

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010
