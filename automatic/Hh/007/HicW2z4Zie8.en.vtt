00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
and under high stress so there's a major

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.630 
and under high stress so there's a major
element<00:02:34.320> there<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.070> that<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.340> only

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
element there and that the only

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.130 
element there and that the only
difference<00:02:36.030> really<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.660> handling<00:02:37.020> of

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
difference really is the handling of

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.470 
difference really is the handling of

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
that makes that big difference it

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.400 
that makes that big difference it

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
doesn't have to be that high and if you
