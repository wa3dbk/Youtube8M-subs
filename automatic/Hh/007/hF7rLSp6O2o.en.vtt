00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:08.929
 Hello again, I will be today 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:13.259
 review another quiz 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:20.039
 Viktorinoks already soldier 111 millimeters 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:26.779
 model red backpack standard 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:31.969
 box knife standard paper 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:33.090
 the only difference from 91 is 1 millimeter 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.930
 knives 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:41.329
 officer's what's here still shown 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.329
 how to fold this knife everything else 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:55.430
 you have nothing new here added here 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:00.270
 Well, about this model there are many reviews 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.710
 actually review it here and not 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.559
 there is something special 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.330
 classic model is very comfortable 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.430
 reliable model in my opinion means 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.770
 I just wanted to tell you why I 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.520
 chose exactly the backpack why is my 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.710
 the choice 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.900
 Well, then let's go 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:25.409
 let's see the blade is still standards 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.610
 like old soldiers here 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:33.840
 the beer is full-sized that is more 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.110
 than 90 one millimeter on the officers 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.310
 the knives are actually why I took to 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.310
 go to the forest there for mushrooms 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:49.430
 in nature and here and 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:53.720
 2 standard bottle openers 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.720
 nothing special either 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:12.390
 respectively tweezers toothpick corkscrew 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:13.470
 and sewed a hole that's why I took 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.070
 backpack 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:21.660
 rather than say there is some outrider 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:25.590
 atlas or even rolled oats respectively 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.200
 width guys width let's say the same 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.160
 outrider and she of course allows him 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.670
 comfortable to hold in your hand on but still 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:40.080
 he is fat he doesn't say 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.569
 plump and when I considered 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:47.190
 let's say the same outrider is flat 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:50.790
 I apologize not outrider atlas there yet 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:56.090
 pliers added pliers on 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:58.140
 atlas and on the officers pressing the same 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.480
 exactly the same 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.630
 that is, if the officer already 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.650
 pliers 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.620
 occupy the entire length of the knife that is 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.430
 completely how to use everything 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.510
 space 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.430
 Yes, and how are you still ok? 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.760
 use them and looks 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:25.019
 then on the same atlas 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.760
 or hercules scissors and pliers 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.920
 exactly the same as 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:36.000
 officer knives so I figured that 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:39.120
 why should I pile up a knife for functions 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.640
 there let's say cut mushrooms yes that is here 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.290
 hands he easily lies comfortable why do I need a knife 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:52.140
 wide for mushrooms 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:55.620
 when there are craters in this case I have 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:01.409
 that's why I did not choose well 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:03.989
 of course I wanted to crawl or outrider 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:06.000
 still one thing or pliers 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:11.129
 either scissors 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.329
 but in the end I came to the conclusion that 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:19.799
 better here are two knives here in this form 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:23.910
 than the symbiosis of 1 111 111 and millimeter 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:28.190
 Escher than knife after all yes this is for 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.240
 me this is my opinion for me here is a backpack 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.080
 turned out to be the most bought 2 weeks 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.419
 backwards 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:42.330
 both knives are in place yes and no 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:48.330
 I feel that somehow there somehow somewhere 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:52.699
 something is missing that is all one knife 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:56.910
 2 complements the only thing here 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:59.360
 saw it lasts less than the same 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.840
 crafts me one 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.479
 officer knives so I chose the model 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.240
 with a blade and with leads because 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:12.620
 all the same to her in the field all the same 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:16.389
 this tool this saw will be me 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:19.569
 I think it is much more convenient to use than 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:25.000
 than rotten 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:25.000
 in short let me maybe the difference 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:32.090
 well, the difference is about one and a half 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.009
 centimeter so on the eye if I look 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:41.629
 I see that the difference is about one and a half 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:44.629
 centimeters are you thickness accordingly 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:50.750
 if the officerâ€™s knife can still be understood 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:55.310
 its thickness well i'm quite comfortable with it 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:06:01.039
 keep that soldier's knife all the same to me 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:09.169
 it seems it should be thinner that is 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:15.909
 Here is the best for me model 4 for on 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:15.909
 Thank you all for your attention.
