weight<00:00:34.649> as<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:34.950> get<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.520> bigger<00:00:35.700> sizes<00:00:36.000> of

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
weight as you get to the bigger sizes of

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.900 
weight as you get to the bigger sizes of
course<00:00:36.450> they<00:00:36.660> do<00:00:36.719> get<00:00:37.020> heavier<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:37.980> these

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
course they do get heavier but these

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.850 
course they do get heavier but these
first<00:00:39.450> three<00:00:39.719> sizes<00:00:40.110> are<00:00:40.200> definitely<00:00:40.379> easy

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
first three sizes are definitely easy

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.000 
first three sizes are definitely easy
for<00:00:41.520> anybody<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.629> carry<00:00:42.870> around<00:00:43.020> after<00:00:43.860> that

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
for anybody to carry around after that

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.729 
for anybody to carry around after that
it<00:00:44.489> might<00:00:44.760> take<00:00:44.789> up<00:00:45.270> more<00:00:45.840> than<00:00:46.020> one<00:00:46.289> person<00:00:46.710> to
