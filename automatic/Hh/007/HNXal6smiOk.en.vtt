00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
feedback when Michelle gets warm which

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.500 
feedback when Michelle gets warm which
she<00:03:36.739> feels<00:03:36.950> more<00:03:37.069> relaxed<00:03:37.700> once<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.269> blood<00:03:38.450> is

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.550 
we're just learning straight punches now
to<00:03:52.130> put<00:03:52.370> it<00:03:52.400> in<00:03:52.519> a<00:03:52.579> context<00:03:53.180> I<00:03:53.930> have<00:03:54.169> to<00:03:54.290> relearn

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
to put it in a context I have to relearn

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.080 
to put it in a context I have to relearn
a<00:03:54.620> combative<00:03:55.099> or<00:03:55.190> a<00:03:55.250> technique<00:03:55.579> we<00:03:55.760> like<00:03:55.910> to<00:03:56.000> do

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
a combative or a technique we like to do

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.789 
a combative or a technique we like to do
a<00:03:56.120> drill<00:03:56.510> whether<00:03:56.840> it's<00:03:57.019> an<00:03:57.079> aggression<00:03:57.380> drill

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
a drill whether it's an aggression drill

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.610 
a drill whether it's an aggression drill
or<00:03:57.889> reaction<00:03:58.400> drill<00:03:59.169> so<00:04:00.169> the<00:04:00.319> drill<00:04:00.500> that

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
or reaction drill so the drill that

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.930 
or reaction drill so the drill that
we're<00:04:00.739> doing<00:04:00.859> right<00:04:00.950> now<00:04:01.010> actually<00:04:01.340> and<00:04:01.790> let's

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
we're doing right now actually and let's

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.909 
we're doing right now actually and let's
have<00:04:02.030> you<00:04:02.120> go<00:04:02.239> slow<00:04:02.540> this<00:04:03.500> is<00:04:03.560> gonna<00:04:03.680> be<00:04:03.829> in

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
have you go slow this is gonna be in

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.289 
have you go slow this is gonna be in
slow<00:04:04.130> time<00:04:04.370> so<00:04:04.519> I<00:04:04.579> can<00:04:04.700> explain<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.030> drill<00:04:05.180> so

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
slow time so I can explain the drill so

this is a great drill and then involves
groups<00:05:42.420> of<00:05:42.660> three<00:05:42.960> so<00:05:43.140> basically<00:05:43.890> the<00:05:44.070> way

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
groups of three so basically the way

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.490 
groups of three so basically the way
it's<00:05:44.340> set<00:05:44.550> up<00:05:44.580> is<00:05:44.930> Jason<00:05:45.930> our<00:05:46.020> fighting<00:05:46.230> stance

all<00:06:01.020> I<00:06:01.170> do<00:06:01.320> is<00:06:01.410> represent<00:06:01.590> a<00:06:01.890> distraction<00:06:02.520> I'm

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
all I do is represent a distraction I'm

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.700 
all I do is represent a distraction I'm
not<00:06:03.150> an<00:06:03.270> attacker<00:06:03.630> so<00:06:04.140> all<00:06:04.200> I'm<00:06:04.380> doing<00:06:04.410> is

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
not an attacker so all I'm doing is

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.080 
not an attacker so all I'm doing is
doing<00:06:04.950> a<00:06:05.010> level<00:06:05.160> change<00:06:05.310> so<00:06:05.820> I<00:06:05.850> don't<00:06:06.030> get
