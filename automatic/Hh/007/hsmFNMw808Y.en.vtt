00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
and allow them to photograph it they

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.410 
and allow them to photograph it they
took<00:00:41.070> photographs<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.000> put<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.239> into

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
took photographs of it put it into

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.750 
took photographs of it put it into
computers<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.829> computer<00:00:44.280> saw<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.579> as<00:00:44.730> a

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
computers and the computer saw it as a

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.580 
computers and the computer saw it as a
living<00:00:45.149> cell<00:00:45.420> that's<00:00:45.780> what<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.020> recognized<00:00:46.469> it

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
living cell that's what it recognized it

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.670 
living cell that's what it recognized it
as<00:00:46.739> didn't<00:00:47.460> see<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.730> as<00:00:47.850> something<00:00:48.239> alien<00:00:49.050> or<00:00:49.649> a

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
as didn't see it as something alien or a

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.590 
as didn't see it as something alien or a
ship<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.280> saw<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.520> as<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> living<00:00:50.910> thing

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
ship it saw it as a living thing

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.430 
ship it saw it as a living thing
couldn't<00:00:51.989> tell<00:00:52.110> sighs<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:55.170> ships

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
couldn't tell sighs and the the ships

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.229 
couldn't tell sighs and the the ships
would<00:00:55.620> when<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.190> beams<00:00:56.430> would<00:00:56.699> get<00:00:56.820> off<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
would when the beams would get off the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.670 
would when the beams would get off the
ships<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.719> ships<00:00:57.960> would<00:00:58.140> actually<00:00:58.469> decrease

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
ships the ships would actually decrease

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.799 
ships the ships would actually decrease
in<00:00:59.100> size<00:00:59.309> when<00:01:00.059> they<00:01:00.210> would<00:01:00.329> get<00:01:00.390> on<00:01:00.449> him<00:01:00.690> they

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
in size when they would get on him they

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.660 
in size when they would get on him they
would<00:01:00.960> increase<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.469> size<00:01:01.680> they<00:01:02.340> would<00:01:02.489> go<00:01:02.609> up

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
would increase in size they would go up

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.640 
would increase in size they would go up
in<00:01:02.820> space<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.809> watched<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.350> then<00:01:04.589> they

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
in space and I watched this then they

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.840 
in space and I watched this then they
would<00:01:04.769> split<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.129> half<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.549> go<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.729> two

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
would split in half and go in two

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.609 
would split in half and go in two
different<00:01:06.000> directions<00:01:06.200> then<00:01:07.200> they'd<00:01:07.409> split

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
different directions then they'd split

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.800 
different directions then they'd split
in<00:01:07.799> half<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.040> go<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.310> another<00:01:08.460> direction

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
in half and go in another direction

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.910 
in half and go in another direction
these<00:01:09.810> things<00:01:10.140> were<00:01:10.290> not<00:01:10.439> even<00:01:10.650> coming<00:01:10.890> from

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
these things were not even coming from

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.880 
these things were not even coming from
space<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.330> what<00:01:12.479> uh<00:01:12.630> six<00:01:13.260> witnesses<00:01:13.500> that

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
space this is what uh six witnesses that

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
actually on the rim watching them before

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.069 
actually on the rim watching them before
it<00:01:28.979> was<00:01:29.100> active<00:01:29.520> coming<00:01:30.390> right<00:01:30.570> out<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.810> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
it was active coming right out of the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.660 
it was active coming right out of the
earth<00:01:31.140> they<00:01:31.619> were<00:01:31.740> coming<00:01:32.009> from<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.280> Inner

earth they were coming from the Inner
Earth<00:01:32.880> spaces<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.950> and<00:01:35.210> they<00:01:36.210> landed<00:01:36.689> all

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
Earth spaces and and they landed all

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.660 
Earth spaces and and they landed all
over<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.350> little<00:01:37.530> town<00:01:37.890> right<00:01:38.189> near<00:01:38.430> there<00:01:38.640> I

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
over this little town right near there I

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.700 
over this little town right near there I
don't<00:01:38.880> know<00:01:39.090> remember<00:01:39.990> what<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.229> was<00:01:40.259> that's
