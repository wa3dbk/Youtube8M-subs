this is not an awkward potion it has no
effect<00:01:07.500> but<00:01:07.860> 20<00:01:08.520> but<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.939> 1<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.780> red<00:01:09.990> mushroom<00:01:11.119> in

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
effect but 20 but a 1 a red mushroom in

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.950 
effect but 20 but a 1 a red mushroom in
the<00:01:12.270> brew<00:01:12.420> extent<00:01:13.040> you<00:01:14.040> will<00:01:14.400> get<00:01:14.820> not<00:01:15.780> sure

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
the brew extent you will get not sure

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.170 
the brew extent you will get not sure
action<00:01:16.200> actually<00:01:16.680> but<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.040> think<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.759> potion

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
action actually but I think the potion

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.999 
action actually but I think the potion
of<00:01:18.240> downsizing<00:01:18.869> I'm<00:01:19.229> not<00:01:19.409> sure<00:01:19.590> but<00:01:19.710> we<00:01:19.890> will

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
of downsizing I'm not sure but we will

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.440 
of downsizing I'm not sure but we will
see<00:01:20.250> once<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.299> gets<00:01:21.479> protists<00:01:22.170> all<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.770> way<00:01:22.920> so

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
see once it gets protists all the way so

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.570 
see once it gets protists all the way so
it's<00:01:24.450> waiting<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.780> few<00:01:24.810> seconds<00:01:25.409> more<00:01:25.770> it

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
it's waiting a few seconds more it

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.750 
it's waiting a few seconds more it
should<00:01:26.759> be<00:01:26.939> good

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.660 

I'm<00:01:31.760> not<00:01:32.000> sure<00:01:32.320> what<00:01:33.320> is<00:01:33.440> what<00:01:33.890> is<00:01:33.920> potion<00:01:34.550> is

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
I'm not sure what is what is potion is

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.590 
I'm not sure what is what is potion is
but<00:01:34.990> let's<00:01:35.990> repeat<00:01:36.440> this<00:01:36.680> process<00:01:37.210> and<00:01:38.210> once

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
but let's repeat this process and once

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.270 
but let's repeat this process and once
you<00:01:38.720> repeat<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.200> same<00:01:39.409> process<00:01:39.619> you'll<00:01:40.010> get

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
you repeat the same process you'll get

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.280 
you repeat the same process you'll get
the<00:01:40.430> same<00:01:40.700> potion<00:01:41.240> but<00:01:41.479> to<00:01:41.720> any<00:01:41.869> button

example I have my bare fists one hit

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.530 
example I have my bare fists one hit
kill<00:02:34.190> I<00:02:34.780> kill<00:02:35.920> creepers<00:02:36.920> with<00:02:37.610> my<00:02:37.850> bare<00:02:38.090> fists

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
kill I kill creepers with my bare fists

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.940 
kill I kill creepers with my bare fists
with<00:02:38.780> three<00:02:39.590> hits

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
with three hits

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.680 
with three hits
so<00:02:41.019> that's<00:02:42.019> permitted<00:02:42.970> high<00:02:43.970> break<00:02:44.299> blocks

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
so that's permitted high break blocks

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.289 
so that's permitted high break blocks
