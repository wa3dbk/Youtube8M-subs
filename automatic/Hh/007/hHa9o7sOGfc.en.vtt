on my channel it's been a little while

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.519 
on my channel it's been a little while
since<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.509> last<00:00:15.660> one<00:00:15.870> it's<00:00:16.080> been<00:00:16.230> over<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.500> week

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
since the last one it's been over a week

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.500 
since the last one it's been over a week
and<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.830> don't<00:00:16.890> normally<00:00:17.130> leave<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.150> long

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
and I don't normally leave it that long

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.960 
and I don't normally leave it that long
but<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:18.810> time<00:00:19.080> we're<00:00:19.320> looking<00:00:19.350> at<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.980> PDW

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
but this time we're looking at the PDW

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.900 
but this time we're looking at the PDW
this<00:00:21.330> gun<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.990> bit<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.070> beast<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.550> was

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
this gun is a bit of a beast it was

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.700 
this gun is a bit of a beast it was
probably<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.359> most<00:00:24.449> overpowered<00:00:25.080> gun<00:00:25.380> until

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
probably the most overpowered gun until

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.859 
probably the most overpowered gun until
the<00:00:25.830> most<00:00:25.980> recent<00:00:26.070> patch<00:00:27.060> updates<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.779> it's

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
the most recent patch updates and it's

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.529 
the most recent patch updates and it's
my<00:00:28.050> most<00:00:28.439> used<00:00:28.590> weapon<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.550> game<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:30.090> I've

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
my most used weapon in the game so I've

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.179 
my most used weapon in the game so I've
got<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> lot<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.900> experience<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.650> however

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
got a lot of experience of it however

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.790 
got a lot of experience of it however
most<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.610> my<00:00:32.759> gameplay<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.270> or<00:00:33.750> cersei<00:00:34.469> kills

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
most of my gameplay that or cersei kills

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.620 
most of my gameplay that or cersei kills
that<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.010> got<00:00:35.250> with<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:35.640> gun<00:00:35.880> were<00:00:36.059> before<00:00:36.450> the

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
that I got with this gun were before the

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.660 
that I got with this gun were before the
patch<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.559> be<00:00:37.680> honest<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.040> really<00:00:38.219> do

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
patch and to be honest you really do

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.100 
patch and to be honest you really do
notice<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.149> difference<00:00:39.600> ever<00:00:39.750> since<00:00:39.930> that

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
notice the difference ever since that

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.990 
notice the difference ever since that
patch<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.350> not<00:00:40.770> quite<00:00:41.010> as<00:00:41.129> strong<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.579> that's

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
patch is not quite as strong and that's

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.250 
patch is not quite as strong and that's
why<00:00:42.180> as<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.360> can<00:00:42.510> see<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.780> B<00:00:42.899> straight<00:00:43.140> in

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
why as you can see the B straight in

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.810 
why as you can see the B straight in
bottom<00:00:43.530> right<00:00:43.620> hand<00:00:43.739> corner<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.190> now<00:00:44.309> an<00:00:44.430> 8<00:00:44.610> out

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
bottom right hand corner is now an 8 out

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.549 
bottom right hand corner is now an 8 out
of<00:00:44.850> 10<00:00:44.969> before<00:00:45.600> these<00:00:45.989> updates<00:00:46.350> who<00:00:46.469> would

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
of 10 before these updates who would

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.740 
of 10 before these updates who would
have<00:00:46.649> definitely<00:00:46.920> been<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.489> 9<00:00:47.879> maybe<00:00:48.210> even<00:00:48.570> nine

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
have definitely been a 9 maybe even nine

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.990 
have definitely been a 9 maybe even nine
and<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.020> half<00:00:49.230> out<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.590> ten<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.280> was<00:00:50.430> my<00:00:50.640> favorite

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
and a half out of ten it was my favorite

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.400 
and a half out of ten it was my favorite
weapon<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> game<00:00:51.570> but<00:00:51.750> now<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.930> think<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
weapon in the game but now I think the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.590 
weapon in the game but now I think the
assault<00:00:52.710> rifles<00:00:53.100> are<00:00:53.190> really<00:00:53.969> strong<00:00:54.329> this

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
assault rifles are really strong this

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.990 
assault rifles are really strong this
this<00:00:55.110> gun<00:00:55.350> not<00:00:55.559> quite<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:55.949> strong<00:00:56.160> over<00:00:56.430> range

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
this gun not quite so strong over range

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.670 
this gun not quite so strong over range
it<00:00:57.210> does<00:00:57.420> struggle<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.140> become<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> lot

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
it does struggle and it's become a lot

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.590 
it does struggle and it's become a lot
more<00:00:58.710> specialized<00:00:59.370> rather<00:00:59.940> than<00:01:00.239> absolute

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
more specialized rather than absolute

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.750 
more specialized rather than absolute
beasts<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.079> everything<00:01:01.710> which<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.550> pretty

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
beasts to everything which it pretty

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.450 
beasts to everything which it pretty
much<00:01:02.879> was<00:01:03.120> before<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.629> patch<00:01:03.780> update<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:05.220> what

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
much was before the patch update so what

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.620 
much was before the patch update so what
is<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.729> that's<00:01:05.880> interesting<00:01:06.299> about<00:01:06.390> this

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
is it that's interesting about this

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.450 
is it that's interesting about this
weapon<00:01:06.780> let's<00:01:07.409> take<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.650> look<00:01:07.830> at<00:01:07.890> some<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
weapon let's take a look at some of the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.280 
weapon let's take a look at some of the
properties<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.210> statistics<00:01:09.810> first<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.200> all

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
properties and statistics first of all

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.800 
properties and statistics first of all
it<00:01:10.380> has<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.770> largest<00:01:11.100> magazine<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:12.060> any<00:01:12.270> SMG

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
it has the largest magazine of any SMG

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
it has the largest magazine of any SMG
which<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.140> remember<00:01:13.290> when<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.560> first<00:01:13.740> started

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
which I remember when I first started

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.770 
which I remember when I first started
playing<00:01:14.040> black<00:01:14.340> ops<00:01:14.490> 2<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.970> was<00:01:15.090> using<00:01:15.600> some

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
playing black ops 2 and I was using some

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.149 
playing black ops 2 and I was using some
of<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.990> submachine<00:01:16.439> guns<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.799> remember<00:01:17.040> one

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
of the submachine guns I remember one

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.440 
of the submachine guns I remember one
day<00:01:17.189> looking<00:01:17.580> down<00:01:17.790> at<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.060> bottom<00:01:18.330> right

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
day looking down at that bottom right

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.359 
day looking down at that bottom right
hand<00:01:18.540> corner<00:01:18.630> going<00:01:18.990> damn<00:01:19.229> 50<00:01:19.860> bullets<00:01:20.250> this

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
hand corner going damn 50 bullets this

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.249 
hand corner going damn 50 bullets this
is<00:01:20.520> ridiculous<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.450> can't<00:01:21.810> believe<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.140> was

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
is ridiculous I can't believe it was

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.749 
is ridiculous I can't believe it was
there<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.710> was<00:01:22.860> even<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.340> game<00:01:23.520> that's

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
there it was even in the game that's

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.700 
there it was even in the game that's
more<00:01:23.970> than<00:01:24.150> any<00:01:24.420> assault<00:01:25.020> rifle<00:01:25.380> that's<00:01:25.500> more

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
more than any assault rifle that's more

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.499 
more than any assault rifle that's more
than<00:01:25.860> any<00:01:26.040> submachine<00:01:26.580> gun<00:01:26.759> it's<00:01:27.090> nearly<00:01:27.360> on

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
than any submachine gun it's nearly on

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.300 
than any submachine gun it's nearly on
par<00:01:27.570> with<00:01:27.840> some<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.350> LMGs<00:01:28.799> which<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.100> just

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
par with some of the LMGs which is just

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.219 
par with some of the LMGs which is just
incredible<00:01:29.880> submachine<00:01:30.540> guns<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:30.960> great

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
incredible submachine guns so it's great

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.910 
incredible submachine guns so it's great
for<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:32.490> close<00:01:32.909> range<00:01:33.180> however<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.470> does<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:34.890> a

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
for a close range however it does have a

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.830 
for a close range however it does have a
slow<00:01:35.189> reload<00:01:35.549> which<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.939> suppose<00:01:36.180> compensates

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
slow reload which I suppose compensates

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.330 
slow reload which I suppose compensates
for<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.049> fact<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.320> has<00:01:37.470> such<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> large

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
for the fact it has such a large

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.160 
for the fact it has such a large
magazine<00:01:38.700> but<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.180> reload<00:01:39.450> isn't<00:01:39.810> too<00:01:39.990> bad

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
magazine but the reload isn't too bad

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.289 
magazine but the reload isn't too bad
but<00:01:40.439> then<00:01:40.619> again<00:01:40.740> me<00:01:41.460> personally<00:01:41.939> as<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.090> said

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
but then again me personally as I said

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.420 
but then again me personally as I said
in<00:01:42.420> previous<00:01:42.540> videos<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.290> reload<00:01:43.860> all<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.250> time

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
in previous videos I reload all the time

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.670 
in previous videos I reload all the time
especially<00:01:44.700> when<00:01:45.060> I'm<00:01:45.210> rushing<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.290> tend<00:01:46.619> to

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
especially when I'm rushing so I tend to

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.350 
especially when I'm rushing so I tend to
find<00:01:46.860> fast<00:01:47.159> mags<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.640> quite<00:01:47.939> useful<00:01:48.119> because

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
find fast mags is quite useful because

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.569 
find fast mags is quite useful because
it<00:01:48.689> does<00:01:48.930> have<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> slow<00:01:49.470> reload<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.100> because<00:01:50.549> I

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
it does have a slow reload and because I

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.609 
it does have a slow reload and because I
just<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.090> know<00:01:51.210> I'm<00:01:51.810> gonna<00:01:52.020> reload<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> lot

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
just I know I'm gonna reload a lot

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.649 
just I know I'm gonna reload a lot
regardless<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.310> how<00:01:53.430> many<00:01:53.610> bullets<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.479> have

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
regardless of how many bullets I have

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.149 
regardless of how many bullets I have
like<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.930> see<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.259> still<00:01:55.470> had<00:01:55.649> 20<00:01:56.009> bullets

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
like you see that I still had 20 bullets

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.249 
like you see that I still had 20 bullets
left<00:01:56.520> but<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.700> reloaded<00:01:57.119> anyway<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:58.049> find

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
left but I reloaded anyway I just find

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.810 
left but I reloaded anyway I just find
it<00:01:58.320> more<00:01:58.500> useful<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:59.040> have<00:01:59.189> those<00:01:59.369> bullets<00:01:59.700> in

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
it more useful to have those bullets in

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.319 
it more useful to have those bullets in
the<00:01:59.909> chamber

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
the chamber

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.819 
the chamber
rather<00:02:00.780> than<00:02:00.990> risk<00:02:01.200> if<00:02:01.469> there's<00:02:01.710> an

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
rather than risk if there's an

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.260 
rather than risk if there's an
opportunity<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.310> reload<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.729> will<00:02:02.909> do<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.119> so

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
opportunity to reload I will do it so

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.120 
opportunity to reload I will do it so
I've<00:02:03.390> got<00:02:03.540> reload<00:02:03.899> as<00:02:04.079> an<00:02:04.530> attachment<00:02:04.829> there<00:02:05.100> a

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
I've got reload as an attachment there a

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.730 
I've got reload as an attachment there a
fast<00:02:05.399> reload<00:02:05.700> even<00:02:06.060> now<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.960> patch<00:02:07.259> updates

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
fast reload even now the patch updates

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.770 
fast reload even now the patch updates
they<00:02:07.950> increase<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.489> recoil<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.060> reduce<00:02:09.599> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
they increase the recoil and reduce the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.720 
they increase the recoil and reduce the
hipfire<00:02:10.140> accuracy<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.830> these<00:02:11.039> bait<00:02:11.370> big

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
hipfire accuracy and these bait big

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.640 
hipfire accuracy and these bait big
changes<00:02:12.239> because<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.599> remember

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
changes because I remember

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.619 
changes because I remember
for<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.040> patch<00:02:14.459> I<00:02:14.489> used<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.760> hipfire<00:02:15.209> people

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
for the patch I used to hipfire people

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.410 
for the patch I used to hipfire people
all<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.200> time<00:02:16.230> from<00:02:16.739> really<00:02:17.220> long<00:02:17.370> range<00:02:17.640> and

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
all the time from really long range and

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.910 
all the time from really long range and
it<00:02:18.689> was<00:02:18.810> just<00:02:19.019> ridiculous<00:02:19.379> I'll<00:02:19.650> be<00:02:19.739> honest<00:02:19.860> it

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
it was just ridiculous I'll be honest it

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.350 
it was just ridiculous I'll be honest it
was<00:02:20.069> ridiculous<00:02:20.489> it<00:02:20.640> didn't<00:02:20.939> need<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.180> patch

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
was ridiculous it didn't need the patch

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.059 
was ridiculous it didn't need the patch
update<00:02:21.750> but<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.379> has<00:02:22.560> made<00:02:22.769> it<00:02:22.920> slightly

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
update but it has made it slightly

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.160 
update but it has made it slightly
weaker<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.000> these<00:02:24.269> go<00:02:24.450> gun<00:02:24.689> clips<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.019> can

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
weaker and these go gun clips you can

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.530 
weaker and these go gun clips you can
see<00:02:25.349> here<00:02:25.590> all<00:02:26.099> with<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.549> update<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.239> I

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
see here all with the update and I

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.149 
see here all with the update and I
remember<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:27.930> think<00:02:28.019> I've<00:02:28.260> got<00:02:28.379> over<00:02:28.470> 3,000

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
remember I think I've got over 3,000

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.319 
remember I think I've got over 3,000
kills<00:02:29.310> with<00:02:29.459> this<00:02:29.549> gun<00:02:29.730> before<00:02:29.909> the<00:02:30.209> update

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
kills with this gun before the update

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.210 
kills with this gun before the update
and<00:02:30.689> it's<00:02:31.379> definitely<00:02:31.769> behaves<00:02:32.040> differently

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
and it's definitely behaves differently

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.309 
and it's definitely behaves differently
it's<00:02:32.939> strong<00:02:33.390> it's<00:02:33.659> definitely<00:02:34.049> a<00:02:34.079> strong

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
it's strong it's definitely a strong

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.170 
it's strong it's definitely a strong
weapon<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.769> worth<00:02:34.890> using<00:02:35.129> but<00:02:35.730> it's<00:02:35.909> not<00:02:36.060> what

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
weapon and worth using but it's not what

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.610 
weapon and worth using but it's not what
it<00:02:36.299> was<00:02:36.450> but<00:02:36.659> like<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:36.840> said<00:02:36.989> previously<00:02:37.260> it

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
it was but like I said previously it

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.339 
it was but like I said previously it
definitely<00:02:38.040> needed<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.489> in<00:02:38.760> my<00:02:39.090> opinion<00:02:39.569> now

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
definitely needed that in my opinion now

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.509 
definitely needed that in my opinion now
it's<00:02:40.530> actually<00:02:40.739> got<00:02:40.829> a<00:02:40.859> slow<00:02:41.189> fire<00:02:41.489> rate

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
it's actually got a slow fire rate

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.750 
it's actually got a slow fire rate
around<00:02:41.939> 700<00:02:42.629> maybe<00:02:42.810> 720<00:02:43.530> rpm<00:02:43.950> karrimba<00:02:44.400> the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
around 700 maybe 720 rpm karrimba the

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.809 
around 700 maybe 720 rpm karrimba the
exact<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.900> exact<00:02:46.260> rpm<00:02:46.889> but<00:02:47.099> it's<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.400> slow<00:02:47.609> one

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
exact the exact rpm but it's a slow one

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.839 
exact the exact rpm but it's a slow one
especially<00:02:48.420> for<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:48.870> SMGs<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.769> mp7<00:02:50.010> scorpion

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
especially for the SMGs the mp7 scorpion

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.660 
especially for the SMGs the mp7 scorpion
vector<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.480> lot<00:02:51.780> faster<00:02:52.349> but<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.040> tend<00:02:53.340> find<00:02:53.579> a

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
vector a lot faster but I tend find a

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.129 
vector a lot faster but I tend find a
slow<00:02:53.879> far-right<00:02:54.239> gun<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.629> kind<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:54.930> help

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
slow far-right gun to kind of help

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:56.629 
slow far-right gun to kind of help
sometimes<00:02:55.650> with<00:02:55.920> your<00:02:56.069> accuracy<00:02:56.489> and

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
sometimes with your accuracy and

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.610 
sometimes with your accuracy and
especially<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.389> fact<00:02:57.569> that<00:02:57.629> this<00:02:57.810> gun<00:02:58.019> has<00:02:58.200> 50

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
especially the fact that this gun has 50

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.319 
especially the fact that this gun has 50
bullets<00:02:58.769> in<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.069> magazine<00:02:59.099> mixed<00:03:00.060> with<00:03:00.150> that

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
worry too much which is great when

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.449 
worry too much which is great when
you're<00:03:07.079> rushing<00:03:07.290> great<00:03:07.950> if<00:03:08.099> you're<00:03:08.250> playing

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459

graham wall or something like that I

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.170 
graham wall or something like that I
tend<00:03:10.829> to<00:03:10.889> find<00:03:11.069> that<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.280> faka<00:03:11.609> see<00:03:11.879> that<00:03:12.090> you

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
tend to find that a faka see that you

tend to find that a faka see that you
see<00:03:12.299> there<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:12.510> reload<00:03:12.900> all<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.200> time<00:03:13.409> but

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
see there I reload all the time but

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.770 
see there I reload all the time but
anyway<00:03:13.769> it<00:03:13.950> is<00:03:14.129> good<00:03:14.459> for<00:03:14.879> rushing<00:03:15.209> into<00:03:15.359> large

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
anyway it is good for rushing into large

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.300 
anyway it is good for rushing into large
amounts<00:03:16.139> of<00:03:16.200> people<00:03:16.349> and<00:03:16.650> just<00:03:16.799> spraying<00:03:17.159> them

even though it's a three hit kill at
close<00:03:21.090> range<00:03:21.510> will<00:03:21.690> tend<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:22.109> shoot<00:03:22.319> around

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500

up what 12 16 bullets the accuracy
wasn't<00:03:34.530> perfect<00:03:35.010> but<00:03:35.819> so<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.090> only<00:03:36.329> probably

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
wasn't perfect but so you only probably

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.149 
wasn't perfect but so you only probably
kill<00:03:37.019> three<00:03:37.290> or<00:03:37.409> four<00:03:37.620> people<00:03:37.859> and

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
spawn you have to think about are they

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:21.949 
spawn you have to think about are they
gonna<00:04:20.820> over<00:04:21.209> sudden<00:04:21.359> know<00:04:21.599> where<00:04:21.719> I<00:04:21.750> am

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
gonna over sudden know where I am

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.750 
gonna over sudden know where I am
because<00:04:22.169> I've<00:04:22.349> just<00:04:22.380> shot<00:04:22.740> my<00:04:22.889> gun<00:04:23.070> we<00:04:23.490> have<00:04:23.729> a

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
because I've just shot my gun we have a

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.219 
because I've just shot my gun we have a
suppressor<00:04:24.120> it<00:04:24.270> kind<00:04:24.419> of<00:04:24.479> takes<00:04:24.659> all<00:04:24.900> of<00:04:25.080> that

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
suppressor it kind of takes all of that

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.870 
suppressor it kind of takes all of that
out<00:04:25.349> of<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.560> equation<00:04:25.669> and

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
out of the equation and

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.970 
out of the equation and
makes<00:04:27.000> it<00:04:27.120> a<00:04:27.150> lot<00:04:27.300> easier<00:04:27.660> for<00:04:27.720> you<00:04:27.900> in<00:04:28.740> terms

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
makes it a lot easier for you in terms

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.890 
makes it a lot easier for you in terms
of<00:04:29.160> actually<00:04:29.430> strategizing<00:04:30.150> your<00:04:30.330> way<00:04:30.540> around

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
of actually strategizing your way around

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.590 
of actually strategizing your way around
the<00:04:30.960> map<00:04:31.140> and<00:04:31.320> getting<00:04:32.040> all<00:04:32.220> dem<00:04:32.430> kills<00:04:32.760> so<00:04:33.540> I

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
the map and getting all dem kills so I

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.450 
the map and getting all dem kills so I
never<00:04:33.990> Tex<00:04:34.200> what<00:04:34.350> I've<00:04:34.530> suggested<00:04:34.650> here<00:04:35.280> is

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
never Tex what I've suggested here is

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.010 
never Tex what I've suggested here is
the<00:04:35.700> laser<00:04:35.850> sight<00:04:36.150> because<00:04:36.540> the<00:04:36.690> hipfire

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
the laser sight because the hipfire

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.320 
the laser sight because the hipfire
accuracy<00:04:37.350> was<00:04:38.040> reduced<00:04:38.550> I<00:04:38.730> remember<00:04:39.090> it<00:04:39.180> used

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
accuracy was reduced I remember it used

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.080 
accuracy was reduced I remember it used
to<00:04:39.420> be<00:04:39.540> an<00:04:39.600> absolute<00:04:40.080> monster<00:04:40.640> with<00:04:41.640> hipfire

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
to be an absolute monster with hipfire

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.090 
to be an absolute monster with hipfire
accuracy<00:04:42.450> before<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:43.080> patch<00:04:43.290> and<00:04:43.530> I<00:04:43.680> tend<00:04:44.070> to

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
accuracy before the patch and I tend to

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.710 
accuracy before the patch and I tend to
find<00:04:44.280> Jets<00:04:44.490> you<00:04:44.610> do<00:04:44.850> need<00:04:45.060> this<00:04:45.210> laser<00:04:45.450> sight

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
find Jets you do need this laser sight

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.150 
find Jets you do need this laser sight
now<00:04:45.900> because<00:04:46.230> it<00:04:46.350> just<00:04:46.500> tightens<00:04:46.770> up<00:04:46.980> that

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
now because it just tightens up that

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.980 
now because it just tightens up that
hipfire<00:04:47.550> spread<00:04:47.580> and<00:04:48.360> when<00:04:48.510> you're<00:04:48.630> gonna<00:04:48.720> be

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
hipfire spread and when you're gonna be

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.720 
hipfire spread and when you're gonna be
in<00:04:49.140> and<00:04:49.320> around<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.650> enemy<00:04:49.890> as<00:04:50.040> you<00:04:50.250> should<00:04:50.310> be

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
in and around the enemy as you should be

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.580 
in and around the enemy as you should be
with<00:04:50.970> a<00:04:51.000> submachine<00:04:51.480> gun<00:04:51.660> I<00:04:51.810> just<00:04:52.050> find<00:04:52.470> it

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
with a submachine gun I just find it

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.170 
with a submachine gun I just find it
really<00:04:52.620> helps<00:04:53.010> you<00:04:53.130> could<00:04:53.430> possibly<00:04:53.880> swap

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
really helps you could possibly swap

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.600 
really helps you could possibly swap
that<00:04:54.300> out<00:04:54.360> for<00:04:54.450> quick-draw<00:04:55.200> maybe<00:04:55.890> stock<00:04:56.370> but

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
that out for quick-draw maybe stock but

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.040 
that out for quick-draw maybe stock but
I<00:04:56.640> tend<00:04:56.880> front<00:04:57.120> stock<00:04:57.390> I<00:04:57.420> don't<00:04:57.690> really<00:04:57.870> use

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
I tend front stock I don't really use

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.350 
I tend front stock I don't really use
too<00:04:58.260> much<00:04:58.440> and<00:04:59.190> you're<00:04:59.340> fast<00:04:59.610> enough<00:04:59.850> without

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
too much and you're fast enough without

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.090 
too much and you're fast enough without
a<00:05:00.420> it<00:05:00.780> were<00:05:00.900> without<00:05:01.320> a<00:05:01.380> stock<00:05:01.650> with<00:05:01.800> an<00:05:01.860> SMG

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
a it were without a stock with an SMG

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.890 
a it were without a stock with an SMG
anyway<00:05:02.430> stocks<00:05:02.730> more<00:05:02.910> for<00:05:03.120> assault<00:05:03.360> rifles<00:05:03.660> in

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
anyway stocks more for assault rifles in

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.200 
anyway stocks more for assault rifles in
my<00:05:04.410> opinion<00:05:04.860> so<00:05:05.070> overall<00:05:05.520> this<00:05:05.820> is<00:05:05.970> still<00:05:06.180> a

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
my opinion so overall this is still a

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.020 
my opinion so overall this is still a
very<00:05:06.540> usable<00:05:06.960> and<00:05:07.410> very<00:05:07.590> viable<00:05:07.950> option<00:05:08.520> for<00:05:08.670> a

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
very usable and very viable option for a

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.550 
very usable and very viable option for a
submachine<00:05:09.630> gun<00:05:09.810> it's<00:05:10.050> not<00:05:10.170> the<00:05:10.290> absolute

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
submachine gun it's not the absolute

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.260 
submachine gun it's not the absolute
beast<00:05:11.010> that<00:05:11.220> it<00:05:11.340> was<00:05:11.580> it<00:05:11.820> would<00:05:12.000> have<00:05:12.030> been<00:05:12.240> a

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
beast that it was it would have been a

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.300 
beast that it was it would have been a
nine<00:05:12.570> nine<00:05:13.140> and<00:05:13.170> a<00:05:13.350> half<00:05:13.410> out<00:05:13.740> of<00:05:13.800> ten<00:05:14.040> but<00:05:14.160> I'm

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
nine nine and a half out of ten but I'm

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.250 
nine nine and a half out of ten but I'm
gonna<00:05:14.460> give<00:05:14.670> it<00:05:14.760> an<00:05:14.880> eight<00:05:15.030> if<00:05:15.750> you<00:05:15.900> do<00:05:16.080> like

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
gonna give it an eight if you do like

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.630 
gonna give it an eight if you do like
the<00:05:16.380> waste<00:05:16.500> weapon<00:05:16.770> behaves<00:05:17.040> if<00:05:17.280> you<00:05:17.340> like<00:05:17.520> the

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
the waste weapon behaves if you like the

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.640 
the waste weapon behaves if you like the
idea<00:05:17.940> of<00:05:18.000> having<00:05:18.270> that<00:05:18.390> huge<00:05:18.780> magazine<00:05:19.020> then

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
idea of having that huge magazine then

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.200 
idea of having that huge magazine then
this<00:05:19.890> is<00:05:20.070> definitely<00:05:20.220> the<00:05:20.580> gun<00:05:20.730> for<00:05:20.910> you<00:05:21.000> and

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
this is definitely the gun for you and

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.540 
this is definitely the gun for you and
you<00:05:21.330> can<00:05:21.630> still<00:05:22.050> do<00:05:22.230> work<00:05:22.410> for<00:05:22.710> it<00:05:22.860> but<00:05:23.070> like<00:05:23.520> I

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
you can still do work for it but like I

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.340 
you can still do work for it but like I
said<00:05:23.820> before<00:05:23.970> I<00:05:24.180> think<00:05:24.300> assault<00:05:24.840> rifles<00:05:25.230> are

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
said before I think assault rifles are

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.870 
said before I think assault rifles are
currently<00:05:25.620> king<00:05:25.860> in<00:05:25.980> this<00:05:26.040> game<00:05:26.340> especially

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
currently king in this game especially

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.400 
currently king in this game especially
if<00:05:27.240> you<00:05:27.300> aim<00:05:27.510> down<00:05:27.540> sight<00:05:28.020> a<00:05:28.050> lot<00:05:28.230> and<00:05:28.350> you

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
if you aim down sight a lot and you

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.100 
if you aim down sight a lot and you
stock<00:05:28.710> with<00:05:28.920> them<00:05:29.130> so<00:05:30.090> anyway<00:05:30.300> that's<00:05:30.570> it<00:05:30.870> for

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
stock with them so anyway that's it for

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.050 
stock with them so anyway that's it for
this<00:05:31.200> go<00:05:31.440> gun<00:05:31.680> video<00:05:31.950> I've<00:05:32.640> only<00:05:32.790> got<00:05:32.970> a<00:05:33.000> few

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
this go gun video I've only got a few

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.030 
this go gun video I've only got a few
more<00:05:33.540> guns<00:05:33.900> to<00:05:34.020> go<00:05:34.230> now<00:05:34.470> I've<00:05:34.590> got<00:05:34.770> to<00:05:34.830> do<00:05:34.920> the

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
more guns to go now I've got to do the

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.710 
more guns to go now I've got to do the
specials<00:05:35.520> I've<00:05:35.670> got<00:05:35.790> to<00:05:35.880> do<00:05:35.970> the<00:05:36.120> right<00:05:36.270> shield

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
specials I've got to do the right shield

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.720 
specials I've got to do the right shield
the<00:05:37.530> knife<00:05:37.710> and<00:05:37.950> things<00:05:38.130> like<00:05:38.250> that<00:05:38.310> but<00:05:38.580> those

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
the knife and things like that but those

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.210 
the knife and things like that but those
videos<00:05:39.030> are<00:05:39.120> a<00:05:39.150> little<00:05:39.270> bit<00:05:39.450> kind<00:05:39.690> of<00:05:39.840> a<00:05:40.500> little

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
videos are a little bit kind of a little

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.200 
videos are a little bit kind of a little
bit<00:05:41.310> different<00:05:41.670> though<00:05:41.850> because<00:05:41.880> they're<00:05:42.120> not
