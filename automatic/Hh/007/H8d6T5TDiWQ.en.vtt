00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.789 
hi I'm Ginny from Ginny make up.com
today's<00:00:03.600> tip<00:00:04.350> is<00:00:05.270> the<00:00:06.270> container<00:00:06.600> water<00:00:07.200> and

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
today's tip is the container water and

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.209 
today's tip is the container water and
the<00:00:08.220> way<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:08.370> do<00:00:08.519> it<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:09.120> have<00:00:09.480> I<00:00:10.380> always<00:00:10.710> have<00:00:11.010> two

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
the way I do it I have I always have two

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.970 
the way I do it I have I always have two
containers<00:00:11.670> for<00:00:12.059> water<00:00:12.120> first<00:00:12.960> thing<00:00:13.170> one<00:00:13.799> to

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
containers for water first thing one to

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.279 
containers for water first thing one to
release<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.460> pigments<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.690> other<00:00:15.809> ones<00:00:16.049> so

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
release the pigments the other ones so

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.820 
release the pigments the other ones so
the<00:00:16.500> water<00:00:16.710> stays<00:00:17.160> clear<00:00:17.580> longer<00:00:18.390> so<00:00:19.140> if<00:00:19.560> you

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
the water stays clear longer so if you

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.160 
the water stays clear longer so if you
get<00:00:20.010> used<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:21.000> you'll<00:00:21.480> see<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.810> you

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
get used to this you'll see that you

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.320 
get used to this you'll see that you
don't<00:00:22.320> have<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.710> change<00:00:23.609> your<00:00:23.789> water<00:00:23.939> all<00:00:24.180> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
don't have to change your water all the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.500 
don't have to change your water all the
time<00:00:24.800> so<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.980> works<00:00:26.160> well<00:00:26.400> for<00:00:26.430> me<00:00:26.730> normally

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
time so that works well for me normally

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.890 
time so that works well for me normally
I<00:00:27.539> have<00:00:27.750> my<00:00:27.990> layer<00:00:28.710> on<00:00:28.920> black<00:00:29.670> where<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.720> don't

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
I have my layer on black where you don't

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.639 
I have my layer on black where you don't
see<00:00:31.230> through<00:00:31.439> at<00:00:31.800> all<00:00:32.660> but<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:34.140> does<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.620> job

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
see through at all but that does the job

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.889 
see through at all but that does the job
as<00:00:35.100> long<00:00:35.309> as<00:00:35.460> that's<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:36.000> not<00:00:36.239> clear<00:00:36.660> you

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
as long as that's it's not clear you

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.440 
as long as that's it's not clear you
don't<00:00:37.050> want<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.320> share<00:00:37.590> with<00:00:37.950> people<00:00:38.149> all<00:00:39.149> that

don't want to share with people all that

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.299 
don't want to share with people all that
because<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.930> rinse<00:00:40.170> once<00:00:40.530> with<00:00:40.800> black<00:00:41.070> and

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
because you rinse once with black and

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.030 
because you rinse once with black and
your<00:00:41.399> water<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.760> completely<00:00:42.270> dark<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:43.379> avoid

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
your water is completely dark so avoid

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.810

doing the big bucket where people

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.610 
doing the big bucket where people
sometimes<00:00:48.090> they<00:00:48.510> rinse<00:00:48.780> their<00:00:49.050> sponge<00:00:49.410> in

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
sometimes they rinse their sponge in

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.650 
sometimes they rinse their sponge in
there<00:00:49.829> they<00:00:50.100> take<00:00:50.309> water<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.820> mean<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.629> me

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
there they take water I mean that to me

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.709 
there they take water I mean that to me
is<00:00:51.960> not<00:00:52.170> it's<00:00:52.590> not<00:00:52.770> attractive<00:00:53.370> at<00:00:53.579> all<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.329> I

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
is not it's not attractive at all so I

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.369 
is not it's not attractive at all so I
like<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.379> keep<00:00:55.980> my<00:00:56.370> hands<00:00:57.149> clean<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.230> way<00:00:58.350> I

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
like to keep my hands clean so the way I

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.990 
like to keep my hands clean so the way I
do<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.039> just<00:00:59.100> put<00:00:59.520> a<00:01:00.359> small<00:01:01.109> amount<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.590> water

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
do it I just put a small amount of water

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.880 
do it I just put a small amount of water
actually<00:01:03.000> just<00:01:03.449> for<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.960> understand<00:01:04.619> why

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
actually just for you to understand why

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.109 
actually just for you to understand why
is<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.820> if<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.390> put<00:01:07.100> this<00:01:08.100> much<00:01:08.340> water<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
is that if I put this much water in the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.130 
is that if I put this much water in the
cup<00:01:09.360> when<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:09.900> rinse<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:12.090> brushes<00:01:12.659> they

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
cup when I rinse the the brushes they

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.800 
cup when I rinse the the brushes they
have<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.710> bend<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.790> bottom<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.600> really

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
have to bend in the bottom so it really

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.679 
have to bend in the bottom so it really
rinse<00:01:16.200> all<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.560> way<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.009> metal<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.689> then

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
rinse all the way to the metal and then

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.649 
rinse all the way to the metal and then
it<00:01:19.140> releases<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.950> pigment<00:01:20.400> well<00:01:20.640> if<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.420> did

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
it releases the pigment well if I did

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.780 
it releases the pigment well if I did
put<00:01:21.960> water<00:01:22.200> all<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.740> way<00:01:22.860> up<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.189> there<00:01:23.369> like<00:01:23.640> I

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
put water all the way up to there like I

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.179 
put water all the way up to there like I
see<00:01:24.060> many<00:01:24.479> times<00:01:24.780> people<00:01:25.049> do<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:25.560> it's<00:01:25.950> fine

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
see many times people do but it's fine

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.240 
see many times people do but it's fine
they<00:01:26.369> don't<00:01:26.549> know<00:01:26.729> but<00:01:26.939> look<00:01:27.420> if<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.229> rinse<00:01:28.560> then

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
they don't know but look if I rinse then

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.219 
they don't know but look if I rinse then
I<00:01:29.280> have<00:01:29.610> water<00:01:29.909> coming<00:01:30.210> all<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.689> way<00:01:30.720> up<00:01:30.840> to

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
I have water coming all the way up to

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.030 
I have water coming all the way up to
here<00:01:31.759> then<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:33.390> gets<00:01:33.720> slippery<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.829> lose

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
here then it gets slippery you lose

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.039 
here then it gets slippery you lose
control<00:01:35.340> you're<00:01:35.850> wasting<00:01:36.299> time<00:01:36.540> because<00:01:36.930> you

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
control you're wasting time because you

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.440 
control you're wasting time because you
have<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.409> wipe<00:01:37.619> your<00:01:37.890> hand<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.909> there's<00:01:39.240> no

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
have to wipe your hand so there's no

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.240 
have to wipe your hand so there's no
reason<00:01:39.869> for<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.530> just<00:01:40.590> release<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
reason for that so you just release the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.700 
reason for that so you just release the
pigment<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:41.909> one<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.420> then<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.320> can<00:01:43.500> grab

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
pigment in one and then you you can grab

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.319 
pigment in one and then you you can grab
some<00:01:43.950> clear<00:01:44.220> water<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.579> then<00:01:44.970> you're<00:01:45.090> ready

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
some clear water and then you're ready

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:53.080 
some clear water and then you're ready
to<00:01:45.420> go

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.149 

you
