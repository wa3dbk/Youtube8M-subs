00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
this winter because i'm learning that

this winter because i'm learning that
some<00:04:58.690> of<00:04:58.780> the<00:04:58.840> stuff<00:04:59.110> that<00:04:59.379> i<00:04:59.770> did<00:05:00.129> when<00:05:00.580> i<00:05:00.610> had

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:00.909 
some of the stuff that i did when i had

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:03.089 
some of the stuff that i did when i had
a<00:05:00.940> TWA<00:05:01.539> is<00:05:01.780> really<00:05:02.229> not<00:05:02.379> working<00:05:02.530> out<00:05:02.830> from<00:05:03.009> you

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099
