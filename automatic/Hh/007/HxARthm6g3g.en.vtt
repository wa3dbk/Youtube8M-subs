 The ingredients you can replace are 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.249
 taste let's see the utensils a 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:52.649
 refractory that can be put in the oven 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:56.130
 and a mixing stick or spoon 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.340
 let's see the appliances 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:02.220
 and an oven let's see the process is going to 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.720
 be preheat your oven to 180 degrees 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.070
 let's mix all the ingredients 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.500
 that we have previously 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:14.170
 and I recommend that every time you go 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.170
 this added one we mix 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.430
 and so we are going to do with each of the 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.430
 seven 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.520
 they do not necessarily have to be the 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.460
 half assumed rate has been lost 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:42.460

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.460
 cranberry the coconut put gives for more 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.720

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.300
 Oil 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.300
 that is, the vices 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.440
 because you can add the amount of 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.760
 if they are natural 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.760
 and that's what I love 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.410
 above 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.010
 ah 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:55.430
 the combats I bought them without shell 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.930
 if you did not know what to spill 'there are not three 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.520
 guys, someone who is sweet 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.650
 there are some that are natural that we are 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.990
 using and there's another one that 's like 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.090
 amarillito to me in the personal family 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:23.060
 the target is very much but if you have or you 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.060
 Like you can use others 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:32.140
 and also that I have to crush 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:34.510
 all values ​​when you are 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.200
 eating and if you chew it like that 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.200
 you will not see 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.620
 and finally add the seeds of 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:56.069
 channel 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.069
 these must obviously be without a helmet 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.200
 ah 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:30.569
 since you have very well all mixed 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.569
 to add the oil 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.650
 of little 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.110
 say let's do it reminds you of little 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.440
 little everything so that it will not be a 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.440
 milestone 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.180
 baked 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.480
 and the base space 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.319
 for 45 minutes but you 're going to do it 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:57.830
 timelapse this means 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:59.380
 that looks it every five minutes what are you going to 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.100
 Mix 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.100
 I do not know what 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:58.069
 Y 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:58.069
 since if you're going to get it every year 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:06.989
 with the help of another smaller spoonful 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:10.550
 you can remove what was stuck as 

00:07:06.989 --> 00:07:10.550
 shows in the video 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.790
 so that no waste 

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:21.509
 and you put it in the oven and put it in the oven 

00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:21.509
 in the middle part 

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:37.219
 there we see how delicious the 

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:37.219
 cochineal 

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:44.629
 when it's over, he's going to take it out with 

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:47.599
 how many challenges are to protect your 

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:50.089
 hot and you're going to leave it 

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:54.709
 stand for a few minutes or until 

00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:56.899
