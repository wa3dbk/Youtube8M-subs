00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
moment especially for summertime I don't

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.460 
moment especially for summertime I don't
think<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.270> travel<00:01:09.689> addition<00:01:10.080> but

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
think that this is a travel addition but

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.320 
think that this is a travel addition but
it's<00:01:10.619> still<00:01:10.860> 50<00:01:11.250> mils<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.670> these<00:01:11.790> actually<00:01:12.180> are

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
it's still 50 mils so these actually are

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.160 
it's still 50 mils so these actually are
exactly<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.869> same<00:01:13.049> size<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.549> light

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
exactly the same size this is a light

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.920 
exactly the same size this is a light
gradual<00:01:16.170> tan<00:01:16.409> moisturizer<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.549> gradually

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
gradual tan moisturizer so it gradually

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.660 
gradual tan moisturizer so it gradually
darkens<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.290> face<00:01:19.470> over<00:01:19.710> time<00:01:20.009> perfect<00:01:20.369> for
