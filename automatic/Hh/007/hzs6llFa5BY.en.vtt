00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.589
 hello everyone greets you again the hunter vampire 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.129
 the other day they told me to do an analysis about the legend of the 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.129
 damn cartridge must reading cell majora's mask 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.969
 when I made time I started looking for the story I thought it was interesting 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.699
 and this time I have proof to prove that this is totally false since a 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.670
 Sometimes I go and personal opinions that is not much to my liking because it is as if 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.140
 out that there are not enough proofs 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.560
 but before showing them maybe some do not know this story so they 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.180
 I'll summarize if you want the whole story I leave you a link in the 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.140
 video description 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.490
 a young man has been given a nintendo 64 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.990
 what was your pleasure to play the games again as a child 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.910
 so he went to nearby garage sales he managed to get several 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.020
 video game 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.670
 before returning something caught his attention and it was a house with a table and some 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.290
 things that we could say was junk 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.160
 an old man smiled at him and welcomes him the young jesus speaks to him 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.080
 asked if he had any videogames that the old man sold to look for and 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.070
 came back with a nintendo cartridge without labels but it was written with a 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.080
 score the word improves the old man does not accept anything in return that is to say he gave me 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.320
 as a gift 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.760
 when it says it there is a file that had the name of the subject 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.880
 the young man enters the file and sees that the game was almost complete 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.930
 but he decided to start over so he creates a new file called link and 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.290
 start to play 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.640
 and in the game they call it link and see, he thought maybe it was a bus 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.080
 game so I deleted the sale file 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.500
 as I was playing this one got weirder they still did not get erased 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.280
 games appeared strange phrases even reappeared the file come 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.400
 the young man went to the old man's house but did not find him he went several times 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.360
 until he asked a neighbor where he was and he replied that he had 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.630
 moved that did not have relatives 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.079
 out of curiosity he tells him if he knew a guy and the neighbor says he was 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.489
 a child who had died in an accident 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.260
 When you go back home and play again a word file opens with a 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.079
 website address 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.419
 where slowly and supposedly speaks with femp that this 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:21.779
 I asked for help to get out because I was stuck like a spirit inside a 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:22.529
 game 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:26.599
 then carlos speak I ignore him but he had a nightmare and he's going to talk to ben 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.959
 spies where he tells him he had drowned 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.780
 to all this leaves a warning saying do not take any of your 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.079
 videos your texts or anything you have written or done 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:41.889
 day the cartridge and destroy it all and this nightmare is over 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:47.439
 As I told you, it's something summarized if the video is not too long and also 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:48.609
 boring 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.989
 now let's go to the interesting part 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.450
 then this legend became very famous throughout the internet more than anything for the 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.649
 web page that supposedly could lay the conversation moon with time 

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:03.519
 after all this I searched the net and found that the same young man 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.979
 started with all this legend has published an article on its website 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:12.689
 this is the website is obviously in English but the important thing about this 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.299
 text is that here he tells us the whole truth 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.059
 when he declares that he can no longer continue the story of ben to where he 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.879
 wanted to 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.529
 that the home depot website is purposely made to react 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:25.969
 keywords to answer what they see 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:29.139
 this young man is a big fan of this video game 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:30.150
 In summary 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.049
 there is no damned cartridge does not exist or meet the port nor the website 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:35.899
 it is real 

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:39.719
 He even leaves us his email to contact him 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:43.709
 with this it is demonstrated that this is only a myth and it is not true although the 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:44.849
 he did very well 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.419
 so it's done I'm retired 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.769
 the hunter vampire says goodbye until soon
