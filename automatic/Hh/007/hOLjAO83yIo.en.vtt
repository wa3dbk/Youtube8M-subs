00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.359
 but 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.089
 Alexander Panova Alexander 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:47.350
 not so thanks to you that you 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.120
 render our request alexander 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.329
 today was such a tense match 5 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.299
 recanati a few words about this day 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.939
 so hard gaming two games here 

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:59.250
 the first game was not easy with the team 

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:02.760
 flight 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.710
 legion here and the second sister guys 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.260
 Well done from here including because they 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.220
 played less time to rest was up 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.740
 over time we have been but they their 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.570
 the game was equal to the principle but we could 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.050
 win could lose because 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.780
 mutually had dangerous moments in those and in 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.060
 other gudogai fair draw 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.860
 probably let's say no one wanted 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.590
 win and no one deserved defeat 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.200
 that's all decided a penalty shootout but to 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.509
 this is not well performed a series of five of 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.190
 five scored here but the filing is very with us 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.750
 the goalkeeper is harder of course played great 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.540
 first game pulled a few moments 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.930
 good kicking and very confident when 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.520
 in principle, we will be kicked and we are quite 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.250
 feel confident in our goalkeeper 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:55.020
 and because more than once we have sent in 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.869
 difficult moments so thank him 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.860
 Here are the terms of which 1 4 floor of course 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.370
 good achievement 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.680
 bad 0 before and for us 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.840
 this is not the limit because we set 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.160
 the task of winning one like the others 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.400
 commands on r which are you here 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.840
 Feel specifically you have not 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.610
 it seemed that how much playing time 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.380
 less than it was at the Russian Cup 8 by 8 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.540
 maybe it's okay with health 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:26.830
 planets but we have a lot of players 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.750
 in attack yes well there is time of course the main thing 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.900
 I always say no matter how much 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.480
 prigrozhu important as here tolerates sorry 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.850
 it does not have a normal that I can 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.730
 trying to make play useful on 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.070
 team after all my team game yes 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.950
 of course there is more opportunity 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:48.400
 I wanted to play well, I'm not upset 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.550
 here are four more maybe two games tomorrow 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.800
 so there are certain trauma guys 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.200
 the problem is now one of the scavenger 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.270
 we got hurt this game can be 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.650
 tomorrow will be more time so how 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.170
 then I take it easy 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.940
 for me the main task is team play and 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.630
 your individual personal ambitions 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.010
 leave for the field boil Russia 8 to 8 in 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.930
 Moscow this time went to some 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.730
 completely new level but nonetheless 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.290
 today there are two such events not 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.120
 I am very pleased to have your opinion. 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:23.540
 opera was a massive fight 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:26.720
 filled so sorry that the guys from Dagestan 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.750
 Makhachkala let's say well, lose 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.560
 the account began well, as all the same we do not 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:37.190
 nicely I understand football and the emotions you 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.299
 This is certain nuances but all 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.689
 equally be respected 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:44.000
 I think the rivals do not think the page 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.849
 either hands and that's it 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.819
 and there is a culture of football because 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:51.560
 fight but what's good about it 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.970
 got into a fight disqualified one 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.069
 the team is no longer she play 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.049
 it will be but for the sake of it did not come that 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.389
 fight no longer plays well somehow 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.769
 stupid so i understand that no one 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.590
 He wants to play soccer on it here 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.709
 someone won played well and the second 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.900
 accident of course I'm sorry 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:11.659
 Konstantin broke his arm but again 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.169
 The elements here are beautiful football 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:18.680
 still need to remove it from yourself 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:21.410
 hurt on such a slippery field wet 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.260
 somehow a dangerous trauma to think 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.199
 God bless him with his safety 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.750
 maybe not everything is as scary as it can 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.800
 it seemed to be but nevertheless the incident 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.690
 very unpleasant 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.389
 Now I think that this is an example for all 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.639
 should serve that need be more 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.520
 let's say carefully and when you go to fight 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.710
 for example, too, is there yesterday? 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.740
 there man pushed fatter you flew away 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:49.960
 there was also an unpleasant moment which 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:52.610
 still we do one thing happy in ourselves 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.479
 fans who come under these 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.550
 injuries of course deepen I do not ask it 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.380
 dangerous question 2 peters commanders 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.580
 now involved grand sport has already flown 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.819
 golden in the semifinals 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.759
 but Zemlyuk and ask questions as you 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:11.300
 performance of our guys well principle 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:13.820
 Team look golden one 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.970
 from those teams that 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:19.420
 does not set serious tasks 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:24.050
 here reaches a certain level already 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:26.960
 play the semi-finals here in Petersburg they 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:30.200
 also worthy of playing but lost cdk 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.560
 new 8 and serpentine memory 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.180
 less is added by each tournament and 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.540
 I think that the team looks good on 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:42.830
 tournament well done i want to wish them good luck 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:45.260
 Thank you for coming. 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.520
 all the same I think it will be interesting in 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.190
 Petersburg to see some 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.880
 beautiful stadium what's what is what 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.930
 seek 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.930
 amateur league
