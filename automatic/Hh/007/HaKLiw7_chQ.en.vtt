in<00:00:00.480> this<00:00:00.690> video<00:00:01.079> we're<00:00:01.439> gonna<00:00:01.560> be<00:00:01.740> taking<00:00:02.100> a

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
in this video we're gonna be taking a

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.889 
in this video we're gonna be taking a
look<00:00:02.399> at<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.240> gigabyte<00:00:03.780> GT<00:00:04.589> 640<00:00:05.490> this<00:00:06.480> is<00:00:06.720> the

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
look at the gigabyte GT 640 this is the

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.339 
look at the gigabyte GT 640 this is the
overclocked<00:00:07.620> version<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:09.170> it<00:00:10.170> is

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
overclocked version and it is

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.320 
overclocked version and it is
overclocked<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:11.300> 1045<00:00:12.300> megahertz<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:14.059> it's<00:00:15.059> 2

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
overclocked to 1045 megahertz and it's 2

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.230 
overclocked to 1045 megahertz and it's 2
gigabytes<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:16.130> ddr3<00:00:17.130> RAM<00:00:19.670> it<00:00:20.670> looks<00:00:20.850> like<00:00:21.060> that

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
gigabytes of ddr3 RAM it looks like that

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.740 
gigabytes of ddr3 RAM it looks like that
some<00:00:21.830> gold-plated<00:00:22.830> support<00:00:23.369> on<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.789> HDMI

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.540 

some<00:00:27.750> other<00:00:28.760> stuff<00:00:29.760> there<00:00:30.090> DirectX<00:00:30.750> 11

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
some other stuff there DirectX 11

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.180 
some other stuff there DirectX 11
128-bit<00:00:34.070> so<00:00:35.070> there's<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:36.000> card<00:00:36.860> it's<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.950> dual

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
128-bit so there's the card it's a dual

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.690 
128-bit so there's the card it's a dual
slot<00:00:38.610> card<00:00:39.239> obviously<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.230> then<00:00:40.440> this

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
slot card obviously and then this

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.930 
slot card obviously and then this
gigantic<00:00:41.700> fanon<00:00:42.450> on<00:00:42.660> here<00:00:42.989> it's<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
gigantic fanon on here it's this the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.940 
gigantic fanon on here it's this the
heatsink<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.600> rather<00:00:45.780> large<00:00:46.110> as<00:00:46.379> well<00:00:46.559> -<00:00:46.800> it

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
heatsink is rather large as well - it

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.510 
heatsink is rather large as well - it
does<00:00:47.219> extend<00:00:47.520> past<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.690> PT<00:00:48.930> a--<00:00:49.079> past<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.950> PCB

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
does extend past the PT a-- past the PCB

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.270 
does extend past the PT a-- past the PCB
a<00:00:50.550> little<00:00:50.879> bit<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.680> it's<00:00:52.680> got<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.010> little

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
a little bit and it's got this little

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.420 
a little bit and it's got this little
wing<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> back<00:00:54.030> but<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:54.989> fan<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.680> quite

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
wing in the back but that fan is quite

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.420 
wing in the back but that fan is quite
huge<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.539> I'm<00:00:57.870> really<00:00:58.739> looking<00:00:59.039> forward<00:00:59.309> to

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
huge so I'm really looking forward to

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.660 
huge so I'm really looking forward to
see<00:00:59.899> just<00:01:00.899> how<00:01:01.140> well<00:01:01.789> this<00:01:02.789> does<00:01:04.369> so<00:01:05.369> yeah

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
see just how well this does so yeah

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.359 
see just how well this does so yeah
anyway<00:01:06.210> I'm<00:01:06.750> gonna<00:01:06.990> do<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> couple<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.680> DirectX

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
anyway I'm gonna do a couple of DirectX

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.020 
anyway I'm gonna do a couple of DirectX
11<00:01:09.119> benchmarking<00:01:10.110> tests<00:01:10.439> for<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.130> we'll

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
11 benchmarking tests for it and we'll

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.190 
11 benchmarking tests for it and we'll
see<00:01:12.299> how<00:01:12.479> well<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.840> does<00:01:14.240> by<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.299> way<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.570> held<00:01:16.049> a

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
see how well it does by the way I held a

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.030 
see how well it does by the way I held a
120<00:01:17.009> mil<00:01:17.280> fan<00:01:17.640> up<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:19.200> 120<00:01:19.830> mil

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
120 mil fan up to this and the 120 mil

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.920 
120 mil fan up to this and the 120 mil
is<00:01:20.220> just<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.549> hair<00:01:20.759> bigger<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.390> I'm<00:01:21.479> gonna<00:01:21.630> guess

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
is just a hair bigger so I'm gonna guess

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.410 
is just a hair bigger so I'm gonna guess
that<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.290> fan<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.740> probably<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.790> hundred

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
that this fan is probably a hundred

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.609 
that this fan is probably a hundred
millimetres<00:01:25.850> yeah<00:01:26.850> which<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.990> pretty<00:01:28.439> big

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
millimetres yeah which is a pretty big

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.609 
millimetres yeah which is a pretty big
size<00:01:28.860> for<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> graphics<00:01:30.060> card<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.390> think<00:01:30.590> but<00:01:31.590> I

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
size for a graphics card I think but I

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.770 
size for a graphics card I think but I
just<00:01:31.710> wanted<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.280> throw<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.329> now

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
just wanted to throw that in and now

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.830 
just wanted to throw that in and now
let's<00:01:34.079> get<00:01:34.259> on<00:01:34.380> with<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.680> testing<00:01:35.780> okay<00:01:36.780> so

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
let's get on with the testing okay so

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.370 
let's get on with the testing okay so
now<00:01:37.140> I've<00:01:37.259> got<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.590> gigabyte<00:01:38.040> GT<00:01:38.630> 640<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
now I've got the gigabyte GT 640 on the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.600 
now I've got the gigabyte GT 640 on the
test<00:01:40.590> bench<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> x58<00:01:43.220> system<00:01:44.220> with

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
test bench and it is a x58 system with

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.490

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.929 
Home Premium 64-bit and we're
benchmarking<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:02.600> 3dmark<00:02:03.600> 11<00:02:04.020> right<00:02:04.200> now

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
benchmarking it on 3dmark 11 right now

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.490 
benchmarking it on 3dmark 11 right now
so<00:02:05.939> we're<00:02:06.180> gonna<00:02:06.270> let<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.630> run<00:02:06.780> its<00:02:06.930> benchmark

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
so we're gonna let it run its benchmark

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.690 
so we're gonna let it run its benchmark
and<00:02:07.770> we'll<00:02:08.580> check<00:02:08.910> out<00:02:09.119> how<00:02:09.539> well<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.959> does

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
and we'll check out how well it does

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.830 
and we'll check out how well it does
performance<00:02:11.700> wise<00:02:11.910> and

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
performance wise and

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.509 
performance wise and
we'll<00:02:12.930> check<00:02:13.110> out<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.349> maximum<00:02:14.310> temperature

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
we'll check out the maximum temperature

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.280 
we'll check out the maximum temperature
to<00:02:14.910> cheves<00:02:15.180> as<00:02:15.390> well<00:02:15.739> I'll<00:02:16.739> be<00:02:16.950> back<00:02:18.230> okay<00:02:19.230> so

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
to cheves as well I'll be back okay so

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.479 
to cheves as well I'll be back okay so
here's<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.890> results<00:02:20.760> we've<00:02:21.450> got<00:02:21.660> ap<00:02:22.489> 1701

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489

overclocked<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:29.010> 10:45<00:02:29.930> really<00:02:30.930> makes<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.739> bit

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
overclocked to 10:45 really makes a bit

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.369 
overclocked to 10:45 really makes a bit
of<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.430> difference<00:02:32.819> or<00:02:33.090> such<00:02:33.379> factory

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.390 
of a difference or such factory
overclock<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.160> should<00:02:35.370> say<00:02:35.610> of<00:02:36.530> 1045<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:38.250> that

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
overclock I should say of 1045 so that

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.400 
overclock I should say of 1045 so that
made<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.610> heck<00:02:38.819> of<00:02:38.849> a<00:02:39.060> difference<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.660> with

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
made a heck of a difference and with

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.479 
made a heck of a difference and with
that<00:02:40.680> big-ass<00:02:41.160> fan<00:02:41.879> on<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.629> barely<00:02:43.349> broke<00:02:44.220> a

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
that big-ass fan on it it barely broke a

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.130 
that big-ass fan on it it barely broke a
sweat<00:02:44.720> at<00:02:45.720> 38<00:02:46.680> degrees<00:02:47.299> 15<00:02:48.299> degrees<00:02:48.329> above

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
sweat at 38 degrees 15 degrees above

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.800 
sweat at 38 degrees 15 degrees above
ambient<00:02:49.410> temperature<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:51.000> this<00:02:51.180> thing<00:02:51.510> got<00:02:51.750> a

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
ambient temperature so this thing got a

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.199 
ambient temperature so this thing got a
workout<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:54.630> didn't<00:02:55.110> even<00:02:55.700> get<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.760> workout

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
workout and it didn't even get a workout

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.500 
workout and it didn't even get a workout
I<00:02:57.829> didn't<00:02:58.829> think<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.280> fan<00:02:59.519> ever<00:02:59.819> increased<00:03:00.299> in

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
I didn't think the fan ever increased in

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.319 
I didn't think the fan ever increased in
speed<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:01.079> according<00:03:01.829> to<00:03:02.099> afterburner<00:03:03.090> it

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
speed and according to afterburner it

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.770 
speed and according to afterburner it
did<00:03:03.540> not<00:03:03.799> so<00:03:04.799> this<00:03:05.220> guy<00:03:05.519> here<00:03:05.879> could<00:03:06.450> probably

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
did not so this guy here could probably

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.550 
did not so this guy here could probably
handle<00:03:08.060> maybe<00:03:09.060> even<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.629> bit<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:09.900> overclocking

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
handle maybe even a bit of overclocking

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.440 
handle maybe even a bit of overclocking
although<00:03:10.799> I'm<00:03:10.920> not<00:03:11.099> going<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.370> do<00:03:11.489> that<00:03:11.670> but<00:03:12.090> I

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
although I'm not going to do that but I

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.750 
although I'm not going to do that but I
think<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:13.110> could<00:03:13.349> handle<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.250> pretty<00:03:14.459> good

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
think it could handle it pretty good

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.300 
think it could handle it pretty good
especially<00:03:15.030> with<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.660> that<00:03:16.319> big<00:03:16.680> fan<00:03:17.010> right

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
especially with that that big fan right

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.210 
especially with that that big fan right
there<00:03:17.609> it's<00:03:18.030> incredible<00:03:18.660> it<00:03:19.019> did

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
there it's incredible it did

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.420 
there it's incredible it did
far<00:03:20.700> far<00:03:21.120> exceeded<00:03:21.600> my<00:03:21.750> expectations<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:22.920> it

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
far far exceeded my expectations and it

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.300 
far far exceeded my expectations and it
didn't<00:03:23.730> even<00:03:23.819> have<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.239> spool<00:03:24.660> up<00:03:25.010> so<00:03:26.010> now<00:03:26.160> I'm

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
didn't even have to spool up so now I'm

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.890 
didn't even have to spool up so now I'm
gonna<00:03:26.430> give<00:03:26.639> it<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.790> little<00:03:26.940> more<00:03:27.269> of<00:03:27.389> a<00:03:27.480> workout

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
gonna give it a little more of a workout

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.660 
gonna give it a little more of a workout
and<00:03:28.170> I'm<00:03:28.319> going<00:03:28.799> to<00:03:29.069> run<00:03:29.970> an<00:03:30.299> X<00:03:30.630> score<00:03:31.590> for<00:03:32.220> 3d

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
and I'm going to run an X score for 3d

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.660 
and I'm going to run an X score for 3d
mark<00:03:32.910> 11<00:03:33.299> and<00:03:33.500> I<00:03:34.500> will<00:03:34.709> get<00:03:34.889> back<00:03:34.920> to<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:35.489> with

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
mark 11 and I will get back to you with

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.960 
mark 11 and I will get back to you with
those<00:03:35.849> results<00:03:37.220> all<00:03:38.220> right<00:03:38.489> so<00:03:38.700> there's<00:03:38.880> a

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
those results all right so there's a

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.789 
those results all right so there's a
results<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.599> the<00:03:39.810> X<00:03:40.079> score<00:03:40.769> and<00:03:42.590> we<00:03:43.590> actually

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
results of the X score and we actually

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.420 
results of the X score and we actually
got<00:03:44.700> two<00:03:45.450> degrees<00:03:45.630> warmer<00:03:46.319> so<00:03:46.950> we<00:03:47.099> ended<00:03:47.310> up

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
got two degrees warmer so we ended up

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.110 
got two degrees warmer so we ended up
with<00:03:47.639> a<00:03:47.669> 17<00:03:48.510> degree<00:03:49.079> Delta<00:03:49.410> which<00:03:50.400> i<00:03:50.639> think<00:03:50.700> is

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
with a 17 degree Delta which i think is

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.409 
with a 17 degree Delta which i think is
still<00:03:51.269> pretty<00:03:51.630> good<00:03:51.859> didn't<00:03:52.859> even<00:03:53.310> move<00:03:53.940> the

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
still pretty good didn't even move the

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.770 
still pretty good didn't even move the
fan<00:03:54.690> speed<00:03:55.169> the<00:03:55.410> whole<00:03:55.590> time

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
fan speed the whole time

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.449 
fan speed the whole time
okay<00:03:57.780> so<00:03:58.500> we<00:03:58.950> got<00:03:59.130> an<00:03:59.430> explorer<00:03:59.970> of<00:04:00.620> 665<00:04:01.620> with

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
okay so we got an explorer of 665 with

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.370 
okay so we got an explorer of 665 with
the<00:04:02.609> graphics<00:04:03.120> core<00:04:03.480> of<00:04:04.940> 594<00:04:06.019> so<00:04:07.019> that<00:04:07.169> about

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
the graphics core of 594 so that about

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.970 
the graphics core of 594 so that about

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
this card not a real performer but I

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.670 
this card not a real performer but I

gaming<00:04:20.190> it's<00:04:20.489> probably<00:04:21.209> not<00:04:21.390> a<00:04:21.450> priority<00:04:22.049> on
