about it was we were that we were on

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.330 
about it was we were that we were on
sound<00:02:20.510> stages<00:02:20.810> all<00:02:21.110> day<00:02:21.350> with<00:02:21.650> no<00:02:21.830> windows<00:02:22.310> and

you know for 15 to 18 hours a day and
and<00:02:26.690> we<00:02:26.870> all<00:02:26.990> sort<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.260> went<00:02:27.470> mad<00:02:27.680> in<00:02:28.040> the

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
and we all sort of went mad in the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.280 
and we all sort of went mad in the
process<00:02:28.700> which<00:02:29.060> helped<00:02:29.480> things<00:02:29.720> in<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.110> long

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
process which helped things in the long

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.010 
process which helped things in the long
run<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:31.100> you<00:02:31.520> have<00:02:31.730> said<00:02:32.030> before<00:02:32.300> that<00:02:32.630> you

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
seven years no I I assumed when we began

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.390 
seven years no I I assumed when we began
it<00:02:55.940> would<00:02:56.060> be<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.209> one-year<00:02:57.100> experience<00:02:58.100> my

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
it would be a one-year experience my

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.850 
it would be a one-year experience my
show<00:02:58.850> was<00:02:59.000> sold<00:02:59.209> for<00:02:59.420> a<00:02:59.480> year<00:02:59.780> and<00:02:59.959> I<00:03:00.590> was<00:03:00.709> like

show was sold for a year and I was like

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.320 
show was sold for a year and I was like
everybody<00:03:01.069> else<00:03:01.400> I<00:03:01.580> thought<00:03:01.790> there's<00:03:02.030> no<00:03:02.180> way

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330

sets for the new shows and Trekkies were
a<00:03:42.319> little<00:03:42.500> tipped<00:03:42.859> within<00:03:43.129> this<00:03:43.220> thing<00:03:43.459> you

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
a little tipped within this thing you

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.190 
a little tipped within this thing you
were<00:03:43.790> in<00:03:43.879> the<00:03:43.970> top<00:03:44.120> five<00:03:44.180> why<00:03:44.750> did<00:03:44.930> they<00:03:45.019> cancel

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
were in the top five why did they cancel

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.129 
were in the top five why did they cancel
it<00:03:45.530> you<00:03:45.769> know<00:03:46.280> I<00:03:46.310> think<00:03:46.750> undoubtedly<00:03:47.750> it<00:03:47.989> was

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
it you know I think undoubtedly it was

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:52.930 
it you know I think undoubtedly it was
purely<00:03:48.590> an<00:03:48.829> economic<00:03:49.569> reality<00:03:50.569> and<00:03:51.370> I<00:03:52.370> just

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
purely an economic reality and I just

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.520 
purely an economic reality and I just
think<00:03:53.180> that<00:03:53.269> they<00:03:53.480> they<00:03:54.079> found<00:03:54.319> that<00:03:54.409> they

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
think that they they found that they

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.199 
think that they they found that they
would<00:03:54.680> do<00:03:54.769> better<00:03:54.950> with<00:03:55.069> new<00:03:55.400> shows<00:03:55.639> coming<00:03:55.670> on

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
would do better with new shows coming on

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.940 
would do better with new shows coming on
and<00:03:56.420> then<00:03:56.569> there's<00:03:56.720> this<00:03:56.900> thing<00:03:57.139> of<00:03:57.349> salaries

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
and then there's this thing of salaries

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.160 
and then there's this thing of salaries
going<00:03:58.250> up<00:03:58.400> as<00:03:58.579> the<00:03:58.730> years<00:03:58.879> go<00:03:59.120> on<00:03:59.150> and<00:03:59.750> they

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
going up as the years go on and they

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.240 
going up as the years go on and they
start<00:04:00.409> a<00:04:00.470> new<00:04:00.590> one<00:04:00.709> where<00:04:00.889> they<00:04:00.980> can<00:04:01.129> have

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
start a new one where they can have

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.399 
start a new one where they can have
lower<00:04:01.430> set<00:04:01.730> but<00:04:01.909> you<00:04:01.939> had<00:04:02.120> 178<00:04:02.870> episodes

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:03.409 
lower set but you had 178 episodes

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:04.929 
lower set but you had 178 episodes
exactly<00:04:03.950> which<00:04:04.129> is<00:04:04.280> I<00:04:04.430> think<00:04:04.489> pretty<00:04:04.819> much

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:04.939 
exactly which is I think pretty much

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:08.170 
exactly which is I think pretty much
enough<00:04:05.329> of<00:04:05.510> any<00:04:06.310> and<00:04:07.310> there'll<00:04:07.579> be<00:04:07.609> more<00:04:07.909> Star

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
enough of any and there'll be more Star

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.869 
enough of any and there'll be more Star
Trek<00:04:08.420> movies<00:04:08.720> perhaps<00:04:09.109> but<00:04:10.010> yeah<00:04:10.189> I<00:04:10.849> think

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
Trek movies perhaps but yeah I think

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.360 
Trek movies perhaps but yeah I think
another<00:04:11.269> economic<00:04:11.599> reality<00:04:12.470> there<00:04:12.650> but<00:04:12.859> we're

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
another economic reality there but we're

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.619 
another economic reality there but we're
hopeful<00:04:13.669> and<00:04:13.819> I<00:04:13.879> think<00:04:14.090> there<00:04:14.209> probably<00:04:14.239> will

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
hopeful and I think there probably will

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.409 
hopeful and I think there probably will
be<00:04:14.690> don't<00:04:15.199> put<00:04:15.379> all<00:04:15.470> your<00:04:15.500> gold<00:04:15.889> powder<00:04:16.130> away

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
be don't put all your gold powder away

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.509 
be don't put all your gold powder away
