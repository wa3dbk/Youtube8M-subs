00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.830
 hello everyone and welcome to my first 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:09.910
 diary chapter navigate to this the 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:12.960
 point number one the theme of today 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.330
 proteins 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.580
 have you wondered what stories leave homework 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.700
 and how many summers are there in a hospital 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:25.030
 due to protein deficiency 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.190
 very well that is the protein in the first 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.980
 place that are organic compounds 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.740
 formed by 20 amino acids in 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.260
 amino acids but different their function 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.360
 is creation and maintenance of 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.100
 cells and help metabolize those 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.590
 food to see us a little bit more 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.440
 scientists the word protein comes 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.290
 from the Greek protected meaning 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.080
 primary primary first hand vegetables 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.080
 raw, do not tell me you're going to 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.850
 eat the raw cow so much quantity of 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.470
 animal protein can harm our 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.050
 tissues our organs our 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.600
 muscles the nadel kidneys and calcium 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.270
 zinc vitamins especially from 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.000
 vitamin b iron magnesium and cause 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:09.190
 of our but also heart damage 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.650
 obesity and cancer our cells and 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.320
 also speed aging 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.880
 premature 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.190
 another question is how much protein 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.800
 we really need the average is 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.050
 between 18 and 60 grams a day the doctor 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.820
 Patrick Wolf wrote a book that 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.740
 optimal flame 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.380
 most people are in higher 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.020
 risk of taking twice as much protein 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.910
 that the not to eat the necessary the 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.100
 protein is formed from amino acids 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.380
 amino acids are vitamins are enzymes 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.080
 alive the chicken has so many grams of 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.110
 protein in the fish both the werder 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.600
 it vibrates yes but it's obvious because it's 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.240
 Animal muscle is something already 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.180
 formed were the amino acids that already 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.910
 formed in animals for example the 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.640
 cows are three thousand two animal are you not 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.729
 they kill you they sit on you can you 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.509
 kill that cow not breakfast eggs he does not 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.670
 ate bull and I also do not know its not tuna 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.440
 home for the gym no and yet 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.560
 she has muscle is very large she 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.060
 Herbal feed is raw vegan 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.820
 where we get the proteins 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.010
 well the mole is a good option but 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.850
 something more natural could be the 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.580
 spinach walnuts almonds the 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.010
 lentils beans there is a food 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.400
 delicious that is called quinoa together with 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.110
 the amaranth is also one of the 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.870
 star of this world also the 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.330
 Chia seeds that exist here is that 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.950
 you feel healthy that you feel good 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.989
 that you feel energized and no longer 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.690
 have skin problems , have better 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.090
 digestion a lot of pros that you can 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.790
 get changing your diet not what 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.270
 I recommend it be sudden I changed 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.090
 something long to me I take it I think two 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.970
 years but vegan vegetarian if it was 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.390
 of sudden thanks to this book is called 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.600
 good skinny page is written by mistake 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.660
 and fernÃ¡n in kimono in the book does not have 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.280
 nothing nothing to do with the title you 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.019
 I recommend that you read it if you have more 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.000
 doubt or want to introduce yourself to all this 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.519
 world of vegans about my story 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.310
 what I did consume though were 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.350
 yogurt since I left I went back changes 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.810
 extremely very good in the body 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.370
 then it was the chicken and until the last 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.290
 the seafood believe me that afterwards not 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.120
 you need and then reduced raw fish 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.689
 it was the worst thing you could have done to me 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.609
 My Christmas the dairy is practically 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:38.189
 fat of cows and then they say milk 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:41.280
 lactoseous to say milk and its 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:42.930
 dairy products and they sell it to you is lactose that 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.030
 they are removing and then that you are 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.970
 drinking when you drink more milk 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.310
 ask what nutrients I am going to tell 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.040
 my body and before you say calcium 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.470
 ask yourself what calcium is and how it has it 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.709
 on youtube or that the cows go and 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.889
 order a goat and take it to 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.680
 song you're practically nonsense 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:07.500
 say you need the milk of a uvi 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.430
 of a cow to be healthy to me I do not 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.530
 gives meaning and you if forward and then of 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.120
 there you derive all the yogurt you put 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.759
 bacteria to make it a milk 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.979
 decomposed and cheese there are additives that if 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:22.079
 they give the cheese to make you addicted 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.699
 or addicted if someday you said I never 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.830
 I'm going to leave the cheese because I'm addicted 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:28.139
 I believe you can change or you can go 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.110
 taking away little things like that, do not do it 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.090
 Suddenly, it will reach 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.600
 to fall there is a decision that I like 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.430
 do 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.380
 there are times when people put on 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.290
 they get sick of hypertension 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.600
 cholesterol diabetes very high or that 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.790
 they suffer a lot and they go to the hospital 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.160
 who are sick when they go and 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.160
 they prescribe most of the time the 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.890
 doctor says you know he leaves the meat 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.750
 red do not eat pork down to the 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.300
 You leave the cheese 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.790
 I think it's illogical 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.910
 thought of if it really makes you 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.760
 lack that kind of nutrients because 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.880
 when you get sick it 's the first thing 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.190
 they forbid I'll leave you homework that you 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.900
 think about it this concludes a little bit 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.500
 my videoblog see you in the next 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.500
