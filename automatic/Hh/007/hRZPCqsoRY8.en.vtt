a<00:00:17.070> while<00:00:17.340> for<00:00:17.369> us<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.029> have<00:00:18.660> been<00:00:18.960> getting<00:00:19.260> an

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
a while for us to have been getting an

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.250 
a while for us to have been getting an
item<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.770> believe<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.699> last<00:00:20.970> time<00:00:21.210> was<00:00:21.810> maybe

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
item I believe the last time was maybe

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.349 
item I believe the last time was maybe
about<00:00:22.410> four<00:00:22.800> months<00:00:22.949> ago<00:00:23.279> but<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.060> could<00:00:24.240> be

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
about four months ago but I could be

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.689 
about four months ago but I could be
wrong<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.320> definitely<00:00:25.590> was<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> long<00:00:26.400> time

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
wrong but it definitely was a long time

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.240 
wrong but it definitely was a long time

so this is a new item and I believe it's

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.519
