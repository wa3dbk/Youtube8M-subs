00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.730
 daily wasted thousands of 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.130
 tons of food around the world 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.680
 while millions of people suffer from 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.170
 hungry for it came food not bombs 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.910
 international movement that regained the 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.100
 wasted food to give him in 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.260
 streets 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.629
 basically the reason is called food not 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.210
 bombs is because they were protesting saying 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.250
 that the tax money that is 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.320
 pagans did not have to be spending on 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.000
 fight wars and buy weapons that 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.989
 all this being that people have 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.129
 hungry then instead how it was 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.989
 very good no advance baisley we are not going to 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.390
 buy food and do not buy pumps 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.220
 so now I've also sneaked a 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.930
 little the approach we give you is 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.789
 focused and that in Mexico they fight to the 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.710
 war against drug trafficking is spent 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:17.020
 in struggle this war against the 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.580
 drug traffickers say that the 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.770
 Drug addiction is the number one problem 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.450
 of mexico when the health problem 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.670
 number one old age with reality is the 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.890
 obesity then we try to 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.929
 provide healthy meals are by 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.149
 fruits and vegetables are salads 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.960
 fruits this we cook the vegetables 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:37.030
 we did all these things are trying 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.929
 also to teach people that is 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.929
 healthy food 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:51.630
 some of them have it in the trash 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:54.090
 we are going away and picks up 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.670
 people this helps us a lot is is 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.230
 dedicating to the garbage additionally not 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.570
 we have to do that because the people of 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.430
 the treaties of camping the food them 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.420
 you already know that we do this and 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.170
 they shake hands 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.170
 they tell me
