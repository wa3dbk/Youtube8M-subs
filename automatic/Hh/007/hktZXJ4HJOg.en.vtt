00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
nether I don't know what happen I know I

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.839 
nether I don't know what happen I know I
built<00:00:12.900> it<00:00:13.049> like<00:00:13.170> I'm<00:00:13.440> for<00:00:13.620> sure<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:13.830> built<00:00:14.340> the

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
built it like I'm for sure I built the

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.019 
built it like I'm for sure I built the
thing<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.389> just<00:00:15.450> never<00:00:15.839> found<00:00:16.139> another<00:00:16.560> reactor

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
thing I just never found another reactor

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.390 
thing I just never found another reactor
but<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.240> went<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.539> got<00:00:18.600> them<00:00:18.750> on<00:00:18.900> materials<00:00:19.400> for

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
but I went and got them on materials for

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.220 
but I went and got them on materials for
it<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:20.880> we're<00:00:21.000> gonna<00:00:21.060> head<00:00:21.420> off<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:22.020> the

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
it and so we're gonna head off in the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.210 
it and so we're gonna head off in the
distance<00:00:22.640> so<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.789> it's<00:00:23.970> not<00:00:24.150> too<00:00:25.039> visible<00:00:26.039> I

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
distance so that it's not too visible I

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.009 
distance so that it's not too visible I
guess<00:00:26.430> you'd<00:00:26.609> say<00:00:26.849> well<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.539> know<00:00:27.660> what<00:00:27.810> I

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
guess you'd say well you know what I

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.019 
guess you'd say well you know what I
don't<00:00:28.470> know<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.980> kind<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.279> our<00:00:29.429> area<00:00:29.760> for

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
don't know this kind of our area for

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.389 
don't know this kind of our area for
another<00:00:30.210> hector's<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:31.080> guess<00:00:32.009> I'll<00:00:32.160> just<00:00:32.250> build

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
another hector's I guess I'll just build

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.670 
another hector's I guess I'll just build
it<00:00:32.550> right<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:32.820> no<00:00:33.360> reason<00:00:33.750> not<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.170> guess

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
it right here no reason not to I guess

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.200 
it right here no reason not to I guess
except<00:00:35.280> respect<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.700> mean<00:00:35.880> it'd<00:00:35.969> be<00:00:36.000> able<00:00:36.149> to

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
except respect I mean it'd be able to

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.369 
except respect I mean it'd be able to
get<00:00:36.329> out<00:00:36.420> but<00:00:37.200> it's<00:00:37.980> gonna<00:00:38.160> have<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.640> take

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
get out but it's gonna have to take

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.130 
get out but it's gonna have to take
because<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.890> sounds<00:00:41.160> cool<00:00:41.399> when<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.760> say<00:00:41.940> it

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
because that sounds cool when you say it

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.279 
because that sounds cool when you say it
so<00:00:43.140> let's<00:00:43.860> build<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.309> right<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:45.230> don't<00:00:46.230> know

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
so let's build it right I don't know

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.720 
so let's build it right I don't know
kind<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.559> want<00:00:46.710> some<00:00:46.800> open<00:00:47.160> land<00:00:47.370> for<00:00:47.610> it
