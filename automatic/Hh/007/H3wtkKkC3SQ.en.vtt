and<00:01:06.510> tons<00:01:06.659> already<00:01:06.900> for<00:01:07.229> about<00:01:07.409> 1k<00:01:07.860> there's

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
and tons already for about 1k there's

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.190 
and tons already for about 1k there's
loads<00:01:08.610> there<00:01:08.939> for<00:01:09.150> 1000<00:01:09.720> coins<00:01:09.840> which<00:01:10.110> you

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
loads there for 1000 coins which you

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.080 
loads there for 1000 coins which you
need<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.439> buy<00:01:10.650> off<00:01:10.860> by<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.400> by<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.549> by<00:01:11.729> and

less than 900 lower I think that was
about<00:01:39.750> 2k<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:41.159> all<00:01:41.549> these<00:01:41.970> Flint<00:01:42.360> chemistry

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
about 2k so all these Flint chemistry

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.480 
about 2k so all these Flint chemistry
