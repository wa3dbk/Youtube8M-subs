00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.400

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.589
 school you know they do not learn anything in 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:26.179
 those courses but good of something already me 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:29.449

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:31.130
 video because it's around the school very 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.760

 an indie game like the limbo I'm leaving 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.320

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.070
 is doomed to failure and wants to do 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.230
 some new good is worth good before the 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.659
 genius for god does not have something like 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.250
 100 years but that game is cool for God 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.300

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.450
