them out of the deck find them take them
out<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:16.920> deck<00:00:17.160> um<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:18.359> then<00:00:18.779> there's<00:00:19.470> two<00:00:19.680> ways

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
out of deck um and then there's two ways

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.939 
out of deck um and then there's two ways
you<00:00:19.890> can<00:00:20.160> do<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.310> trick<00:00:20.810> what<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.930> do<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.470> and

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
you can do this trick what you do is and

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.220 
you can do this trick what you do is and
I<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.369> probably<00:00:23.699> figured<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.150> out<00:00:24.330> but<00:00:24.600> you

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
I you probably figured this out but you

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.179 
I you probably figured this out but you
have<00:00:25.560> three<00:00:26.420> cards<00:00:27.420> like<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.500> any<00:00:28.800> college

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
have three cards like that any college

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.330 
have three cards like that any college
you<00:00:29.220> want<00:00:29.359> and<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.390> bet<00:00:31.349> on<00:00:31.380> top<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.859> here<00:00:32.189> like

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
you want and you bet on top of here like

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.430 
you want and you bet on top of here like
this<00:00:32.610> okay<00:00:35.000> so<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.110> two<00:00:37.260> ways<00:00:37.410> you

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
this okay so so this is the two ways you

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.680 
this okay so so this is the two ways you
can<00:00:37.680> do<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.010> can<00:00:38.040> spread<00:00:38.460> them<00:00:38.670> out<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.570> I

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
can do it you can spread them out and I

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
can do it you can spread them out and I
suck<00:00:40.020> at<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.530> why<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.739> didn't<00:00:40.980> do<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.129> um

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
suck at this is why I didn't do it um

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.889 
suck at this is why I didn't do it um
can<00:00:43.710> spread<00:00:43.980> them<00:00:44.160> out<00:00:44.250> like<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.940> show

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
can spread them out like that and show

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.470 
can spread them out like that and show
like<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.590> four<00:00:46.860> jacks<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.940> then<00:00:48.239> make<00:00:48.450> sure

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
like the four jacks and then make sure

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.840 
like the four jacks and then make sure
but<00:00:48.840> but<00:00:49.379> make<00:00:49.530> sure<00:00:49.559> those<00:00:49.800> cards<00:00:50.399> are<00:00:50.579> behind

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
but but make sure those cards are behind

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.380 
but but make sure those cards are behind
there<00:00:51.149> which<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.809> can't<00:00:52.140> ever<00:00:52.739> do<00:00:53.129> um<00:00:56.059> so<00:00:57.059> just

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
there which I can't ever do um so just

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.680 
there which I can't ever do um so just
do<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.350> then<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:58.770> squared<00:00:59.489> up<00:00:59.690> but

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
do that and then like squared up but

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.540 
do that and then like squared up but
this<00:01:00.809> looks<00:01:01.170> kind<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.469> corny<00:01:01.890> because<00:01:02.250> you
