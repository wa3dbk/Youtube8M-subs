00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.500
 very good to everyone I am grant fox and in 

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:07.650
 this video I'm going to give you a few 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.019
 tips to maximize the super of 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:13.440
 your hunter these tips good 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.360
 for me they are a usual thing I have 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.670
 gone discovering with the passage of time 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.140
 but most of them because they already 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.240
 you will know the people that you play 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.250
 I had usually although I'm going to 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.470
 go up because I have many things that 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.390
 for me although as I say they are usual 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.480
 every time I use them or when 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.369
 I use because there are still people who still 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.839
 today that almost a year has already passed 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.969
 since he left sting and they follow me 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:38.429
 wondering what to do or what why 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.670
 I do these things because we're not going 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:44.070
 you know then are tips that are in 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.589
 the game and if you have not dropped the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.960
 mind you can use them a lot 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.210
 to maximize as I say the super 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.329
 good hunter let's start with the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.920
 acrobat class of the edge and what 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.019
 first thing I have to say is that as 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.539
 You know because it is the super Acrobat 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.280
 edge is quite risky because as 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.049
 you have seen good 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.939
 may the enemies kill us 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.580
 baptize it since we have to attack the 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.670
 body 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.060
 with this super then there is a way to 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.530
 maximize this super since as you see 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.030
 for certain enemies although the 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.200
 attack we have body body although 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.240
 we will attack them body to body 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.670
 Well, it's going to be pretty 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.090
 dangerous to kill them then let's 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.980
 begin the way to maximize in the 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.950
 effects is where it's super and that's 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.080
 is super in a not only good for 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.690
 kill but with this super good 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.470
 We can do other things like 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.110
 example 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.820
 save our lives because we are in the 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.590
 enemies and becoming invisible 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.190
 in front of them something that everyone will know 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.720
 there is an option to disappear then 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.220
 it's called fade a skill that 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.140
 it's called fade and that's good 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.610
 can save our lives and that of 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.550
 our colleagues if we want to stay 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.750
 resuscitate them in some case and in others 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.420
 as well 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.400
 and not only can we fade 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.350
 with the super but you already know then with 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.630
 the slash 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.940
 is super can also serve us well 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.420
 Well, to flee from enemies when 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.280
 we're in trouble jumping in because the 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.360
 attacks the body body is super by 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.370
 they are pretty fast 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.830
 As you can see, it can also serve us 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.050
 to hear things that are basic and that I 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.420
 I imagine that you will all know one thing that 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.670
 not people know and these people this is 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.410
 they are things that ask me 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.140
 good is that it is super can serve us 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.790
 to jump and well I miss you when 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.490
 People tell me where I'm going 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.080
 in the glass chamber or how it happened 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.240
 with the project hunter the hunter is 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.070
 difficult so good to pass this on 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.810
 the jumps with the hunter is the most 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.810
 easy of the world because as you see then 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.320
 well let's use the super for 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.000
 get to the end of the stairs and 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.250
 as you see the only thing we have to do 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.890
 is to throw ourselves into the void and use the super 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.840
 in the air and in with the super only 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.120
 using the super well let's get there 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.010
 until the end this is one thing that I 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.390
 I've been doing it since the first 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.340
 glass camera of the game I think 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.420
 I hope good people and many times 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.130
 that you do not realize and I still 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.560
 ask where am I going crazy that I'm going to 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.390
 kill pulling towards the vacuum then good 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.580
 this is one thing that if you have not fallen 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.590
 Well, there you have it other than 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.600
 does not fall people is that we can 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.880
 use the edge of the knife 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.710
 Elvis in the two special abilities 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.210
 for example in the pressure of 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.650
 Elders prevent enemies from leaving 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:30.320
 because on the edge that we send the surge 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.600
 of energy that we send in the way 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.190
 the soil and can not go through 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.770
 I answer where the enemies come out that 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.690
 as you see then in not letting or leaving 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.160
 the enemies then with them more 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.950
 we imitate the effects of the super of 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.870
 hunter because in addition to that we do not put 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.610
 in danger our life as you see then 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.650
 we are going to generate enough orbs of light 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.320
 because it's super good because they generate 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.540
 few orbs of light and also because always 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.400
 we will be stabbed in order to 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.280
 when we run out of super good 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.530
 in leaving and then the enemy that 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.180
 come when we ran out of the super that 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.310
 do not kill us as you are seeing we give 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.510
 the stab and we go if we want if 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.670
 not that it kills us 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.590
 your lesson but we have the 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.660
 stab even for when we were 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.480
 ends the super on the other hand and in 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.760
 how much class the gunslinger so good 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.980
 with certain helmets we can increase 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.950
 the distance the super but she gave me 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.639
 it does not happen only in the pv is I think that 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.650
 also in multiplayer like this 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.620
 we can change at a certain moment the 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.659
 helmet and get with the super and with the 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.449
 Arachnid helmet to certain trades 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:35.699
 where otherwise with the super well no 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:38.219
 we would arrive in which then we can 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.870
 give quite an advantage over the 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:43.469
 enemies as you have seen there for 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.539
 prevent them from stealing in what they catch the 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:48.479
 heavy ammunition that would correspond to your 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.830
 team or what in this case then 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.539
 we will use but it is one thing 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.900
 we can use not only in the kid 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:57.270
 but also the pvp on the other hand and a 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.490
 thing that there are people who do not know is that 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:03.689
 we can also maximize the effects of 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:06.689
 this super gunman using 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:08.459
 the sting of crisis because as you have 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:09.689
 seen if we use the super with the 

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:11.969
 pri bite that if we do 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:14.549
 invisible with the shot of the 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:17.610
 super let's poison the enemies 

00:05:14.549 --> 00:05:19.679
 that only poisons some shot 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.169
 with what is a stupid shoot three 

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:24.479
 times so we could also 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.889
 maximize the effects of this super is 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.629
 always shooting with a helmet 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.319
 anyone or put the case of four 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:30.419
 shots 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:32.519
 we have the celestial hawk helmet that 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.779
 as you already know, multiply in our 

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:35.369
 super 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:38.369
 we only have one trigger to super but 

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:40.229
 that shot is multiplied by six 

00:05:38.369 --> 00:05:42.389
 with which in addition to removing six 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:45.389
 times more than life we ​​will poison the 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:48.300
 enemy with the final shot of the super 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.679
 and nothing those are the tips that you 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.319
 I can give so that we maximize your 

00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:53.599
 surpass you already know that in each game 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:55.649
 Well, it's going to be a different thing 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:59.039
 It will depend on if you are in multiplayer 

00:05:55.649 --> 00:06:00.809
 of if it is always but they are advice that 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:03.059
 If you did not know then you can apply 

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:04.019
 so that you may find it a bit more 

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:05.969
 simple 

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:08.159
 spend certain things like for example 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:09.990
 the highs of the glass bed so that 

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:12.540
 inflict the greatest damage 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.760
 of possible damage to enemies and nothing 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.280
 that 's all I hope you liked 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.810
