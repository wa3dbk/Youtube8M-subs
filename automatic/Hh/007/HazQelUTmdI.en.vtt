00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:13.460
 Only the ability and expression to repaint the potential of digital cameras 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:17.080
 We aimed to show the power to the limit 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.080
 64 after system 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.690
 And now 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.690
 A new legend is born 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.310
 Get off here 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:40.079
 The large sensor receives an overwhelming amount of information likely to be input from the large aperture lens 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.540
 Toei expressed there 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.190
 Resolution 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.940
 Color depth 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.940
 sense of unity 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:58.090
 And from that shooting new field 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.090
 To a wider professional area 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:09.440
 di by Pentax 645 z 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:11.940
 The large sensor that the 64 z also carries is a 35 mm full size sensor 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:18.530
 If double area 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:24.200
 Ample imaging area achieves a sense of unity with overwhelming resolution 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:27.400
 The resolution of about 51.4 million pixels is a quality of 300 dpi 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:34.420
 To enable the output of the peak two-class 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:35.470
 Also au is linked to -1 ev in TairaAkiratoshi such as night-time field Auto 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.890
 The focus is 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.790
 Follow up to -3 ev 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:47.159
 Resolution and noise immunity 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:51.829
 The potential of 64 unique systems that balance these two in high dimensions 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.829
 Maximize the perfection of the work 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:01.170
 Even for active shooting such as shooting people in the studio 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:08.069
 645 z performs well 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:12.860
 Shooting without taking an angle on the tilt rear LCD monitor or continuous shooting of approximately 3 ryokans 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:19.160
 Enables shooting without losing the sense of speed such as quick view 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:25.490
 In addition , high speed pc cooperation via usb 3.0 with image transmitter 2 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:28.360
 Professional functions such as shooting and remote shooting using the full card wireless lan function 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.360
 Are substantial 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:43.519
 Dustproof and drip-proof magnesium alloy body for all environments 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:43.519
 -You can take pictures safely without worrying about the change by guaranteeing the 10 degree cold resistance operation 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:55.220
 Even full hd movie shooting 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:58.930
 This camera supports various shooting modes such as 49 interval video shooting 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:02.129
 Naturally they are the studio field 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.129
 The shooting location 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:19.270
 pentax 645 z 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.270
 Before a new legend begins
