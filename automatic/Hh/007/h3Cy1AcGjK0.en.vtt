00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
so in three more USB ports in the back

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.480 
so in three more USB ports in the back
405<00:02:32.640> also<00:02:33.640> an<00:02:33.730> HDMI<00:02:34.210> here<00:02:35.010> optical<00:02:36.010> audio<00:02:36.130> is

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
405 also an HDMI here optical audio is

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.900 
405 also an HDMI here optical audio is
integrated<00:02:37.060> over<00:02:37.860> this<00:02:38.860> way<00:02:39.070> we<00:02:39.280> get<00:02:39.400> ethernet

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
integrated over this way we get ethernet

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.730 
integrated over this way we get ethernet
hub<00:02:40.090> of<00:02:40.300> course<00:02:40.540> through<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.780> 8th<00:02:40.930> route<00:02:41.170> 11<00:02:41.560> n

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
hub of course through the 8th route 11 n

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.050 
hub of course through the 8th route 11 n
built<00:02:42.040> in<00:02:42.220> as<00:02:42.340> well<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:44.310> then<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.520> AV<00:02:45.940> block

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
built in as well and then the AV block

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.570 
built in as well and then the AV block
out<00:02:46.390> this<00:02:47.050> is<00:02:47.200> a<00:02:47.290> new<00:02:47.470> power<00:02:47.980> connector

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
out this is a new power connector

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.460 
out this is a new power connector
compared<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.600> current<00:02:49.750> one<00:02:49.990> which<00:02:50.230> we've

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
compared to the current one which we've

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.310 
compared to the current one which we've
got<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.860> have<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.250> male<00:02:51.550> end<00:02:51.760> on<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.030> center

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.960 

and<00:02:56.320> then<00:02:56.680> somewhere<00:02:57.040> out<00:02:57.220> here<00:02:57.250> this<00:02:57.640> new

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
and then somewhere out here this new

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.010 
and then somewhere out here this new
hard<00:02:58.210> drive<00:03:01.440> there's<00:03:02.440> always<00:03:02.980> removing<00:03:03.730> 400

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
hard drive there's always removing 400

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:14.310 
hard drive there's always removing 400
it's<00:03:05.020> hard<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.200> do<00:03:05.350> elegantly<00:03:12.900> now<00:03:13.900> we<00:03:13.960> see

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
it's hard to do elegantly now we see

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.490 
it's hard to do elegantly now we see
there's<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.820> 250<00:03:15.820> gigabyte<00:03:16.030> label<00:03:16.570> on<00:03:16.690> it<00:03:19.500> and

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
there's a 250 gigabyte label on it and

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.570 
there's a 250 gigabyte label on it and
then<00:03:20.740> I<00:03:21.010> can<00:03:21.280> just

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.460 

how<00:03:26.090> do<00:03:26.150> you<00:03:26.240> build<00:03:26.360> that<00:03:26.510> tension<00:03:26.750> gaming

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
how do you build that tension gaming

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.170 
how do you build that tension gaming
system<00:03:27.830> so<00:03:28.790> if<00:03:28.850> you<00:03:28.910> have<00:03:29.000> an<00:03:29.090> existing

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
system so if you have an existing

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.440 
system so if you have an existing
comfortable<00:03:29.990> it's<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.070> same<00:03:31.340> data<00:03:32.060> transfer

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
comfortable it's the same data transfer

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.000 
comfortable it's the same data transfer
process<00:03:32.810> that<00:03:32.930> we<00:03:33.020> have<00:03:33.140> today<00:03:33.290> actually<00:03:33.500> so

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
process that we have today actually so

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.200 
process that we have today actually so
you<00:03:34.640> can<00:03:34.820> use<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.860> which<00:03:36.860> we<00:03:37.100> are<00:03:37.460> actually

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
you can use the which we are actually

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.180 
you can use the which we are actually
going<00:03:38.450> to<00:03:38.540> make<00:03:38.690> a<00:03:38.720> resale<00:03:39.260> product<00:03:39.620> so<00:03:40.100> you

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
going to make a resale product so you

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.780 
going to make a resale product so you
can<00:03:40.340> now<00:03:40.400> buy<00:03:40.820> that<00:03:41.000> for<00:03:41.180> 1995<00:03:41.750> in<00:03:42.710> the<00:03:42.800> US<00:03:43.070> you

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
can now buy that for 1995 in the US you

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.760 
can now buy that for 1995 in the US you
can<00:03:43.850> also<00:03:44.060> do<00:03:44.330> transfer<00:03:45.260> me<00:03:45.350> a<00:03:45.380> USB<00:03:45.740> thumb

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
can also do transfer me a USB thumb

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.460 
can also do transfer me a USB thumb
drive<00:03:46.130> so<00:03:46.610> we<00:03:46.790> enabled<00:03:46.970> that<00:03:47.270> a<00:03:47.570> month<00:03:48.200> or<00:03:48.320> so

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
drive so we enabled that a month or so

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.670 
drive so we enabled that a month or so
ago<00:03:48.500> that<00:03:49.280> you<00:03:49.760> can<00:03:49.910> change<00:03:50.090> up<00:03:50.990> to<00:03:51.110> 16<00:03:51.500> big

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
ago that you can change up to 16 big

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.130 
ago that you can change up to 16 big

you<00:03:59.900> can<00:03:59.930> redownload<00:04:00.350> that<00:04:01.510> okay<00:04:02.510> a<00:04:02.750> speed

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
you can redownload that okay a speed

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.100 
you can redownload that okay a speed
changes<00:04:04.430> to<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:04.790> drivers<00:04:05.270> are<00:04:05.390> just<00:04:05.600> larger

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
changes to the drivers are just larger

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.020 
changes to the drivers are just larger
than<00:04:06.410> optimizations<00:04:07.280> you<00:04:07.400> guys<00:04:07.610> have<00:04:07.790> done<00:04:08.000> a

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
than optimizations you guys have done a

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.130 
than optimizations you guys have done a
part<00:04:08.510> but<00:04:10.120> that<00:04:11.120> might<00:04:11.300> actually<00:04:11.450> improve<00:04:11.959> my

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
part but that might actually improve my

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.440 
part but that might actually improve my
game<00:04:12.320> 1<00:04:12.590> times<00:04:12.830> right<00:04:13.070> now<00:04:13.550> so<00:04:13.790> performance

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
game 1 times right now so performance

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
this is composite so we've got a

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:02.360 
this is composite so we've got a
definition<00:04:55.680> of<00:04:55.770> the<00:04:55.920> box<00:04:56.130> so<00:04:56.970> far<00:05:01.010> we<00:05:02.010> have<00:05:02.040> an

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
I believe it is a shiny the different

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.040 
I believe it is a shiny the different
the<00:05:32.060> admission<00:05:32.539> that<00:05:32.569> they<00:05:32.780> made<00:05:33.020> the

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
the admission that they made the

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.230 
the admission that they made the
Explorer<00:05:33.650> match<00:05:34.069> the<00:05:34.370> new<00:05:34.520> console<00:05:35.030> that

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
Explorer match the new console that

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:47.649 
Explorer match the new console that
could<00:05:35.419> be<00:05:35.979> hit<00:05:36.979> by<00:05:37.159> renaud<00:05:37.520> humming<00:05:38.270> I'm<00:05:46.659> gonna

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:47.659 
could be hit by renaud humming I'm gonna

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:51.279 
could be hit by renaud humming I'm gonna
bury<00:05:47.960> it<00:05:48.650> does<00:05:48.919> have<00:05:49.669> batteries<00:05:50.090> so<00:05:51.020> there's

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
bury it does have batteries so there's

00:05:51.289 --> 00:06:01.320 
bury it does have batteries so there's
nothing<00:05:52.129> noise

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330
