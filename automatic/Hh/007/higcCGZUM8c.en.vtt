good looking heat map here the gap rige
32%<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.870> your<00:00:36.989> runs<00:00:37.200> at<00:00:38.190> 5<00:00:38.550> yards<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.180> Miller

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
32% of your runs at 5 yards and Miller

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.959 
32% of your runs at 5 yards and Miller
is<00:00:39.809> way<00:00:40.170> higher<00:00:40.440> than<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.860> McCoy<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.640> 1%

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
is way higher than that McCoy is 1%

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.889 
is way higher than that McCoy is 1%
higher<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.079> 33<00:00:43.969> just<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.030> bet<00:00:45.180> one<00:00:45.420> column

was McCoy wasn't impressive in 2014 in
2013<00:01:16.740> he<00:01:16.860> might<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.100> been<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.490> top<00:01:17.700> one<00:01:17.939> or

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
2013 he might have been the top one or

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.390 
2013 he might have been the top one or
two<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.659> like<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.259> some<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.799> these<00:01:19.979> advanced

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
two in like in some of these advanced

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.270 
two in like in some of these advanced
metrics<00:01:20.700> really<00:01:21.119> there<00:01:21.540> was<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> drop<00:01:22.710> off<00:01:22.979> and

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
metrics really there was a drop off and

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.179 
metrics really there was a drop off and
you<00:01:23.820> know<00:01:23.939> what<00:01:24.270> whether<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.810> was<00:01:25.189> mileage

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
you know what whether that was mileage

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.370 
you know what whether that was mileage
and<00:01:26.640> something<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.479> alarmed<00:01:27.810> about<00:01:27.900> or

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
and something to be alarmed about or

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.649 
and something to be alarmed about or
just<00:01:28.970> it'll<00:01:29.970> an<00:01:30.150> anomaly<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.659> some<00:01:30.869> kind

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
just it'll an anomaly of some kind

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.349 
just it'll an anomaly of some kind
you<00:01:32.649> know<00:01:32.710> I<00:01:32.829> guess<00:01:33.009> that's<00:01:33.369> TBD<00:01:33.729> you<00:01:34.240> know

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:34.359 
you know I guess that's TBD you know

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.029 
you know I guess that's TBD you know
like<00:01:34.539> what<00:01:34.780> well<00:01:35.229> I<00:01:35.259> still<00:01:35.560> find<00:01:35.740> out<00:01:35.920> this
