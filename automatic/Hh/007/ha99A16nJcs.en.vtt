00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
we put that back in there because the

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.260 
we put that back in there because the
King<00:01:03.720> James<00:01:03.930> editors<00:01:04.500> added<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.550> to<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
King James editors added that to the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.910 
King James editors added that to the
lower<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.900> they<00:01:07.200> should<00:01:07.409> have<00:01:07.500> never<00:01:07.620> done

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
lower and they should have never done

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.500 
lower and they should have never done
that<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.490> we<00:01:08.670> just<00:01:08.850> do<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.150> out<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.360> respect

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
that so we just do that out of respect

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.140 
that so we just do that out of respect
the<00:01:10.380> same<00:01:10.650> thing<00:01:10.890> applies<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.280> yahushua

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
the same thing applies to yahushua

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.870 
the same thing applies to yahushua
instead<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.140> saying<00:01:13.320> Jesus<00:01:13.830> we<00:01:14.040> say<00:01:14.250> yahushua

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
instead of saying Jesus we say yahushua

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.690 
instead of saying Jesus we say yahushua
because<00:01:15.360> he<00:01:15.870> came<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.260> his<00:01:16.380> father's<00:01:16.770> name<00:01:17.010> yah

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
because he came in his father's name yah

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.930 
because he came in his father's name yah
his<00:01:18.180> salvation<00:01:18.930> that's<00:01:19.110> what<00:01:19.380> his<00:01:19.530> name<00:01:19.770> me<00:01:20.040> so

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
his salvation that's what his name me so

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.859 
his salvation that's what his name me so
and<00:01:21.240> Elohim<00:01:21.720> means<00:01:22.229> God<00:01:22.710> or<00:01:23.220> oh<00:01:23.520> my<00:01:23.940> so<00:01:24.720> that's

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
and Elohim means God or oh my so that's

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.930 
and Elohim means God or oh my so that's
why<00:01:25.049> we<00:01:25.229> put<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.560> back<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:26.010> the<00:01:26.130> scripture

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940
