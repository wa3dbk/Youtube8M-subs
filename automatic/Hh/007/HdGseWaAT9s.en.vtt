don't<00:00:28.529> like<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:29.039> know<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.369> minute<00:00:29.609> or<00:00:29.730> two<00:00:29.880> and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
don't like you know a minute or two and

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.730 
don't like you know a minute or two and
sometimes<00:00:30.449> it'll<00:00:30.900> be<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> little<00:00:31.230> bit<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.650> little

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
sometimes it'll be a little bit a little

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.770 
sometimes it'll be a little bit a little
bit<00:00:31.949> longer<00:00:32.160> than<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:33.300> has<00:00:33.420> been<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
bit longer than that it has been in the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.920 
bit longer than that it has been in the
past<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:35.120> there's<00:00:36.120> just<00:00:36.329> something<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.780> keep

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
past so there's just something to keep
