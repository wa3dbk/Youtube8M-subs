especially going with this kind of card
good<00:01:28.650> look<00:01:28.860> at<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.869> business<00:01:30.869> side<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
good look at the business side of the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:41.929 
good look at the business side of the
scale<00:01:38.990> in<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.140> card<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.740> monster<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.640> terms

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
of size to begin with so he definitely

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.149 
of size to begin with so he definitely
would<00:01:45.810> benefit<00:01:46.290> from<00:01:46.350> using<00:01:46.680> one<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.009> these

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
would benefit from using one of these

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:55.460 
would benefit from using one of these
back<00:01:47.490> plates<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.560> looks<00:01:49.560> good<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:54.140> four<00:01:55.140> back
