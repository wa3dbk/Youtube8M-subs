plant these now the easiest way to plant

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.570 
plant these now the easiest way to plant
these<00:01:13.210> is<00:01:14.210> all<00:01:15.049> you<00:01:15.200> need<00:01:15.380> to<00:01:15.530> do<00:01:15.709> is<00:01:16.009> rag<00:01:16.250> a<00:01:16.280> hoe

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
these is all you need to do is rag a hoe

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.120 
these is all you need to do is rag a hoe
or<00:01:16.940> other<00:01:17.390> implement<00:01:18.020> down<00:01:18.200> through<00:01:18.649> to<00:01:18.950> make

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
or other implement down through to make

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.370 
or other implement down through to make
that<00:01:19.310> two<00:01:19.520> inch<00:01:19.729> trench<00:01:20.119> and<00:01:20.420> pull<00:01:20.959> the<00:01:21.110> soil

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
that two inch trench and pull the soil

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.419 
that two inch trench and pull the soil
back<00:01:23.170> because<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.350> root<00:01:24.530> systems<00:01:25.069> on<00:01:25.280> these

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:25.429 
back because the root systems on these

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:27.999 
back because the root systems on these
plants<00:01:25.940> are<00:01:26.060> so<00:01:26.360> beautiful<00:01:27.289> and<00:01:27.380> enormous

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
plants are so beautiful and enormous

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.149 
plants are so beautiful and enormous
that<00:01:28.729> we're<00:01:28.970> going<00:01:29.119> to<00:01:29.209> need<00:01:29.799> the<00:01:30.799> entire

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
that we're going to need the entire

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.870 
that we're going to need the entire
space<00:01:31.640> from<00:01:32.030> plant<00:01:32.299> to<00:01:32.450> plant

space from plant to plant

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.730 
space from plant to plant
now<00:01:34.880> we<00:01:34.939> recommend<00:01:35.720> that<00:01:35.929> these<00:01:36.110> plants<00:01:36.500> be

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
now we recommend that these plants be

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.719 
now we recommend that these plants be
planted<00:01:38.200> approximately<00:01:39.200> a<00:01:42.369> foot<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:43.519> a<00:01:43.550> half

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
planted approximately a foot and a half

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.369 
planted approximately a foot and a half
apart<00:01:44.440> so<00:01:45.440> as<00:01:45.619> we<00:01:45.830> lay<00:01:46.069> in<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:47.420> first<00:01:47.690> root<00:01:48.110> of

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:48.379 
apart so as we lay in the first root of

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:53.770 
apart so as we lay in the first root of
the<00:01:48.709> first<00:01:48.890> plant<00:01:51.220> we<00:01:52.220> have<00:01:52.250> that<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:53.000> then<00:01:53.149> we

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
the first plant we have that and then we

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.309 
the first plant we have that and then we
we<00:01:54.500> push<00:01:54.830> this<00:01:55.099> down<00:01:55.539> so<00:01:56.539> that<00:01:56.569> we'll<00:01:56.869> have<00:01:56.899> all

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
we push this down so that we'll have all

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.969 
we push this down so that we'll have all
the<00:01:57.769> roots<00:01:57.950> covered<00:01:58.519> on<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:59.420> cane<00:01:59.690> and<00:02:00.050> then

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
the roots covered on the cane and then

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.589 
the roots covered on the cane and then
we<00:02:01.160> have<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.550> majority<00:02:02.149> of<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.539> feeder<00:02:02.989> roots

00:02:04.589 --> 00:02:04.599 
we have the majority of the feeder roots

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:07.149 
we have the majority of the feeder roots
covered<00:02:05.599> with<00:02:05.750> two<00:02:05.899> inches<00:02:06.259> of<00:02:06.409> soil<00:02:06.679> and<00:02:07.009> a

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
foot and a half to two foot spacing the

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.369 
foot and a half to two foot spacing the
roots<00:02:09.709> will<00:02:09.920> be<00:02:10.069> almost<00:02:10.280> touching<00:02:10.909> each<00:02:11.030> other

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
roots will be almost touching each other

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:13.780 
roots will be almost touching each other
and<00:02:12.379> we<00:02:12.560> push<00:02:12.769> this<00:02:12.980> down<00:02:13.190> just<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.610> wee<00:02:13.760> bit

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
and we push this down just a wee bit

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.180 
and we push this down just a wee bit
cover<00:02:14.780> it<00:02:14.989> up<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.379> then<00:02:15.769> we<00:02:15.890> have<00:02:16.040> the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
cover it up and then we have the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.490 
cover it up and then we have the
majority<00:02:16.610> of<00:02:16.879> the<00:02:17.000> roots<00:02:17.360> at<00:02:17.659> this<00:02:18.019> two<00:02:18.260> inch

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
majority of the roots at this two inch

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.449
