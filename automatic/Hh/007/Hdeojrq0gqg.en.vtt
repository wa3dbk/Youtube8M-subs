00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:08.220
 Means comment previous video 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:11.250
 the first launch of the VAZ 2105 on the injector 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:16.890
 order to remake the belt engine 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:19.260
 0 5 here the injector had to make two 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.840
 such non-standard parts sensor 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.660
 crankshaft position and lateral tee 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.660
 coolant from the bench unit 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.769
 crankshaft position sensor bracket 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.540
 it is generally not under 5 loops nature 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.250
 exists 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.010
 as for the tee coolant outlet 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.350
 liquids had to be made exactly like that 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.120
 same as there was but you mill to cook 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:49.140
 Well, the only add tide nut 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.010
 for fixing the temperature sensor 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.010
 coolant 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.640
 brackets 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.550
 as far as I can see but then 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.350
 I'll take off I'll show you another bracket 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.689
 made so to say from henchmen 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.220
 of materials 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:12.420
 installed and basically a car on it 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.750
 worked here but the car worked spun 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.350
 motor to about five and a half 6000 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.700
 more spin could not throwing out the error 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.310
 crankshaft position sensor 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.490
 Well, as it turned out later it was 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.150
 because of the large gap between the reference 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.329
 disk and the sensor itself now I will show 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.689
 what's the gap now try 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.790
 probes to fill but I would just like 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:47.100
 Iâ€™ll just demonstrate this case 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:50.070
 to go pretty tight here we look 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.130
 what is it here we have 3 probes place folded 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:57.380
 04 08 09 in total it will be 2 1 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:01.440
 millimeter i mean it's a lot because 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.660
 Well, since AvtoVAZ recommends the case 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.940
 here 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.619
 there 05 if I'm not mistaken millimeter gap 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.050
 or something like that or 07 but we will try 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.790
 remake a little bit and care 07 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.360
 millimeter that's because on large 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.440
 revs 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.870
 well the sensor turns out well 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.840
 receives an odd fuzzy signal 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.150
 miss the teeth and as a result the error 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.020
 crankshaft position sensor and proper 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.110
 resulting phase sensor error 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.040
 now the actual bracket itself is noise and 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.270
 all represent 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.250
 This is such a curly detail of this 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:46.080
 aluminum corner here is the thickness 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:50.670
 four get election piece povalko 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:55.250
 cut off drilled hole by himself 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:59.610
 sensor under the body of the hole under 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:02.930
 under the bolt that will fix here we are 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:07.200
 here it is attached like this 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.540
 it means this is a plate 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.870
 millimeter on which is all 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.470
 secured to fastened like this 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.290
 it turns out to the end of the engine bolts 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:26.010
 attaching plastic protection 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:28.650
 timing belt means the question often arises 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.300
 actually I had this question like 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.090
 place it correctly, that is, as 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.310
 calculate that's all it turned out 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:40.769
 quite simple on plastic covers 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:43.320
 belt have tags one of them denotes 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.810
 0 degrees wmt 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:51.000
 I mean the top dead. first 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:54.510
 cylinder actually this one sensor 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.350
 must stand for this 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:03.200
 the label is here 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:07.260
 risk on this such on the paint here I 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.319
 screwed the plate here put this risk 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.670
 put a ruler there 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:15.950
 well, and then placed accordingly 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.739
 Well, I tried this detail 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.630
 stand the distance 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.169
 necessary for this, well, we saw 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.479
 a little per millimeter did not guess here 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.900
 and it is now planning to do it all on 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.699
 I think everything will be fine, that's basically 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.099
 in principle, it was probably more logical 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:37.930
 would move it a couple of millimeters a 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:41.320
 then puck there or push something away 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:45.830
 sensor back 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.330
 Well, that is to have some 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.669
 the ability to customize it more 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:05:00.470
 correctly as rebuilt bracket 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:05:06.729
 try now probe gap 066 we do not 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:06.729
 it comes in but about 05 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.320
 that is, we gap now on 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:27.800
 millimeter that now collect the tip 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:27.800
 I will try to have a great yes from us 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:19.660
 Well, that's basically 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:22.199
 twist to fairly high rpm 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.199
 no problem
