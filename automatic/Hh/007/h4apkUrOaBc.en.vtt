it but either way those will need to get
pushed<00:01:31.040> back<00:01:31.130> in<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:32.090> bumper<00:01:32.420> itself<00:01:32.720> though

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
pushed back in the bumper itself though

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.630 
pushed back in the bumper itself though
is<00:01:33.170> still<00:01:33.380> pretty<00:01:33.560> straited<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.250> skin<00:01:34.520> over

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
itself is still solid as a rock so

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.179 
itself is still solid as a rock so
that's<00:01:39.200> good<00:01:40.930> front<00:01:41.930> core<00:01:42.170> support<00:01:42.619> here<00:01:43.009> has

that's good front core support here has

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.730 
that's good front core support here has
been<00:01:43.430> pushed<00:01:43.700> in<00:01:43.939> so<00:01:44.180> that<00:01:44.930> only<00:01:45.350> had<00:01:45.530> pulled

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
still there I haven't try starting it up

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.960 
still there I haven't try starting it up
since<00:01:51.380> it's<00:01:51.590> been<00:01:51.740> sitting<00:01:52.100> all<00:01:52.310> winter<00:01:52.369> but

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
since it's been sitting all winter but

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.600 
since it's been sitting all winter but
it<00:01:53.119> was<00:01:53.329> covered<00:01:53.570> up<00:01:53.899> and<00:01:54.220> winterize<00:01:55.220> so

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
it was covered up and winterize so

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.620

it<00:02:56.660> was<00:02:56.840> when<00:02:57.020> I<00:02:57.080> started<00:02:57.560> so<00:02:57.830> that's<00:02:58.610> a<00:02:58.760> good

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
it was when I started so that's a good

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.400 
it was when I started so that's a good
sign<00:02:59.150> hopefully<00:02:59.450> I<00:02:59.630> can<00:02:59.750> get<00:02:59.870> it<00:02:59.990> pulled<00:03:00.200> up

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
sign hopefully I can get it pulled up

other side here and get it all tucking
in<00:03:04.190> real<00:03:04.400> nice<00:03:04.610> I'm<00:03:05.510> also<00:03:05.720> going<00:03:05.930> to<00:03:06.020> turn<00:03:06.230> the

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
in real nice I'm also going to turn the

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.700 
in real nice I'm also going to turn the
trunk<00:03:07.640> inside<00:03:08.030> out<00:03:08.210> as<00:03:08.420> per<00:03:08.930> our<00:03:09.140> rules<00:03:09.440> we

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
trunk inside out as per our rules we

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.620 
trunk inside out as per our rules we
weren't<00:03:09.920> allowed<00:03:10.190> to<00:03:10.220> do<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:10.820> valley<00:03:11.180> in<00:03:11.360> the

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
weren't allowed to do a valley in the

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.490 
weren't allowed to do a valley in the
middle<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:13.340> so<00:03:13.970> that's<00:03:14.420> why<00:03:14.660> it<00:03:14.720> was<00:03:14.960> left

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
middle and so that's why it was left

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.270 
middle and so that's why it was left
stock<00:03:16.750> formation<00:03:17.750> as<00:03:18.020> you<00:03:18.200> can<00:03:18.470> see<00:03:18.680> how<00:03:19.100> it<00:03:19.220> is

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
stock formation as you can see how it is

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.520

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
now but now that it's pre run I can get

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.620 
now but now that it's pre run I can get
away<00:03:21.620> with<00:03:21.920> doing<00:03:21.950> a<00:03:22.280> V<00:03:22.460> so<00:03:23.150> that's<00:03:23.450> what<00:03:23.600> I

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
away with doing a V so that's what I

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.600 
away with doing a V so that's what I

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
is starting to kink a little bit right

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.240

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.120 
behind the past where the passenger seat
would<00:03:40.400> be<00:03:40.870> so<00:03:41.870> that's<00:03:42.350> going<00:03:42.590> to<00:03:42.680> be<00:03:42.800> an<00:03:42.890> item

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
would be so that's going to be an item

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.460 
would be so that's going to be an item
of<00:03:43.250> concern<00:03:43.640> to<00:03:43.670> try<00:03:44.060> to<00:03:44.120> address<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:45.320> see

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
of concern to try to address and see

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.740 
of concern to try to address and see
what<00:03:45.590> we<00:03:45.680> can<00:03:45.830> do<00:03:45.950> to<00:03:46.100> keep<00:03:46.340> that<00:03:46.580> from

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
what we can do to keep that from

continuing the body panel there has been
pushed<00:03:50.330> in<00:03:50.510> quite<00:03:50.750> a<00:03:50.780> bit<00:03:51.050> so<00:03:51.320> it<00:03:51.410> looks<00:03:51.590> a

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
pushed in quite a bit so it looks a

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.940 
pushed in quite a bit so it looks a
little<00:03:51.830> more<00:03:52.070> drastic<00:03:52.610> than<00:03:52.640> it<00:03:52.910> actually<00:03:53.060> is

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
little more drastic than it actually is

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.670 
little more drastic than it actually is
and<00:03:55.330> overall<00:03:56.330> this<00:03:56.360> car<00:03:56.870> fared<00:03:57.290> pretty<00:03:57.500> well

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
and overall this car fared pretty well

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.380 
and overall this car fared pretty well
as<00:03:58.100> a<00:03:58.630> some<00:03:59.630> of<00:03:59.750> you<00:03:59.810> guys<00:03:59.959> remember<00:04:00.530> I<00:04:00.950> did<00:04:01.910> we

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
as a some of you guys remember I did we

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.970 
as a some of you guys remember I did we
do<00:04:02.510> have<00:04:02.660> video<00:04:02.780> of<00:04:02.990> this<00:04:03.260> running<00:04:03.740> in<00:04:03.860> the

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
do have video of this running in the

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.400 
do have video of this running in the
heat<00:04:04.190> and<00:04:04.660> unfortunately<00:04:05.660> right<00:04:06.020> after<00:04:06.350> I

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
heat and unfortunately right after I

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.980 
heat and unfortunately right after I
drove<00:04:06.709> out<00:04:06.920> on<00:04:07.100> the<00:04:07.220> track<00:04:07.520> I<00:04:07.850> almost<00:04:08.390> entirely

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
drove out on the track I almost entirely

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.560 
drove out on the track I almost entirely
lost<00:04:09.410> drive<00:04:10.250> any<00:04:11.240> forward<00:04:11.750> years<00:04:12.050> I<00:04:12.260> tried

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
lost drive any forward years I tried

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.020 
lost drive any forward years I tried
just<00:04:14.570> regular<00:04:14.990> drive<00:04:15.320> one<00:04:15.770> two<00:04:16.070> and<00:04:16.459> three<00:04:17.000> and

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
just regular drive one two and three and

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.190 
just regular drive one two and three and
nothing<00:04:17.630> was<00:04:18.260> working<00:04:19.359> ok<00:04:20.359> i<00:04:20.390> found<00:04:20.750> it<00:04:20.930> twice

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
nothing was working ok i found it twice

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.860 
nothing was working ok i found it twice
i<00:04:21.410> did<00:04:21.560> find<00:04:21.830> drive<00:04:22.190> twice<00:04:22.520> but<00:04:23.510> for<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:23.720> most

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
i did find drive twice but for the most

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.600 
i did find drive twice but for the most
part<00:04:23.990> it<00:04:24.290> would<00:04:24.350> not<00:04:24.560> engage<00:04:24.710> it<00:04:25.070> all<00:04:25.220> all<00:04:25.490> the

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
part it would not engage it all all the

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.640 
part it would not engage it all all the
head<00:04:25.760> was<00:04:25.940> reversed<00:04:26.360> so<00:04:26.660> i<00:04:26.690> could<00:04:27.050> only<00:04:27.080> do<00:04:27.440> so

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
head was reversed so i could only do so

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.330 
head was reversed so i could only do so
much<00:04:28.660> so<00:04:29.660> either<00:04:29.930> back<00:04:30.260> up<00:04:30.500> hit<00:04:30.710> someone<00:04:31.130> wait

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
much so either back up hit someone wait

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.550 
much so either back up hit someone wait
for<00:04:31.729> a<00:04:32.060> couple<00:04:32.479> good<00:04:32.600> hits<00:04:32.780> to<00:04:33.080> turn<00:04:33.260> me<00:04:33.440> around

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
for a couple good hits to turn me around

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.290 
for a couple good hits to turn me around
and<00:04:33.919> then<00:04:33.979> I'd

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
and then I'd

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.909 
and then I'd
go<00:04:34.360> and<00:04:34.539> do<00:04:34.629> it<00:04:34.750> again<00:04:34.840> so<00:04:35.289> that's<00:04:35.379> pretty<00:04:35.710> much

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
go and do it again so that's pretty much

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.640 
go and do it again so that's pretty much
why<00:04:36.909> you<00:04:37.720> know<00:04:37.810> there's<00:04:38.050> times<00:04:38.319> when<00:04:38.500> I<00:04:38.560> would

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
why you know there's times when I would

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:39.930 
why you know there's times when I would
just<00:04:38.800> sit<00:04:38.979> there<00:04:39.009> well<00:04:39.400> that's<00:04:39.639> because<00:04:39.789> I

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
just sit there well that's because I

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.550 
just sit there well that's because I
couldn't<00:04:40.240> do<00:04:40.330> anything<00:04:40.569> other<00:04:40.900> than<00:04:41.169> just<00:04:41.409> go

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
couldn't do anything other than just go

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.649 
couldn't do anything other than just go
backwards<00:04:42.099> I<00:04:42.280> try<00:04:42.520> to<00:04:42.550> go<00:04:42.789> forward<00:04:43.330> and<00:04:43.419> kept

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:43.659 
backwards I try to go forward and kept

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:48.570 
backwards I try to go forward and kept
trying<00:04:44.009> but<00:04:45.009> had<00:04:45.159> nothing<00:04:45.610> so<00:04:46.030> i<00:04:46.440> guess<00:04:47.580> the

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
trying but had nothing so i guess the

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.490 
trying but had nothing so i guess the
transmission<00:04:49.180> itself<00:04:49.509> had<00:04:49.750> been<00:04:49.810> sitting<00:04:50.229> for

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
transmission itself had been sitting for

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.490 
transmission itself had been sitting for
a<00:04:50.560> better<00:04:50.740> part<00:04:51.039> of<00:04:51.099> the<00:04:51.190> year<00:04:51.250> and<00:04:52.169> it<00:04:53.169> seemed

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
a better part of the year and it seemed

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.350 
a better part of the year and it seemed
good<00:04:53.740> it<00:04:53.949> looked<00:04:54.129> good<00:04:54.370> but<00:04:54.819> apparently<00:04:55.270> it

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
good it looked good but apparently it

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.839 
good it looked good but apparently it
wasn't<00:04:55.539> good<00:04:55.840> and<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.889> motor<00:04:57.099> I<00:04:57.250> put<00:04:57.550> in<00:04:57.699> it

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
wasn't good and the motor I put in it

00:04:57.849 --> 00:04:59.550 
wasn't good and the motor I put in it
came<00:04:58.090> out<00:04:58.240> of<00:04:58.270> my<00:04:58.419> polling<00:04:58.750> tractor<00:04:59.169> which<00:04:59.379> has

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
came out of my polling tractor which has

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.350 
came out of my polling tractor which has
quite<00:05:00.039> a<00:05:00.069> bit<00:05:00.280> more<00:05:00.430> horsepower<00:05:00.940> than<00:05:01.060> what<00:05:01.330> a

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
quite a bit more horsepower than what a

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.270 
quite a bit more horsepower than what a
stock<00:05:01.659> engine<00:05:02.319> that<00:05:02.530> was<00:05:02.590> in<00:05:02.740> this<00:05:02.860> car<00:05:03.129> would

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
stock engine that was in this car would

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.809 
stock engine that was in this car would
have<00:05:03.520> so<00:05:04.440> all<00:05:05.440> things<00:05:05.740> combined<00:05:06.250> I<00:05:06.490> lost<00:05:06.699> the

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:06.819 
have so all things combined I lost the

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:08.279 
have so all things combined I lost the
transmission<00:05:07.060> it's<00:05:07.719> just<00:05:07.870> the<00:05:08.020> way<00:05:08.139> it<00:05:08.259> goes

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
transmission it's just the way it goes

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:10.080 
transmission it's just the way it goes
sometimes<00:05:08.830> it's<00:05:09.699> the<00:05:09.789> little<00:05:09.940> things

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
sometimes it's the little things

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.059 
sometimes it's the little things
sometimes<00:05:10.419> it's<00:05:10.810> the<00:05:10.930> big<00:05:11.080> things<00:05:11.319> so<00:05:11.949> this

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:12.069 
sometimes it's the big things so this

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:14.399 
sometimes it's the big things so this
time<00:05:12.099> as<00:05:12.430> a<00:05:12.460> transmission<00:05:13.080> but<00:05:14.080> I<00:05:14.139> do<00:05:14.259> have

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:14.409 
time as a transmission but I do have

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:16.559 
time as a transmission but I do have
another<00:05:14.469> one<00:05:14.800> that<00:05:15.520> I<00:05:15.550> know<00:05:15.699> works<00:05:16.120> and<00:05:16.449> is

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:16.569 
another one that I know works and is

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:17.969 
another one that I know works and is
good<00:05:16.780> so<00:05:17.050> we're<00:05:17.169> going<00:05:17.259> to<00:05:17.349> put<00:05:17.379> that<00:05:17.500> in<00:05:17.830> this

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
good so we're going to put that in this

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.360 
good so we're going to put that in this
car<00:05:18.250> and<00:05:18.460> we<00:05:18.580> should<00:05:18.759> be<00:05:18.879> good<00:05:18.909> to<00:05:19.060> go<00:05:20.370> keep

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
car and we should be good to go keep

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.619 
car and we should be good to go keep
walking<00:05:21.729> around<00:05:21.849> here<00:05:22.090> trying<00:05:22.270> to<00:05:22.360> think<00:05:22.539> of

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:22.629 
walking around here trying to think of

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:24.930 
walking around here trying to think of
anything<00:05:22.840> else<00:05:23.490> kind<00:05:24.490> of<00:05:24.520> look<00:05:24.639> on<00:05:24.759> the<00:05:24.819> inside

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
anything else kind of look on the inside

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.450 
anything else kind of look on the inside
not<00:05:25.419> a<00:05:25.479> whole<00:05:25.690> lot<00:05:25.870> to<00:05:26.169> write<00:05:26.500> home<00:05:26.620> about<00:05:26.680> just

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
not a whole lot to write home about just

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.809 
not a whole lot to write home about just
the<00:05:28.180> normal<00:05:28.710> mud<00:05:29.710> and<00:05:30.310> everything<00:05:30.610> else

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:30.819 
the normal mud and everything else

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:35.309 
the normal mud and everything else
always<00:05:31.659> people<00:05:32.020> deal<00:05:32.229> with<00:05:32.289> Oh<00:05:34.169> put<00:05:35.169> some

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
always people deal with Oh put some

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:37.260 
always people deal with Oh put some
extra<00:05:35.469> foam<00:05:35.860> there<00:05:36.190> because<00:05:36.669> of<00:05:36.699> where<00:05:37.120> the

shifter is located occasionally you

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.899 
shifter is located occasionally you
could<00:05:39.009> get<00:05:39.159> hit<00:05:39.340> and<00:05:39.460> you<00:05:39.550> might<00:05:39.729> actually

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:39.909 
could get hit and you might actually

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:42.870 
could get hit and you might actually
punch<00:05:40.419> your<00:05:40.800> bar<00:05:41.800> there<00:05:42.099> that's<00:05:42.370> happened<00:05:42.819> to

punch your bar there that's happened to

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.719 
punch your bar there that's happened to
me<00:05:42.909> before<00:05:43.029> I<00:05:43.360> had<00:05:43.690> a<00:05:44.159> busted-up<00:05:45.159> wrist<00:05:45.520> a
