is<00:04:04.600> a<00:04:04.630> sitrep<00:04:05.200> Pro<00:04:05.470> I<00:04:05.500> think<00:04:05.920> that<00:04:06.160> that

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
is a sitrep Pro I think that that

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.380 
is a sitrep Pro I think that that
increases<00:04:07.209> the<00:04:07.630> enemy's<00:04:08.260> foot<00:04:08.590> noise<00:04:09.400> I<00:04:09.730> don't

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
increases the enemy's foot noise I don't

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.150 
increases the enemy's foot noise I don't
know<00:04:10.510> if<00:04:10.630> it<00:04:10.780> really<00:04:10.989> works<00:04:11.260> I<00:04:11.590> heard<00:04:11.920> people

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
know if it really works I heard people

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.890 
know if it really works I heard people
say<00:04:12.489> that<00:04:12.760> it<00:04:12.880> really<00:04:13.030> doesn't<00:04:13.390> work<00:04:13.660> in<00:04:13.810> this

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
say that it really doesn't work in this

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.560 
say that it really doesn't work in this
game<00:04:14.140> and<00:04:14.470> other<00:04:15.459> games<00:04:15.760> like<00:04:15.940> even<00:04:16.330> if<00:04:16.450> you

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
game and other games like even if you

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.479 
game and other games like even if you
have<00:04:16.720> ninja<00:04:17.080> on<00:04:17.169> because<00:04:17.380> it<00:04:17.530> doesn't<00:04:18.010> counter

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
the dead silence ability seems like they

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.200 
the dead silence ability seems like they
would<00:04:22.930> have<00:04:23.050> made<00:04:23.289> sitrep<00:04:24.070> row<00:04:24.340> counter<00:04:24.910> dead

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
would have made sitrep row counter dead

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.420 
would have made sitrep row counter dead
silence<00:04:25.720> or<00:04:25.990> dead<00:04:26.200> silence<00:04:26.560> Pro<00:04:26.800> would

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
silence or dead silence Pro would

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.210 
silence or dead silence Pro would

silence<00:04:30.580> really<00:04:30.970> doesn't<00:04:31.510> have<00:04:31.720> a<00:04:31.750> counter

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
silence really doesn't have a counter

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.010 
silence really doesn't have a counter
and<00:04:33.640> it's<00:04:33.850> a<00:04:33.940> really<00:04:34.090> strong<00:04:34.390> prayer<00:04:34.660> and<00:04:34.900> that
