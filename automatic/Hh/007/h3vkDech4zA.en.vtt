00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.290
 It is important that after work, our faithful world of libido is home 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.380
 the best Dutchman from childhood, as it were, with his steel steed of the 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.380
 law enforcement 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.860
 the afternoon good afternoon 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.420
 what is the bike 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.820
 store the bikes 12 13 year old borger 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.320
 the loss was calculated 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.720
 but taking the bike against I might find this 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.280
 once because it is so never aware that I have no cyclists 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.110
 the fund did win 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.350
 big risers 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.670
 but I do not want that I prefer walking than cycling yes yes 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.630
 it can be adjusted 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.630
 but for people who are precursors healthy 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.590
 sign up 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.430
 9 from the case it's never nice to know he expects that 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.070
 that is fit being he has made a big hit, for example 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.090
 Pieter Lakeman is Monday 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.390
 he will be in this neighborhood 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.390
 that they send roda what more often but that is consistent with the car 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.940
 why is just a bunch of strange find that they are ready 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.610
 he said he had a number of weeks 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.890
 of course you can too 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.080
 he looks tough 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.470
 but it is also okay to show that the protocol agreement with 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.889
 lock the bike 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.399
 it pays off to make sure you cycle you are logging in to his design 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.399
 cycling anyway you go you're the winner 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.449

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.679

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:37.989
 with the bad weather Almere 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.969

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:43.009

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:45.649
 I have no idea why not 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:47.399

 go to school yes 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.600

 I have never mined I have never been a bicycle repairman there 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.180
