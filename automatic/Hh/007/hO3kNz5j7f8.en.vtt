hi today I want to talk to you about

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.599 
hi today I want to talk to you about
panthenol<00:00:03.650> before<00:00:04.650> I<00:00:04.680> talk<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.100> you<00:00:05.520> about

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
panthenol before I talk to you about

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.700 
panthenol before I talk to you about
panthenol<00:00:06.299> I<00:00:06.540> do<00:00:06.629> want<00:00:06.990> to<00:00:07.049> say<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.290> couple<00:00:07.589> of

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
panthenol I do want to say a couple of

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.730 
panthenol I do want to say a couple of
things<00:00:07.770> about<00:00:08.280> hair<00:00:08.670> first<00:00:09.330> I<00:00:09.750> want<00:00:10.650> to

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
things about hair first I want to

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.900 
things about hair first I want to
reiterate<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.969> restate<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:12.929> hair<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:14.040> not

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
reiterate and restate that hair is not

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.580 
reiterate and restate that hair is not
living<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:16.650> basic<00:00:17.130> on<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.400> definition<00:00:18.150> of

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
living so basic on the definition of

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.150 
living so basic on the definition of
hair<00:00:19.590> no<00:00:20.220> longer<00:00:20.699> going<00:00:20.910> through<00:00:21.270> mitosis

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
hair no longer going through mitosis

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.589 
hair no longer going through mitosis
mitosis<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.850> cell<00:00:24.449> division<00:00:25.460> hair<00:00:26.460> no<00:00:27.180> longer

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
mitosis is cell division hair no longer

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.109 
mitosis is cell division hair no longer
goes<00:00:27.810> through<00:00:28.140> mitosis<00:00:28.890> wants<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.939> can

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
goes through mitosis wants it you can

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.740 
goes through mitosis wants it you can
see<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.510> here<00:00:31.170> on<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:32.340> scalp<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:33.239> therefore

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
see it here on the scalp so therefore

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.560 
see it here on the scalp so therefore
the<00:00:33.930> hair<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.469> dead<00:00:34.890> not<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.640> ends<00:00:36.149> not

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
the hair is dead not just the ends not

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.020 
the hair is dead not just the ends not
the<00:00:36.840> broken<00:00:37.260> part<00:00:37.500> but<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.250> whole<00:00:38.280> hair

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
the broken part but the whole hair

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.200 
the broken part but the whole hair
strand<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.809> no<00:00:40.110> longer<00:00:40.379> alive<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.940> point

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
strand is no longer alive so the point

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.740 
strand is no longer alive so the point
is<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:43.230> doesn't<00:00:43.530> really<00:00:43.770> take<00:00:44.070> in

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
is is that it doesn't really take in

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.979 
is is that it doesn't really take in
nutrients<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.460> become

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
nutrients so that it can become

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.389 
nutrients so that it can become
healthier

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
healthier

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.729 
healthier
it<00:00:50.399> does<00:00:50.700> take<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.239> oils<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.379> different

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
it does take in oils and different

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.689 
it does take in oils and different
things<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.360> structure<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:55.110> be

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
things so that the structure can be

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.610 
things so that the structure can be
maintained<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.780> point<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.440> that

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
maintained and so the point is is that

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.240 
maintained and so the point is is that
it<00:00:59.039> doesn't<00:00:59.370> really<00:00:59.579> take<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.559> nutrients<00:01:01.559> so

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
it doesn't really take in nutrients so

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
it doesn't really take in nutrients so
that<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:03.030> can<00:01:03.300> become<00:01:03.860> healthier

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
that it can become healthier

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.539 
that it can become healthier
it<00:01:06.270> does<00:01:06.540> take<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:07.080> oils<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.220> different

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
it does take in oils and different

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.530 
it does take in oils and different
things<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.200> structure<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.950> be

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
things so that the structure can be

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.289 
things so that the structure can be
maintained<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.900> look<00:01:13.380> good<00:01:13.830> but<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.700> want<00:01:15.119> to

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
maintained and look good but I want to

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.940 
maintained and look good but I want to
make<00:01:15.479> sure<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.259> understand<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
make sure that you understand the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.950 
make sure that you understand the
difference<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:18.619> hair<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:20.100> not<00:01:20.610> alive<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.570> is

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
difference that hair is not alive it is

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.990 
difference that hair is not alive it is
no<00:01:22.290> longer<00:01:22.500> going<00:01:22.860> through<00:01:23.159> cell<00:01:23.430> division<00:01:23.460> or

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
no longer going through cell division or

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.590 
no longer going through cell division or
mitosis<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:25.080> therefore<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.820> something

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
mitosis so therefore it is something

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.370 
mitosis so therefore it is something
that<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.950> be<00:01:28.979> preserved<00:01:29.780> with<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:31.049> stated

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
that is to be preserved with that stated

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.399 
that is to be preserved with that stated
I<00:01:31.740> want<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.250> talk<00:01:32.460> about<00:01:32.790> how<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.570> make

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
is not so that it will provide nutrition

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.819 
is not so that it will provide nutrition
and<00:01:59.130> food<00:01:59.729> for<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.210> hair<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.780> use<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.710> because

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
and food for the hair I use it because

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.150 
and food for the hair I use it because
of<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.759> properties<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:05.240> vitamin<00:02:06.240> b5<00:02:06.689> or

of the properties of it vitamin b5 or

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.550 
of the properties of it vitamin b5 or
panthenol<00:02:08.450> what<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:10.020> is

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
panthenol what it is is

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.690 
panthenol what it is is
hygroscopic<00:02:12.190> type<00:02:13.120> of<00:02:13.330> product<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:14.050> is<00:02:14.349> a

hygroscopic type of product it is a

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.839 
hygroscopic type of product it is a
humectant<00:02:15.700> so<00:02:16.630> what<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.410> does<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.950> on<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.640> hair

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849

of water or a half a cup I'm going to

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.160 
of water or a half a cup I'm going to
use<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:51.580> straight<00:02:51.910> from<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.120> sink<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.600> I

use it straight from the sink and I

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.059 
use it straight from the sink and I
recommend<00:02:53.560> you<00:02:53.799> use<00:02:53.910> hot<00:02:54.910> water<00:02:55.150> call<00:02:55.750> me<00:02:56.140> it's

recommend you use hot water call me it's

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.539 
recommend you use hot water call me it's
very<00:02:57.220> important<00:02:57.849> to<00:02:57.910> use<00:02:58.090> hot<00:02:58.330> water<00:02:58.540> because

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
very important to use hot water because

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.690 
very important to use hot water because
this<00:03:00.549> is<00:03:01.239> very<00:03:01.510> sticky<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:02.349> it<00:03:03.250> will<00:03:03.519> not

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
this is very sticky and it will not

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.080 
this is very sticky and it will not
dissolve<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:04.599> cold<00:03:05.500> water<00:03:05.769> sometimes<00:03:06.400> so<00:03:07.030> I

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
dissolve and cold water sometimes so I

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.830 
dissolve and cold water sometimes so I
use<00:03:07.420> very<00:03:07.780> hot<00:03:08.110> one<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:09.370> I<00:03:09.459> stir<00:03:09.760> it<00:03:09.790> up<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.299> if

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
use very hot one and I stir it up and if

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.789 
use very hot one and I stir it up and if
I'm<00:03:11.019> able<00:03:11.349> to<00:03:11.620> let<00:03:11.980> me<00:03:12.069> see<00:03:12.250> if<00:03:12.340> I<00:03:12.489> can<00:03:12.700> pull<00:03:13.000> out

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
I'm able to let me see if I can pull out

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:20.670 
I'm able to let me see if I can pull out
one<00:03:14.799> of<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:15.099> undissolved<00:03:15.850> pieces<00:03:16.510> okay<00:03:19.680> so

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
one of the undissolved pieces okay so

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.810 
one of the undissolved pieces okay so
here<00:03:21.040> is<00:03:21.160> good<00:03:21.400> panthenol<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:22.359> it<00:03:22.780> is<00:03:23.170> sticky

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
here is good panthenol and it is sticky

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.340 
here is good panthenol and it is sticky
you<00:03:24.820> can<00:03:25.030> kind<00:03:25.390> of<00:03:25.450> see<00:03:25.720> that<00:03:25.900> I<00:03:25.959> don't<00:03:26.079> know<00:03:26.260> if

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
you can kind of see that I don't know if

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.199 
you can kind of see that I don't know if
you<00:03:26.440> can<00:03:26.590> can<00:03:27.250> see<00:03:27.519> that<00:03:27.730> but<00:03:28.540> it's<00:03:29.109> sticky<00:03:29.500> and

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
you can can see that but it's sticky and

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.819 
you can can see that but it's sticky and
this<00:03:31.209> is<00:03:31.390> part<00:03:31.630> of<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:31.810> reason<00:03:32.109> why<00:03:32.230> I<00:03:32.530> like<00:03:32.769> to

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
this is part of the reason why I like to

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.620 
this is part of the reason why I like to
use<00:03:32.980> this<00:03:33.459> in<00:03:33.730> my<00:03:33.940> hair

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
use this in my hair

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.990 
use this in my hair
leave-in<00:03:34.959> my<00:03:35.440> hair<00:03:35.739> products<00:03:36.220> because<00:03:36.640> again

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
leave-in my hair products because again

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.009 
leave-in my hair products because again
it<00:03:37.480> forms<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.670> barrier<00:03:39.670> over<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.389> hair<00:03:40.600> strand

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
it forms a barrier over the hair strand

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.379 
it forms a barrier over the hair strand
so<00:03:41.620> again<00:03:41.980> I'm<00:03:42.100> not<00:03:42.220> looking<00:03:42.549> to<00:03:42.579> repair<00:03:43.060> hair

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
so again I'm not looking to repair hair

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.509 
so again I'm not looking to repair hair
damage<00:03:43.930> I'm<00:03:44.200> not<00:03:44.380> looking<00:03:44.769> to<00:03:44.799> make<00:03:45.130> my<00:03:45.280> hair

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
damage I'm not looking to make my hair

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.629 
damage I'm not looking to make my hair
look<00:03:45.549> thicker<00:03:45.930> my<00:03:46.930> goal<00:03:47.200> is<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.980> use<00:03:48.010> it<00:03:48.430> as<00:03:48.609> a

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
look thicker my goal is to use it as a

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.090 
look thicker my goal is to use it as a
humectant<00:03:49.329> to<00:03:49.959> use<00:03:50.139> it<00:03:50.290> as<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.440> hydroscopic

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
humectant to use it as a hydroscopic

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.059 
humectant to use it as a hydroscopic
component<00:03:51.940> to<00:03:52.389> use<00:03:52.600> it<00:03:52.780> as<00:03:52.930> something<00:03:53.440> to<00:03:53.650> seal

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
component to use it as something to seal

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.020 
component to use it as something to seal
in<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:54.579> moisture<00:03:54.940> in<00:03:55.720> my<00:03:55.959> hair<00:03:56.340> salt<00:03:57.340> this

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
in the moisture in my hair salt this

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.340 
in the moisture in my hair salt this
will<00:03:58.209> be<00:03:58.329> the<00:03:58.510> 5%<00:03:59.440> solution<00:03:59.940> so<00:04:00.940> it's<00:04:01.870> a<00:04:02.079> half<00:04:02.319> a

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
will be the 5% solution so it's a half a

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.309 
will be the 5% solution so it's a half a
cup<00:04:02.709> or<00:04:02.980> 100<00:04:03.819> milliliters<00:04:04.389> and<00:04:04.569> you<00:04:04.989> can<00:04:05.170> use

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
cup or 100 milliliters and you can use

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.009 
cup or 100 milliliters and you can use
all<00:04:05.560> of<00:04:05.739> this<00:04:05.889> some<00:04:06.280> of<00:04:06.310> this<00:04:06.609> half<00:04:07.600> of<00:04:07.870> it

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
all of this some of this half of it

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.979 
all of this some of this half of it
whatever<00:04:08.200> you<00:04:08.560> want<00:04:08.889> and<00:04:09.450> although<00:04:10.450> it<00:04:10.840> will

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
whatever you want and although it will

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.660 
whatever you want and although it will
not<00:04:11.230> be<00:04:11.470> 5<00:04:11.889> percent<00:04:12.519> in<00:04:12.850> your<00:04:13.720> leave-in<00:04:14.680> you

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
not be 5 percent in your leave-in you

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.990 
not be 5 percent in your leave-in you
no<00:04:15.819> you<00:04:15.880> have<00:04:16.269> 5%<00:04:16.870> in<00:04:17.500> terms<00:04:18.280> of<00:04:18.489> this<00:04:18.639> solution

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
no you have 5% in terms of this solution

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.240 
no you have 5% in terms of this solution
so<00:04:19.269> this<00:04:19.389> is<00:04:19.480> a<00:04:19.510> 5%<00:04:20.169> solution<00:04:20.290> of<00:04:20.680> panthenol

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
so this is a 5% solution of panthenol

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.129 
so this is a 5% solution of panthenol
water

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
water

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.830 
water
now<00:04:23.139> to<00:04:23.530> make<00:04:23.650> a<00:04:23.710> 10%<00:04:24.400> solution<00:04:24.730> you<00:04:25.389> simply

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
now to make a 10% solution you simply

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.180 
now to make a 10% solution you simply
use<00:04:26.139> two<00:04:26.740> teaspoons<00:04:27.370> of<00:04:28.830> panthenol<00:04:29.830> powder

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
use two teaspoons of panthenol powder

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.659 
use two teaspoons of panthenol powder
and<00:04:30.610> you<00:04:31.570> use<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:32.530> same<00:04:32.740> amount<00:04:32.860> of<00:04:33.130> water<00:04:33.340> and

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
and you use the same amount of water and

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.760 
and you use the same amount of water and
that<00:04:33.760> will<00:04:33.850> give<00:04:33.970> you<00:04:34.090> a<00:04:34.150> 10%<00:04:34.450> solution<00:04:34.990> so

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
that will give you a 10% solution so

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.010 
that will give you a 10% solution so
I'll<00:04:35.889> put<00:04:36.130> the<00:04:36.220> math<00:04:36.460> for<00:04:36.910> you<00:04:37.090> down<00:04:37.360> below<00:04:37.840> so

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
I'll put the math for you down below so

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.840 
I'll put the math for you down below so
you<00:04:38.139> know<00:04:38.260> exactly<00:04:38.440> what<00:04:38.919> you're<00:04:39.040> doing<00:04:39.250> but

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
you know exactly what you're doing but

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.900 
you know exactly what you're doing but
again<00:04:40.150> this<00:04:40.660> is<00:04:40.960> one<00:04:41.440> way<00:04:41.710> to<00:04:41.770> make<00:04:42.220> panthenol

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
again this is one way to make panthenol

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.870 
again this is one way to make panthenol
water<00:04:43.240> and<00:04:43.540> again<00:04:44.260> this<00:04:44.740> person<00:04:45.280> or<00:04:45.400> i<00:04:45.639> buy
