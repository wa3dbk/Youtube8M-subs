00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:58.800
 the only thing I didn't like 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.409
 it is impossible to choose a color 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.070
 send gift send random colors 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:08.040
 but a gray cover on a white smartphone 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.649
 It looks like it's dirty you by 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.329

 Menu keys home and back without backlight 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.990
 the circular frame looks like 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.649
 metal but actually 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.200

 battery for 2200 milliampere hours 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.620
 in fact, the battery is probably 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.989
 the only thing that is a little bit 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.569
 placed in the phone to watch movies on 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.970

 quite a long time keeps this rank on 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:57.549
 forums write that over time 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.769
 sort of like the phone adapts and this one 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.500
 The bug disappears I do not know in time 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.870

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.400
