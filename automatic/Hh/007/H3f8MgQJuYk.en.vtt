00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
 today we're going to the metropolitan 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:09.000
 building we hope to be able to climb 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:10.950
 because this is the secondary entrance of the 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.090
 our secondary success of ours 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.570
 hotels from 60 should be kind above 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:21.720
 so tall that he is afraid anyway 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.000
 and we'll have to go straight to where 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.790
 see those gentlemen who walk then 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.810
 turn right if I'm not mistaken is the 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.309
 map we had a blank map 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.720
 detailed that in casino move ok 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.550
 it is never where 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:43.800
 it has not done and I do not know 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.800
 however now let's go to the right 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.370
 this morning it's cool to be god 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.629
 cold and should be if I'm wrong 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.629
 his gigantic building here 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:00.079
 sphere yes 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.079
 hakim and trumpets indeed this here then 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.760
 and we go there 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.800
 at the pedestrian crossing and then 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.800
 cross 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.020
 this is the washington hotel 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.640
 but by the vabbè you could use a rita 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.640
 espress or even the low limousin yes no 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.920
 that is huge 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.829
 nothing anywhere you go to certain shinjuku there 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.299
 they are people you see check 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.299
 where to get it true 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.909
 the art quantity xvi in ​​short, to be a 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.710
 New York 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.810
 this is what this area is all about 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.259
 here from a lot of new york 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.259
 think 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.890
 but not seeing the film 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:33.110
 washington hotel a tonnage and coast 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.569
 I don't know if it costs so much there is from 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.459
 from luxury it would seem so because if 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.459
 gigantic giant 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.180
 well ... yes 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.910
 Yup 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.070
 and a company 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:03:04.240
 compared to the number one it is 250 meters 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:07.510
 but let's see if it waits ok we'll see 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.410
 indeed not star it seems that all is 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:14.670
 in fact it could cost us nothing is true 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.670
 if it is not true look at all 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.370
 certainly here the continuous flow 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.930
 Yup 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.460

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.490

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:51.220

 one number two will be the under number one 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.520
 this is not the other not only 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.520

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.520

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.900
 what a mess guys there is 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.360
 we can't even get into a cabbage 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.240

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.060
 You can not pass 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.970
 let's talk about the park that this plan is a 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.050
 you can see the beautiful ladybugs in a large park 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.520
 yes it is true 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:40.770

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:45.150

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.860
 little way in Japanese 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.930
 we would then need from what I have 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.390
 understood is that other live building 90 le 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:22.120

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:53.849
