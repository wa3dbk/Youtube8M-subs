00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
shrinking pad throw that down I'm

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.040 
shrinking pad throw that down I'm
instantly<00:00:37.010> smaller<00:00:39.999> now<00:00:40.999> I<00:00:41.059> can<00:00:41.390> run<00:00:42.019> over

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.810 
what's a shrinking potion well the
shrinking<00:01:11.240> potion<00:01:11.479> is<00:01:12.159> just<00:01:13.159> a<00:01:13.280> potion<00:01:13.610> of

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
shrinking potion is just a potion of

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.440 
shrinking potion is just a potion of
strength<00:01:14.350> renamed<00:01:15.350> and<00:01:17.110> that<00:01:18.110> is<00:01:18.350> the<00:01:18.500> big

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
strength renamed and that is the big

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.380 
strength renamed and that is the big
room<00:01:20.649> that<00:01:21.649> I<00:01:21.740> was<00:01:21.890> in<00:01:23.619> so<00:01:25.119> this<00:01:26.119> basically

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
room that I was in so this basically

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.660 
room that I was in so this basically
uses<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.820> teleportation<00:01:28.820> potions<00:01:30.670> going

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
uses the teleportation potions going

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.080 
uses the teleportation potions going
from<00:01:32.770> that<00:01:33.770> room<00:01:34.189> to<00:01:34.729> this<00:01:35.090> huge<00:01:35.509> room<00:01:36.820> it<00:01:37.820> has

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
from that room to this huge room it has

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.490 
from that room to this huge room it has
the<00:01:38.390> same<00:01:39.520> setup<00:01:40.520> as<00:01:41.380> my<00:01:42.380> last<00:01:42.590> video

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
the same setup as my last video

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.319 
the same setup as my last video
basically<00:01:47.079> this<00:01:48.079> hopper<00:01:48.499> clock<00:01:48.939> out<00:01:49.939> putting

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
basically this hopper clock out putting

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:55.779 
basically this hopper clock out putting
it<00:01:50.509> so<00:01:51.109> signal<00:01:51.619> this<00:01:52.549> signal<00:01:52.850> is<00:01:54.189> to<00:01:55.189> remove

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
it so signal this signal is to remove

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.940 
it so signal this signal is to remove
the<00:01:57.009> strength<00:01:58.009> potion<00:01:58.369> from<00:01:58.909> me<00:01:59.210> arm<00:01:59.929> so<00:02:00.799> it's

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
the strength potion from me arm so it's

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.889 
the strength potion from me arm so it's
constantly<00:02:01.100> removing<00:02:01.909> it<00:02:02.060> so<00:02:02.179> I<00:02:02.270> only<00:02:02.450> have<00:02:02.719> it

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899

for the strength potion as well and if

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:56.220 
for the strength potion as well and if
it<00:02:51.250> finds<00:02:51.609> it<00:02:52.079> arm<00:02:53.079> when<00:02:53.650> I'm<00:02:53.680> on<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:55.230> sponge

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
it finds it arm when I'm on that sponge

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.970 
it finds it arm when I'm on that sponge
in<00:02:56.560> there<00:02:56.590> it'll<00:02:57.159> teleport<00:02:57.940> me<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:59.680> big

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
in there it'll teleport me to the big

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.610 
in there it'll teleport me to the big
sponge<00:03:00.670> in<00:03:01.000> there<00:03:01.060> so<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:01.930> gives<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.530> effect

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
sponge in there so it gives the effect

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.280 
sponge in there so it gives the effect
that<00:03:03.159> I<00:03:04.060> am<00:03:04.859> shrinking<00:03:06.689> although<00:03:07.689> it's<00:03:08.019> just

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
that I am shrinking although it's just

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.410 
that I am shrinking although it's just
teleportation<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:10.000> if<00:03:10.120> I<00:03:10.209> stand<00:03:10.480> on<00:03:10.689> this<00:03:10.989> and

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
teleportation so if I stand on this and

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.210 
teleportation so if I stand on this and
we<00:03:13.420> break<00:03:14.019> this<00:03:14.349> you<00:03:14.650> can<00:03:14.769> see<00:03:14.980> that<00:03:15.189> that

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
we break this you can see that that

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.250 
we break this you can see that that
comparator<00:03:16.120> right<00:03:16.420> over<00:03:16.689> there<00:03:16.840> is<00:03:16.959> lit<00:03:17.230> up

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
comparator right over there is lit up

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.069 
comparator right over there is lit up
which<00:03:18.040> means<00:03:18.400> it<00:03:18.700> is<00:03:18.819> constantly<00:03:19.420> testing<00:03:19.930> to

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
which means it is constantly testing to

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.470 
which means it is constantly testing to
see<00:03:20.109> when<00:03:20.590> I<00:03:20.620> will<00:03:21.010> throw<00:03:21.310> this<00:03:21.579> potion<00:03:22.209> of

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
see when I will throw this potion of

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.939 
see when I will throw this potion of
strength<00:03:22.540> down<00:03:23.310> when<00:03:24.310> I<00:03:24.340> do<00:03:24.930> it'll<00:03:25.949> it'll

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:26.949 
strength down when I do it'll it'll

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:31.319 
strength down when I do it'll it'll
confirm<00:03:27.519> it<00:03:27.790> and<00:03:29.370> send<00:03:30.370> me<00:03:30.519> over<00:03:31.000> here<00:03:31.269> to

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
confirm it and send me over here to

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.899 
confirm it and send me over here to
appear<00:03:32.230> that<00:03:32.260> i<00:03:32.500> have<00:03:32.739> shrunk<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:33.430> learn

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
appear that i have shrunk and learn

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.680 
appear that i have shrunk and learn
grown<00:03:34.299> again<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:36.400> yeah<00:03:36.879> that's<00:03:37.209> all<00:03:37.480> I've<00:03:37.629> got

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
grown again so yeah that's all I've got

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.430 
grown again so yeah that's all I've got
