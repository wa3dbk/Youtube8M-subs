00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:10.880 
catalytic converters so let's take a

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.720 
catalytic converters so let's take a
look<00:00:11.030> at<00:00:11.120> a<00:00:11.180> typical<00:00:11.330> unit<00:00:12.070> this<00:00:13.070> is<00:00:13.130> often<00:00:13.400> an

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
look at a typical unit this is often an

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.339 
look at a typical unit this is often an
early<00:00:14.000> model<00:00:14.150> from<00:00:14.570> a<00:00:14.690> car<00:00:14.900> from<00:00:15.019> the<00:00:15.170> early

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:15.349 
early model from a car from the early

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.320 
early model from a car from the early
1990s<00:00:16.189> you'll<00:00:16.610> see<00:00:16.790> it's<00:00:16.910> quite<00:00:17.029> a<00:00:17.119> simple

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
1990s you'll see it's quite a simple

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.839 
1990s you'll see it's quite a simple
round<00:00:18.290> or<00:00:18.590> oval<00:00:18.619> construction<00:00:19.400> in<00:00:19.489> this<00:00:19.610> case

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:19.849 
round or oval construction in this case

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.060 
round or oval construction in this case
and<00:00:20.150> it<00:00:20.509> lives<00:00:20.689> underneath<00:00:20.960> the<00:00:21.200> gearstick<00:00:21.800> in

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
and it lives underneath the gearstick in

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.970 
and it lives underneath the gearstick in
the<00:00:22.160> passenger<00:00:22.520> compartment<00:00:22.640> or<00:00:26.980> later

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
the passenger compartment or later

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.190 
the passenger compartment or later
vehicles<00:00:28.550> you'll<00:00:28.910> see<00:00:29.090> that<00:00:29.239> the<00:00:29.450> catalyst

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
vehicles you'll see that the catalyst

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.420 
vehicles you'll see that the catalyst
has<00:00:30.349> moved<00:00:30.619> right<00:00:30.890> up<00:00:31.009> to<00:00:31.130> the<00:00:31.220> engine

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
has moved right up to the engine

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.310 
has moved right up to the engine
manifold<00:00:31.849> this<00:00:32.149> is<00:00:32.329> to<00:00:32.450> aid<00:00:32.570> light<00:00:32.840> off<00:00:33.050> time

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
manifold this is to aid light off time

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.919 
manifold this is to aid light off time
since<00:00:34.040> 2001<00:00:34.730> when<00:00:34.850> he<00:00:34.940> mission<00:00:35.239> legislations

00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:35.929 
since 2001 when he mission legislations

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:37.750 
since 2001 when he mission legislations
got<00:00:36.140> tighter<00:00:36.410> these<00:00:37.129> are<00:00:37.280> to<00:00:37.399> get<00:00:37.519> hotter

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
got tighter these are to get hotter

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.119 
got tighter these are to get hotter
quicker<00:00:38.210> so<00:00:38.840> the<00:00:38.960> catalyst<00:00:39.379> units<00:00:39.859> been

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
quicker so the catalyst units been

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.400 
quicker so the catalyst units been
bolted<00:00:40.429> directly<00:00:40.699> to<00:00:41.059> the<00:00:41.149> manifold<00:00:41.539> in<00:00:42.140> terms

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
bolted directly to the manifold in terms

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.720 
bolted directly to the manifold in terms
of<00:00:42.469> replacement<00:00:43.039> this<00:00:43.160> can<00:00:43.339> give<00:00:43.489> you<00:00:43.609> issues

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
of replacement this can give you issues

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.310 
of replacement this can give you issues
because<00:00:44.329> you'll<00:00:44.420> have<00:00:44.449> to<00:00:44.600> replace<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.050> whole

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
because you'll have to replace the whole

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.790 
because you'll have to replace the whole
unit<00:00:46.839> so<00:00:47.839> let's<00:00:47.989> talk<00:00:48.140> about<00:00:48.199> construction

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800
