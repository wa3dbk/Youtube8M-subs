connect with type of work that I do so I

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.200 
connect with type of work that I do so I
think<00:01:37.770> when<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.189> look<00:01:38.220> for<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.610> professional

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.120 
think when you look for a professional
photographer<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:40.140> think<00:01:40.409> it's<00:01:40.530> very<00:01:40.590> important

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
photographer I think it's very important

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.069 
photographer I think it's very important
that<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.280> meet<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.880> photographer<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.780> your

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
that you meet the photographer in your

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.719 
that you meet the photographer in your
in<00:01:43.290> their<00:01:43.530> work<00:01:43.829> environment<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.729> think<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.780> a

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
in their work environment I think that a

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.649 
in their work environment I think that a
photographer<00:01:47.729> wants<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.180> meet<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.479> at<00:01:48.570> a
