have<00:01:35.220> been<00:01:35.400> written<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:36.030> think<00:01:36.869> only<00:01:37.380> the

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
have been written I think only the

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.980 
have been written I think only the
rightly<00:01:38.820> made<00:01:39.030> feature<00:01:39.390> film<00:01:39.869> would

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
rightly made feature film would

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.620 
rightly made feature film would
eventually<00:01:40.290> capture<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.250> emotional<00:01:42.210> aspect

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
eventually capture the emotional aspect

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.240 
eventually capture the emotional aspect
of<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.899> because<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.350> being<00:01:43.680> told<00:01:43.950> through

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
of it because it is being told through

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.359 
of it because it is being told through
people<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.509> through<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.259> inner<00:01:46.710> conflicts

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
people and through the inner conflicts

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.340 
people and through the inner conflicts
it's<00:01:47.610> not<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:48.090> being<00:01:48.240> sent<00:01:48.570> as<00:01:48.689> information

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
it's not just being sent as information

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.490 
it's not just being sent as information
so<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.590> think<00:01:50.000> is<00:01:51.000> very<00:01:51.240> important<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.049> that

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
so I think is very important that that

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.429 
so I think is very important that that
that<00:01:53.189> particular<00:01:53.460> chronicle<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:55.049> event

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
that particular chronicle of this event

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.929 
that particular chronicle of this event
should<00:01:55.619> be<00:01:55.680> there<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.340> was<00:01:56.460> my<00:01:56.610> main
