we're going to be doing a 9 way braid

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.260 
we're going to be doing a 9 way braid
which<00:01:40.160> is<00:01:40.280> essentially<00:01:40.760> three<00:01:41.000> braids

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
which is essentially three braids

which is essentially three braids
braided<00:01:41.690> into<00:01:41.810> one<00:01:43.030> so<00:01:44.030> we're<00:01:44.210> going<00:01:44.300> to<00:01:44.420> start

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
braided into one so we're going to start

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.330 
braided into one so we're going to start
by<00:01:44.750> braiding<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.290> first<00:01:45.560> section<00:01:45.800> and<00:01:46.070> tying

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
by braiding the first section and tying

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.890 
by braiding the first section and tying
it<00:01:46.490> off<00:01:46.580> with<00:01:46.790> a<00:01:46.880> rubber<00:01:47.030> band

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.170 

and<00:01:50.140> then<00:01:51.010> just<00:01:51.220> do<00:01:51.400> the<00:01:51.490> same<00:01:51.700> thing<00:01:51.940> for<00:01:52.120> the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
and then just do the same thing for the

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.609 
and then just do the same thing for the
other<00:01:52.240> sections

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.960 

the<00:01:59.619> next<00:02:00.009> step<00:02:00.159> is<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:00.369> take<00:02:00.490> all<00:02:00.790> three

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
the next step is to take all three

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.039 
the next step is to take all three
pieces<00:02:01.180> and<00:02:01.570> braid<00:02:01.720> them<00:02:01.869> into<00:02:02.079> one<00:02:02.200> as<00:02:04.049> you

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
pieces and braid them into one as you

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.330 
pieces and braid them into one as you
keep<00:02:05.200> writing<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.619> braids<00:02:05.829> can<00:02:06.009> look<00:02:06.159> more

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
keep writing the braids can look more

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.559 
keep writing the braids can look more
intricate<00:02:08.640> once<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:09.789> get<00:02:09.880> near<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.209> end<00:02:10.360> go

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
intricate once you get near the end go

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:17.280 
intricate once you get near the end go
ahead<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:10.899> tie<00:02:11.020> it<00:02:11.050> off<00:02:11.230> at<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.470> hair<00:02:11.620> time<00:02:16.290> to

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
ahead and tie it off at the hair time to

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.900 
ahead and tie it off at the hair time to
make<00:02:17.470> your<00:02:17.620> hair<00:02:17.830> appear<00:02:18.190> thicker<00:02:18.430> go<00:02:18.730> ahead

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
make your hair appear thicker go ahead

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.570 
make your hair appear thicker go ahead
and<00:02:19.060> loosen<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.360> braid<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:19.569> little<00:02:19.840> bit<00:02:20.580> once

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
and loosen the braid a little bit once

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.830 
and loosen the braid a little bit once
you<00:02:21.730> are<00:02:21.760> done<00:02:21.970> with<00:02:22.030> that<00:02:22.239> last<00:02:22.480> step<00:02:22.569> it

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
you are done with that last step it

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.059 
you are done with that last step it
should<00:02:23.019> look<00:02:23.140> like<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.470> spent<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.739> really<00:02:23.920> long

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
should look like you spent a really long

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.890 
should look like you spent a really long
