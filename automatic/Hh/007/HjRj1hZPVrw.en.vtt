these guys out here they got about 25 or
35<00:05:35.740> feets<00:05:36.160> of<00:05:36.280> the<00:05:36.370> first<00:05:36.580> car<00:05:36.850> the<00:05:37.180> trucks<00:05:37.660> are

35 feets of the first car the trucks are
lighter<00:05:37.990> they're<00:05:38.440> gonna<00:05:38.530> get<00:05:38.680> in<00:05:38.770> major<00:05:38.950> air

lighter they're gonna get in major air

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.370 
lighter they're gonna get in major air
at<00:05:39.460> first<00:05:39.730> with<00:05:40.030> in<00:05:40.150> the<00:05:40.240> truck<00:05:40.870> cars<00:05:41.139> should

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
at first with in the truck cars should

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.570 
at first with in the truck cars should
start<00:05:41.800> to<00:05:41.889> go<00:05:42.040> away

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
start to go away

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.280 
start to go away
now<00:05:43.090> go<00:05:43.240> away<00:05:43.360> means<00:05:43.660> every<00:05:43.870> time<00:05:44.050> they<00:05:44.169> get

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
now go away means every time they get

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.470 
now go away means every time they get
hit<00:05:44.530> they<00:05:44.860> start<00:05:45.160> to<00:05:45.250> roll<00:05:45.430> over<00:05:45.460> so<00:05:46.060> the<00:05:46.180> lead

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
hit they start to roll over so the lead

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.940 
hit they start to roll over so the lead
car<00:05:46.720> becomes<00:05:47.020> a<00:05:47.139> ramp<00:05:47.350> and<00:05:47.500> every<00:05:47.650> time<00:05:47.830> the

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
car becomes a ramp and every time the

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.740 
car becomes a ramp and every time the
guy<00:05:48.070> comes<00:05:48.310> back<00:05:48.580> that<00:05:48.790> ramp<00:05:49.030> is<00:05:49.180> different

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
guy comes back that ramp is different

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.780 
guy comes back that ramp is different
he<00:05:50.380> might<00:05:50.530> be<00:05:50.650> third<00:05:50.889> in<00:05:50.980> line<00:05:51.160> now<00:05:51.370> the<00:05:51.430> ramps

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:51.790 
he might be third in line now the ramps

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.100 
he might be third in line now the ramps
different<00:05:52.120> than<00:05:52.210> it<00:05:52.330> was<00:05:52.450> when<00:05:52.630> it<00:05:52.690> was<00:05:52.780> first

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
different than it was when it was first

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.720 
different than it was when it was first
in<00:05:53.290> line<00:05:53.410> last<00:05:53.680> time<00:05:53.919> so<00:05:54.460> it's<00:05:54.580> really

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:54.730 
in line last time so it's really

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.490 
in line last time so it's really
important<00:05:55.030> together<00:05:55.300> starting<00:05:55.990> line<00:05:56.110> roll<00:05:56.380> up

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
important together starting line roll up

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.740 
important together starting line roll up
to<00:05:56.620> the<00:05:56.710> car<00:05:56.860> really<00:05:57.040> look<00:05:57.340> at<00:05:57.490> it<00:05:57.610> read<00:05:57.910> it<00:05:58.060> for

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
to the car really look at it read it for

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.680 
to the car really look at it read it for
the<00:05:58.840> easiest<00:05:59.169> way<00:05:59.440> over<00:05:59.770> now<00:06:00.610> once<00:06:01.540> that's

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
the easiest way over now once that's

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.659 
the easiest way over now once that's
done<00:06:01.870> the<00:06:02.020> guy<00:06:02.139> starts<00:06:02.680> hits<00:06:03.040> the<00:06:03.190> cars<00:06:03.370> and

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
done the guy starts hits the cars and

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.430 
done the guy starts hits the cars and
flies<00:06:04.139> you<00:06:05.139> know<00:06:05.260> he's<00:06:05.470> got<00:06:05.650> about<00:06:06.870> 35<00:06:07.870> 40<00:06:08.260> feet

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
flies you know he's got about 35 40 feet

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.380 
flies you know he's got about 35 40 feet
to<00:06:08.620> pass<00:06:09.310> the<00:06:09.460> cards<00:06:09.700> to<00:06:09.790> the<00:06:09.880> finish<00:06:10.090> line<00:06:10.150> but

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:10.390 
to pass the cards to the finish line but

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:11.940 
to pass the cards to the finish line but
he's<00:06:10.570> only<00:06:10.660> got<00:06:10.780> 60<00:06:11.230> feet<00:06:11.410> before<00:06:11.560> he<00:06:11.740> eats<00:06:11.800> the

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:11.950 
he's only got 60 feet before he eats the

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.950 
he's only got 60 feet before he eats the
concrete<00:06:12.370> so<00:06:12.640> he<00:06:12.790> has<00:06:12.880> to<00:06:13.060> stop<00:06:13.330> hit<00:06:13.840> the

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
concrete so he has to stop hit the

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.720 
concrete so he has to stop hit the
ground<00:06:14.169> settle<00:06:14.650> it<00:06:14.860> jam<00:06:15.100> on<00:06:15.220> the<00:06:15.310> brakes<00:06:15.490> and

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.730 
ground settle it jam on the brakes and

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.580 
ground settle it jam on the brakes and
stop<00:06:15.940> his<00:06:16.390> forward<00:06:16.750> momentum<00:06:16.870> while<00:06:17.290> he's<00:06:17.500> on

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
stop his forward momentum while he's on

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.530 
stop his forward momentum while he's on
the<00:06:17.710> dirt<00:06:17.919> because<00:06:18.640> if<00:06:18.760> he<00:06:18.850> gets<00:06:18.970> off<00:06:19.210> the<00:06:19.330> dirt

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:19.540 
the dirt because if he gets off the dirt

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.140 
the dirt because if he gets off the dirt
he<00:06:19.780> is<00:06:19.960> screwed<00:06:20.380> he<00:06:21.190> has<00:06:21.340> the<00:06:21.610> wall<00:06:21.790> and<00:06:22.060> that's

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
he is screwed he has the wall and that's

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.340 
he is screwed he has the wall and that's
kind<00:06:22.419> of<00:06:22.450> like<00:06:22.570> what<00:06:22.720> we<00:06:22.810> saw<00:06:22.960> earlier<00:06:22.990> with

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:23.350 
kind of like what we saw earlier with

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.990 
kind of like what we saw earlier with
drew<00:06:23.530> and<00:06:23.680> dream<00:06:23.860> catcher<00:06:24.130> stayed<00:06:24.700> in<00:06:24.790> the<00:06:24.850> gas

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
drew and dream catcher stayed in the gas

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.790 
drew and dream catcher stayed in the gas
a<00:06:25.030> little<00:06:25.390> too<00:06:25.570> long<00:06:25.720> possibly<00:06:26.260> and<00:06:26.530> he<00:06:26.710> was

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
a little too long possibly and he was

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.930 
a little too long possibly and he was
saying<00:06:26.950> he<00:06:27.040> had<00:06:27.130> some<00:06:27.250> brake<00:06:27.400> problems<00:06:27.760> also

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
saying he had some brake problems also

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.280 
saying he had some brake problems also
but<00:06:28.210> once<00:06:28.360> he<00:06:28.450> hit<00:06:28.540> the<00:06:28.630> concrete<00:06:28.840> there<00:06:29.200> was

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:29.290 
but once he hit the concrete there was

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.140 
but once he hit the concrete there was
no<00:06:29.410> stopping<00:06:29.650> the<00:06:29.830> track<00:06:30.070> when<00:06:30.760> it<00:06:30.850> came<00:06:30.970> down

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
no stopping the track when it came down

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.340 
no stopping the track when it came down
a<00:06:31.180> little<00:06:31.360> crooked<00:06:31.510> and<00:06:31.840> he<00:06:31.900> gave<00:06:32.020> the<00:06:32.169> gas

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.350 
a little crooked and he gave the gas

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.659 
a little crooked and he gave the gas
again<00:06:32.590> to<00:06:32.740> kind<00:06:32.919> of<00:06:33.040> goose<00:06:33.220> it<00:06:33.370> to<00:06:33.460> straighten

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:33.669 
again to kind of goose it to straighten

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:35.250 
again to kind of goose it to straighten
it<00:06:33.790> out<00:06:33.940> but<00:06:34.150> he<00:06:34.360> ran<00:06:34.750> out<00:06:34.900> of<00:06:34.930> running<00:06:35.139> room

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:35.260 
it out but he ran out of running room

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.110 
it out but he ran out of running room
for<00:06:35.440> the<00:06:35.650> brakes<00:06:35.919> you<00:06:36.160> know<00:06:36.280> he<00:06:36.460> had<00:06:36.610> no<00:06:36.880> place

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 
for the brakes you know he had no place

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.600 
for the brakes you know he had no place
to<00:06:37.150> stop<00:06:37.600> and<00:06:38.320> get<00:06:38.650> that<00:06:38.770> tractive<00:06:39.190> effort<00:06:39.310> to

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
to stop and get that tractive effort to

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.850 
to stop and get that tractive effort to
the<00:06:39.700> ground<00:06:39.940> and<00:06:40.210> make<00:06:40.390> a<00:06:40.419> stop<00:06:40.750> in<00:06:40.780> it<00:06:41.200> and<00:06:41.710> of

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
the ground and make a stop in it and of

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.260 
the ground and make a stop in it and of
course<00:06:41.890> he<00:06:42.070> hit<00:06:42.220> the<00:06:42.340> wall<00:06:42.520> everybody<00:06:43.150> hates

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
course he hit the wall everybody hates

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.940 
course he hit the wall everybody hates
to<00:06:43.390> see<00:06:43.570> that<00:06:43.750> I<00:06:43.990> think<00:06:44.470> it's<00:06:44.590> a<00:06:44.650> lesson

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:44.950 
to see that I think it's a lesson

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.050 
to see that I think it's a lesson
learned<00:06:45.160> I<00:06:45.370> don't<00:06:45.400> think<00:06:45.610> you<00:06:45.669> see<00:06:45.850> him<00:06:45.940> do

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060 
learned I don't think you see him do

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.630 
learned I don't think you see him do
that<00:06:46.180> next<00:06:46.390> time<00:06:46.510> yeah<00:06:47.169> definitely<00:06:47.860> and<00:06:47.979> let's

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:48.640 
that next time yeah definitely and let's

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.920 
that next time yeah definitely and let's
talk<00:06:48.820> a<00:06:48.850> little<00:06:48.940> bit<00:06:49.120> about<00:06:49.240> the<00:06:49.450> throttle

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:49.930 
talk a little bit about the throttle

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.480 
talk a little bit about the throttle
rhythm<00:06:50.229> as<00:06:50.350> you're<00:06:50.470> coming<00:06:50.650> up<00:06:50.800> to<00:06:50.830> the<00:06:50.950> cars<00:06:51.250> -

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
rhythm as you're coming up to the cars -

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.100 
rhythm as you're coming up to the cars -
we've<00:06:51.910> seen<00:06:52.120> a<00:06:52.150> couple<00:06:52.300> drivers<00:06:52.810> doing<00:06:53.020> it<00:06:53.080> a

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.110 
we've seen a couple drivers doing it a

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.480 
we've seen a couple drivers doing it a
little<00:06:53.260> differently<00:06:53.650> like<00:06:53.860> Rick<00:06:54.310> with

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
little differently like Rick with

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.400 
little differently like Rick with
Bigfoot<00:06:54.910> for<00:06:55.030> example<00:06:55.479> he<00:06:55.780> says<00:06:55.990> he's<00:06:56.110> running

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:56.410 
Bigfoot for example he says he's running

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.990 
Bigfoot for example he says he's running
up<00:06:56.530> to<00:06:56.560> him<00:06:56.740> letting<00:06:57.010> off<00:06:57.190> just<00:06:57.460> a<00:06:57.580> little<00:06:57.610> bit

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 
up to him letting off just a little bit

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.400 
up to him letting off just a little bit
so<00:06:58.150> he<00:06:58.210> doesn't<00:06:58.419> catch<00:06:58.510> too<00:06:58.780> much<00:06:58.930> air<00:06:59.169> but

00:06:59.400 --> 00:06:59.410 
so he doesn't catch too much air but

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.110 
so he doesn't catch too much air but
then<00:06:59.740> we<00:06:59.830> seen<00:07:00.039> Jerry<00:07:00.280> with<00:07:00.430> snake<00:07:00.669> by<00:07:00.850> just

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 
then we seen Jerry with snake by just

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.630 
then we seen Jerry with snake by just
kind<00:07:01.360> of<00:07:01.479> batten<00:07:02.020> it<00:07:02.169> and<00:07:02.350> catching<00:07:02.710> some<00:07:02.950> some

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:03.640 
kind of batten it and catching some some

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.190 
kind of batten it and catching some some
pretty<00:07:03.820> huge<00:07:04.120> air<00:07:04.330> here<00:07:04.570> in<00:07:04.690> the<00:07:04.780> the<00:07:05.020> Tulsa

break<00:07:08.140> a<00:07:08.169> couple<00:07:08.410> of<00:07:08.500> shocks<00:07:08.740> they've<00:07:09.039> been

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.160 
break a couple of shocks they've been

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.140 
break a couple of shocks they've been
this<00:07:09.250> way<00:07:09.490> barred

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.150 
this way barred

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.120 
this way barred
a<00:07:10.180> few<00:07:10.690> other<00:07:10.840> things<00:07:10.960> so<00:07:11.410> there<00:07:11.560> is<00:07:11.740> technique

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:12.130 
a few other things so there is technique

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.409 
a few other things so there is technique
here<00:07:12.370> there's<00:07:12.580> definitely<00:07:12.910> starting<00:07:13.270> line<00:07:13.390> a

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:13.419 
here there's definitely starting line a

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:15.659 
here there's definitely starting line a
technique<00:07:13.870> with<00:07:14.350> how<00:07:14.530> how<00:07:15.160> aggressive<00:07:15.580> you

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:15.669 
technique with how how aggressive you

get with this dirt use this dirt will

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.540 
get with this dirt use this dirt will
blow<00:07:17.320> away<00:07:17.440> these<00:07:17.860> guys<00:07:18.070> have<00:07:18.250> got<00:07:18.370> enough

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:18.550 
blow away these guys have got enough

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.610 
blow away these guys have got enough
horsepower<00:07:18.880> they<00:07:19.510> can<00:07:19.660> leave<00:07:19.810> ruts<00:07:20.140> down<00:07:20.380> here

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:20.620 
horsepower they can leave ruts down here

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.230 
horsepower they can leave ruts down here
you<00:07:20.770> know<00:07:20.890> and<00:07:21.039> that<00:07:21.190> gets<00:07:21.370> them<00:07:21.490> nowhere<00:07:21.700> your

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 
you know and that gets them nowhere your

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.400 
you know and that gets them nowhere your
tires<00:07:22.450> are<00:07:22.600> spinning<00:07:22.720> they're<00:07:22.990> not<00:07:23.110> moving

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:23.410 
tires are spinning they're not moving

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.380 
tires are spinning they're not moving
forward<00:07:23.700> so<00:07:24.700> you're<00:07:24.850> coming<00:07:25.000> out<00:07:25.120> in<00:07:25.210> the<00:07:25.270> hole

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:25.390 
forward so you're coming out in the hole

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.810 
forward so you're coming out in the hole
guys<00:07:25.630> too<00:07:25.810> early<00:07:26.080> shift<00:07:26.320> and<00:07:26.530> usually<00:07:26.890> and<00:07:27.610> try

bring<00:07:35.470> the<00:07:35.590> front<00:07:35.800> end<00:07:35.950> down

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:36.289 
bring the front end down

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.469 
bring the front end down
a<00:07:36.319> little<00:07:36.619> bit<00:07:36.740> is<00:07:37.520> to<00:07:37.699> get<00:07:37.909> the<00:07:37.969> major<00:07:38.180> here

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:39.649 
kind of points the front end where it

00:07:39.649 --> 00:07:43.389 
kind of points the front end where it
needs<00:07:39.830> to<00:07:39.919> go<00:07:40.039> and<00:07:41.020> if<00:07:42.020> the<00:07:42.169> other<00:07:42.289> guy<00:07:42.469> gets
