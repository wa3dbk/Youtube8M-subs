 raising the water but since we change 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.119
 clothes and when twice a day and sometimes more often and 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.780
 etc 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.500
 worth noting that i 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.510
 and this kaleidoscope makes us home 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.839
 that fashion well then start her client 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:42.120
 it's completely wrong 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.170
 therefore not always a lot of 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.579

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.010
 in other words it was a fashion it was 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.489
 fascination is a stunning view of water 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.949
 criticism madness more 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:02.930
 nothing they will not force 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.280
 i can say the same from 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.760
 Alexander Vasin 35 historian 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.970
 collective crazy 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.170
 of course 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.870
 this is the beauty 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.380
 and understand why people went to sums 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.920
 in the 18th century at the seams 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.900
 and why in the course of the first should be 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.050
 Everything is OK with a high-waisted Russian 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.640

 has changed 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.510
 and here so changed the interpretation of the body why 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.440
 one time the same person is one without a heel 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.110
 then it was necessary to meet on the heels 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.440
 and why 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.230
 because I don't have everything historical 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.810

 they demand couture and when it won't 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:49.680
 cost-effective 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.299
 at the expense of the enterprise 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.469
 for this segment the superstructure is completely

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:10.610
 to make 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.690
 there was also a generation of monarchies when there were

 such Christie and minutes look like 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.089
 having enjoyed but also fed the game 

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:29.989

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.520
 why am I talking about the Belgian kim

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.499
 all changes in the area reported that 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:15.730

 corset 5 sexy st belgrade 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:35.959
 such because it also depends on 

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:37.240
 numbers of men 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.380

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.530
 we already came to the conclusion that the knitwear 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.979

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:50.020
 won in all 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.470
 since their students have absolutely 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.640
 everyone who has gone 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.710
 basically everything you wear before was 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.740

 left pajamas are very necessary standard but 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.760
 and I think that it was less convenient and and it 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.860
 right after the solo revolution because 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.650
 women wanted to kill a man more 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.930

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.700
 what does this have to do with it 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.400
 but I never understood the question 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.400
