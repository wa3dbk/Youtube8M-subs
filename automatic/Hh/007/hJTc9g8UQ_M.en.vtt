amount<00:01:41.390> armor<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:41.900> weapons<00:01:42.259> um<00:01:42.560> I<00:01:43.630> you<00:01:44.630> know

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
amount armor and weapons um I you know

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.139 
amount armor and weapons um I you know
did<00:01:45.170> my<00:01:45.320> own<00:01:45.350> thing<00:01:45.500> to<00:01:45.860> get<00:01:45.950> in<00:01:46.070> there<00:01:46.220> and<00:01:46.369> it

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
did my own thing to get in there and it

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.230 
did my own thing to get in there and it
is<00:01:47.420> a<00:01:47.869> good<00:01:48.440> castle<00:01:49.160> it's<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.399> little<00:01:49.640> bit<00:01:49.820> far

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
is a good castle it's a little bit far

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.029 
is a good castle it's a little bit far
from<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:50.660> right<00:01:50.869> of<00:01:50.990> spawn<00:01:51.320> like<00:01:51.619> I've<00:01:51.800> sped

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
from the right of spawn like I've sped

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.130 
from the right of spawn like I've sped
this<00:01:52.160> up<00:01:52.280> a<00:01:52.430> bit<00:01:52.460> it<00:01:52.789> takes<00:01:53.420> a<00:01:53.600> little<00:01:53.810> bit<00:01:53.960> of<00:01:54.020> a

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
this up a bit it takes a little bit of a

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.270 
this up a bit it takes a little bit of a
journey<00:01:54.320> to<00:01:54.530> get<00:01:54.649> there<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.009> there's<00:01:55.130> some

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
journey to get there and there's some

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.249 
journey to get there and there's some
chess<00:01:55.490> on<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.789> way<00:01:55.910> there<00:01:56.179> but<00:01:56.420> it's<00:01:56.929> pretty

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
chess on the way there but it's pretty

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:58.779 
chess on the way there but it's pretty
easy<00:01:57.470> to<00:01:57.649> get<00:01:57.860> there<00:01:58.070> and<00:01:58.250> once<00:01:58.460> you<00:01:58.610> there

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
easy to get there and once you there

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.490 
easy to get there and once you there
it's<00:01:59.090> well<00:01:59.390> worth<00:01:59.600> it<00:01:59.810> just<00:01:59.899> try<00:02:00.140> not<00:02:00.170> to<00:02:00.289> die

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
it's well worth it just try not to die

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.590 
it's well worth it just try not to die
because<00:02:00.830> money<00:02:01.640> to<00:02:01.759> make<00:02:01.880> some<00:02:02.030> bandages<00:02:02.509> or

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
because money to make some bandages or

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.060 
because money to make some bandages or
something<00:02:02.780> like<00:02:02.840> that<00:02:02.899> but<00:02:03.259> it's<00:02:03.830> well<00:02:04.039> worth

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
something like that but it's well worth

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.910 
something like that but it's well worth
it<00:02:04.840> apparently<00:02:05.840> from<00:02:06.020> what<00:02:06.080> I've<00:02:06.350> heard<00:02:06.380> about

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
it apparently from what I've heard about

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.130 
it apparently from what I've heard about
this<00:02:07.070> seed<00:02:07.310> if<00:02:07.729> other<00:02:08.360> people<00:02:08.720> have<00:02:08.810> also

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
this seed if other people have also

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.360 
this seed if other people have also
found<00:02:09.380> like<00:02:10.540> like<00:02:11.540> burnished<00:02:12.320> chests<00:02:12.800> but

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
found like like burnished chests but

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.610 
found like like burnished chests but
then<00:02:13.489> this<00:02:13.700> was<00:02:13.880> pre<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.690> update<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.410> just

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
then this was pre the update that just

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.620 
then this was pre the update that just
came<00:02:15.799> out<00:02:15.829> for<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.250> offended<00:02:16.820> koala<00:02:17.060> update

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
came out for the offended koala update

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.080 
came out for the offended koala update
so<00:02:17.930> not<00:02:18.530> all<00:02:18.709> of<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:19.010> is<00:02:19.070> confirmed<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.760> still

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
so not all of it is confirmed to still

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.580 
so not all of it is confirmed to still
be<00:02:20.299> there<00:02:20.540> but<00:02:20.570> I<00:02:20.780> know<00:02:20.930> there's<00:02:21.260> definitely

a glitch castle and now we're gonna move

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.039 
a glitch castle and now we're gonna move
on<00:02:48.200> to<00:02:48.350> our<00:02:48.380> number<00:02:48.799> one<00:02:49.010> for<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.280> week<00:02:50.049> number

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
on to our number one for the week number

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.120 
on to our number one for the week number
one<00:02:51.829> and<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:53.720> moving<00:02:53.989> down<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.200> our<00:02:54.530> number<00:02:54.860> one

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
one and so moving down to our number one

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.210 
one and so moving down to our number one
on<00:02:55.400> this<00:02:55.610> week's<00:02:55.940> countdown<00:02:56.720> list<00:02:57.230> you<00:02:58.010> move

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
on this week's countdown list you move

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.699 
on this week's countdown list you move
on<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.640> another<00:02:58.760> planet<00:02:59.329> that<00:02:59.720> is<00:02:59.930> a<00:03:00.079> forest

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
on to another planet that is a forest

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.420 
on to another planet that is a forest
one<00:03:01.010> it's<00:03:01.310> found<00:03:01.579> in<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.910> Alpha<00:03:02.540> lamboda<00:03:03.430> CEP

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
one it's found in the Alpha lamboda CEP

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.670 
one it's found in the Alpha lamboda CEP
66<00:03:05.150> for<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.810> on<00:03:06.560> this<00:03:07.220> planet<00:03:07.910> has<00:03:08.420> a<00:03:08.780> pulse<00:03:09.200> jump

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
66 for a on this planet has a pulse jump

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.610 
66 for a on this planet has a pulse jump
to<00:03:10.579> the<00:03:10.760> right<00:03:10.940> of<00:03:11.180> spawn<00:03:11.630> it<00:03:12.260> should<00:03:12.500> be<00:03:12.590> just

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
to the right of spawn it should be just

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.380 
to the right of spawn it should be just
in<00:03:12.920> a<00:03:12.980> little<00:03:13.220> cave<00:03:13.430> as<00:03:13.700> i'll<00:03:13.910> be<00:03:13.940> showing<00:03:14.209> you

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
and then also to the left of spawn there

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.000 
and then also to the left of spawn there
is<00:03:16.880> another<00:03:17.090> tech<00:03:17.480> chest<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:18.170> there's<00:03:18.739> also

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
is another tech chest and there's also

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.910 
is another tech chest and there's also
an<00:03:19.370> apex<00:03:20.060> left<00:03:20.330> this<00:03:20.569> this<00:03:20.959> this<00:03:21.650> one<00:03:22.040> is

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
towards this next tech chest and it's

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.340 
towards this next tech chest and it's
just<00:03:43.709> out<00:03:43.920> in<00:03:44.280> plain<00:03:44.550> sight<00:03:44.850> easy<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.810> find<00:03:45.989> I

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
there's also an apex lab even further up

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.920 
there's also an apex lab even further up
feeling<00:03:59.790> it's<00:03:59.880> more<00:03:59.940> XP<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:00.600> maybe<00:04:00.750> some
