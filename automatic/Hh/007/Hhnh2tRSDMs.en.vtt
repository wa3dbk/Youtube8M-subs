00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:18.919
 The Renaissance of 2012 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:21.859
 Let me use flowers 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.019
 If you ask the following music 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.149
 Of each modern society 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.169
 In various fields- 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.120
 I think I need a renaissance spirit 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.730
 Naturally one field is ecology 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.739
 Or 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.739
 What about environmental 19 minutes 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.690
 My mother is very impressed by this place 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.600
 Is 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.980
 Old Japanese 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.440
 Unbelievably high level 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.220
 Ecology 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.690
 I think it was 21,000 yen every day 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.100
 Daily victory with nature 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.700
 In such 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.020
 They are 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.540
 In what spirit 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.100
 Water 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.100
 In the aspect of being able to claim the word of life 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.890
 Did they break through? 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.600
 Just special flight guests 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.640
 Autumn leaves 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.979
 Corporation- 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.210
 You are the Vice President 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.740
 You are Yoko Koga 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.670
 4 days in a row 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.640
 from now 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.369
 Make the map function 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.610
 I want to receive 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.420
 Well it is first of all 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.850
 The situation of full water pollution is becoming a serious problem worldwide 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.520
 What kind of flow do you have? 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.050
 In this case blocks are often 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.869
 Did you get to 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.500
 Register in a 21st Century environment, not a regular block 

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:55.110
 In terms of 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.850
 Because there is a US factory and a mold 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.700
 Yeah when i was inspired 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.740
 Though 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.130
 It will be interesting from the bathroom with this block voice 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.420
 It's just that one inspiration 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.639
 Research for about 10 years to the body 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.870
 It is said that it should be normalized to this 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.689
 Completed 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:15.670
 this 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.659
 Kitagawa Eri water and 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:21.499
 What happens if you put it in the lake 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:25.540
 The cash that was in the eco came in 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.920
 It is a full-time job or archaea that has naturally been treated as a medium company 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.309
 Will eat 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:34.530
 So it is simple with the power of nature 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.059
 Can clean the water at the back 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:40.849
 Certify this small pond is polluted 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.409
 It will do so 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.409
 How does the city do it? 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.579
 Just one after another 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.860
 Though it is a quite simple method 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.770
 Such Japanese Communist Party 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.630
 Because I will be a great god 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.630
 You can imagine the natto bacteria 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.250
 It is good even in the snow, but it is necessary to set it up carefully 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:04.609
 There is 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.429
 The city has a contest, for example 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:10.429
 let me see 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.719
 Is this just enough? 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:17.019
 Was in the top ten in Guotais gold 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.980
 Then the effect is only a few 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.020
 That baby is in deficit 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.460
 Because there is a gap between the regions, it will be 200,000 yen beautiful 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.120
 And the role of this block disappears, but travel throughout Hong Kong 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.330
 This special number goes to the diary 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:41.709
 How to make depends on the book 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.659
 For example 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.329
 There are 9 corresponding ciphers in the park. 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.959
 The sun 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.079
 People who are conscious about the earth 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.109
 Though it is written about a circle 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.669
 Confirmation that took 2 years of the production 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:03.089
 In English 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:05.449
 Many say that 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:07.519
 I have to repeat 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.519
 The year is not good content 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.929
 It took 2 years 

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:16.299
 Then my wife this time 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.389
 To translate 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.139
 It takes half a year to one year 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.120
 Then I'm going to be a book for the first time 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.270
 Because this is a 45-year-old book 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.719
 To kill 1 at this pace 

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:34.960
 It's too late to hit 2010 information 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.280
 I thought in 2 minutes, but just 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.590
 At that time 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.500
 Encounter at Tokuma Publishing Co., Ltd., a house special number publishing company. 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.300
 I understand a new way 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.879
 English now 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:50.919
 Offset this camera 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:51.919
 to cas 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.020
 6- 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.800
 Mr. Saito also went to England together 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.219
 More than eight hours- 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:00.850
 With drama version nationalism 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.710
 I'm shooting a talk 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.669
 Next time 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.930
 Content of operability 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.029
 Because it seems natural 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:10.520
 To use warning 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.699
 This time, I went back to the publisher with the contents of the tape march. 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:19.939
 Third year of publication 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:21.050
 ing 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.099
 translator 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:23.330
 Art 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.020
 Because Nitta 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.020
 When you get translated 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.110
 Pandora's 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.809
 In a jungle similar to a dense forest 

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:37.050
 have been to 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.060
 Actually this is my story but my story 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:44.039
 I have been in such a genre 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:45.580
 at esco 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.849
 It's loose high cm 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:49.900
 Ran Ando 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.370
 The indigenous people's shift was also on the rise together 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:59.650
 Whatever 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.570
 Generals are more plant-like than picture arrests 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.710
 Jumping to an alchemist 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.469
 Share 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:09.740
 What is this story 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.619
 And I 

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:14.360
 Death family 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.960
 On the national flag of nanuki 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.889
 Only demons 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:22.059
 A world similar to memory 

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:24.259
 I have actually seen it 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:27.259
 I am going to go here and say 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:30.300
 Between ourselves 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.979
 Actually this Cameron is 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:34.460
 Different dimension 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.389
 I think it's a single digit 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:38.930
 It is said that 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.379
 The world called Pandora that his film is 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.800
 It is an abandoned city 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.870
 Yes, the company is a world where you come and go 

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:54.909
 So what's a very nostalgic place in everyone's mind 

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:55.879
 you know 

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:59.080
 A country that exists in our hearts 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.259
 What 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:02.559
 But I can not access easily 

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:04.830
 It is during 20 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.869
 If so, Kubrick too 

00:07:07.869 --> 00:07:09.119
 Cameron too 

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:14.949
 As a director, I cast a state of organizational awareness and saw another world 

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:21.859
 Not only what we saw but in the future we humanity is ours 

00:07:21.859 --> 00:07:24.969
 The policy also becomes such a world
