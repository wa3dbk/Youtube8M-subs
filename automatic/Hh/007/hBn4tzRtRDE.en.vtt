trip<00:00:21.869> lever<00:00:22.199> in<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:23.279> bathtub<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.539> the

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
trip lever in the bathtub this is the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.429 
trip lever in the bathtub this is the
trip<00:00:24.869> lever<00:00:25.109> as<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.099> sit<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.460> bathtub<00:00:26.640> and

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
trip lever as I sit in the bathtub and

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:34.639 
trip lever as I sit in the bathtub and
this<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.680> open<00:00:32.000> and/or<00:00:33.000> up<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.440> water

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
this is open and/or up so that the water

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.850 
this is open and/or up so that the water
doesn't<00:00:34.890> come<00:00:35.070> out<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:36.140> down<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.770> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
doesn't come out and down is so that the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.190 
doesn't come out and down is so that the
water<00:00:38.040> drains<00:00:38.460> well<00:00:39.329> what<00:00:39.540> happens<00:00:39.870> with<00:00:39.989> mine

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
water drains well what happens with mine

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.840 
water drains well what happens with mine
is<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.530> won't<00:00:40.680> go<00:00:40.829> down<00:00:41.070> anymore<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.640> wasn't

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
is it won't go down anymore and I wasn't

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.529 
is it won't go down anymore and I wasn't
sure<00:00:42.180> why<00:00:42.420> but<00:00:43.320> as<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.800> was<00:00:43.950> at<00:00:44.190> Lowe's<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.850> found

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
sure why but as I was at Lowe's I found

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.200 
sure why but as I was at Lowe's I found
a<00:00:45.809> trip<00:00:46.110> lever<00:00:46.350> style<00:00:46.800> tub<00:00:47.070> faceplate<00:00:47.910> and

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
a trip lever style tub faceplate and

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.920 
a trip lever style tub faceplate and
that<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.350> right<00:00:49.680> here<00:00:50.480> price<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.719> this

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
that is this right here price on this

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.389 
that is this right here price on this
something<00:00:52.410> like<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.860> think<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.190> five

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
something like this I think is five

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.069 
something like this I think is five
dollars<00:00:53.610> I've<00:00:53.969> already<00:00:54.239> opened<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.870> save

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
dollars I've already opened it to save

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.209 
dollars I've already opened it to save
time<00:00:56.030> trip<00:00:57.030> lever<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:58.050> I've<00:00:58.710> already<00:00:58.890> also

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
time trip lever and I've already also

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.700 
time trip lever and I've already also
taken<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.820> screws<00:01:00.239> out<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.199> first<00:01:01.440> thing

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
taken the screws out so the first thing

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.549 
taken the screws out so the first thing
I<00:01:01.800> guess<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.160> want<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.430> do<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:03.049> plug<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.290> drain

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
I guess you want to do is plug the drain

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.120 
I guess you want to do is plug the drain
so<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.400> whatever<00:01:06.180> you're<00:01:06.450> taking<00:01:06.810> out<00:01:07.590> like

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
so that whatever you're taking out like

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
so that whatever you're taking out like
the<00:01:08.280> screws<00:01:08.549> don't<00:01:08.850> fall<00:01:09.119> out<00:01:10.729> take<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.760> out

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
the screws don't fall out take that out

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.550 
the screws don't fall out take that out
and<00:01:13.610> this<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.670> connected<00:01:15.330> right<00:01:15.360> here<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.049> what

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
and this is connected right here so what

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.670 
and this is connected right here so what
happened<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.189> guess<00:01:17.990> so<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.259> doesn't<00:01:19.560> stay

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
happened I guess so that it doesn't stay

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.010 
happened I guess so that it doesn't stay
down<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.189> as<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.700> can<00:01:20.729> see<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.119> spring<00:01:21.540> right

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
down is as you can see the spring right

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.620 
down is as you can see the spring right
there<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.580> rusted<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.820> not<00:01:24.150> supposed<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.540> look

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
down and stop it from just a moment as I

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.200

I<00:01:48.420> should<00:01:48.479> probably<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:49.200> regular

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
I should probably have regular

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.289 
I should probably have regular
needlenose<00:01:50.070> pliers<00:01:50.549> but<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.880> couldn't<00:01:51.149> find

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
needlenose pliers but I couldn't find

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.020 
needlenose pliers but I couldn't find
them<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.659> I've<00:01:51.750> got<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.990> bent<00:01:52.170> nose<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:53.030> this

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
them so I've got the bent nose and this

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.050 
them so I've got the bent nose and this
actually<00:01:54.479> was<00:01:54.689> kind<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.229> forked<00:01:55.649> out<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.790> that

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
actually was kind of forked out so that

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.550 
actually was kind of forked out so that
it<00:01:57.360> would<00:01:57.479> go<00:01:57.630> through<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:57.960> hold<00:01:58.170> its<00:01:58.380> place

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
it would go through and hold its place

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.370 
it would go through and hold its place
but<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.189> straightened<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.299> out<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.869> pulled<00:02:01.229> it

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
but I straightened it out and pulled it

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.109 
but I straightened it out and pulled it
so<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:01.979> he<00:02:02.040> came<00:02:02.250> out<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.610> one<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.000> way

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
so that he came out and one of the way

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.140 
so that he came out and one of the way
to<00:02:03.180> do

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
to do

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.609 
to do

in that position so it's good to go and
that<00:03:45.190> was<00:03:45.310> very<00:03:45.610> easy<00:03:45.880> did<00:03:46.209> not<00:03:46.480> need<00:03:46.660> a

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720
