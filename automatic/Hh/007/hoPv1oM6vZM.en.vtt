00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
for the drummers now we're asking about

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.909 
for the drummers now we're asking about
the<00:00:03.510> guilt<00:00:03.870> so<00:00:04.049> motion<00:00:04.259> is<00:00:04.589> really<00:00:04.950> simple

00:00:06.909 --> 00:00:06.919 
the guilt so motion is really simple

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:09.290 
the guilt so motion is really simple
the<00:00:07.919> heel<00:00:08.130> comes<00:00:08.460> down<00:00:08.550> against<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.000> stroke

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
the heel comes down against the stroke

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.480 
the heel comes down against the stroke
as<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:09.750> go<00:00:09.870> further<00:00:10.200> down<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.710> pedal<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:11.190> found

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
as you go further down the pedal I found

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.400 
as you go further down the pedal I found
out<00:00:11.759> what<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.360> was<00:00:12.570> doing<00:00:12.630> for<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.139> double

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
out what I was doing for the double

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.519 
out what I was doing for the double
stroke<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.830> that<00:00:14.370> they<00:00:14.490> went<00:00:14.700> further<00:00:14.880> back

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:15.529 
stroke is that they went further back

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:20.029 
stroke is that they went further back
I'm<00:00:16.529> playing<00:00:16.859> here<00:00:17.100> but<00:00:17.160> I'm<00:00:17.400> still<00:00:18.770> using<00:00:19.770> the

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
I'm playing here but I'm still using the

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.099 
I'm playing here but I'm still using the
heel<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:21.029> get<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.300> stroke<00:00:21.570> otherwise<00:00:21.930> I

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
heel to get the stroke otherwise I

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.089 
heel to get the stroke otherwise I
wouldn't<00:00:24.410> you<00:00:25.410> wouldn't<00:00:25.590> be<00:00:25.710> able<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.920> get<00:00:26.010> the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
wouldn't you wouldn't be able to get the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.670 
wouldn't you wouldn't be able to get the
stroke<00:00:26.369> off<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.000> floor<00:00:27.210> I'm<00:00:27.510> just<00:00:27.750> telling

too<00:01:30.509> big<00:01:30.780> for<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.079> pedal<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.560> course<00:01:32.280> slide

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
too big for the pedal of course slide

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.330 
too big for the pedal of course slide
back<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.180> paddle<00:01:38.689> but<00:01:39.689> it's<00:01:39.810> still<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
back on the paddle but it's still the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.770 
back on the paddle but it's still the
you<00:01:41.340> see<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:41.939> still<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> heel<00:01:42.479> going

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
you see that it's still the heel going

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.230 
you see that it's still the heel going
down<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.290> causes<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.740> motion<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:45.060> get

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
down that causes that motion you can get

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.300 
down that causes that motion you can get
up<00:01:48.170> okay<00:01:49.170> that's<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.560> with<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> version<00:01:49.979> where

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
up okay that's like with a version where

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.130 
up okay that's like with a version where
guys<00:01:50.729> like<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.119> are<00:01:51.180> tapping<00:01:53.570> my<00:01:54.570> heels<00:01:54.960> not

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
guys like that are tapping my heels not

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.859 
guys like that are tapping my heels not
coming<00:01:55.409> down<00:01:55.530> there

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.760 

guys<00:02:02.869> that<00:02:03.020> are<00:02:03.079> bringing<00:02:03.290> their<00:02:03.470> whole<00:02:03.590> leg

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
guys that are bringing their whole leg

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.920 
guys that are bringing their whole leg
down<00:02:03.979> like<00:02:04.189> that<00:02:04.399> it's<00:02:04.670> whether<00:02:05.390> they<00:02:05.630> think

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
down like that it's whether they think

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.840 
down like that it's whether they think
it<00:02:06.049> or<00:02:06.170> not<00:02:06.380> they're<00:02:06.710> still<00:02:06.740> controlling<00:02:07.729> that

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
it or not they're still controlling that

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.670 
it or not they're still controlling that
by<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.090> leg<00:02:08.360> moving<00:02:08.750> up<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:08.989> down<00:02:11.560> that's<00:02:12.560> a

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
by the leg moving up and down that's a

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.780 
by the leg moving up and down that's a
different<00:02:13.010> kind<00:02:13.069> of<00:02:13.220> a<00:02:13.280> stroke

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
different kind of a stroke

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.080 
different kind of a stroke
okay<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:14.560> whether<00:02:15.560> it's<00:02:15.800> a<00:02:15.950> smallest<00:02:16.849> you<00:02:17.030> a

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
okay so whether it's a smallest you a

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.870 
okay so whether it's a smallest you a
no-shoe<00:02:17.810> of<00:02:18.110> big<00:02:18.319> shoe<00:02:18.590> Mike<00:02:19.280> boot<00:02:19.519> whatever

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
no-shoe of big shoe Mike boot whatever

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:36.670 
no-shoe of big shoe Mike boot whatever
you<00:02:20.000> want<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.300> should<00:02:20.480> be<00:02:20.569> able<00:02:35.380> okay<00:02:36.380> so

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
you want you should be able okay so

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.650 
you want you should be able okay so
hopefully<00:02:36.950> that<00:02:37.310> will<00:02:37.400> help<00:02:38.030> clear<00:02:38.299> up<00:02:38.330> things

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
hopefully that will help clear up things

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.140 
hopefully that will help clear up things
a<00:02:38.780> little<00:02:38.989> bit
