00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
like I said isn't that easy you're going

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.410 
like I said isn't that easy you're going
to<00:00:40.260> have<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.590> take<00:00:40.800> off<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.370> cover<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.969> you're

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
to have to take off the cover and you're

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.540

one<00:03:11.320> side<00:03:11.650> but<00:03:12.280> not<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.520> other<00:03:12.790> so<00:03:13.330> we're<00:03:13.510> sigh

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
one side but not the other so we're sigh

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.750 
one side but not the other so we're sigh
are<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:14.020> gonna<00:03:14.110> put<00:03:14.380> in<00:03:14.500> you<00:03:15.100> can't<00:03:15.370> do<00:03:15.550> that

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
are you gonna put in you can't do that

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.729 
are you gonna put in you can't do that
because<00:03:16.030> not<00:03:16.480> only<00:03:16.510> does<00:03:16.989> it<00:03:17.050> not<00:03:17.230> look<00:03:17.350> pretty

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
because not only does it not look pretty

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.710 
because not only does it not look pretty
but<00:03:17.890> there's<00:03:18.220> cork<00:03:18.610> shown<00:03:18.910> and<00:03:19.120> that's<00:03:19.390> not

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
but there's cork shown and that's not

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.110 
but there's cork shown and that's not
very<00:03:20.020> attractive<00:03:20.580> so<00:03:21.580> you're<00:03:21.700> going<00:03:21.850> to<00:03:21.940> put

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
very attractive so you're going to put

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.810 
very attractive so you're going to put
on<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.360> side<00:03:22.600> it<00:03:23.080> doesn't<00:03:23.530> have<00:03:24.040> any<00:03:24.400> court

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
on the side it doesn't have any court

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.820 
on the side it doesn't have any court
because<00:03:25.180> then<00:03:25.510> it<00:03:25.750> hides<00:03:26.050> the<00:03:26.380> court<00:03:26.650> and

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
because then it hides the court and

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.160 
because then it hides the court and
makes<00:03:27.100> your<00:03:27.280> clarinet<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:28.000> you<00:03:28.300> look<00:03:28.630> so<00:03:28.930> much

I<00:04:52.840> know<00:04:52.960> I<00:04:53.110> did<00:04:53.290> because<00:04:53.620> I<00:04:53.970> learned<00:04:54.970> how<00:04:55.180> to

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
I know I did because I learned how to

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:03.810 
I know I did because I learned how to
sew<00:04:55.900> okay<00:04:57.810> okay<00:05:01.560> so<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:02.740> only<00:05:02.949> problem<00:05:03.789> that

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
sew okay okay so the only problem that

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.939 
sew okay okay so the only problem that
you<00:05:04.270> might<00:05:04.300> have<00:05:04.690> with<00:05:04.960> your<00:05:05.169> clarinet<00:05:05.740> is

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
putting in the reed like I said the rate

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.440 
putting in the reed like I said the rate
is<00:05:08.470> pretty<00:05:08.830> easy<00:05:09.160> to<00:05:09.370> put<00:05:09.550> it<00:05:09.639> just<00:05:09.970> just

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
is pretty easy to put it just just

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.490 
is pretty easy to put it just just
rewrite<00:05:10.990> blind<00:05:11.530> and<00:05:11.950> go<00:05:12.490> back<00:05:12.729> and<00:05:13.000> watch<00:05:13.500> so

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
now like I said make sure the

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.980 
now like I said make sure the
mouthpieces<00:05:17.919> face<00:05:18.280> for<00:05:18.520> you<00:05:18.669> and<00:05:18.990> there's
