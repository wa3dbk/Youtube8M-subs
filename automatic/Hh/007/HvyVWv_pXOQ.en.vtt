to show you guys how to change a

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.909 
to show you guys how to change a
speedometer<00:00:07.760> cable<00:00:08.179> on<00:00:08.570> a<00:00:08.630> Geo<00:00:09.230> Metro<00:00:09.469> I

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:09.919 
speedometer cable on a Geo Metro I

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:12.310 
speedometer cable on a Geo Metro I
believe<00:00:10.219> the<00:00:10.339> same<00:00:10.580> wood<00:00:10.879> this<00:00:11.450> is<00:00:11.539> a<00:00:11.599> 95<00:00:12.049> mile

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
believe the same wood this is a 95 mile

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.600 
believe the same wood this is a 95 mile
I<00:00:12.349> think<00:00:12.530> that<00:00:12.919> is<00:00:13.549> 95<00:00:14.059> -<00:00:14.299> maybe<00:00:14.480> 2001<00:00:15.550> so<00:00:16.550> I'm

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:16.610 
I think that is 95 - maybe 2001 so I'm

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:17.620 
I think that is 95 - maybe 2001 so I'm
going<00:00:16.730> to<00:00:16.760> show<00:00:16.850> you<00:00:16.940> how<00:00:17.000> to<00:00:17.090> do<00:00:17.240> it<00:00:17.390> first

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
going to show you how to do it first

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.450 
going to show you how to do it first
we're<00:00:17.870> going<00:00:17.960> to<00:00:18.110> pull<00:00:18.410> a<00:00:18.790> clip<00:00:19.790> out<00:00:20.770> the<00:00:21.770> part

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
we're going to pull a clip out the part

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.340 
we're going to pull a clip out the part
that<00:00:22.610> goes<00:00:22.730> into<00:00:22.910> the<00:00:23.030> transmission<00:00:23.450> and<00:00:23.750> then

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
that goes into the transmission and then

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.930 
that goes into the transmission and then
we're<00:00:24.560> going<00:00:24.650> to<00:00:24.740> push<00:00:25.100> the<00:00:25.280> grommet<00:00:25.670> in<00:00:25.760> that

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:25.940 
we're going to push the grommet in that

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.090 
we're going to push the grommet in that
goes<00:00:26.090> through<00:00:26.270> the<00:00:26.360> firewall<00:00:26.840> and<00:00:27.530> then<00:00:27.650> we

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.100 
goes through the firewall and then we

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.510 
goes through the firewall and then we
should<00:00:28.340> be<00:00:28.460> able<00:00:28.580> to<00:00:28.850> reach<00:00:29.060> under<00:00:29.480> the<00:00:29.570> dash

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
should be able to reach under the dash

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.160 
should be able to reach under the dash
without<00:00:31.520> having<00:00:31.820> to<00:00:31.880> remove<00:00:32.149> anything<00:00:32.419> to<00:00:32.960> get

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
without having to remove anything to get

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.270 
without having to remove anything to get
to<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:33.410> back<00:00:33.590> of<00:00:33.740> the<00:00:33.829> instrument<00:00:33.920> cluster

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
to the back of the instrument cluster

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.140 
to the back of the instrument cluster
push<00:00:35.180> down<00:00:35.390> a<00:00:35.420> little<00:00:35.660> clip<00:00:35.900> pull<00:00:36.500> it<00:00:36.650> out<00:00:36.829> and

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
push down a little clip pull it out and

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.410 
push down a little clip pull it out and
fish<00:00:38.150> it<00:00:38.300> through<00:00:38.329> the<00:00:38.600> firewall<00:00:39.410> and<00:00:39.710> then

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
fish it through the firewall and then

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.130 
fish it through the firewall and then
reverse<00:00:41.420> process

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
reverse process

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.530

here we go okay guys first step is to
here's<00:00:52.520> the<00:00:52.640> top<00:00:52.850> of<00:00:53.000> the<00:00:53.059> motor<00:00:53.210> come<00:00:54.200> down

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
here's the top of the motor come down

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.350 
here's the top of the motor come down
right<00:00:57.290> here<00:00:57.730> on<00:00:58.730> the<00:00:58.880> top<00:00:59.090> of<00:00:59.120> the

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
right here on the top of the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.260 
right here on the top of the
transmission<00:01:00.460> you<00:01:01.460> can<00:01:01.489> see<00:01:01.850> this<00:01:02.030> little

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
transmission you can see this little

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.310 
transmission you can see this little
dust<00:01:03.200> boot<00:01:03.440> here<00:01:03.800> you<00:01:04.339> can<00:01:04.489> just<00:01:04.640> grab<00:01:04.879> it<00:01:05.320> and

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
dust boot here you can just grab it and

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.820 
dust boot here you can just grab it and
slide<00:01:06.680> it<00:01:06.860> up<00:01:07.040> and<00:01:09.430> you<00:01:10.430> can<00:01:10.610> see<00:01:11.590> where<00:01:12.590> the

slide it up and you can see where the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.740 
slide it up and you can see where the
cable<00:01:13.340> goes<00:01:13.549> into<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:13.940> transmission<00:01:14.390> this

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
cable goes into the transmission this

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.109 
cable goes into the transmission this
one<00:01:14.960> is<00:01:15.170> broken<00:01:15.710> right<00:01:15.950> here<00:01:16.370> that's<00:01:16.610> why<00:01:16.970> I'm

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
one is broken right here that's why I'm

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.230 
one is broken right here that's why I'm
replacing<00:01:17.299> it<00:01:17.750> in<00:01:18.619> this<00:01:18.799> pull<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.820> cable<00:01:20.180> out

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
replacing it in this pull the cable out

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.230 
replacing it in this pull the cable out
of<00:01:20.390> there<00:01:20.510> that's<00:01:20.750> not<00:01:20.960> supposed<00:01:21.170> to<00:01:21.290> happen

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
right here is a ridge this little clip

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.310 
right here is a ridge this little clip
is<00:01:26.270> on<00:01:27.110> that<00:01:27.350> Ridge<00:01:27.790> just<00:01:28.790> pull<00:01:29.600> it<00:01:29.750> off<00:01:29.930> you

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
is on that Ridge just pull it off you

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.480 
is on that Ridge just pull it off you
can<00:01:30.439> just<00:01:30.470> do<00:01:30.680> it<00:01:30.710> with<00:01:30.860> your<00:01:30.920> fingers<00:01:31.130> and

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
can just do it with your fingers and

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.300 
can just do it with your fingers and
then<00:01:32.170> you're<00:01:33.170> going<00:01:33.260> to<00:01:33.350> have<00:01:33.470> to<00:01:33.619> wiggle<00:01:34.070> this

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
then you're going to have to wiggle this

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.460 
then you're going to have to wiggle this
and<00:01:35.299> pull<00:01:35.540> it<00:01:35.689> out<00:01:35.780> I'm<00:01:35.990> gonna<00:01:36.080> have<00:01:36.229> to<00:01:36.320> use

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
and pull it out I'm gonna have to use

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.760 
and pull it out I'm gonna have to use
some<00:01:36.650> pliers<00:01:36.830> with<00:01:37.220> it<00:01:37.630> but<00:01:38.630> then<00:01:39.110> once<00:01:39.680> you

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
some pliers with it but then once you

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.500 
some pliers with it but then once you
get<00:01:39.920> this<00:01:40.070> out<00:01:40.310> you'll<00:01:40.820> be<00:01:40.909> able<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:41.210> move<00:01:41.330> on

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
get this out you'll be able to move on

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.990 
get this out you'll be able to move on
to<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.689> next<00:01:41.840> step<00:01:42.250> okay<00:01:43.250> guys<00:01:43.430> once<00:01:43.729> you<00:01:43.850> get

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
to the next step okay guys once you get

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.640 
to the next step okay guys once you get
this<00:01:44.360> is<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:44.659> piece<00:01:44.869> this<00:01:45.170> is<00:01:45.320> what<00:01:45.470> it<00:01:45.590> will

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
this is the piece this is what it will

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.530 
this is the piece this is what it will
look<00:01:45.710> like<00:01:45.860> this<00:01:46.670> is<00:01:46.880> what<00:01:47.030> was<00:01:47.150> sticking<00:01:47.390> out

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
look like this is what was sticking out

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.910 
look like this is what was sticking out
of<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.689> top<00:01:47.750> of<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.080> transmission<00:01:48.380> like<00:01:48.799> I

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
of the top of the transmission like I

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.370 
of the top of the transmission like I
said<00:01:49.159> that<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.850> cable<00:01:50.210> of<00:01:50.299> mine<00:01:50.479> broke<00:01:50.930> here

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
said that the cable of mine broke here

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.469 
said that the cable of mine broke here
so<00:01:51.530> that's<00:01:51.680> why<00:01:51.799> the<00:01:52.640> cable<00:01:53.030> isn't<00:01:53.119> attached

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
so that's why the cable isn't attached

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.390 
so that's why the cable isn't attached
to<00:01:53.750> it<00:01:53.840> but<00:01:53.930> on<00:01:54.049> the<00:01:54.170> new<00:01:54.290> one<00:01:54.439> it<00:01:54.590> is<00:01:55.070> it's

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
to it but on the new one it is it's

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.539

follow here right next to the
the<00:02:15.890> brake<00:02:16.160> booster<00:02:17.590> here's<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.910> grommet

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
the brake booster here's the grommet

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.820 
the brake booster here's the grommet
where<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.180> goes<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:20.690> firewall<00:02:21.140> this<00:02:21.620> is

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
where it goes to the firewall this is

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.100 
where it goes to the firewall this is
the<00:02:22.270> speedometer<00:02:23.270> cable<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:23.660> what<00:02:23.780> we<00:02:23.870> need<00:02:24.020> to

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
the speedometer cable so what we need to

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.990 
the speedometer cable so what we need to
do<00:02:24.260> is<00:02:24.470> go<00:02:24.620> ahead<00:02:24.770> and<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.190> pop<00:02:25.940> this<00:02:26.240> out<00:02:28.000> just

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
do is go ahead and and pop this out just

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.290 
do is go ahead and and pop this out just
so<00:02:29.210> when<00:02:30.020> we<00:02:30.140> get<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.560> other<00:02:31.040> end<00:02:31.700> of<00:02:31.850> it<00:02:31.910> we'll

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
so when we get the other end of it we'll

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.090 
so when we get the other end of it we'll
be<00:02:32.420> able<00:02:32.570> to<00:02:32.750> fish<00:02:32.960> it<00:02:33.140> through<00:02:33.170> so<00:02:33.860> you<00:02:33.950> just

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.580 
be able to fish it through so you just
put<00:02:34.280> your<00:02:34.370> finger<00:02:34.640> around<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:34.970> edge<00:02:35.350> roll<00:02:36.350> it

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.100 
under the dash and and figure all that
out<00:04:40.360> but<00:04:40.870> then<00:04:41.620> you<00:04:41.890> install<00:04:42.130> this<00:04:42.490> grommet

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110

up<00:04:48.310> all<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.610> way<00:04:49.620> so<00:04:50.620> now<00:04:50.800> we're<00:04:51.070> down<00:04:51.640> to<00:04:51.700> our

up all the way so now we're down to our

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
transmission you can see there's there's

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.430 
transmission you can see there's there's
actually<00:05:03.640> a<00:05:03.700> little<00:05:03.970> notch<00:05:04.240> in<00:05:04.600> here<00:05:05.260> and<00:05:05.380> you

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
actually a little notch in here and you

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:12.830 
actually a little notch in here and you
want<00:05:05.620> to<00:05:05.710> try<00:05:05.830> to<00:05:05.890> line<00:05:06.190> up<00:05:06.490> I<00:05:08.820> can

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.660 

that<00:05:13.840> not<00:05:17.100> with<00:05:18.100> the<00:05:18.280> one<00:05:18.460> in<00:05:18.640> the

that not with the one in the

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.020 
that not with the one in the
transmission<00:05:20.250> what<00:05:21.250> you<00:05:21.370> do<00:05:21.490> is<00:05:21.640> you'll<00:05:21.790> slide

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
transmission what you do is you'll slide

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.460 
transmission what you do is you'll slide
it<00:05:22.180> back<00:05:22.330> into<00:05:22.600> the<00:05:22.750> top<00:05:22.960> of<00:05:22.990> the<00:05:23.140> transmission

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
it back into the top of the transmission

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.670 
it back into the top of the transmission
trying<00:05:24.310> to<00:05:24.370> line<00:05:24.550> up<00:05:24.700> those<00:05:24.850> notches<00:05:26.310> and<00:05:27.480> then

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
trying to line up those notches and then

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.500 
trying to line up those notches and then
you'll<00:05:29.680> reinsert<00:05:30.310> that<00:05:30.340> clip<00:05:30.850> which<00:05:31.480> will

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
you'll reinsert that clip which will

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.220 
you'll reinsert that clip which will
catch<00:05:31.870> the<00:05:32.200> catch<00:05:33.040> the<00:05:33.250> new<00:05:33.370> cable<00:05:33.730> right<00:05:33.820> here

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
catch the catch the new cable right here

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.760 
catch the catch the new cable right here
and<00:05:35.230> then<00:05:35.350> you<00:05:35.410> should<00:05:35.470> be<00:05:35.740> working<00:05:37.620> all<00:05:38.620> right

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
and then you should be working all right

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.440 
and then you should be working all right
here<00:05:39.190> it<00:05:39.280> is<00:05:39.390> working<00:05:40.390> it<00:05:41.200> works<00:05:42.210> you<00:05:43.210> know<00:05:43.300> all

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
here it is working it works you know all

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.250 
here it is working it works you know all
the<00:05:43.660> way<00:05:43.750> through<00:05:44.020> the<00:05:44.110> range<00:05:46.080> that<00:05:47.080> was<00:05:47.200> a

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
the way through the range that was a

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.920 
the way through the range that was a
fairly<00:05:47.530> simple<00:05:47.830> install<00:05:48.430> the<00:05:49.240> only<00:05:49.450> thing<00:05:49.690> is

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
fairly simple install the only thing is

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.260 
fairly simple install the only thing is
I<00:05:50.170> would<00:05:50.590> say<00:05:50.770> if<00:05:50.980> you're<00:05:51.130> a<00:05:51.160> bigger<00:05:51.430> bigger

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
I would say if you're a bigger bigger

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.440 
I would say if you're a bigger bigger
guy<00:05:53.310> try<00:05:54.310> to<00:05:54.370> get<00:05:54.520> a<00:05:54.550> friend<00:05:54.790> to<00:05:54.910> come<00:05:55.060> help<00:05:55.270> you

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
guy try to get a friend to come help you

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.440 
guy try to get a friend to come help you
that's<00:05:56.320> a<00:05:56.410> little<00:05:56.530> smaller<00:05:56.920> it<00:05:57.640> definitely

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
that's a little smaller it definitely

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.120 
that's a little smaller it definitely
helps<00:05:58.720> out<00:05:58.870> that's<00:05:59.230> that<00:05:59.650> was<00:05:59.770> the<00:05:59.860> hardest

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
helps out that's that was the hardest

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.480 
helps out that's that was the hardest
thing<00:06:00.370> is<00:06:01.020> actually<00:06:02.130> clipping<00:06:03.130> it<00:06:03.220> from<00:06:03.400> the

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
thing is actually clipping it from the

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.740 
thing is actually clipping it from the
back<00:06:03.640> of<00:06:03.790> the<00:06:03.850> transmission<00:06:04.270> getting<00:06:04.660> your

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
back of the transmission getting your

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.350 
back of the transmission getting your
arm<00:06:04.900> up<00:06:05.110> in<00:06:05.260> there<00:06:05.410> that's<00:06:05.620> not<00:06:05.710> so<00:06:06.010> bad<00:06:06.360> the

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
arm up in there that's not so bad the

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.090 
arm up in there that's not so bad the
only<00:06:07.450> thing<00:06:07.720> is<00:06:07.840> you<00:06:07.990> you<00:06:08.350> know<00:06:08.440> laying<00:06:08.680> upside

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
only thing is you you know laying upside

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.960 
only thing is you you know laying upside
down<00:06:09.780> the<00:06:10.780> new<00:06:10.960> cable<00:06:11.470> is<00:06:11.650> really<00:06:12.340> tight<00:06:12.640> to

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
down the new cable is really tight to

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.150 
down the new cable is really tight to
slide<00:06:13.300> into<00:06:13.600> the<00:06:13.690> transmission<00:06:14.440> it's<00:06:14.980> like

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
slide into the transmission it's like

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.580 
slide into the transmission it's like
barely<00:06:15.460> long<00:06:15.880> enough<00:06:16.180> so<00:06:16.780> I<00:06:16.840> had<00:06:17.230> to<00:06:17.320> kind<00:06:17.470> of

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
barely long enough so I had to kind of

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.440 
barely long enough so I had to kind of
you<00:06:17.710> know<00:06:17.860> finagle<00:06:18.790> with<00:06:18.820> it<00:06:19.120> and<00:06:19.270> make<00:06:19.420> sure

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
you know finagle with it and make sure

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.050
