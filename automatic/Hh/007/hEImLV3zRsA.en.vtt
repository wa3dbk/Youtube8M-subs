spec ops mission called resistance
movement<00:01:15.060> using<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.020> knife<00:01:16.320> jump<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.799> can<00:01:16.830> get

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
movement using a knife jump you can get

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.190 
movement using a knife jump you can get
out<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.759> map<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.270> top<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.900> lot<00:01:19.080> of

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
out of the map and on top of a lot of

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.399 
out of the map and on top of a lot of
roofs<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:20.430> was<00:01:20.580> found<00:01:20.790> by<00:01:20.939> me<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.720> ex<00:01:22.049> andrew

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
roofs this was found by me and ex andrew

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.340 
roofs this was found by me and ex andrew
2007<00:01:23.220> x<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:24.180> reason<00:01:24.540> i<00:01:24.630> like<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:24.960> one<00:01:25.140> so

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
2007 x the reason i like this one so

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.469 
2007 x the reason i like this one so
much<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.830> because<00:01:25.890> at<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> time<00:01:26.909> nobody

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
much is because at the time nobody

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.819 
much is because at the time nobody
thought<00:01:27.840> you'd<00:01:28.049> get<00:01:28.290> out<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.619> map

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
thought you'd get out of this map

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.460 
thought you'd get out of this map
because<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.220> surrounded<00:01:29.340> by<00:01:29.759> buildings<00:01:30.470> but

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
because it's surrounded by buildings but

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.530 
because it's surrounded by buildings but
me<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.040> andrew<00:01:32.369> put<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> lot<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.090> time<00:01:33.390> and

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
me and andrew put a lot of time and

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.140 
me and andrew put a lot of time and
effort<00:01:33.630> into<00:01:33.960> finding<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:36.030> this

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
effort into finding this and I like this

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.399 
effort into finding this and I like this
one<00:01:36.210> because<00:01:36.450> there's<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.780> lot<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:36.930> freedoms

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
one because there's a lot of freedoms

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.109 
one because there's a lot of freedoms
you<00:01:37.560> can<00:01:37.710> literally<00:01:37.950> run<00:01:38.189> along<00:01:38.400> hundreds<00:01:39.030> of

another<00:01:56.340> spec<00:01:56.700> ops<00:01:56.909> mission<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:58.020> one<00:01:58.290> is

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
another spec ops mission this one is

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.100 
another spec ops mission this one is
called<00:01:58.680> hit<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:58.979> run<00:01:59.280> now<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.850> reason<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.600> like

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
called hit and run now the reason I like

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.649 
called hit and run now the reason I like
this<00:02:01.259> one<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.649> much<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:02.100> because<00:02:02.509> you<00:02:03.509> can

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
this one so much is because you can

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.950 
this one so much is because you can
literally<00:02:03.990> fly<00:02:04.380> around<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.040> helicopter

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
literally fly around on a helicopter

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.240 
literally fly around on a helicopter
this<00:02:06.960> one<00:02:07.140> was<00:02:07.259> found<00:02:07.380> by<00:02:07.590> me<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:07.890> ex<00:02:08.009> andrew

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
this one was found by me and ex andrew

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.700 
this one was found by me and ex andrew
2007<00:02:08.940> x<00:02:09.090> first<00:02:09.750> you're<00:02:10.140> going<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.319> want<00:02:10.440> to

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
2007 x first you're going to want to

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.770 
2007 x first you're going to want to
out<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:11.010> the<00:02:11.070> map<00:02:11.280> then<00:02:11.850> on<00:02:12.060> top<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:12.510> roof

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
out of the map then on top of this roof

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.930 
out of the map then on top of this roof
and<00:02:13.050> we<00:02:13.680> figured<00:02:14.010> out<00:02:14.100> that<00:02:14.310> if<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.460> mess<00:02:14.760> with

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
and we figured out that if you mess with

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.460 
and we figured out that if you mess with
the<00:02:15.000> helicopter<00:02:15.540> enough<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:15.900> will<00:02:15.960> go<00:02:16.080> close

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
the helicopter enough it will go close

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.710 
the helicopter enough it will go close
to<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.680> roof<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.100> you<00:02:17.220> can<00:02:17.370> jump<00:02:17.640> on<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.970> now

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
to the roof and you can jump on it now

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.990 
to the roof and you can jump on it now
the<00:02:19.410> fact<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.800> you<00:02:20.010> could<00:02:20.190> fly<00:02:20.580> around<00:02:20.640> on<00:02:20.910> a

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
the fact that you could fly around on a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.490 
the fact that you could fly around on a
helicopter<00:02:21.240> when<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:21.900> weren't<00:02:22.020> supposed<00:02:22.350> to

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
helicopter when you weren't supposed to

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.050 
helicopter when you weren't supposed to
we<00:02:22.620> found<00:02:22.890> hilarious<00:02:23.490> I<00:02:23.640> think<00:02:23.850> we<00:02:23.940> laughed

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
we found hilarious I think we laughed

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.600 
we found hilarious I think we laughed
for<00:02:24.210> a<00:02:24.330> straight<00:02:24.600> hour<00:02:24.830> but<00:02:25.830> this<00:02:26.190> one<00:02:26.370> didn't

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
for a straight hour but this one didn't

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.120 
for a straight hour but this one didn't
get<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:26.820> much<00:02:26.910> attention<00:02:27.090> because<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.890> fact

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
get that much attention because the fact

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.270 
get that much attention because the fact
that<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.550> was<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.730> spec<00:02:30.300> ops<00:02:30.510> mission--<00:02:30.840> glitch

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
that it was a spec ops mission-- glitch

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.190 
that it was a spec ops mission-- glitch
but<00:02:32.280> nevertheless<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.420> was<00:02:33.450> still<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.780> great

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
but nevertheless it was still a great

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.070 
but nevertheless it was still a great
glitch<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:35.070> was<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.190> lot<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.460> fun<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.730> do<00:02:36.080> so

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
glitch and it was a lot of fun to do so

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.700 
glitch and it was a lot of fun to do so
let's<00:02:37.980> head<00:02:38.100> on<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.520> number<00:02:38.820> three<00:02:39.710> from

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
let's head on to number three from

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.350 
let's head on to number three from
number<00:02:41.040> three<00:02:41.310> we're<00:02:41.520> gonna<00:02:41.610> head<00:02:41.880> on<00:02:41.910> over<00:02:42.030> to

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
number three we're gonna head on over to

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.780 
number three we're gonna head on over to
call<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.930> duty<00:02:43.110> ghosts<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:44.040> worst<00:02:44.340> call<00:02:44.670> of

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
call of duty ghosts the worst call of

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.910 
call of duty ghosts the worst call of
duty<00:02:45.060> game<00:02:45.270> in<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.690> whole<00:02:45.900> franchise<00:02:46.260> but

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
duty game in the whole franchise but

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.330 
duty game in the whole franchise but
let's<00:02:47.220> not<00:02:47.340> get<00:02:47.760> me<00:02:47.880> started<00:02:48.120> on<00:02:48.300> that<00:02:49.340> the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
let's not get me started on that the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.860 
let's not get me started on that the
reason<00:02:50.580> I<00:02:50.640> chose<00:02:50.820> this<00:02:50.880> one<00:02:51.180> was<00:02:51.450> because<00:02:51.750> it

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
reason I chose this one was because it

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.330 
reason I chose this one was because it
was<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.050> first<00:02:52.080> out<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.470> map<00:02:52.710> found<00:02:53.040> for<00:02:53.250> the

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
was the first out of map found for the

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.890 
was the first out of map found for the
entire<00:02:53.640> game<00:02:53.940> which<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:54.330> thought<00:02:54.510> was<00:02:54.720> really

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
entire game which I thought was really

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.100 
entire game which I thought was really
cool<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.620> was<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.800> sniper<00:02:56.130> jump<00:02:56.550> on<00:02:56.670> containment

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
cool it was a sniper jump on containment

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.100 
cool it was a sniper jump on containment
the<00:02:58.110> reason<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:59.210> like<00:03:00.210> this<00:03:00.330> one<00:03:00.390> so<00:03:00.690> much<00:03:00.870> was

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
the reason I like this one so much was

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.200 
the reason I like this one so much was
simply<00:03:01.560> because<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:02.340> was<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:02.700> first<00:03:02.730> out<00:03:03.090> of

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
simply because it was the first out of

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.980 
simply because it was the first out of
map<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:05.060> win<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.210> glittering<00:03:06.510> community

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
map and win the glittering community

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.590 
map and win the glittering community
there's<00:03:07.230> usually<00:03:07.410> a<00:03:07.860> bit<00:03:08.490> of<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.670> race<00:03:08.940> so<00:03:09.540> to

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
there's usually a bit of a race so to

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.700 
there's usually a bit of a race so to
say<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:11.160> find<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.550> first<00:03:11.730> out<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:12.060> map<00:03:12.180> and

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
say to find the first out of map and

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.050 
say to find the first out of map and
yeah<00:03:13.710> I<00:03:13.950> felt<00:03:14.310> pretty<00:03:14.580> proud<00:03:14.790> of<00:03:14.850> this<00:03:15.030> one<00:03:16.040> so

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
yeah I felt pretty proud of this one so

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.620 
yeah I felt pretty proud of this one so
yeah<00:03:18.060> let's<00:03:18.510> move<00:03:18.660> on<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.990> number<00:03:19.620> two<00:03:20.330> so<00:03:21.330> for

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
yeah let's move on to number two so for

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.750 
yeah let's move on to number two so for
number<00:03:21.720> two<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.290> most<00:03:22.560> recent<00:03:23.130> one<00:03:23.160> we're<00:03:23.610> on

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
number two the most recent one we're on

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.070 
number two the most recent one we're on
solar<00:03:24.150> from<00:03:24.750> advanced<00:03:25.230> warfare<00:03:25.380> and<00:03:26.960> at<00:03:27.960> the

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
solar from advanced warfare and at the

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.590 
solar from advanced warfare and at the
time<00:03:28.290> all<00:03:28.710> the<00:03:28.770> glitches<00:03:29.460> had<00:03:30.030> been<00:03:30.300> patched

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
time all the glitches had been patched

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.180 
time all the glitches had been patched
all<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:30.960> older<00:03:31.230> maps<00:03:31.410> so<00:03:31.650> then<00:03:31.800> I<00:03:31.830> went<00:03:32.040> and

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
all the older maps so then I went and

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.130 
all the older maps so then I went and
found<00:03:32.520> this<00:03:32.700> one<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.180> this<00:03:33.720> could<00:03:33.870> be<00:03:33.990> done

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
found this one and this could be done

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.930 
found this one and this could be done
online<00:03:34.320> it<00:03:34.620> can<00:03:34.710> be<00:03:34.830> done<00:03:35.070> without<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.730> hover

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
online it can be done without the hover

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.360 
online it can be done without the hover
and<00:03:36.260> I<00:03:37.260> like<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.530> other<00:03:37.560> map<00:03:37.890> on<00:03:38.070> this<00:03:38.220> one

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
and I like the other map on this one

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.070 
and I like the other map on this one
there's<00:03:38.550> a<00:03:38.610> lot<00:03:38.700> of<00:03:38.730> exploring<00:03:39.240> a<00:03:39.570> lot<00:03:39.780> of<00:03:39.900> cool

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
there's a lot of exploring a lot of cool

need two of them so you really couldn't
do<00:04:12.599> it<00:04:12.750> wasn't<00:04:13.019> really<00:04:13.170> practical<00:04:13.620> for<00:04:13.920> online

but it was still really cool glitch and
fairly<00:04:17.549> easy<00:04:17.669> to<00:04:17.760> do<00:04:17.970> if<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:18.180> knew<00:04:18.269> how<00:04:18.419> to
