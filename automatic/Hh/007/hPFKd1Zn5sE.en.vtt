00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
on the new attachments I wanted to see

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.530 
on the new attachments I wanted to see
how<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:10.080> guns<00:00:10.440> performed<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.300> overall<00:00:12.300> I'm

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
how the guns performed and overall I'm

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.600 
how the guns performed and overall I'm
really<00:00:12.690> excited<00:00:13.170> with<00:00:13.620> what<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.889> have<00:00:14.099> seen<00:00:14.370> so

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610

many more hours to get a full assessment
of<00:00:18.869> how<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.260> patch<00:00:19.529> will<00:00:20.189> affect<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.670> game

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.120 
of how this patch will affect the game
but<00:00:21.570> right<00:00:22.199> now<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.380> kind<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.680> want<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.920> give<00:00:23.039> you

but right now I kind of want to give you

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.560 
but right now I kind of want to give you
guys<00:00:23.220> my<00:00:23.460> initial<00:00:23.820> thoughts<00:00:24.060> some<00:00:24.330> things

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
guys my initial thoughts some things

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.960 
guys my initial thoughts some things
that<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.779> think<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.019> guys<00:00:25.400> would<00:00:26.400> find

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
that I think you guys would find

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.759 
that I think you guys would find
noteworthy<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:28.080> first<00:00:28.320> thing<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.740> that

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
noteworthy and the first thing is that

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.620 
noteworthy and the first thing is that
all<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.340> your<00:00:29.580> normal<00:00:29.910> setups<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.330> all<00:00:30.449> the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
all of your normal setups and all the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.299 
all of your normal setups and all the
weapons<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.109> probably<00:00:31.349> previously

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
weapons that you probably previously

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.000 
weapons that you probably previously
used<00:00:32.669> are<00:00:32.969> going<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.930> have<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.230> change<00:00:34.559> and

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
used are going to have to change and

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.889 
used are going to have to change and
they're<00:00:35.280> going<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.489> feel<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> lot<00:00:36.180> different<00:00:36.210> I

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
they're going to feel a lot different I

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.709 
they're going to feel a lot different I
found<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.040> previous<00:00:38.640> viable<00:00:39.329> setups

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
found that the previous viable setups

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.209 
found that the previous viable setups
which<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.050> normally<00:00:40.379> just<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.680> silence<00:00:41.070> or

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
which is normally just the silence or

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.770 
which is normally just the silence or
the<00:00:41.309> foregrip<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.910> no<00:00:42.090> longer<00:00:42.329> going<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.570> be<00:00:42.629> as

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
the foregrip is no longer going to be as

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.170 
the foregrip is no longer going to be as
powerful<00:00:42.989> as<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.500> once<00:00:43.920> was<00:00:44.040> we<00:00:44.789> already<00:00:45.000> knew

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
powerful as it once was we already knew

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.790 
powerful as it once was we already knew
that<00:00:45.210> going<00:00:45.480> into<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.989> patch<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.559> wasn't

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
that going into the patch that it wasn't

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.430 
that going into the patch that it wasn't
going<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.039> be<00:00:47.160> as<00:00:47.489> strong<00:00:47.850> but<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:48.960> it's<00:00:49.320> a

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
going to be as strong but it's it's a

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.049 
going to be as strong but it's it's a
pretty<00:00:49.680> significant<00:00:50.399> nerf<00:00:50.610> for<00:00:50.940> this

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
pretty significant nerf for this

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.310 
pretty significant nerf for this
combination<00:00:51.719> you're<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.289> a

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
combination you're going to have a

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.380 
combination you're going to have a
difficult<00:00:52.590> time<00:00:52.829> taking<00:00:53.190> people<00:00:53.789> out<00:00:53.940> at<00:00:54.149> long

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
difficult time taking people out at long

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.600 
difficult time taking people out at long
range<00:00:54.719> using<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.649> foregrip<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.129> silencer

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
range using the foregrip of the silencer

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.760 
range using the foregrip of the silencer
I<00:00:56.640> found<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.480> recoil<00:00:57.989> was<00:00:58.379> very

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
I found that the recoil was very

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.520 
I found that the recoil was very
unmanageable<00:00:59.460> at<00:00:59.670> longer<00:01:00.510> distances<00:01:00.539> maybe

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
unmanageable at longer distances maybe

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.290 
unmanageable at longer distances maybe
I'm<00:01:01.770> just<00:01:01.980> out<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.340> practice<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.940> don't<00:01:03.180> know

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
I'm just out of practice I don't know

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.450 
I'm just out of practice I don't know
but<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:03.840> felt<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.769> was<00:01:05.189> a

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
but it just felt like it was a

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.460 
but it just felt like it was a
significant<00:01:06.240> decreasing<00:01:06.780> decrease<00:01:07.320> in

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
significant decreasing decrease in

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.460 
significant decreasing decrease in
accuracy<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.820> lot<00:01:09.000> more<00:01:09.119> recoil<00:01:09.570> at<00:01:09.869> long

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
accuracy and a lot more recoil at long

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.679 
accuracy and a lot more recoil at long
range<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.100> i<00:01:11.310> don't<00:01:11.580> think<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.090> silencer<00:01:12.540> for

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
range so i don't think the silencer for

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.929 
range so i don't think the silencer for
grip<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.049> no<00:01:13.200> longer<00:01:13.409> going<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.650> be<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.490> top

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
grip is no longer going to be the top

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.149 
grip is no longer going to be the top
combination<00:01:15.630> what<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.170> did<00:01:16.409> find<00:01:16.740> though<00:01:16.950> was

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
combination what I did find though was

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.070 
combination what I did find though was
that<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.400> heavy<00:01:17.670> barrel<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:19.049> a

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
that the heavy barrel is it is a

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.560 
that the heavy barrel is it is a
phenomenal<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:20.070> just<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.580> really<00:01:21.000> really<00:01:21.270> nice

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
phenomenal it just a really really nice

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.480 
phenomenal it just a really really nice
attachment<00:01:22.259> they<00:01:22.380> buffed<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.830> significantly

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
attachment they buffed it significantly

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.300 
attachment they buffed it significantly
and<00:01:23.790> when<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.810> slap<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.560> pretty<00:01:25.979> much<00:01:26.070> any

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
and when I slap that on pretty much any

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.460 
and when I slap that on pretty much any
of<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.580> weapons<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.180> became<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.960> much<00:01:28.290> more

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
of the weapons it became a much more

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.740 
of the weapons it became a much more
powerful<00:01:28.680> gun<00:01:29.130> at<00:01:29.369> long<00:01:29.610> range<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.240> could<00:01:30.600> stay

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
powerful gun at long range I could stay

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.870 
powerful gun at long range I could stay
on<00:01:30.869> target<00:01:31.079> very<00:01:31.470> easily<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.549> just<00:01:32.700> found

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
on target very easily and I just found

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.140 
on target very easily and I just found
it<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.299> an<00:01:33.570> overall<00:01:34.020> satisfying

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
it to be an overall satisfying

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.380 
it to be an overall satisfying
attachment<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.299> far<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.780> also<00:01:37.200> tried<00:01:37.710> out<00:01:38.040> the

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
attachment so far I also tried out the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.130 
attachment so far I also tried out the
bipod<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.659> was<00:01:39.750> actually<00:01:39.810> kind<00:01:39.990> of

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
bipod and that was actually kind of

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.380 
bipod and that was actually kind of
surprised<00:01:40.530> at<00:01:40.770> how<00:01:40.920> effective<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.670> was<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.090> was

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
surprised at how effective it was I was

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.240 
surprised at how effective it was I was
kind<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.600> opting<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:42.990> not<00:01:43.500> even<00:01:43.619> using<00:01:44.040> an

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
kind of opting for not even using an

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.550 
kind of opting for not even using an
attachment<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:44.970> slot<00:01:45.299> but<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.930> decided<00:01:46.380> to

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
attachment in that slot but I decided to

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.499 
attachment in that slot but I decided to
give<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.740> bipod<00:01:47.399> ago<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.240> was<00:01:48.360> actually

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
give the bipod ago and I was actually

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.630 
give the bipod ago and I was actually
kind<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.810> surprised<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.530> really<00:01:50.130> how

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
kind of surprised and really how

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.490 
kind of surprised and really how
effective<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.270> was<00:01:51.450> when<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:51.990> was<00:01:52.140> using<00:01:52.350> it

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
effective it was when I was using it

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.899 
effective it was when I was using it
with<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.799> assault<00:01:53.070> weapons<00:01:53.159> or<00:01:53.460> really<00:01:53.729> any

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
with the assault weapons or really any

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.209 
with the assault weapons or really any
weapon<00:01:54.299> what<00:01:54.810> they<00:01:54.960> did<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.470> patch<00:01:55.740> was

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
weapon what they did in this patch was

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.550 
weapon what they did in this patch was
to<00:01:56.729> decrease<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.540> amount<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.930> time<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.380> takes

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
to decrease the amount of time it takes

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.440 
to decrease the amount of time it takes
for<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:58.979> go<00:01:59.189> through<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.610> animation<00:02:00.210> to

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
for you to go through the animation to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.539 
for you to go through the animation to
set<00:02:01.229> up<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.469> bipod<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.130> think<00:02:02.340> they<00:02:02.430> also

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
set up the bipod and I think they also

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.399 
set up the bipod and I think they also
made<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.939> easier<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.659> deploy<00:02:03.810> I'm<00:02:04.200> not<00:02:04.259> really

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
made it easier to deploy I'm not really

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.170 
made it easier to deploy I'm not really
sure<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:04.890> one<00:02:05.009> but<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.610> do<00:02:05.700> know<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:05.939> they

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
sure on that one but I do know that they

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.059 
sure on that one but I do know that they
reduce<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.659> time<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.899> takes<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.350> deploy<00:02:07.890> it

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
reduce the time it takes to deploy it

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.820 
reduce the time it takes to deploy it
which<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.819> awesome<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.929> was<00:02:10.080> using<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.560> with

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
which is awesome and I was using it with

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.979 
which is awesome and I was using it with
the<00:02:11.160> assault<00:02:11.580> weapons<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.420> was<00:02:12.510> very<00:02:12.690> very

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
the assault weapons and it was very very

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.530 
the assault weapons and it was very very
effective

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
effective

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.539 
effective
got<00:02:13.719> me<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:13.930> lot<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.349> kills<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.950> increase<00:02:15.430> my

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
got me a lot of kills it increase my

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.970 
got me a lot of kills it increase my
accuracy<00:02:15.969> significantly<00:02:16.719> and<00:02:17.019> I<00:02:17.530> can<00:02:17.680> see

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
accuracy significantly and I can see

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.550 
accuracy significantly and I can see
that<00:02:18.400> more<00:02:18.700> more<00:02:19.239> players<00:02:19.599> are<00:02:19.930> going<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.409> take

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
that more more players are going to take

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.860 
that more more players are going to take
advantage<00:02:20.799> of<00:02:21.069> this<00:02:21.219> of<00:02:21.430> this<00:02:21.489> attachment<00:02:22.480> in

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
advantage of this of this attachment in

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.630 
advantage of this of this attachment in
op<00:02:23.140> for<00:02:23.469> not<00:02:23.709> even<00:02:23.829> going<00:02:24.189> with<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.370> foregrip

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
op for not even going with the foregrip

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.390 
op for not even going with the foregrip
anymore<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.209> maybe<00:02:25.359> moving<00:02:26.230> over<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.709> the

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
anymore and maybe moving over to the

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.069 
anymore and maybe moving over to the
bipod<00:02:27.790> I<00:02:27.969> still<00:02:28.420> don't<00:02:28.450> think<00:02:28.659> it's<00:02:28.900> going<00:02:28.989> to

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
bipod I still don't think it's going to

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.809 
bipod I still don't think it's going to
be<00:02:29.170> an<00:02:29.290> overpowered<00:02:29.799> attachment<00:02:30.340> i<00:02:30.430> know<00:02:30.489> some

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
be an overpowered attachment i know some

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.759 
be an overpowered attachment i know some
people<00:02:30.849> might<00:02:31.180> be<00:02:31.299> worried<00:02:31.599> about<00:02:31.750> that<00:02:31.959> it's

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
people might be worried about that it's

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.199 
people might be worried about that it's
still<00:02:32.920> gonna<00:02:33.069> leave<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.400> open<00:02:33.579> to<00:02:33.790> getting

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
still gonna leave you open to getting

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.539 
still gonna leave you open to getting
shot<00:02:34.569> by<00:02:34.810> recons<00:02:35.409> and<00:02:35.769> getting<00:02:36.040> taken<00:02:36.310> out<00:02:36.400> and

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
shot by recons and getting taken out and

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.309 
shot by recons and getting taken out and
flying<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.849> bolt-action<00:02:37.120> rifles<00:02:37.689> and<00:02:37.900> it

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
flying the bolt-action rifles and it

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.780 
flying the bolt-action rifles and it
still<00:02:38.500> makes<00:02:38.530> you<00:02:38.739> feel<00:02:38.890> clumsy<00:02:39.340> but<00:02:39.519> so<00:02:39.760> I

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
still makes you feel clumsy but so I

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.129 
still makes you feel clumsy but so I
don't<00:02:40.180> think<00:02:40.389> everyone's<00:02:40.750> going<00:02:41.019> to

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:41.139 
don't think everyone's going to

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.709 
don't think everyone's going to
gravitate<00:02:41.620> on<00:02:42.069> over<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.549> bipod<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:43.239> think

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:43.719 
gravitate on over to the bipod I think

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:44.940 
gravitate on over to the bipod I think
people<00:02:43.840> are<00:02:44.109> really<00:02:44.139> just<00:02:44.530> going<00:02:44.709> to<00:02:44.769> have<00:02:44.889> to

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
people are really just going to have to

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.710 
people are really just going to have to
consider<00:02:45.370> do<00:02:45.639> I<00:02:45.700> want<00:02:45.939> to<00:02:46.000> use<00:02:46.120> this<00:02:46.269> bipod

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
consider do I want to use this bipod

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.940 
consider do I want to use this bipod
which<00:02:46.750> may<00:02:47.139> make<00:02:47.349> it<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.560> little<00:02:47.680> bit<00:02:47.829> more

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
which may make it a little bit more

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.039 
which may make it a little bit more
clumsy<00:02:48.189> do<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:49.180> not<00:02:49.420> want<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.750> use<00:02:49.900> any

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
clumsy do I not want to use any

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.229 
clumsy do I not want to use any
attachment<00:02:50.620> in<00:02:50.739> that<00:02:50.889> slot<00:02:51.189> or<00:02:51.430> should<00:02:51.970> i<00:02:52.060> opt

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
attachment in that slot or should i opt

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.089 
attachment in that slot or should i opt
for<00:02:52.599> the<00:02:52.629> foregrip<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:53.680> I<00:02:53.709> think<00:02:53.919> it's<00:02:54.010> going

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
for the foregrip so I think it's going

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.860 
for the foregrip so I think it's going
to<00:02:54.189> make<00:02:54.340> for<00:02:54.400> some<00:02:54.790> interesting<00:02:54.909> dynamics

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
to make for some interesting dynamics

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.289 
to make for some interesting dynamics
and<00:02:56.019> what<00:02:56.260> people<00:02:56.409> decide<00:02:56.919> to<00:02:57.579> use<00:02:57.790> in<00:02:58.120> their

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
and what people decide to use in their

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.569 
and what people decide to use in their
future<00:02:58.540> attachment<00:02:59.290> build<00:02:59.470> so<00:02:59.709> cool<00:03:00.370> things

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
future attachment build so cool things

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.670 
future attachment build so cool things
right<00:03:00.760> there<00:03:00.939> I<00:03:01.120> haven't<00:03:02.019> really<00:03:02.139> checked<00:03:02.470> out

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
right there I haven't really checked out

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.409 
right there I haven't really checked out
many<00:03:02.919> of<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.129> other<00:03:03.250> attachments<00:03:03.879> I<00:03:03.970> did<00:03:04.180> try

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:04.419 
many of the other attachments I did try

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
that I'm going to really just go through

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.679 
that I'm going to really just go through
all<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.669> attachments<00:03:12.939> I'll<00:03:13.299> probably<00:03:13.450> make<00:03:13.629> a

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:13.689 
all the attachments I'll probably make a

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.259 
all the attachments I'll probably make a
video<00:03:13.930> on<00:03:14.230> each<00:03:14.379> one<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:14.889> how<00:03:15.459> they<00:03:16.060> will

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
video on each one and how they will

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.659 
video on each one and how they will
perform<00:03:16.419> in<00:03:16.930> different<00:03:17.230> situations<00:03:17.519> so<00:03:18.519> stay

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:18.669 
perform in different situations so stay

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:20.550 
perform in different situations so stay
tuned<00:03:18.849> for<00:03:19.060> that<00:03:19.090> another<00:03:20.019> thing<00:03:20.229> I<00:03:20.290> wanted<00:03:20.319> to

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
tuned for that another thing I wanted to

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.080 
tuned for that another thing I wanted to
talk<00:03:20.709> about<00:03:20.769> was<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.519> stock<00:03:21.819> weapons

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
talk about was that the stock weapons

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.210 
talk about was that the stock weapons
seem<00:03:22.599> to<00:03:22.840> be<00:03:22.959> really<00:03:23.379> powerful<00:03:23.560> I<00:03:23.979> went

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
seem to be really powerful I went

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.129 
seem to be really powerful I went
through<00:03:24.489> a<00:03:24.519> lot<00:03:24.909> of<00:03:25.209> you<00:03:25.629> know<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.870> weapons

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
through a lot of you know the weapons

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.319 
through a lot of you know the weapons
that<00:03:26.199> you<00:03:26.319> unlock<00:03:26.769> and<00:03:27.040> I<00:03:27.669> psyched<00:03:28.030> I<00:03:28.209> found

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
that you unlock and I psyched I found

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.390 
that you unlock and I psyched I found
myself<00:03:28.690> gravitating<00:03:29.049> towards<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.159> stock

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
myself gravitating towards the stock

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.559 
myself gravitating towards the stock
weapons<00:03:30.609> I<00:03:30.909> found<00:03:31.120> them<00:03:31.209> to<00:03:31.359> be<00:03:31.389> very

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
weapons I found them to be very

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.990 
weapons I found them to be very
effective<00:03:32.049> the<00:03:32.709> accuracy<00:03:33.220> on<00:03:33.340> a<00:03:33.370> lot<00:03:33.669> of<00:03:33.819> them

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
effective the accuracy on a lot of them

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.659 
effective the accuracy on a lot of them
were<00:03:34.629> fantastic<00:03:35.470> especially<00:03:35.859> when<00:03:36.430> I<00:03:36.459> was

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:36.669 
were fantastic especially when I was

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:38.580 
were fantastic especially when I was
using<00:03:36.879> the<00:03:37.060> heavy<00:03:37.239> barrel<00:03:37.479> so<00:03:38.109> I'll<00:03:38.470> be

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
using the heavy barrel so I'll be

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.159 
using the heavy barrel so I'll be
interesting<00:03:39.069> to<00:03:39.159> see<00:03:39.370> if<00:03:39.669> that<00:03:40.090> is<00:03:40.299> true<00:03:40.629> while

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
interesting to see if that is true while

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.259 
interesting to see if that is true while
i<00:03:41.199> continue<00:03:41.530> my<00:03:41.799> play<00:03:42.190> sessions<00:03:42.609> i<00:03:42.819> will<00:03:43.239> I

scoping I know there were a lot of fears

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.039 
scoping I know there were a lot of fears
that<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.609> sniper<00:04:10.180> rifles<00:04:10.659> would<00:04:10.870> be

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
that the sniper rifles would be

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.659 
that the sniper rifles would be
overpowered<00:04:11.620> in<00:04:11.650> this<00:04:11.799> patch<00:04:12.009> if<00:04:12.459> you're

overpowered in this patch if you're
unaware<00:04:12.849> of<00:04:13.090> what<00:04:13.209> they<00:04:13.329> did<00:04:13.540> they<00:04:13.720> basically

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
unaware of what they did they basically

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.099 
unaware of what they did they basically
made<00:04:14.439> a<00:04:14.470> hitbox<00:04:14.799> on<00:04:15.690> soldiers<00:04:16.690> that<00:04:16.870> if<00:04:16.989> you're

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
made a hitbox on soldiers that if you're

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.199 
made a hitbox on soldiers that if you're
using<00:04:17.259> the<00:04:17.650> bolt-action<00:04:18.039> rifles<00:04:18.639> if<00:04:19.000> you<00:04:19.090> hit

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
using the bolt-action rifles if you hit

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.140

in<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.389> upper<00:04:19.989> chest<00:04:20.320> it<00:04:20.530> does<00:04:20.709> 1.5<00:04:21.609> times

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
in the upper chest it does 1.5 times

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.580 
in the upper chest it does 1.5 times
more<00:04:22.360> damage<00:04:22.719> I<00:04:22.900> believe<00:04:23.200> with<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.409> bolt

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
more damage I believe with the bolt

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.440 
more damage I believe with the bolt
action<00:04:23.889> rifles<00:04:24.219> and<00:04:24.370> essentially<00:04:25.150> if<00:04:25.300> you're

a<00:04:37.580> lot<00:04:37.700> of<00:04:37.730> people<00:04:37.820> were<00:04:38.090> fearing<00:04:38.360> that<00:04:38.480> this

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
a lot of people were fearing that this

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.840 
a lot of people were fearing that this
would<00:04:39.110> just<00:04:39.230> lead<00:04:39.500> to<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:40.100> Recon<00:04:40.400> class<00:04:40.640> being

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
would just lead to the Recon class being

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.760 
would just lead to the Recon class being
overpowered<00:04:41.480> it<00:04:41.720> would<00:04:41.810> be<00:04:41.930> the<00:04:42.110> optic<00:04:42.530> the

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
overpowered it would be the optic the

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.850 
overpowered it would be the optic the
kit<00:04:43.430> that<00:04:44.120> would<00:04:44.390> basically<00:04:44.540> dominate<00:04:45.380> every

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
kit that would basically dominate every

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.160 
kit that would basically dominate every
scenario<00:04:46.370> you<00:04:46.610> know<00:04:46.940> short<00:04:47.270> range<00:04:47.480> long<00:04:47.840> range

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
scenario you know short range long range

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.830 
scenario you know short range long range
with<00:04:48.710> my<00:04:48.890> play<00:04:49.130> session<00:04:49.490> today<00:04:49.640> I<00:04:49.840> am

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
with my play session today I am

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.480 
with my play session today I am
basically<00:04:51.230> going<00:04:51.410> to<00:04:51.620> say<00:04:51.770> that<00:04:52.070> that's<00:04:52.340> not

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
basically going to say that that's not

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.550 
basically going to say that that's not
going<00:04:52.550> to<00:04:52.730> be<00:04:52.790> the<00:04:52.910> case<00:04:53.120> and<00:04:53.390> I<00:04:54.020> don't<00:04:54.320> think

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
going to be the case and I don't think

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.890 
going to be the case and I don't think
that<00:04:54.710> these<00:04:54.950> fears<00:04:55.490> are<00:04:55.760> or<00:04:56.120> these<00:04:56.390> claims<00:04:56.750> are

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
that these fears are or these claims are

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.710 
that these fears are or these claims are
justified<00:04:57.470> I<00:04:57.710> found<00:04:58.280> that<00:04:58.730> when<00:04:59.180> someone<00:04:59.480> is

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
justified I found that when someone is

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.960 
justified I found that when someone is
running<00:04:59.930> a<00:05:00.110> pair<00:05:00.770> are<00:05:00.980> perpendicular<00:05:01.340> to<00:05:01.670> you

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
running a pair are perpendicular to you

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.930 
running a pair are perpendicular to you
going<00:05:02.690> for<00:05:02.960> a<00:05:02.990> shot<00:05:03.530> at<00:05:03.770> the<00:05:03.830> arm<00:05:04.130> or<00:05:04.460> where<00:05:04.760> you

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
going for a shot at the arm or where you

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.970 
going for a shot at the arm or where you
would<00:05:05.060> assume<00:05:05.300> that<00:05:05.360> hitbox<00:05:05.900> would<00:05:06.080> be<00:05:06.260> you

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
would assume that hitbox would be you

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.590 
would assume that hitbox would be you
don't<00:05:07.130> get<00:05:07.250> that<00:05:07.280> one<00:05:07.520> shot<00:05:07.730> one<00:05:07.910> kill<00:05:07.940> even<00:05:08.510> if

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
don't get that one shot one kill even if

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.300 
don't get that one shot one kill even if
you're<00:05:08.660> up<00:05:08.840> close<00:05:09.050> the<00:05:09.380> arm<00:05:09.530> blocks<00:05:09.920> it<00:05:10.160> and

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
you're up close the arm blocks it and

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.490 
you're up close the arm blocks it and
you<00:05:10.910> don't<00:05:11.030> get<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.390> kill<00:05:11.600> the<00:05:11.780> only<00:05:11.930> way<00:05:12.260> for

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
you don't get the kill the only way for

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.480 
you don't get the kill the only way for
you<00:05:12.620> to<00:05:12.650> get<00:05:12.800> the<00:05:12.920> kill<00:05:13.130> is<00:05:13.160> if<00:05:13.370> they're

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
you to get the kill is if they're

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.130 
you to get the kill is if they're
basically<00:05:13.910> running<00:05:14.210> straight<00:05:14.570> at<00:05:14.630> you<00:05:14.900> and

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
basically running straight at you and

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.380 
basically running straight at you and
you<00:05:15.950> get<00:05:16.340> that<00:05:16.520> you<00:05:16.670> know<00:05:16.760> you<00:05:16.820> get<00:05:17.030> the<00:05:17.150> shot

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
you get that you know you get the shot

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.270 
you get that you know you get the shot
in<00:05:17.570> the<00:05:17.660> chest<00:05:17.690> and<00:05:18.170> also<00:05:18.710> that<00:05:18.860> 10<00:05:19.100> meter

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
in the chest and also that 10 meter

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.460 
in the chest and also that 10 meter
range<00:05:19.520> is<00:05:19.790> really<00:05:20.330> really<00:05:20.600> short<00:05:21.020> there<00:05:21.290> was<00:05:21.440> a

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
range is really really short there was a

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.320 
range is really really short there was a
lot<00:05:21.620> of<00:05:21.650> situations<00:05:21.860> where<00:05:22.430> I<00:05:22.460> thought<00:05:22.940> if<00:05:23.210> I

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
lot of situations where I thought if I

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.000 
lot of situations where I thought if I
went<00:05:23.480> for<00:05:23.690> the<00:05:23.750> chest<00:05:23.990> shot<00:05:24.170> I<00:05:24.380> would<00:05:24.950> have

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
went for the chest shot I would have

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.310 
went for the chest shot I would have
gotten<00:05:25.250> the<00:05:25.550> kill<00:05:25.910> but<00:05:26.330> apparently<00:05:26.990> I<00:05:27.020> was<00:05:27.230> out

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
gotten the kill but apparently I was out

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.960 
gotten the kill but apparently I was out
of<00:05:27.350> range<00:05:27.620> of<00:05:28.010> that<00:05:28.190> you<00:05:28.370> know<00:05:28.460> that<00:05:28.610> really

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
of range of that you know that really

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.300 
of range of that you know that really
shorts<00:05:29.780> 10<00:05:30.230> meters<00:05:30.560> and<00:05:30.770> I<00:05:30.980> don't<00:05:31.130> get<00:05:31.220> the

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
shorts 10 meters and I don't get the

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.010 
shorts 10 meters and I don't get the
kill<00:05:31.460> and<00:05:31.550> i<00:05:31.610> got<00:05:31.730> myself<00:05:31.850> you<00:05:32.480> know<00:05:32.510> then<00:05:32.930> I

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
kill and i got myself you know then I

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.620 
kill and i got myself you know then I
died<00:05:33.260> so<00:05:33.650> I<00:05:33.890> don't<00:05:34.460> think<00:05:34.820> that<00:05:35.120> these<00:05:35.300> changes

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
died so I don't think that these changes

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.510 
died so I don't think that these changes
are<00:05:35.870> going<00:05:36.230> to<00:05:36.410> make<00:05:36.680> the<00:05:36.890> Recon<00:05:37.220> class

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
are going to make the Recon class

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.490 
are going to make the Recon class
overpowered<00:05:38.210> but<00:05:38.750> I<00:05:38.780> do<00:05:38.870> think<00:05:39.110> it's<00:05:39.290> going<00:05:39.410> to

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
overpowered but I do think it's going to

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.140 
overpowered but I do think it's going to
make<00:05:39.650> it<00:05:39.860> a<00:05:40.010> little<00:05:40.190> bit<00:05:40.340> more<00:05:40.460> viable<00:05:40.730> and<00:05:41.090> if

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
make it a little bit more viable and if

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.430 
make it a little bit more viable and if
you<00:05:41.240> do<00:05:41.360> get<00:05:41.450> a<00:05:41.510> shot<00:05:41.750> up<00:05:41.900> close<00:05:42.140> where<00:05:42.380> you

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
you do get a shot up close where you

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.330 
you do get a shot up close where you
kill<00:05:42.650> you<00:05:42.770> know<00:05:42.860> you<00:05:42.920> shoot<00:05:43.130> them<00:05:43.190> in<00:05:43.310> the

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
kill you know you shoot them in the

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.010 
kill you know you shoot them in the
chest<00:05:43.400> it's<00:05:44.030> going<00:05:44.150> to<00:05:44.210> get<00:05:44.270> you<00:05:44.390> that<00:05:44.510> kill<00:05:44.780> I

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
chest it's going to get you that kill I

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.480 
chest it's going to get you that kill I
think<00:05:45.410> it's<00:05:45.530> a<00:05:45.560> nice<00:05:45.800> change<00:05:45.830> its<00:05:46.310> going<00:05:46.340> to

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
think it's a nice change its going to

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.830 
think it's a nice change its going to
make<00:05:46.640> the<00:05:46.760> Recon<00:05:47.060> class<00:05:47.300> a<00:05:47.330> little<00:05:47.570> bit<00:05:47.720> more

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
make the Recon class a little bit more

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.530 
make the Recon class a little bit more
viable<00:05:48.200> and<00:05:48.590> in<00:05:48.770> more<00:05:48.980> situations<00:05:49.220> and<00:05:49.940> I

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
viable and in more situations and I

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.450 
viable and in more situations and I
think<00:05:50.780> people<00:05:51.140> just<00:05:51.290> need<00:05:51.500> to<00:05:51.800> try<00:05:52.190> it<00:05:52.250> out<00:05:52.430> and

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
think people just need to try it out and

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.730 
think people just need to try it out and
not<00:05:53.360> freaked<00:05:53.780> out<00:05:53.930> that<00:05:54.170> this<00:05:54.290> is<00:05:54.440> going<00:05:54.620> to

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
not freaked out that this is going to

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.260 
not freaked out that this is going to
completely<00:05:55.190> make<00:05:55.580> the<00:05:55.730> Recon<00:05:56.030> class

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
completely make the Recon class

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.210 
completely make the Recon class
overpowered<00:05:56.990> another<00:05:57.740> thing<00:05:57.890> i<00:05:58.010> really<00:05:58.100> like

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
overpowered another thing i really like

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.280 
overpowered another thing i really like
is<00:05:58.490> that<00:05:58.520> the<00:05:58.700> mini-map<00:05:59.060> has<00:05:59.300> changed<00:05:59.810> you<00:05:59.990> can

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
is that the mini-map has changed you can

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.390 
is that the mini-map has changed you can
switch<00:06:00.650> it<00:06:00.680> between<00:06:01.040> three<00:06:01.280> different

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
switch it between three different

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.370 
switch it between three different
settings<00:06:01.880> and<00:06:01.940> i<00:06:02.840> would<00:06:03.050> highly<00:06:03.200> recommend

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
settings and i would highly recommend

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.590 
settings and i would highly recommend
checking<00:06:03.770> out<00:06:04.100> all<00:06:04.310> three<00:06:04.730> I<00:06:04.880> like<00:06:05.420> the

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 
checking out all three I like the

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.660 
checking out all three I like the
changes<00:06:05.990> a<00:06:06.110> lot<00:06:06.500> it<00:06:06.860> makes<00:06:07.280> it<00:06:07.430> a<00:06:07.490> lot<00:06:07.610> more

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:07.670 
changes a lot it makes it a lot more

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.220 
changes a lot it makes it a lot more
crisp<00:06:08.120> and<00:06:08.330> clear<00:06:08.660> and<00:06:08.690> you<00:06:08.990> can<00:06:09.110> identify

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.230 
crisp and clear and you can identify

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.010 
crisp and clear and you can identify
where<00:06:09.890> targets<00:06:10.310> are<00:06:10.460> a<00:06:10.490> lot<00:06:10.940> easier<00:06:10.970> so<00:06:11.840> I'm

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
where targets are a lot easier so I'm

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.440 
where targets are a lot easier so I'm
really<00:06:12.320> really<00:06:12.740> liking<00:06:13.070> this<00:06:13.160> the<00:06:13.550> the<00:06:14.150> main

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
really really liking this the the main

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.540 
really really liking this the the main
map<00:06:14.600> changing<00:06:14.990> so<00:06:15.680> the<00:06:15.770> final<00:06:15.920> thing<00:06:16.040> I<00:06:16.340> wanted

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
map changing so the final thing I wanted

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.920 
map changing so the final thing I wanted
to<00:06:16.610> talk<00:06:16.760> about<00:06:16.820> was<00:06:17.030> the<00:06:17.300> Stinger<00:06:17.630> missiles

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
to talk about was the Stinger missiles

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.750 
to talk about was the Stinger missiles
i'm<00:06:18.110> sure<00:06:18.350> a<00:06:18.380> lot<00:06:18.530> of<00:06:18.770> you<00:06:18.950> have<00:06:19.160> questions<00:06:19.400> on

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.760 
i'm sure a lot of you have questions on

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.130 
i'm sure a lot of you have questions on
it<00:06:19.790> and<00:06:20.120> what<00:06:20.300> they've<00:06:20.480> done<00:06:20.660> in<00:06:20.810> the<00:06:20.900> patch

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.140 
it and what they've done in the patch

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.070 
it and what they've done in the patch
was<00:06:21.950> to<00:06:22.400> significantly<00:06:23.240> increase<00:06:23.510> the<00:06:23.900> damage

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
was to significantly increase the damage

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.020 
was to significantly increase the damage
but<00:06:24.440> also<00:06:24.650> they<00:06:24.950> decrease<00:06:25.430> the<00:06:25.610> effective

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030 
but also they decrease the effective

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.270 
but also they decrease the effective
range<00:06:26.300> for<00:06:26.930> you<00:06:26.960> to<00:06:27.170> be<00:06:27.350> able<00:06:27.380> to<00:06:27.680> lock<00:06:27.860> on<00:06:28.070> its

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 
range for you to be able to lock on its

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.310 
range for you to be able to lock on its
to<00:06:28.430> a<00:06:28.460> target<00:06:29.060> so<00:06:29.480> really<00:06:29.690> what<00:06:30.020> Stinger

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
to a target so really what Stinger

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.660 
to a target so really what Stinger
missiles<00:06:30.590> are<00:06:30.680> going<00:06:30.800> to<00:06:30.860> be<00:06:30.950> useful<00:06:31.130> for<00:06:31.340> is

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:31.670 
missiles are going to be useful for is

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.130 
missiles are going to be useful for is
taking<00:06:31.940> out<00:06:32.030> helicopters<00:06:32.630> that<00:06:32.690> you're<00:06:32.990> not

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.140 
taking out helicopters that you're not

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.450 
taking out helicopters that you're not
really<00:06:33.290> going<00:06:33.440> to<00:06:33.530> be<00:06:33.590> able<00:06:33.650> to<00:06:33.770> take<00:06:33.920> out<00:06:34.070> Jets

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
really going to be able to take out Jets

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.710 
really going to be able to take out Jets
the<00:06:34.790> only<00:06:34.940> way<00:06:35.030> you're<00:06:35.150> going<00:06:35.240> to<00:06:35.300> be<00:06:35.480> able<00:06:35.540> to

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 
the only way you're going to be able to

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.300 
the only way you're going to be able to
do<00:06:35.780> that<00:06:35.900> is<00:06:36.110> if<00:06:36.290> they're<00:06:36.470> going<00:06:36.590> really<00:06:36.919> slow

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.310 
do that is if they're going really slow

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.730 
do that is if they're going really slow
they<00:06:37.970> are<00:06:38.270> directly<00:06:38.720> above<00:06:38.960> you

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
they are directly above you

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.260 
they are directly above you
and<00:06:39.889> they're<00:06:40.430> just<00:06:40.669> you<00:06:40.819> know<00:06:40.849> they're<00:06:41.090> just

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
and they're just you know they're just

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.820 
and they're just you know they're just
not<00:06:41.479> doing<00:06:41.870> their<00:06:42.050> best<00:06:42.199> to<00:06:42.410> get<00:06:42.560> out<00:06:42.680> of<00:06:42.710> the

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830 
not doing their best to get out of the

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.140 
not doing their best to get out of the
way<00:06:42.979> and<00:06:43.220> that's<00:06:43.699> the<00:06:43.789> only<00:06:43.910> way<00:06:44.000> you're<00:06:44.090> gonna

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150 
way and that's the only way you're gonna

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.610 
way and that's the only way you're gonna
be<00:06:44.240> able<00:06:44.300> to<00:06:44.449> lock<00:06:44.569> on<00:06:44.780> to<00:06:44.900> them<00:06:45.050> because<00:06:45.199> like

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
be able to lock on to them because like

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.469 
be able to lock on to them because like
i<00:06:45.740> said<00:06:45.770> the<00:06:46.069> range<00:06:46.340> is<00:06:46.699> just<00:06:46.880> significantly

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:47.479 
i said the range is just significantly

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:49.930 
i said the range is just significantly
decreased<00:06:48.110> but<00:06:48.740> for<00:06:48.889> helicopters<00:06:49.520> it's<00:06:49.759> gonna

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 
decreased but for helicopters it's gonna

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.670 
decreased but for helicopters it's gonna
it's<00:06:50.270> going<00:06:50.539> to<00:06:50.599> make<00:06:51.050> for<00:06:51.110> an<00:06:51.440> interesting

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
it's going to make for an interesting

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.129 
it's going to make for an interesting
dynamic<00:06:52.039> between<00:06:52.550> infantry<00:06:53.150> units<00:06:53.479> and<00:06:53.660> the

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:54.139 
dynamic between infantry units and the

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:56.350 
dynamic between infantry units and the
helicopter<00:06:54.740> pilot<00:06:55.160> the<00:06:55.819> pilots<00:06:56.180> going<00:06:56.300> to

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 
helicopter pilot the pilots going to

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.839 
helicopter pilot the pilots going to
have<00:06:56.509> to<00:06:56.630> gauge<00:06:56.870> should<00:06:57.410> I<00:06:57.530> try<00:06:58.009> to<00:06:58.039> stay<00:06:58.400> in

00:06:58.839 --> 00:06:58.849 
have to gauge should I try to stay in

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:00.610 
have to gauge should I try to stay in
this<00:06:58.940> location<00:06:59.479> you<00:06:59.960> know<00:07:00.050> maybe<00:07:00.169> take<00:07:00.470> out

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:00.620 
this location you know maybe take out

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.529 
this location you know maybe take out
the<00:07:00.949> two<00:07:01.370> people<00:07:01.669> or<00:07:01.849> the<00:07:01.970> couple<00:07:02.210> people<00:07:02.449> that

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:02.539 
the two people or the couple people that

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:03.730 
the two people or the couple people that
are<00:07:02.630> trying<00:07:02.720> to<00:07:02.870> take<00:07:03.020> me<00:07:03.169> out<00:07:03.199> on<00:07:03.319> the<00:07:03.470> ground

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:03.740 
are trying to take me out on the ground

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.559 
are trying to take me out on the ground
with<00:07:04.460> their<00:07:04.580> stinger<00:07:04.849> missiles<00:07:05.120> or<00:07:05.330> should<00:07:05.509> I

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:05.569 
with their stinger missiles or should I

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:07.570 
with their stinger missiles or should I
just<00:07:05.599> try<00:07:05.900> to<00:07:05.990> get<00:07:06.560> out<00:07:06.740> of<00:07:06.770> the<00:07:06.919> range<00:07:07.190> and

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:07.580 
just try to get out of the range and

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.839 
just try to get out of the range and
avoid<00:07:08.419> getting<00:07:08.750> shot<00:07:08.840> out<00:07:09.259> of<00:07:09.289> the<00:07:09.380> sky

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:09.849 
avoid getting shot out of the sky

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:12.249 
avoid getting shot out of the sky
overall<00:07:10.849> I<00:07:11.030> do<00:07:11.090> i<00:07:11.419> do<00:07:11.539> like<00:07:11.810> the<00:07:11.870> Stinger

00:07:12.249 --> 00:07:12.259 
overall I do i do like the Stinger

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:13.779 
overall I do i do like the Stinger
missile<00:07:12.530> changes<00:07:12.889> they<00:07:13.159> definitely<00:07:13.430> needed

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:13.789 
missile changes they definitely needed

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:15.909 
missile changes they definitely needed
some<00:07:13.940> sort<00:07:14.419> of<00:07:14.539> buff<00:07:14.810> I'm<00:07:15.530> not<00:07:15.680> really<00:07:15.800> sure

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 
some sort of buff I'm not really sure

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:17.770 
some sort of buff I'm not really sure
what's<00:07:16.699> going<00:07:16.880> to<00:07:16.970> happen<00:07:17.270> with<00:07:17.449> the<00:07:17.569> range

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:17.780 
what's going to happen with the range

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.390 
what's going to happen with the range
i'm<00:07:18.080> not<00:07:18.199> sure<00:07:18.349> how<00:07:18.500> people<00:07:18.770> are<00:07:18.860> going<00:07:19.069> to

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400 
i'm not sure how people are going to

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.629 
i'm not sure how people are going to
like<00:07:20.270> the<00:07:20.509> decrease<00:07:21.020> in<00:07:21.289> the<00:07:21.919> range<00:07:22.280> or<00:07:22.550> the

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639 
like the decrease in the range or the

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:23.980 
like the decrease in the range or the
effective<00:07:23.030> range<00:07:23.240> of<00:07:23.360> walking<00:07:23.720> on<00:07:23.840> with

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:23.990 
effective range of walking on with

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.510 
effective range of walking on with
Stinger<00:07:24.319> missiles<00:07:24.620> but<00:07:24.830> I<00:07:24.889> think<00:07:25.250> it's<00:07:25.370> going

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520 
Stinger missiles but I think it's going

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.219 
Stinger missiles but I think it's going
to<00:07:25.699> make<00:07:26.090> for<00:07:26.150> like<00:07:26.630> I<00:07:26.720> said<00:07:26.900> just<00:07:26.930> an

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:27.229 
to make for like I said just an

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:28.809 
to make for like I said just an
interesting<00:07:27.650> dynamic<00:07:27.770> between<00:07:28.220> the<00:07:28.460> infantry

00:07:28.809 --> 00:07:28.819
