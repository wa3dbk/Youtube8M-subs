00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
used to be that rubbery kind of feel

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.380 
used to be that rubbery kind of feel
because<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.460> hit<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.729> corner<00:01:06.060> wouldn't

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
because if you hit the corner wouldn't

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.789 
and on the 3700 you would share your hot
cues<00:01:51.719> with<00:01:52.109> your<00:01:52.259> auto<00:01:52.439> loop<00:01:54.499> and<00:01:55.499> I<00:01:55.529> didn't

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
cues with your auto loop and I didn't

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:56.690 
cues with your auto loop and I didn't
really<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.009> wasn't<00:01:56.219> really<00:01:56.429> feeling<00:01:56.670> that

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
really I wasn't really feeling that

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.669 
really I wasn't really feeling that
because<00:01:57.179> we<00:01:57.299> had<00:01:57.420> three<00:01:57.569> hot<00:01:57.810> keys<00:01:58.049> but<00:01:58.499> if<00:01:58.619> you

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
because we had three hot keys but if you

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:00.319 
because we had three hot keys but if you
use<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.950> auto<00:01:59.100> loop<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.819> would<00:01:59.939> right<00:02:00.119> away

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
use the auto loop it would right away

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.209 
use the auto loop it would right away
right<00:02:00.569> away<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.840> lose<00:02:01.109> you<00:02:01.740> lose<00:02:01.889> that<00:02:02.100> one

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
right away you lose you lose that one

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.340 
right away you lose you lose that one
huh<00:02:02.399> cute<00:02:02.670> now<00:02:03.179> the<00:02:03.240> hotkey<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.929> its<00:02:04.200> own

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
huh cute now the hotkey is its own

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.760 
huh cute now the hotkey is its own
little<00:02:04.439> area<00:02:04.709> the<00:02:05.579> auto<00:02:05.789> loop<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.529> works<00:02:07.529> off

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
little area the auto loop is works off

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.309 
little area the auto loop is works off
also<00:02:08.039> with<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.399> manual<00:02:08.789> loop<00:02:08.970> before<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
also with the manual loop before the

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.870 
also with the manual loop before the
manual<00:02:10.649> loop<00:02:10.740> is<00:02:10.890> over<00:02:11.099> here<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.459> then<00:02:11.700> I

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
manual loop is over here and then I

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.010 
manual loop is over here and then I
didn't<00:02:12.090> like<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:12.240> either<00:02:12.510> because<00:02:12.630> you<00:02:12.840> kind

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
didn't like that either because you kind

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.570 
didn't like that either because you kind
of<00:02:13.080> forget<00:02:13.349> about<00:02:13.410> it<00:02:13.740> cuz<00:02:13.890> it's<00:02:14.010> over<00:02:14.190> here

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
of forget about it cuz it's over here

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.370 
of forget about it cuz it's over here
you<00:02:14.970> know<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.209> now<00:02:15.330> they<00:02:15.450> put<00:02:15.569> together<00:02:15.720> you

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
you know so now they put together you

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.440 
you know so now they put together you
auto<00:02:16.620> loop<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.100> now<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.820> one<00:02:18.060> thing<00:02:18.210> I<00:02:18.300> really

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
auto loop it now the one thing I really

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.030 
auto loop it now the one thing I really
liked<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.900> at<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.080> fix

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
liked it at the fix

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.059 
liked it at the fix
is<00:02:20.129> you<00:02:20.670> would<00:02:20.819> trim<00:02:21.060> down<00:02:21.269> on<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.260> 3700<00:02:22.980> you

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
is you would trim down on a 3700 you

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.640 
is you would trim down on a 3700 you
would<00:02:23.189> trim<00:02:23.400> down<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.730> loop<00:02:23.939> by<00:02:24.599> using<00:02:24.900> like<00:02:25.620> a

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
would trim down the loop by using like a

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.559 
would trim down the loop by using like a
knob<00:02:25.920> like<00:02:26.159> this<00:02:26.370> but<00:02:26.969> the<00:02:27.060> problem<00:02:27.329> is<00:02:27.420> when

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
knob like this but the problem is when

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.270 
knob like this but the problem is when
you're<00:02:27.689> when<00:02:27.930> you're<00:02:27.959> minimizing<00:02:28.379> it<00:02:28.799> you

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
you're when you're minimizing it you

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.280 
you're when you're minimizing it you
might<00:02:29.459> go<00:02:29.609> too<00:02:29.819> fast<00:02:30.030> like<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.629> screwed<00:02:31.049> up<00:02:31.140> and

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
might go too fast like I screwed up and

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.170 
might go too fast like I screwed up and
it<00:02:31.349> didn't<00:02:31.620> sound<00:02:31.739> clean<00:02:32.069> now<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.700> just<00:02:33.000> hit

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
it didn't sound clean now you just hit

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.140 
it didn't sound clean now you just hit
what<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:33.989> want<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.769> know<00:02:34.859> to<00:02:34.920> beat<00:02:35.280> loop<00:02:35.519> for

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
what you want you know to beat loop for

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.259 
what you want you know to beat loop for
me<00:02:36.269> loop<00:02:36.450> go<00:02:36.989> down<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.939> like<00:02:38.939> that<00:02:39.090> feature

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
me loop go down so I like that feature

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.940 
me loop go down so I like that feature
its<00:02:39.629> little<00:02:40.049> features<00:02:40.319> I<00:02:40.409> sense<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:40.859> people

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
its little features I sense that people

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.449 
its little features I sense that people
are<00:02:41.099> gonna<00:02:41.189> really<00:02:41.400> dig<00:02:42.019> this<00:02:43.019> also<00:02:43.319> has<00:02:43.769> the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
about the engine is that you have now

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.270 
about the engine is that you have now
the<00:03:22.530> choice<00:03:22.829> of<00:03:23.299> putting<00:03:24.299> a<00:03:24.659> hot<00:03:25.440> cue<00:03:25.769> or<00:03:26.010> doing

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
the choice of putting a hot cue or doing

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.580 
the choice of putting a hot cue or doing
loops<00:03:26.489> in<00:03:26.790> there<00:03:26.970> so<00:03:27.329> you<00:03:27.389> can<00:03:27.599> really<00:03:27.750> let's

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
loops in there so you can really let's

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.750 
loops in there so you can really let's
say<00:03:28.739> you're<00:03:29.040> gonna<00:03:29.129> go<00:03:29.280> somewhere<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.669> say

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
say you're gonna go somewhere and say
