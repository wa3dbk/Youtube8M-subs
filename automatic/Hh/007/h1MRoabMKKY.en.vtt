zero<00:02:12.820> which<00:02:13.820> means<00:02:13.850> he'd<00:02:14.570> roll<00:02:14.750> one<00:02:15.050> die<00:02:15.080> for

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
zero which means he'd roll one die for

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.100 
zero which means he'd roll one die for
yoga<00:02:16.160> thoughts<00:02:16.520> attack<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:17.030> first<00:02:17.240> turn<00:02:17.450> and

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
yoga thoughts attack the first turn and

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.770 
yoga thoughts attack the first turn and
eventually<00:02:20.200> 0000<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.350> so<00:02:21.440> on<00:02:22.420> he<00:02:23.420> has<00:02:23.510> one

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
eventually 0000 and so on he has one

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.300 
eventually 0000 and so on he has one
gate<00:02:24.080> so<00:02:24.860> he<00:02:25.160> could<00:02:25.310> survive<00:02:25.640> at<00:02:25.820> once<00:02:26.290> but

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
gate so he could survive at once but

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.360 
gate so he could survive at once but
after<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.700> he<00:02:29.150> wouldn't<00:02:29.600> make<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:29.780> very<00:02:30.500> long

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
504 and a will zero so with her base

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.010 
504 and a will zero so with her base
fight<00:04:25.190> she<00:04:25.550> can<00:04:25.700> deal<00:04:25.850> no<00:04:26.090> damage<00:04:26.420> geox<00:04:26.660> off

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.920 
fight she can deal no damage geox off
and<00:04:27.320> let's<00:04:28.010> use<00:04:28.250> her<00:04:28.400> aid<00:04:28.580> clue<00:04:28.790> tokens<00:04:28.970> which

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
and let's use her aid clue tokens which

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.380 
and let's use her aid clue tokens which
if<00:04:30.230> she<00:04:30.470> rolled<00:04:30.710> perfectly<00:04:31.430> and<00:04:32.030> got<00:04:32.180> all

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
if she rolled perfectly and got all

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.330 
if she rolled perfectly and got all
successes<00:04:32.840> she<00:04:33.650> could<00:04:33.800> deal<00:04:33.919> a<00:04:33.950> total<00:04:34.280> of

ok so the past few days I've been
dreading<00:04:57.620> doing<00:04:57.800> this<00:04:58.010> video<00:04:58.160> because<00:04:58.520> I<00:04:59.510> knew

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
dreading doing this video because I knew

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.070 
dreading doing this video because I knew
that<00:04:59.780> yog<00:05:00.140> Sothoth<00:05:00.260> was<00:05:00.860> so<00:05:01.330> powerful<00:05:02.330> and<00:05:02.930> our

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
that yog Sothoth was so powerful and our

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.060 
that yog Sothoth was so powerful and our
investigators<00:05:03.620> weren't<00:05:03.800> really<00:05:03.980> prepared

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
investigators weren't really prepared

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.900 
investigators weren't really prepared
for<00:05:04.870> my<00:05:05.870> fault<00:05:06.140> I<00:05:06.290> probably<00:05:06.530> should<00:05:06.680> have<00:05:06.910> gone

circumstances if we followed everything

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.740 
circumstances if we followed everything
to<00:05:33.560> Hank<00:05:33.820> everybody<00:05:34.820> used<00:05:35.030> every<00:05:35.300> clue<00:05:35.450> token

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
to Hank everybody used every clue token

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.060 
to Hank everybody used every clue token
they<00:05:35.840> had<00:05:36.080> if<00:05:36.830> you<00:05:37.310> rolled<00:05:37.610> all<00:05:37.760> successes<00:05:39.070> the

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
they had if you rolled all successes the

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.920 
they had if you rolled all successes the
most<00:05:40.490> we<00:05:40.760> could<00:05:40.880> do<00:05:41.030> before<00:05:41.210> everybody<00:05:41.750> was

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
most we could do before everybody was

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.210 
most we could do before everybody was
devoured<00:05:42.350> is<00:05:42.640> 25<00:05:43.640> damage<00:05:44.140> as<00:05:45.140> i<00:05:46.010> said<00:05:46.160> earlier

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
devoured is 25 damage as i said earlier

before<00:05:51.169> he<00:05:51.530> goes<00:05:51.650> down<00:05:51.919> so<00:05:53.680> this<00:05:54.680> game<00:05:54.979> is<00:05:55.010> a

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
before he goes down so this game is a

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.490 
before he goes down so this game is a
guaranteed<00:05:56.120> loss<00:05:56.360> we<00:05:56.660> can't<00:05:56.870> even<00:05:57.140> fight<00:05:57.320> off

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
guaranteed loss we can't even fight off

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.010 
guaranteed loss we can't even fight off
the<00:05:57.710> ancient<00:05:58.039> one<00:05:58.240> which<00:05:59.240> me<00:05:59.600> personally

the ancient one which me personally
whatever<00:06:00.260> the<00:06:00.350> interval<00:06:00.620> Winx<00:06:00.830> wakes<00:06:01.160> up<00:06:01.340> i

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
whatever the interval Winx wakes up i

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.640 
whatever the interval Winx wakes up i
kind<00:06:01.760> of<00:06:01.820> consider<00:06:01.880> that<00:06:02.270> a<00:06:02.330> loss<00:06:02.539> anyway<00:06:02.870> i

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
kind of consider that a loss anyway i

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.180 
kind of consider that a loss anyway i
know<00:06:04.310> that<00:06:04.669> in<00:06:04.789> our<00:06:04.880> second<00:06:05.150> game<00:06:06.039> we<00:06:07.039> took

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
know that in our second game we took

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.210 
know that in our second game we took
down<00:06:07.340> our<00:06:07.669> flow<00:06:07.850> tab<00:06:08.030> but<00:06:08.840> that's<00:06:09.830> to<00:06:10.100> me

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
down our flow tab but that's to me

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.560 
down our flow tab but that's to me
that's<00:06:10.340> kinda<00:06:10.550> just<00:06:10.640> a<00:06:10.700> draw<00:06:10.910> when<00:06:11.270> everything

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
that's kinda just a draw when everything

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.240 
that's kinda just a draw when everything
intial<00:06:11.780> wakes<00:06:11.930> up<00:06:12.080> because<00:06:12.380> when<00:06:13.070> they<00:06:13.130> wake

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
intial wakes up because when they wake

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.920 
intial wakes up because when they wake
up<00:06:13.400> they<00:06:13.580> kind<00:06:13.729> destroy<00:06:14.000> everything<00:06:14.419> you<00:06:14.780> know

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
up they kind destroy everything you know

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.610 
up they kind destroy everything you know
