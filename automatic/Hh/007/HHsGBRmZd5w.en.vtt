00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
this is Shawn and what I've got here is

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.760 
this is Shawn and what I've got here is
a<00:00:03.600> 2001<00:00:04.440> SL<00:00:05.190> 2<00:00:05.430> and<00:00:06.200> I<00:00:07.200> pick<00:00:07.410> this<00:00:07.529> car<00:00:07.740> up

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
a 2001 SL 2 and I pick this car up

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.129 
a 2001 SL 2 and I pick this car up
yesterday<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.519> one<00:00:09.300> of<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.450> problems<00:00:09.809> it<00:00:09.960> has

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
yesterday and one of the problems it has

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.120 
yesterday and one of the problems it has
is<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.740> intake<00:00:11.130> manifold<00:00:12.200> right<00:00:13.200> here<00:00:13.740> this

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
is the intake manifold right here this

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.120 
is the intake manifold right here this
coolant<00:00:14.549> line<00:00:14.750> the<00:00:15.750> little<00:00:15.990> nipple<00:00:16.350> on<00:00:16.590> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
coolant line the little nipple on the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.760 
coolant line the little nipple on the
manifold<00:00:17.730> side<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.210> broken<00:00:18.420> off<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.020> it's

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
manifold side is broken off and it's

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.279 
manifold side is broken off and it's
leaking<00:00:20.310> coolant<00:00:20.720> and<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:21.930> what<00:00:22.050> I'm<00:00:22.140> going<00:00:22.230> to

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
leaking coolant and so what I'm going to

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.070 
leaking coolant and so what I'm going to
try<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.500> do<00:00:22.710> today<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:23.189> walk<00:00:23.430> through

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
try to do today is walk through

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.089 
try to do today is walk through
replacing<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.230> intake<00:00:25.650> manifold<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:28.099> I'm

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
replacing that intake manifold and I'm

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.569 
replacing that intake manifold and I'm
going<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.400> be<00:00:29.519> replacing<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:31.189> with<00:00:32.189> one<00:00:32.430> that

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
going to be replacing it with one that

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.240 
going to be replacing it with one that
I've<00:00:32.669> got<00:00:32.700> off<00:00:33.000> another<00:00:33.239> engine<00:00:33.600> over<00:00:33.780> here

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
I've got off another engine over here

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.950 
I've got off another engine over here
which<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.399> right<00:00:35.579> here<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.239> whole

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
which is right here so this whole

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.770 
which is right here so this whole
plastic<00:00:37.500> piece<00:00:37.710> right<00:00:37.950> here<00:00:38.570> I'll<00:00:39.570> be

replacing so here we are back at the car
what<00:00:42.780> I've<00:00:42.870> done<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.200> I've<00:00:43.350> removed<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.460> air

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
what I've done is I've removed the air

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.229 
what I've done is I've removed the air
tube<00:00:44.910> off<00:00:45.149> here<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.980> have<00:00:46.980> taken<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.489> fuel

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
tube off here I have taken this fuel

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.529 
tube off here I have taken this fuel
line<00:00:48.510> loose<00:00:48.809> right<00:00:49.590> here<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.480> there's<00:00:51.480> a

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
line loose right here and there's a

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.350 
line loose right here and there's a
little<00:00:51.660> connector<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.230> 10<00:00:52.710> millimeter<00:00:52.949> nut<00:00:53.360> so

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
little connector a 10 millimeter nut so

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.889 
little connector a 10 millimeter nut so
that'll<00:00:54.660> slide<00:00:54.899> off<00:00:55.110> now<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.410> fuel<00:00:55.710> line<00:00:55.890> and

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
that'll slide off now the fuel line and

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.220 
that'll slide off now the fuel line and
out<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.079> way<00:00:58.820> you've<00:00:59.820> got<00:00:59.850> a<00:01:00.030> little<00:01:00.230> brace

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
out of the way you've got a little brace

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.810 
out of the way you've got a little brace
here<00:01:01.500> with<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.710> power<00:01:01.890> steering<00:01:02.129> pump<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.670> want

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
here with the power steering pump I want

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.570 
here with the power steering pump I want
to<00:01:02.879> get<00:01:03.000> rid<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.530> I've<00:01:04.530> also<00:01:04.890> pulled<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
to get rid of that I've also pulled the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.630 
to get rid of that I've also pulled the
throttle<00:01:06.210> cable<00:01:06.979> off<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.189> throttle<00:01:08.549> body

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
throttle cable off the throttle body

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.660 
throttle cable off the throttle body
here<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.090> get<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.360> out<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.659> way<00:01:10.369> next<00:01:11.369> I'm

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
here to get that out of the way next I'm

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.420 
here to get that out of the way next I'm
going<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.850> try<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.180> remove<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:13.260> fuel<00:01:14.189> rail

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
going to try and remove the fuel rail

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.660 
going to try and remove the fuel rail
here<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:16.409> fuel<00:01:16.650> rail<00:01:16.860> here<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.310> held<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.610> with

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
here the fuel rail here is held on with

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.109 
here the fuel rail here is held on with
2<00:01:17.939> 8<00:01:18.180> millimeter<00:01:18.600> bolts<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.369> also<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.640> have

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
2 8 millimeter bolts and also I have

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.120 
2 8 millimeter bolts and also I have
disconnected<00:01:21.509> these<00:01:21.810> three<00:01:22.140> connectors<00:01:22.590> from

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
disconnected these three connectors from

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.670 
disconnected these three connectors from
the<00:01:23.250> throttle<00:01:23.460> body<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.080> now<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.290> fuel

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
the throttle body and so now the fuel

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.940 
the throttle body and so now the fuel
rail<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.040> able<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.369> come<00:01:26.520> out<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.829> there<00:01:28.829> was<00:01:28.890> a

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
rail is able to come out and there was a

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.190 
rail is able to come out and there was a
connector<00:01:29.369> down<00:01:30.270> here<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.869> had<00:01:31.020> to

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
connector down here that I had to

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.179 
connector down here that I had to
disconnect<00:01:31.950> also<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:33.680> so<00:01:34.680> now<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.130> should

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
disconnect also and so now this should

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.800 
disconnect also and so now this should
hopefully<00:01:36.470> whoops<00:01:37.470> hopefully<00:01:38.540> stay<00:01:39.540> out<00:01:39.780> of

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
hopefully whoops hopefully stay out of

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.440 
hopefully whoops hopefully stay out of
the<00:01:39.960> way<00:01:40.079> back<00:01:40.350> here<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.950> we<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.250> actually

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
the way back here and we can actually

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.929 
the way back here and we can actually
get<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.799> the<00:01:43.799> intake<00:01:44.310> manifold<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:47.460> remove<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
get to the intake manifold to remove the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.310 
get to the intake manifold to remove the
manifold<00:01:48.479> what<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.439> do<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.040> have<00:01:51.320> six

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
manifold what you do is you have six

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.130 
manifold what you do is you have six
thirteen<00:01:53.189> millimeter<00:01:53.399> nuts<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.810> hold<00:01:54.960> on

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
thirteen millimeter nuts that hold on

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.649 
thirteen millimeter nuts that hold on
these<00:01:55.320> studs<00:01:55.619> here<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.420> then<00:01:57.420> you've<00:01:57.540> also

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
these studs here and then you've also

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.670 
these studs here and then you've also
got<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.890> little<00:01:59.130> connector<00:01:59.549> here<00:01:59.850> and

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
got this little connector here and

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.790 
got this little connector here and
that's<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.799> 13<00:02:02.159> as<00:02:02.310> well<00:02:02.600> so<00:02:03.600> once<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.930> remove

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
that's a 13 as well so once you remove

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.800 
that's a 13 as well so once you remove
those<00:02:06.830> bolts<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.270> also<00:02:09.270> you've<00:02:09.479> got<00:02:09.510> an

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
those bolts and also you've got an

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.770 
those bolts and also you've got an
eight-millimeter<00:02:10.640> down<00:02:11.640> here<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.270> this<00:02:12.660> is

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
eight-millimeter down here and this is

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.480 
eight-millimeter down here and this is
best<00:02:13.050> accessed<00:02:13.530> from<00:02:13.680> underneath<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.280> car

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
best accessed from underneath the car

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.980 
best accessed from underneath the car
use<00:02:15.390> your<00:02:15.540> quarter-inch<00:02:16.260> driver<00:02:16.560> for<00:02:16.830> that

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
use your quarter-inch driver for that

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.800 
use your quarter-inch driver for that
then<00:02:18.990> your<00:02:19.230> intake<00:02:19.830> manifold<00:02:20.540> will<00:02:21.540> slide

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
then your intake manifold will slide

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.360 
then your intake manifold will slide
right<00:02:21.840> off<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:24.890> what<00:02:25.890> you'll<00:02:26.040> want<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.250> do

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
right off and what you'll want to do

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.120 
right off and what you'll want to do
also<00:02:26.550> is<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:26.910> replace<00:02:27.270> this<00:02:27.450> gasket<00:02:27.780> here<00:02:28.200> now

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
also is to replace this gasket here now

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.970 
also is to replace this gasket here now
this<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.670> tool<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:30.000> used<00:02:30.500> just<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.680> regular

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
this is the tool I used just a regular

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
loosen all these fasteners and so here

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.720 
loosen all these fasteners and so here
we<00:02:39.270> are<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:40.260> what<00:02:40.410> I've<00:02:40.500> done<00:02:40.740> here<00:02:41.250> in<00:02:41.400> the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
we are and what I've done here in the

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.550 
we are and what I've done here in the
car<00:02:42.440> is<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.950> have<00:02:44.880> removed<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.600> top<00:02:46.290> motor

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
car is I have removed the top motor

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.520 
car is I have removed the top motor
mount<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.300> supported<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.390> engine<00:02:48.720> from

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
mount and supported the engine from

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.530 
mount and supported the engine from
below<00:02:49.800> with<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.010> jack<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.670> then<00:02:51.390> I've<00:02:51.510> used

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
below with a jack and then I've used

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.650 
below with a jack and then I've used
this<00:02:52.020> ratchet<00:02:52.470> strap<00:02:52.740> here<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:54.120> kind<00:02:54.330> of<00:02:54.420> pull

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
this ratchet strap here to kind of pull

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.050 
this ratchet strap here to kind of pull
the<00:02:54.900> engine<00:02:55.260> back<00:02:56.010> away<00:02:56.340> from<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.640> firewall

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
the engine back away from the firewall

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.780 
the engine back away from the firewall
so<00:02:57.240> I<00:02:57.330> can<00:02:57.480> access<00:02:58.070> some<00:02:59.070> of<00:02:59.130> this<00:02:59.280> stuff<00:02:59.550> back

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
so I can access some of this stuff back

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.040 
so I can access some of this stuff back
here<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:01.740> we're<00:03:01.920> going<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.070> see<00:03:02.280> how<00:03:02.460> I<00:03:02.490> did

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
here and so we're going to see how I did

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.660 
here and so we're going to see how I did
see<00:03:04.050> if<00:03:04.140> I<00:03:04.200> can<00:03:04.350> get<00:03:04.470> this<00:03:04.620> intake<00:03:05.190> manifold

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
see if I can get this intake manifold

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.260 
see if I can get this intake manifold
out<00:03:05.820> of<00:03:05.970> here<00:03:06.210> and<00:03:07.220> it's<00:03:08.220> loose<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:08.940> it's<00:03:09.150> got

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
out of here and it's loose and it's got

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.910 
out of here and it's loose and it's got
to<00:03:09.360> come<00:03:09.480> off<00:03:09.600> of<00:03:09.810> those<00:03:09.900> studs<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:13.590> I<00:03:13.770> may

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
to come off of those studs and I may

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.180 
to come off of those studs and I may
have<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.100> put<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.310> camera<00:03:14.640> down<00:03:14.670> for<00:03:14.820> it<00:03:16.190> hang

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
have to put the camera down for it hang

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.870 
have to put the camera down for it hang
on<00:03:17.370> hey<00:03:18.330> after<00:03:18.540> about<00:03:18.810> 5<00:03:19.290> or<00:03:19.320> 10<00:03:19.650> minutes<00:03:19.800> I<00:03:20.190> got

on hey after about 5 or 10 minutes I got

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.870 
on hey after about 5 or 10 minutes I got
the<00:03:21.030> manifold<00:03:21.450> out<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:22.170> had<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.820> kind<00:03:23.820> of

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
the manifold out and I had to kind of

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.380 
the manifold out and I had to kind of
tweak<00:03:24.180> my<00:03:24.360> engine<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.810> little<00:03:25.020> bit<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:26.390> there

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
tweak my engine a little bit and there

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.540 
tweak my engine a little bit and there
was<00:03:27.480> one<00:03:27.660> more<00:03:27.810> hose<00:03:28.190> that<00:03:29.190> needed<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.459> be

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
was one more hose that needed to be

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.220 
was one more hose that needed to be
disconnected<00:03:29.970> once<00:03:30.300> I<00:03:30.420> got<00:03:30.600> it<00:03:30.690> out<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:32.190> here

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
disconnected once I got it out and here

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.540 
disconnected once I got it out and here
is<00:03:34.459> the<00:03:35.459> manifold<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:37.190> let<00:03:38.190> me<00:03:38.250> take<00:03:38.400> this

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
is the manifold and let me take this

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:51.500 
is the manifold and let me take this
outside<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.090> now<00:03:39.360> I'll<00:03:39.450> show<00:03:39.660> you

see<00:04:18.700> right<00:04:18.940> here<00:04:18.970> on<00:04:19.269> the<00:04:19.419> edge<00:04:20.200> there's<00:04:20.650> a

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
see right here on the edge there's a

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.740 
see right here on the edge there's a
little<00:04:20.890> ear<00:04:21.100> right<00:04:21.280> there<00:04:21.519> and<00:04:22.090> that's<00:04:22.480> a<00:04:22.600> good

little ear right there and that's a good
that<00:04:23.020> makes<00:04:23.140> a<00:04:23.290> good<00:04:23.410> place<00:04:23.590> to<00:04:23.620> start<00:04:24.210> so

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
that makes a good place to start so

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.580 
that makes a good place to start so
we're<00:04:25.450> going<00:04:25.540> to<00:04:25.600> take<00:04:25.780> this<00:04:26.760> manifold<00:04:27.760> and

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
we're going to take this manifold and

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.340 
we're going to take this manifold and
see<00:04:29.590> if<00:04:29.650> we<00:04:29.740> can<00:04:29.919> reinstall<00:04:30.220> it<00:04:31.080> one<00:04:32.080> thing<00:04:32.290> I

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
see if we can reinstall it one thing I

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.700 
see if we can reinstall it one thing I
want<00:04:32.530> to<00:04:32.560> note<00:04:32.770> too<00:04:34.080> this<00:04:35.080> little<00:04:35.320> hose<00:04:35.500> right

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
here which is on the back of the

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:47.320 
here which is on the back of the
manifold<00:04:41.260> is<00:04:41.760> going<00:04:42.760> to<00:04:42.940> plug<00:04:43.180> in

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.409 

it's<00:04:48.330> gonna<00:04:48.479> plug<00:04:48.780> in<00:04:49.970> right<00:04:50.970> here<00:04:51.270> between

it's gonna plug in right here between

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.680 
it's gonna plug in right here between
these<00:04:51.720> two<00:04:51.830> electrical<00:04:52.830> connectors<00:04:53.690> you've

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
these two electrical connectors you've

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.360 
these two electrical connectors you've
got<00:04:54.870> a<00:04:54.900> little<00:04:55.169> nipple<00:04:55.949> right<00:04:56.040> there<00:04:56.250> that

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
got a little nipple right there that

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.810 
got a little nipple right there that
that<00:04:56.400> hose<00:04:56.669> plugs<00:04:56.970> into<00:04:57.949> and<00:04:58.949> so<00:04:59.400> let's<00:04:59.580> get<00:04:59.699> it

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
that hose plugs into and so let's get it

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.170 
that hose plugs into and so let's get it
back<00:04:59.910> in<00:05:01.040> here<00:05:02.040> we<00:05:02.160> are<00:05:02.190> again<00:05:02.400> I've<00:05:02.760> got<00:05:02.940> the

before<00:05:13.830> I<00:05:14.010> did<00:05:14.280> this<00:05:15.090> little<00:05:15.650> connector<00:05:16.650> here

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
before I did this little connector here

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.129 
before I did this little connector here
I<00:05:17.040> reinstalled<00:05:17.610> that<00:05:17.820> we<00:05:18.600> installed<00:05:18.990> the

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
back in and give this a try and see how

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.440 
back in and give this a try and see how
we<00:05:47.250> did<00:05:48.260> and<00:05:49.260> so<00:05:49.919> a<00:05:50.190> couple<00:05:50.760> of<00:05:50.910> notes<00:05:51.120> this

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
we did and so a couple of notes this

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.589 
we did and so a couple of notes this
took<00:05:51.660> me<00:05:51.810> about<00:05:52.760> about<00:05:53.760> two<00:05:53.940> and<00:05:54.060> a<00:05:54.090> half<00:05:54.210> hours

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:54.599 
took me about about two and a half hours

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:56.719 
took me about about two and a half hours
and<00:05:54.930> I'd<00:05:55.740> never<00:05:55.860> done<00:05:56.130> it<00:05:56.220> before<00:05:56.340> with<00:05:56.610> the

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
and I'd never done it before with the

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:58.850 
and I'd never done it before with the
engine<00:05:57.000> in<00:05:57.120> the<00:05:57.180> car<00:05:57.360> only<00:05:58.200> with<00:05:58.470> the<00:05:58.560> engine
