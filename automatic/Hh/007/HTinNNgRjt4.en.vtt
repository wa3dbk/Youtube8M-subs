the<00:02:54.590> next<00:02:54.800> thing<00:02:54.890> we're<00:02:55.040> going<00:02:55.130> to<00:02:55.190> do<00:02:55.430> is

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
the next thing we're going to do is

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.270 
the next thing we're going to do is
learn<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:56.600> play<00:02:56.780> what's<00:02:57.020> called<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.560> turnaround

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
learn to play what's called a turnaround

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.210 
learn to play what's called a turnaround
and<00:02:58.730> a<00:02:59.180> turnaround<00:02:59.510> is<00:02:59.840> usually<00:03:00.200> just<00:03:00.230> a<00:03:00.620> two

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
and a turnaround is usually just a two

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.760 
and a turnaround is usually just a two
bar<00:03:01.580> or<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:02.060> measure<00:03:02.270> phrase<00:03:02.720> that<00:03:03.470> helps

bar or to measure phrase that helps
connect<00:03:04.130> passages<00:03:04.880> in<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:05.330> song<00:03:05.540> especially

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
connect passages in a song especially

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.000 
connect passages in a song especially
between<00:03:07.069> verses<00:03:07.490> or<00:03:07.760> choruses<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.800> this<00:03:09.800> is<00:03:09.980> a

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
between verses or choruses and this is a

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.160 
between verses or choruses and this is a
one<00:03:10.730> that's<00:03:10.910> not<00:03:11.060> too<00:03:11.270> hard<00:03:11.300> to<00:03:11.600> play<00:03:11.900> in

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
one that's not too hard to play in

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.199 
one that's not too hard to play in
twelve<00:03:12.500> position<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.160> it'll<00:03:13.940> give<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:14.150> a

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
twelve position and it'll give you a

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.140 
twelve position and it'll give you a
even<00:03:14.959> better<00:03:15.110> feel<00:03:15.980> for<00:03:16.280> 12th<00:03:16.640> position<00:03:16.760> so

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
even better feel for 12th position so

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.460 
even better feel for 12th position so
let's<00:03:17.360> go<00:03:17.480> ahead<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:17.750> take<00:03:18.320> a<00:03:18.350> look<00:03:18.530> at<00:03:18.709> it
