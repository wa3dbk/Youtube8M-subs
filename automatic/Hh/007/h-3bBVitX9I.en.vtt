00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
rum you could for example since we've

got some apples here a bit of an apple

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.490 
got some apples here a bit of an apple
jack<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:48.329> can<00:01:48.540> really<00:01:48.780> do<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.020> want<00:01:49.229> and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
jack you can really do it you want and

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.320 
jack you can really do it you want and
then<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.700> stir<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.299> all<00:01:51.479> together

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
then you stir this all together

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.090 
then you stir this all together
and<00:01:53.420> let<00:01:53.960> it<00:01:54.110> thicken<00:01:56.200> know<00:01:57.200> this<00:01:57.620> in<00:01:57.770> a<00:01:57.830> minute

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
and let it thicken know this in a minute

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.760 
and let it thicken know this in a minute
but<00:01:58.220> I<00:01:58.250> think<00:01:58.610> before<00:01:59.120> we<00:01:59.390> do<00:01:59.720> that<00:01:59.750> let<00:02:00.650> it

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
but I think before we do that let it

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.860 
but I think before we do that let it
