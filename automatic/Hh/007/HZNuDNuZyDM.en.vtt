00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:02.430
 unionism 

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.280
 complex that exists 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.320
 your organic functions your emotions your decisions your memories 

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:12.129
 everything is regulated by him is interest account 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:18.400
 the day we are paralyzed and others take a chance 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.519
 together we take in taking the right option 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.400
 because we believe that our memory capacity 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.529
 it's time to know your brain that seconded is working on the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.159
 answer 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:32.290
 brain 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.290
 without cuts 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.870
 the human brain one of the greatest enigmas 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.350
 the brain is the most complicated mechanism that exists in the universe 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.860
 we have learned more about the brain in the last five years than in the 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.570
 last five thousand years 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.920
 We came away with the idea that she only a few years ago 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.940
 for the first time we are actually seeing what happens in the brain 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.140
 during sex it is known that sex is located in the middle of the ears then 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.140
 something very intense must happen in the brain during sex 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.360
 what a few years ago the wicked wrote the list of things to do 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.360
 in front of the house stop watching girls not kill 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.850
 there really was what is known as extrasensory perception 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.860
 finally and technology are revealing the secrets of the brain is 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.860
 explaining why we act like we do 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.190
 is helping the experts to develop new methods and machines 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.600
 to increase brain power as well as a reverend the skills 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.600
 wasted that we all have in our heads 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.230
 the brain controls all aspects of our life 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.040
 as in the human being has evolved the brain has doubled its 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.170
 size think only 1 point 36 kilograms but consume 20% of all the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.140
 fuel that enters our body and generates enough energy capable of 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.959
 keep a light bulb on 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.540
 we must take into account that the brain experienced a similar evolution 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.109
 I'll make an old house 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:22.040
 to which we were losing civilian lives as well as all these efforts and 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.019
 pressures 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.750
 at the base of the brain is the oldest part called the club act 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:28.810
 encephalic 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.610
 it's something that we have in common with reptiles and other mammals is what 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.420
 keeps us alive as vital functions as the rhythm 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.239
 cardiac or breathing digestion and blood pressure things 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.029
 that happen without us having to think about them 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:46.739
 more and more up on the first floor the developers and time for hundreds 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.059
 thousands of years later and is called the limbic system 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.349
 since I am important the processing of emotions 

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:01.599
 within the limbic system is the victim the 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.189
 they are more bland of almond-shaped tissue that is found one in each 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.879
 hemisphere of the brain are not bigger than a fingernail but they are the center 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.959
 of the brain that controls processes and stores our reactions 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.259
 emotional 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:16.919
 one of the most simple and strong emotions is fear is an emotion 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.259
 primigenia that we all feel 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:23.719
 if I had to choose an area of ​​the brain where fear is important 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.819
 it would be the amygdala 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.569
 the best place to explore how a fear affects the brain is in the 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.249
 special operations forces of the United States Navy in San Diego 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:37.109
 California 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.289
 they are not recruits or they are put in specialized trainings for 

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:43.289
 change the way your brain are reacting to fear 

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:53.059
 there practically from the first day the students are subjected to a 

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:56.059
 absolute chaos 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.949
 they have to fight 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.739
 and there were when you analyze the mistakes made in the battlefield almost 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.739
 they are always associated with fear or panic 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:13.229
 so the ability to control these houston impulses 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:16.259
 it is extremely important 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:20.019
 of a total of 140 candidates that starts each class is just an average 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.800
 of 36 will reach the end 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.460
 they are not successful recruits are those who could better adapt their brains 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.460
 to the demands of work 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:34.279
 the physical conditions of the applicants do not guarantee that they will overcome 

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:37.739
 this training there are cases of Olympic athletes who have abandoned 

00:04:37.739 --> 00:04:42.110
 this training is the case of a Nebraska boy who headed 73 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.969
 kilos and a half and had never seen the sea managed to graduate why it happens 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:47.520
 this 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.889
 for prisoners to see this question the army resorted to neuroscience 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.340
 when we face fear the amygdala that the one that processes the 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.940
 information received by our senses and the one that instinctively activates 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.940
 the panic button of the body 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.389
 The amygdala is actually one of the most interconnected areas of the 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.439
 sector will send signals some brain stem areas to produce a 

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:16.969
 series of bodily responses will begin to sound will accelerate the 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:17.689
 heart 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:21.509
 you will feel frozen at times until you could run out 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:26.710
 this exercise known as defensive tactics practices with hoods and 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.900
 part of a close defense system is one of the conditions in which the 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.480
 Army of the United States submits its recruits 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.330
 so that we can control the signals emitted by the amygdala our 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.409
 students will not be able to avoid rivera 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:42.189
 the instructors will create a scenario 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:45.439
 close then the hoods will be removed 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:47.199
 to the students 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:49.809
 the destination and this should react 

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:53.229
 When you have that hood, you just have moments to think about the 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.589
 possible scenarios that could be profitable 

00:05:56.589 --> 00:06:00.689
 with everything sometimes the correct soil and lethal answers 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:06.909
 other times they are not violent 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:09.830
 a gas station will be rushed my car is running out 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.950
 fuel in that direction if 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.490
 Thank you 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.150
 you try to play two instantaneous sessions those high situations 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.150
 risk that happens in a fraction of time 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:33.050
 that's why now 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.830
 in fact throughout the race you face to see with the fact that the 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.830
 panic will be getting smaller and smaller with time in training 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:46.270
 agents of the 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.199
 from the av 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:51.599
 the right way to coaches first is to put people to 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:55.650
 situations of fear to which to get accustomed and sure to know how 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.909
 react to such situations 

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:01.150
 Being in constant exposure to terrifying situations 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.690
 and they are recruits learn to suppress fear that otherwise they would not be 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.849
 react erroneously and expose them to death 

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:10.679
 but how the brain manages to do this
