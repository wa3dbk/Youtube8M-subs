 several sections following auditions 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:34.440

 a set that can be found in your garden 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.850
 for a year in a parking lot in paris 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.040
 and then we find ants and grasshoppers facts that have

 it will be enlarged 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.260

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.630
 stating that 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.840
 these decisions and at the same time announced 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.799
