 segarra lopez and romero espinoza montoya 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.320
 we are both engineering students 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.210
 Multimedia at the University of Alicante 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.130

 You can with some simple steps upload your 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.140

 free web I recommend that you see the 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:37.579
 Free video hosting belonging 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.800
 to the course and web 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.640
 in this case we will use the service 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.199
 provided by 000 dotcom web host 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.739
 I will also briefly comment on 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.329
 benefits offered by said service 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.799
 000 web post offers a series of 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.510
 characteristics that make it a 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:55.579
 very interesting free hosting 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.750
 some of its benefits are the 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.089
 following 1500 megs of storage 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.460
 100 gigabytes of data traffic allows the 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:07.179
 use of php has a simple creator of 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.439
 Websites allows the loading of scripts 

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:12.280
 access via ftp through a 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.869
 user allows two mysql databases 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.940
 allows us five sub domains and five 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.899
 five mail domains basic support 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.340
 It also gives us another series of 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.140
 characteristics that you can see in the 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.270
 next link 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.940
 Now I'm going to tell you the steps you should take 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.250
 continue to create an account in 000 web 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.100
 post dotcom and upload a web page of 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.979
 example 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.590
 first of all let's go to the 000 page 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.369
 web host dotcom and we move to the 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.290
 lower part 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.270
 of that page and press order now 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.160
 We appear the following form 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.380
 record where we will fill all 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.080
 the fields being the most important the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.940
 domain name 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.880
 once all the fields are filled 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.920
 click on create my account located in 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.990
 the bottom of that form of 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.690
 this way we will have already created 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.850
 our first domain is worth noting that 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.100
 we can create a subdomain of 000 web 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.259
 dotcom hosts or employ a domain that 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.360
 we have previously acquired 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.250
 the next step will be to go to our 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.989
 email and give the link to 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.379
 activation that will appear in the mail 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.180
 000 web host will have sent us to have 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.950
 in mind that such mail could be 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.860
 in the junk mail or mail folder 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.569
 unwanted will automatically send us 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.000
 a page like the one you can see in 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.860
 screen we can see that the web 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.750
 It is in the process of being built but in 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.270
 little time will be active we update 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.800
 the page we will see that it is already active 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.500
 when an account is already active 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.320
 we can click on go to control panel 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.900
 to upload the files that make up 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.700
 our web 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.680
 in the administration panel we 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.480
 many options will appear but now 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.160
 the one that interests us is file 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.140
 manager 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.730
 before this page appears we 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.620
 They will ask for the password to access the 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.650
 file directory this password 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.850
 will be the same as our account 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.230
 Yesterday we will be able to load the 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.690
 files from our website 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.900
 for this we access the public folder 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.850
 low bar html on the screen that 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.500
 appears below you can see all 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.100
 the archives and directories of our 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.700
 Web page 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.319
 now click on the upload option 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.000
 on the screen where we are 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.890
 now it 's the upload screen 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.599
 files here we can upload all the 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.209
 archives of our web in a file 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:29.780
 compressed point, dot, dot, point, dot 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.640

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.800
 upload individual files in the case 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.010
 of wanting to upload a file or replace 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.810
 one already existing on the left 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.610
 in this case we will click on select 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.670
 file on the right side since 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.230
 we will upload a zip file now 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.940
 we simply look for our file 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.070
 zip point page and click on open 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.900
 Once the above is done we must press 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.250
 over the green approval symbol that 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.350
 you can see on screen 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.000
 If everything goes well we will see a 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.370
 notification with the state of our 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.980
 action is to tell us if everything 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.900
 has been successfully made to 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.790
 finish the process we go to our 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.780
 website and we can see that everything has been 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.850
 made successfully 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.650
 in the case that we want to edit some 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.330
 file individually we can 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.989
 go back to the admin panel and 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.669
 access file manager again 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.259
 to access the files of our 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.740
 web remember that we should click on 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:27.169
 public low bar html 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.289
 once here if we want to edit by 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:33.380
 example the file index.hr ml we press 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:35.509
 in edit here we can already do the 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.039
 modifications that we create timely and 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.750

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:41.630
 in the save icon to save the 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.370
 changes finally I would like to tell you 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.990
 that as always the best in these cases 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.910
 is to try the different possibilities 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.190
 that give us the different pages 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.569
 of hosting or hosting and stay with 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.940
 the one that best suits our 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:54.160
 needs 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.720
 and with this ends this video remembers
