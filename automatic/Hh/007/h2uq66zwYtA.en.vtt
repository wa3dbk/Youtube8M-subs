bounce and vertical paging which I do

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.240 
bounce and vertical paging which I do
think<00:02:32.990> is<00:02:33.170> really<00:02:33.500> good<00:02:33.710> because<00:02:33.860> it<00:02:34.100> makes

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
think is really good because it makes

for<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.390> lab<00:02:38.860> looks<00:02:39.860> like<00:02:40.130> off<00:02:40.430> by<00:02:40.820> mistakes

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
for the lab looks like off by mistakes

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.840 
for the lab looks like off by mistakes
looks<00:02:41.810> like<00:02:42.020> normal<00:02:42.470> paging<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.100> scrolling

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
looks like normal paging and scrolling

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.030 
looks like normal paging and scrolling
down<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:44.420> looks<00:02:44.600> like<00:02:44.840> normal<00:02:45.230> paging<00:02:45.680> as<00:02:45.830> well

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.790 
down it looks like normal paging as well
which<00:02:46.850> I<00:02:47.000> do<00:02:47.060> think<00:02:47.450> is<00:02:47.600> very<00:02:47.750> handy<00:02:48.290> if<00:02:48.500> you

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
which I do think is very handy if you

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.770 
which I do think is very handy if you
sort<00:02:49.250> of<00:02:49.340> like<00:02:49.490> have<00:02:49.700> things<00:02:50.000> on<00:02:50.240> specific

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
sort of like have things on specific

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.990 
sort of like have things on specific
pages<00:02:51.050> and<00:02:51.410> you<00:02:51.980> haven't<00:02:52.250> got<00:02:52.370> enough<00:02:52.459> room<00:02:52.850> to

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.640 
pages and you haven't got enough room to
go<00:02:53.120> left<00:02:53.330> right<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.870> could<00:02:54.050> just<00:02:54.260> all<00:02:54.440> right

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
go left right you could just all right

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.760 
go left right you could just all right
