00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
I understood suddenly how thought was

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:37.880 
I understood suddenly how thought was
just<00:00:28.880> an<00:00:29.880> illusory<00:00:30.359> thing<00:00:32.390> and<00:00:34.399> how<00:00:36.890> thought

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
just an illusory thing and how thought

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
the suffering we experienced and then I

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.299 
the suffering we experienced and then I
suddenly<00:00:51.960> felt<00:00:52.410> like<00:00:54.320> I<00:00:55.320> was<00:00:55.530> looking<00:00:56.010> at

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
suddenly felt like I was looking at

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.069 
suddenly felt like I was looking at
these<00:00:56.699> thoughts<00:00:57.090> from<00:00:57.480> another<00:00:57.750> perspective

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.560 
and I wondered who is it
that's<00:01:02.879> aware<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.660> I'm<00:01:03.840> thinking<00:01:04.290> and

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570

suddenly I was thrown into this
expansive<00:01:11.299> amazing<00:01:12.299> feeling<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.770> freedom

expansive amazing feeling of freedom

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.800

from myself from my problems I saw that

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.070 
from myself from my problems I saw that
I<00:01:21.869> was<00:01:22.110> bigger<00:01:22.520> than<00:01:23.520> what<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.820> do<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.420> was<00:01:24.810> bigger

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.770 

it's<00:01:57.110> like<00:01:57.320> riding<00:01:57.620> a<00:01:57.830> wave<00:01:58.600> sometimes<00:01:59.600> I'm<00:01:59.750> on

possibly<00:02:10.220> can<00:02:10.910> because<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:12.200> feeling<00:02:12.770> is

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
possibly can because the feeling is

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:27.660 
possibly can because the feeling is
amazing
