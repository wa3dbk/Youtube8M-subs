00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.360
 hello everyone and thank you chibane for a second video 2 mm kirk 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.479
 the game of hacking and then so virtual 

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:10.419
 he's still developing 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:14.589
 as in the first video we had seen how to connect a gp 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:16.960
 sign a contract of a year and a half we crack the password 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.869
 how to download files 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.239
 and for that I have if we are not well 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:24.599
 in this second video will attack a part a little bit more 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.640
 crispy let's say old 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.370
 so we'll see percent loading a virus his installation 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.449
 by the time we're going to see how apple ordered the slave bar to do 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:37.640
 work the virus 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.579
 how to make money with stopovers 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.329
 how to spend this money buying equipment 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.400
 and after three little ones anything like that by the way 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.880
 so when we start 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.670
 % one day on the internet we will return to the franck server 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.930
 will fully assume the first video 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.930
 I believe the password 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.680
 far, so as usual 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.590
 there is a lasting trace so I will not take care of the war for the demo 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.310
 you saw from before how was it going 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.020
 in case there are two three little things that change the eyes I'm going 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.759
 you explain it after what was happening 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.209
 and there is especially this lose button that allows to load a file 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.950
 what interests us so the list of gingham she appears there 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.000
 where there was a lot played what creates a little bit later but what 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 interested me dr is to install my arrival of spam 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.160
 so I charge 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.380
 so there you see in English the delays are long 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.039
 a point this point set at 3% she advocates for developments but 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.840
 after 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.820
 the speed of loading what is the deposit of the harbor 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.970
 no connection speed that displays here 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.270
 so now I want a virus that is there 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.000
 if I saw the small town that allows to install the team 4 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.010
 compared to others who are not 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.010
 I install my cousin virus 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.380
 now so capsized what we saw no longer appears as before m he 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.340
 any other file but the same kerry is like that it's a 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.340
 finally does as if like that by cons 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.720
 you see who knows changed 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.720
 in all the turns that will be the finding d oran seif knows 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:14.069
 well now at eye level 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.669
 she stammered 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.939
 it's a button that can hide if I'm going 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.619
 in my software 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:26.689
 we see that the correspondent of afp at 8 o'clock m usher that allows 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.939
 hide files 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:31.919
 as long as I do I think that only want to see that I've installed a 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.919
 Jewish file and so the hidden 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:37.839
 that's how you see his name 

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:41.379
 there is nothing left there is nothing like this here which means that it is 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.379
 hidden 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:52.159
 which allows to hide files 3 033 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.489
 but also my psychiatrist who allows to be able to hidden files that 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.699
 encloses at point 4 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:00.729
 in other words I am able to see all the files that have been hidden 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:03.459
 in 0 34 no fence 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.029
 little demo 

00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:08.029
 if I also delete heart 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.619
 I do not have any more 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:17.109
 sigean refreshed cynical abatement virus and missing 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.409
 so he's still here except I'm not able to see him any more 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.409
 to hide and that I have not read all those that allow to see them 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:26.959
 alright so now I come quickly installed 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.339
 for 100 th before that so that the following 

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:32.000
 Download 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.810
 the fayot role see 86 seconds remember these figures for the future 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.249
 so let's put that I installed my russian 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:42.199
 the most important thing is to go and see how things were going 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.199
 slaves 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:46.780
 so we can see that m on the frankfurt show here 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.420
 jelly mixed hand a spa virus anne 0 anastasia on 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.789
 he is not in action 

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:56.029
 as required 

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:58.939
 in the software wound 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:02.019
 here this pact better 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.769
 I have the opportunity to be spammed so I'm more asked to spam 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.439
 so there we see any case an axiom subject is refreshed they are since 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.679
 four seconds six crowns and that was where 

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:14.810
 % 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.880
 especially continue to note the trianon the cavity quote the charges 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.319
 later we shall see 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:22.849
 so honestly it's fine buffet and slaves and viruses or 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.529
 saint-omer how do I make money 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:28.739
 if yes here I have a small blue button that can harvest the merchant 

00:04:28.739 --> 00:04:31.739
 generated by slaves that's good that's what I want to do 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.330
 I harvest calpella a unique message 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.560
 I gained 20 miles an hour and not yet defined the name of the currency that 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.289
 will be in the game 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.509
 but I believe that in the file of 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.779
 material at pessac tunnel finally I won a biscuit do not believe 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:47.320
 so yes 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.660
 little detail to you will never win twenty thousand 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:55.330
 for them 10 seconds works for a virus the day you will win 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.459
 20000 on a harvest it is you will have a lot a lot of slaves and 

00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:02.459
 that weezer worked for very very very very funny 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.420
 but hey there for the demo and like that still in development where I won 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:07.309
 20 minutes 

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:11.389
 super what can I do with his twenty thousand who in passing we see 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.699
 that blow virus these put back to work 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:16.120
 so with its 20 million 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.120
 haidara I can just go into the material 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:24.589
 so we see that I have a great intentions of 133 Begert it's a pretty 

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:27.860
 hard drive alain giguère and a good rtc connection 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:32.409
 so what interests me especially there for now 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.259
 the internet connection what you see there I am in 114 100% 414 28 classes 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:41.470
 it's not super awesome especially when you start to have ideas 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:43.529
 official contest 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:46.460
 there you see the tenth in the senate taken a minute 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.229
 a minute and a half 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:50.949
 so I will increase my internet connection 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:53.080
 % so I made a million 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.939
 flavin 2500 i'm trying to buy it i do not have enough money obviously 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:00.529
 so c and 1500 knew very well the dci 2 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:01.869
 so the livestock 

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:04.869
 so we see that I switched to blue naked adsl 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:08.960
 and that internet connections now in marine connections do not 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.479
 proposes that those that are above those that I obviously because we 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.400
 will not spend money to buy equipment at ferrières 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.509
 so you made the difference ie6 so young 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:18.879
 refreshments 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:22.080
 so I spend every member's health 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.330
 % and idea man me I'm his download focus but the server him 

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:30.660
 a pond 341 upload so loading 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.430
 which means that if I download could not download faster than 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.089
 341 points obviously we are limited 

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:39.800
 but suddenly do you keep changing our fayot and who took 86 

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:42.069
 against talent choice m 

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:45.069
 alas we take 28 is still much more fun 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:53.139
 so percent also that so much to do the giga chicane so for 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:55.669
 the moment I have only three waves 7% 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:59.400
 of price on the hard drive its margin of walking but let's say that I want 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.029
 to be thoughtful 

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:03.650
 I still have 3500 so I'm going 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.290
 buy a hard drive 30 gig laity 2500 I buy it 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:13.569
 so we see that I included 30 giga discusses hardened refreshed 3700 

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:18.119
 if I want to refresh off the past to zero comma an enigma for that 

00:07:18.119 --> 00:07:21.649
 to the super nice and it asks to see that there is a small bloodbath 

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:23.909
 cold and that I would have to correct 

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:26.909
 but hey you see that in any case what buying stuff 

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:29.909
 dynamically changes all the data in the game 

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:35.619
 all I want to say 

00:07:35.619 --> 00:07:38.499
 there we did everything to buy some arrangements 

00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:41.319
 we bought gold we bought material with the money we had 

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:44.129
 collected in the slaves installed there was what we put in 

00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:46.539
 day 

00:07:46.539 --> 00:07:48.639
 I hope that 

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:51.639
 you liked it and it will put you in suspense for the rest of the game 

00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:53.819
 so i'm telling you ap soon
