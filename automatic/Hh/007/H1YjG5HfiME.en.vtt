00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.570
 those and everyone who was running him in the 67th episode today a 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.719
 little quick tutorial on the use of caunes families 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.859
 so the net fanico these are little icons for the favorites that was at 

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:17.339
 the origin of plays for favorites 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:21.909
 ps you hear me are used percent and more flexible for favorites 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.909
 especially for them the bar of now 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.999
 so we'll find them for example if we go on google points like here just 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:30.269
 next to the title 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.160
 of our uncle 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.390
 there we will find the little icon which is actually that the family knows 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.310
 also 6 rebounds adds 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.080
 this page in your favorites we will be able to see it in the crisis their 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.180
 bookmark the site name but next to the corresponding icon 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.070
 so it allows to see a real identity to stand out from 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.250
 to the jumps of this website 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.449
 we will be able to have a site and that does not correspond 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.030
 an icon that perfectly matches the image of the suite that allows 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.410
 also users to find their bearings 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.199
 to find the net success offers more easily 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.490
 they want to access 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.659
 then you'll see it's super easy to put this up in these illuminated 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.840
 in the source code 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.190
 e but am I also showing you in this video enough of 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.420
 the integration 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.880
 all that is wrong the high voltage weyersheim phone 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.520
 that is to say that when she is on an iphone at Valais on the safari 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.960
 and access a website 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.880
 we did a little more 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.120
 To add 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.480
 e here 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.830
 our website 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.200
 swan in the 6000 so in the favorites 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.390
 or add to the home screen 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.550
 add to the home screen what will it do dry it will create 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.609
 an icon 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:46.550
 next to our applications 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.260
 and when you go there to finish clicking on this icon it has changed safari to the 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.670
 good page 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.660
 no I'm going to show you how first created here 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.840
 the fallico note 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.620
 for the milk navigator surf on the ground 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.340
 and then how to create% and this famous icon what to find next to 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.340
 apps on everything that could possibly shock and iphone 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:09.290
 so let's go 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.899
 I already have my image 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:14.399
 he regained his smile 

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:18.149
 I already have my image that I created in png and transparent 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:20.830
 the famous closed 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.999
 by working more 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:26.449
 you will see one of to bring this image to the site 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:32.269
 so here is my picture is a transparent psg of 6% because and what 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.949
 width and height dimensions 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:36.709
 because that's what I use 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.780
 % if we find it especially this dynamic point lacroix as midwife 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.629
 icon 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.389
 and in fact he's going to take here a parameter a word no mages 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:50.260
 was rejected in more insistent on several formats are supported j 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.029
 jpg png and bmp 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:57.189
 did it have to be done once again put higher since the site goes 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.039
 work provide me 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:00.619
 e an icon 

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:02.989
 with the same transparency 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.069
 kiehl as the provider file 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.069
 we this is what I did here I go and I would choose here 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:12.779
 China 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.689
 then I'll be able tonight 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.790
 in e the merger so seize having seen nor known that is only 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:24.059
 e a known flaw small icons like that also rolls a good 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:25.369
 icon that can serve 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:27.429
 randell stop icon 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:29.629
 an icon for them 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.439
 in europe the bank files with a little more details 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.579
 so in my case it's not really essential so I'll leave it as 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:36.149
 it 

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:39.149
 as is and click on place icon 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.029
 so here we follow your move 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:47.099
 of what it will give but I'm sure in the falcone aude 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.099
 he records wherever I want 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.909
 so deûle done I know of course my opponent then we indicate 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.109
 keller fixing rejected in its source code so there 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.469
 I could do directly to a copy and paste 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:02.769
 of what is given to me here 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.859
 in my coach source of the page so that in the ed suitcases 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.599
 between the suitcase or return the woman but the police close all those who help 

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:13.319
 what am I going to do now is to add 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.309
 ew 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:16.349
 this icon 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.349
 surely site 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:23.949
 that's what I'm going to do right now it's an icon that has been provided to me 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.139
 and I liked it at the root of my site 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:44.599
 and dolphin nancy i will go back to my browser 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:48.550
 and this time loaded 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.550
 the site you are introduced to the video daïra 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:57.419
 I would have appreciated 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.419
 and we can see that the family is well integrated 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.529
 so that's good it's the first part of the top 20 tutorial 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:08.019
 for now I'm going to show you how to add this famous line that 

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:11.020
 allows to have an integration on iphone 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.430
 then on iphone we use another language 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.879
 a hotline that is special for the eyes 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:20.889
 for the hot percentages of cork potash 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.550
 and so that this one 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.759
 she looks like that 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.830
 so it's still a tagline he points out and this time 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.169
 who what is a little pull ph pulled from the icon 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.789
 and the device we give the link 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:37.969
 dr the image that he is 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:39.270
 of this icon 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.839
 so that the cruise 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:44.770
 earlier this summer the famous icons we had been provided 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.310
 and well the c1 psg is so psg with transparency that I used the 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.909
 does it have itself 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:54.279
 than the one I was a little disappointed at the site 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:57.279
 this one m 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:01.039
 dauger fame 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.490
 montreal icon with that the right moment and simply make a copy and paste 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:10.159
 this icon on my site 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:13.099
 so here too I will put in the root 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:16.960
 and I'll add this nice line of code dom cobb source 

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:27.819
 I have to be careful the site has been updated and now if I go on the 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:28.990
 site 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.990
 from my iphone 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:36.229
 I will reload the page 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.919
 and when I clicked on the most 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:41.919
 I will click add to the home screen 

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:47.589
 and there I have good for nikos m kim is presented in place a little bit 

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:49.539
 dark 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:52.860
 but when i clicked on the watch button added m 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.919
 I will find madani rico is not safe 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.619
 the world the home screen 

00:06:58.619 --> 00:07:02.099
 so that's the icon that I provided, otherwise it would have been huge 

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:04.309
 small overview of the page 

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:07.309
 e as it was presented yesterday in full 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:11.320
 So the bus is super simple to add 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.090
 kafa icons on his site so better to do each time for everyone 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:16.029
 of these projects 

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:19.599
 e wise gold right now the navigation 

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:22.439
 much nicer% and for visitors 

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:26.179
 it allows the lidho weave faster the site was also of 

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:26.879
 give 

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:30.499
 percent percent a little more professional interface 

00:07:30.499 --> 00:07:33.979
 valves at the site so it's worth it every time 

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:36.990
 our thoughts and then I'll see you soon for a next video
