00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 what's up with friends stephanie von fifa 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.790
 and gaming and welcome to 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.350
 another fifa 14 video today 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.389
 we devote ourselves to the whole new one 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.160
 formations this in the fifa 4 10 ultimate 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.170
 team mode exists and there are really 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.420
 a whole lot of new things here 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.430
 We look forward to seeing you here now 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.439
 the normal 4 3 3 formation this also in 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.900
 fifa 13 gave but now we jump 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.400
 further to the second possibility seen 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.930
 we only have two more central 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.760
 midfielder one of the three 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.890
 return to the central defensive midfield 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.840
 so that we also have new links 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.850
 and indeed go from the two central 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.710
 midfielders now 1 each 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.210
 to the striker now we continue to 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.460
 third possibility we see two 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.660
 central defensive midfielder from 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.070
 the left he has never changed 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.469
 but we have only one now 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.510
 more defensive variant of the 4 3 3 formation 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.579
 and on it goes with the fourth 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.140
 possibility we see here now directly 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.059
 sometimes a central offensive 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.129
 midfielder two central and 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.390
 Of course, what immediately stands out as having 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.300
 left of the left and right 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.440
 Defenders to the left and right 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.910
 wing players that's what you have again 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.460
 new ways to do it all 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.049
 combine and insert players and 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.330
 Now we come to the last variant 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.610
 the 4 3 3 formation and that reminds 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.890
 but strong to the game of Barcelona 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.119
 via me a hanging tip and how we 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.189
 just seen the left 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.810
 again from the defenders to the 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.909
 wing players yes that actually looks 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.950
 quite interesting from ea has one here 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.750
 many possibilities reveal that one 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.060
 really can clock what can clock 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.580
 I would like to have defensive and offensive 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.530
 that's just my taste 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.180
 and now we have the 4411 formations 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.220
 see there are no changes 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.090
 just like the 4 4 ​​2 formation but 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.220
 Here we see a small one 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.170
 Change is the second 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.250
 Variant of the 4 4 ​​2 formation we see 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.740
 here two central defensive 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.090
 midfielder and thus you can do that 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.189
 vary again here we see the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.970
 4 5 1 formation they have one too 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.920
 small change 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.090
 and we see the left of the left 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.159
 and right midfielder for 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.530
 central midfielder Hokage 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.189
 with the second possibility of 4 5 1 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.899
 formation 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.369
 before we had two central 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.350
 attacking midfielder and now 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.850
 three central midfielders right now 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.740
 we come 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.330
 to the movie parquet the interesting 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.040
 me personally not so i think you 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.600
 not even if they look there 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.340
 I just wanted to press on stop then 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.780
 can you look at the 3 4 1 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.729
 2 information, I do not think so 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.069
 Changes as far as it could of course 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.290
 be that at fifa 13 o'clock a link from 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.420
 central defender went to the goalkeeper 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.100
 used to the 3 4 2 information 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.450
 a left midfield player a right 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.520
 with your player and of course there 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.100
 the wing players at the 3 4 3 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.209
 formation looks the same 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.670
 I mean there are none 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.680
 changes now we come to the 352 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.330
 This has indeed been very popular 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.040
 and here jumps in the eye of the 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.780
 link from left midfielder to 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.510
 Striker and of course on the 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.160
 right side looks just like 04122 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.720
 formations small changes here 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.519
 left and right midfielder 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.709
 have a link to the two 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.090
 defenders and for some 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.680
 that of course a bit annoying 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.850
 But for some people will be 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.830
 In any case, new opportunities 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.390
 and we see her second 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.580
 Of course, the variant jump here directly 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.380
 In the eye we do not have any outside 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.940
 midfielder have more but only 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.769
 still central midfielder 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.380
 Now we see something completely new here 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.640
 guardiola style 4-1-4-1 that was there 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.680
 not yet we see here 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.540
 two central midfielders and 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.190
 one behind and the left you can 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.140
 you look at yourself that looks up 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.660
 every case interesting and now comes 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.640
 give us the 42 2 2 formation andy 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.079
 also has a small change we see 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.790
 here again the left of the 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.470
 full-backs to the central 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.790
 offensive midfielders and from 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.680
 the central defensive 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.450
 midfielders to the strikers and 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.600
 but now comes the real highlight 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.530
 the 4 2 3 1 formation that many too 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.880
 of you celebrate 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.410
 Here we also see two three 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.299
 small changes that sees itself 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.190
 and now we jump to the time 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.660
 second possibility and we see 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.130
 have here once the left 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.480
 midfielder and once the right 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.400
 midfielder so we too 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.440
 with cristiano ronaldo in this 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.450
 can play formation so there you have 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.040
 finally listened to the whole gambler 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.810
 so many have locked over it and 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.570
 I think that's just outstanding 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.709
 now we come to the 4 3 1 formation and 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.230
 Of course, we also see it here directly 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.819
 again more left at the bar the central 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.670
 Midfielders have a few to each 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.680
 finally stormed then the 4 3 2 1 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.069
 formation and here as far as I am concerned 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.959
 that can not see 1 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.120
 goat change and i find that easy 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.469
 outstanding what you did here we did 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.749
 offer us so many new possibilities 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:14.849
 with all the information and mine 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:16.530
 favorite formations fifa 14 comes with 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.870
 security will be the 4 2 3 1 formation 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.250
 in the second variant because there is the 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.410
 possibility with the left and right 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.849
 playing midfield would have me on 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.009
 any case still interested in which 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:27.990
 Form yourselves most in fifa 14 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:30.180
 friends and I would be very happy about one 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.009
 live and a total of 1000 likes who 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.840
 just outstanding that was so far 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:37.009
 I'll be fine until next time 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.009
 skin in and ciao
