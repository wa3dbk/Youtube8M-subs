00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.359 
shows because they're gonna have to
distract<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.590> much<00:01:40.770> they're<00:01:41.040> going<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.220> have

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
distract so much they're going to have

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.190 
distract so much they're going to have

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
to really just like lay out a whole ton

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.429 
to really just like lay out a whole ton
of<00:01:43.320> games<00:01:44.630> Microsoft<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:45.899> expect<00:01:46.259> them<00:01:46.380> to

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
of games Microsoft is so expect them to

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.410 
of games Microsoft is so expect them to
sort<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.649> push<00:01:46.860> kick<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.399> know<00:01:47.490> connect<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:48.149> bit

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
sort of push kick you know connect a bit

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.609 
sort of push kick you know connect a bit
more<00:01:48.630> than<00:01:48.810> they<00:01:48.930> ought<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:50.689> think<00:01:51.689> it's

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
more than they ought to but I think it's

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.139 
more than they ought to but I think it's
not<00:01:52.799> going<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.040> be<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> great<00:01:53.310> showing<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:53.790> it's

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
not going to be a great showing but it's

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.010 
not going to be a great showing but it's
going<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.299> be<00:01:54.420> okay<00:01:54.600> it's<00:01:54.689> gonna<00:01:54.780> be<00:01:54.899> better

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
going to be okay it's gonna be better

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.469 
going to be okay it's gonna be better
than<00:01:55.110> last<00:01:55.320> year<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.619> think<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:56.070> then<00:01:57.030> let's

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
than last year I think and then let's

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.120 
than last year I think and then let's
see<00:01:58.189> there's<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.549> fact<00:01:59.790> that<00:02:00.030> i<00:02:00.950> really<00:02:01.950> think

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
see there's the fact that i really think

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.920 
see there's the fact that i really think
that<00:02:02.340> what<00:02:02.820> nintendo<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.509> going<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.719> show<00:02:03.869> it

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
that what nintendo is going to show it

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.980 
that what nintendo is going to show it
in<00:02:04.049> turn<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> direct<00:02:04.939> it<00:02:05.939> might<00:02:06.360> be<00:02:06.600> something

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
in turn a direct it might be something

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.699 
in turn a direct it might be something
that<00:02:07.799> may<00:02:08.250> be<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:08.789> distracting<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.989> they

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
that may be so distracting that they

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.650 
that may be so distracting that they
want<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.099> get<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.489> out<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.819> way<00:02:11.849> so<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:12.569> not

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
want to get it out the way so it's not

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.650 
want to get it out the way so it's not
like

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
like

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.300 
like
so<00:02:13.810> it's<00:02:13.990> not<00:02:14.110> distracting<00:02:14.350> everyone<00:02:15.040> during

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
so it's not distracting everyone during

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.080 
so it's not distracting everyone during
the<00:02:15.490> actual<00:02:15.850> III<00:02:16.300> presentation<00:02:17.020> uh<00:02:18.090> one

the actual III presentation uh one

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.360 
the actual III presentation uh one
possible<00:02:19.750> way<00:02:20.050> to<00:02:20.410> take<00:02:20.650> this<00:02:20.830> they<00:02:21.040> might<00:02:21.220> be

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
possible way to take this they might be

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.550 
possible way to take this they might be
doing<00:02:21.850> another<00:02:22.480> presentation<00:02:22.960> just<00:02:23.140> for<00:02:23.410> the

that the wii u controller was the
standalone<00:03:13.960> was<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.680> new<00:03:14.830> system<00:03:15.130> so<00:03:16.030> it's

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
standalone was the new system so it's

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.330 
standalone was the new system so it's
like<00:03:16.420> there's<00:03:16.840> still<00:03:17.650> an<00:03:17.890> element<00:03:18.040> of

like there's still an element of
confusion<00:03:19.030> about<00:03:19.209> this<00:03:19.360> it's<00:03:19.600> not<00:03:19.720> going<00:03:19.870> to

confusion about this it's not going to

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.370 
confusion about this it's not going to
be<00:03:20.020> as<00:03:20.110> bad<00:03:20.140> as<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.500> 3ds<00:03:20.830> because<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:22.450> d/s<00:03:22.810> had

there's just been the wii and then

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.650 
there's just been the wii and then
there's<00:03:30.610> going<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.790> be<00:03:30.820> the<00:03:30.970> wii<00:03:31.090> u<00:03:31.300> so<00:03:31.480> I'm<00:03:31.570> not

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
there's going to be the wii u so I'm not

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.790 
there's going to be the wii u so I'm not
really<00:03:31.750> concerned<00:03:31.990> about<00:03:32.200> from<00:03:32.500> that<00:03:32.650> angle

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
really concerned about from that angle

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.640 
really concerned about from that angle
but<00:03:33.070> I<00:03:33.130> think<00:03:33.810> Nintendo<00:03:34.810> wants<00:03:35.170> to<00:03:35.290> hammer

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
but I think Nintendo wants to hammer

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.380 
but I think Nintendo wants to hammer
down<00:03:35.740> once<00:03:36.040> for<00:03:36.250> all<00:03:36.280> this<00:03:36.459> is<00:03:36.670> their<00:03:37.000> new<00:03:37.209> home

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
down once for all this is their new home

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.410 
down once for all this is their new home
system<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:38.610> they<00:03:39.610> want<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.590> have<00:03:41.590> their<00:03:42.420> just

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420
