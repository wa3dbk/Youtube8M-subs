00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:59.660
 let's start with bastienne abdelhak research 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:03.500
 which will illustrate us and the essential novelties 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:07.670
 of models 2016 exact good morning a 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.050
 everyone then I go to present you the 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:14.090
 novelties of the 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:16.250
 2016 then on the 4-stroke range we have 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.030
 a new 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:23.240
 electrical wiring that integrates the 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:27.300
 system that she who is a system that does not 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:32.380
 you have discounted a counter more 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:35.410
 the contact you only have the button to 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.630
 turn on and to timing units 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.820
 when you turn off the bike it has been eliminated 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:45.420
 the double panel of the model 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:53.130
 then 15 side exam 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:57.659
 after we improved on the 250 300 the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:02.960
 throttle body that reduces the speeds 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:08.580
 of the minimum laps and also allows a 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:12.060
 return to the fastest minimum on 4 50 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:17.599
 have improved the connecting rod than one 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.599
 lighter and more robust diet too 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:26.849
 on the two-stroke models we have improved 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:33.090
 the piston that a piston no longer 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:36.590
 forged however bull and also the head that 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:40.650
 a head with a combustion chamber 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:45.060
 different a new design the winter a 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:48.400
 new interior design that allows less 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.650
 more training 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:58.000
 power more 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:03:00.040
 durability even for forgotten for i 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.680
 four customers we also have with 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.950
 experiences of the lawyer in the sand 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:10.799
 we have improved the gearbox system 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:16.000
 of the marches and also in an increase of the 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:21.970
 of the exchange activity area e 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.060
 without commenting on the self even at the level 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:29.019
 of the water pump we have 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:33.760
 improved the surface of the pin of the 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:36.849
 buoys that allows reduced friction with 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.090
 the seal is also the condition is 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:42.069
 state is a new model coming out of the 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.069
 famous 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:49.459
 to support more pressure here more 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:52.040
 durability etc. these on the whole 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.400
 range 4 times and on the two times only 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.959
 inside of the water pump 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.329
 I saw then that there was an improvement 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.840
 also in the filter case 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:06.190
 exact the filter case 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.410
 we have freed space for power 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.069
 access the filter more easily 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:18.040
 we put the wiring that was 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:20.560
 inside the house they rent a better one 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:25.590
 access to rent and also the frame 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.590
 since he has a new design for aiello 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:33.900
 sign that allows us to be more 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:40.590
 stiff more resistant even a new one 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:42.570
 processing of the fine material to the fullest 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.120
 I saw that you also did a new one 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:49.050
 design in the exact fender is a 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:58.010
 fender more rigid than when used 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:05:03.960
 in the mud perhaps the pilot is better 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:05.760
 from solicitations and given in general 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.820
 on the whole range of products we have 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:15.680
 worked a lot who gives life to the hard life 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.680
 for us very important 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:29.880
 the quality is ok so then now 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.630
 we will see the bikes in action that we will do 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:36.020
 try the testers and good luck 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.020
 thank you all 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:43.830
 then michele if you just came down from the 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:47.630
 sherco 2016 your hot impressions 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:50.730
 a brief impression of the whole range 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.780
 generically of all the fines 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.000
 on all the bikes I liked it 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.380
 a lot the one that surprised me 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.650
 so it was all four and a half 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.870
 four times because an inertia that 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.670
 really damped the bike very well 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.560
 it seems very light even in passages 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:07.890
 quite tight in the trees 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.530
 long followed very well both at 2 e 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.120
 half two times that the 300 have one 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.160
 mapping the venue the possibility of 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.150
 change mapping the difference between 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.560
 there are many mappings there is you 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.660
 feels very much 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.430
 both are two beautiful two 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.200
 times and the differences and the 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.320
 features on the main both of the 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.840
 2 half that of the 300 300 m really liked 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.210
 on top he can pull a little bit of 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:36.090
 more than four times the 300 no co2 times 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:38.010
 2 talking about the times and I liked it 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.190
 pulls so much more than pulls 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:43.890
 300 others tested and also the 2nd half 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:48.360
 nice nice shot at low and in others it comes out 

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:50.580
 lengthen the 304 times a lot but 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.110
 very beautiful she is very light too 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.810
 has the option to choose double 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:58.040
 mapping and even there the difference is 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:00.600
 quite a lot is heard of 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.880
 mainly the 300 is a bike that I am 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:06.330
 liked it so much in a break 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.460
 little with a little bit of steps a 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.890
 a little bit more difficult because it succeeds 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.200
 really give you a lot of safety download 

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.760
 well to power on the ground the 2nd half 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.310
 four times it was very fundamentally 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.500
 lighter the smaller it succeeds 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.729
 stretch a lot but could under 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.210
 miss something 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:26.789
 soon you fear sentence 15 you will do a lot 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:29.580
 report will tell us how you heard 

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:31.969
 really the bikes and read it meaning 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:35.819
 wind that will be published in the Senate 

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:37.909
 certainly because it happens thanks a lot 

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:37.909
 Hello
