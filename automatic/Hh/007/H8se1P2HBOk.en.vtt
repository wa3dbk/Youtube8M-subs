00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.010
 all right 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.880
 ah 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.540
 welcome to my cooking channel today in 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.150
 the kitchen was going to prepare a 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.970
 delicious biscuit ideal for breakfast 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.250
 or for a snack it's a sponge cake 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.710
 very easy to prepare and that is very 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.930
 known typical of the area of valÃ¨ncia 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.780
 in Spain where coca is called 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.489
 yanda or coca boba there are some 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.579
 variations and today I 'm going to show you 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:58.160
 how I prepare it at home now 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.160
 let's see what the ingredients are 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.330
 to prepare this coca de yanda we are going to 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.880
 need 500 grams of flour to which 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.250
 I would also add the contents of a 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.100
 sachet of baking powder also 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.320
 they can use leavening flour also 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.400
 we will use measuring with a glass 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.950
 that has a capacity of 250 milliliters 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:26.869
 two sugar glasses one glass of oil 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:31.520
 vegetable a glass and a half of milk three 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.950
 whole eggs a natural yoghurt essence 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.740
 of vanilla and the zest of a lemon 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.410
 then to decorate it over we're going to 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.020
 need a few more teaspoons of 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.970
 sugar the first thing we are going to do is 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.060
 of course put to preheat the 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.700
 180 degree oven and also to have 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.310
 ready our mold we are going to use a 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.399
 mold preferably rectangular east 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.070
 is 30 x 20 and about 5 centimeters 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.100
 I have painted it with a little bit 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.189
 of oil and then I have placed a paper 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.439
 of these mantecados or enclosed that 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.240
 they make unmolding very easy after 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.550
 our cake 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.440
 to begin with the preparation of 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.690
 our cake we are going to place in the 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.360
 blender bowl the eggs together with 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.730
 the sugar and we will beat them to maximum 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.070
 power until the mixture is one 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.490
 color and has increased its 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.490
 volume 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.970
 such 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.320
 the eggs and the sugar are ready and 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.320
 now with the machine on but not at 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.670
 maximum power but at medium power 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.410
 we are going to add little by little 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.540
 rest of the ingredients in the 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.180
 next order first to squirts 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.000
 we are going to add the oil then the 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.640
 milk then the yogurt the essence of 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.110
 vanilla and lemon zest now 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.500
 yes we are going to learn again the 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.500
 machine 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.650
 the part of the liquid ingredients already 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.299
 is ready you could see it is very 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.760
 easy to simply add the 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.010
 ingredients and now if one of the things 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.959
 What I like most about this recipe is that 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.359
 you do not have to separate egg yolks or 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.250
 beat the snow or have a lot 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.980
 Care when adding flour 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.140
 but simply sifted as they 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.340
 I said before we are going to add in the 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.040
 flour 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.950
 without fear this is a very robust mass 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.109
 it's not at all delicate and we're going to 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.159
 simply incorporate it with 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.159
 liquid ingredients 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.700
 now to finish stirring well 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.800
 I have all changed some rods 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.630
 because I find it much more comfortable 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.930
 you can see it is a preparation 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.790
 well homogeneous now we are going to place 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.630
 our preparation in the mold that already 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.630
 we had ready 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.759
 finally let's give it some 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.669
 taps to the mold so that all the 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:26.229
 preparation is as good and now if 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.449
 it was time to decorate it with 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:31.090
 our sugar above this is something 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:33.100
 very typical of this cake and what goes 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.400
 to do is that above is going to form 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:39.280
 as a crispy crust and golden and 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.120
 of course sweet let's sprinkle 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.120
 you in this way 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:47.219
 and finally before closing our 

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:49.289
 baked cake a little detail to me 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:51.629
 like to sprinkle the surface 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.759
 also with a touch of cinnamon if 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:55.769
 you do not like it is not mandatory 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:59.519
 but I'm going to give you a 

00:04:55.769 --> 00:05:02.400
 little cinnamon sorbet is a flavor 

00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:05.460
 that is very good for this cake 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.759
 and good now if we 're going to take it 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.460
 Baked approximately between 40 to 50 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:13.350
 very important minutes and half of 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.600
 cooking approximately 20 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.090
 minutes we see that above is 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.220
 lasting too fast we're going to 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.500
 cover with a piece of metallized paper 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.479
 but do not put it from the beginning 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.940
 because it will vary greatly over time 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:29.270
 of cooking only half of the 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.270
 cooking 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.730
 at 40 minutes I pinched him with a 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.320
 middle stick and it went dry what 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.660
 which means that our biscuits 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.880
 high list here I show you how 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.280
 you are fresh out of the oven 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.220
 you can see that it goes up pretty well 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.230
 parejito is really great now if you 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.870
 let's get out of the mold we're going to 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:59.570
 place on a rack and leave it 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.580
 cool you can not imagine the aroma 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.420
 of sugar with cinnamon is really 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.420
 spectacular 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.480
 now the time has finally come 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.120
 to cut a piece of our sponge cake 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.580
 here I have it already placed on a 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.160
 source to serve it and I want to show you 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.610
 how it looks inside is a sponge cake 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.340
 Fluffy texture but firm at the same time 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.650
 really delicious and the crust 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.110
 sugary from above gives a little touch 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.009
 very very special 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:36.379
 see how it has been 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:41.350
 you're going to serve it here it's fluffy goes up 

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:44.490
 perfectly and it is delicious 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:50.460
 I hope you liked this recipe
