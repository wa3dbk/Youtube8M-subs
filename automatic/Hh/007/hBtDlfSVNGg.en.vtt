00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:09.269
 now only protagonist with biagio 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:11.730
 in short 19 minutes a valentino 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.480
 rossi that meant something sankyo 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:19.170
 quite right 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:21.449
 meanwhile what I say Roman house knows 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.910
 who is simple if tourism even if you 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.599
 that I had slammed so that they know 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.429
 working a lot we saw piaggio there by 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.679
 alongside are schools that were not nearly 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.899
 investment stay at home I worked and 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.760
 less and see who believes shows carlo 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.780
 great sangalli a great Roman francs 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.379
 by samsung 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.750
 that gave us a great deal 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.059
 but gave race stored at 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.500
 times a great satisfaction for everything 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.280
 our team is very good has already been 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.620
 very good at a style 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.170
 in qatar one had not had that 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.329
 suspension problem and could 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.400
 staying there could fight for it 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.799
 win also before the race so now 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.690
 what he is not from Rome 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.460
 stay focused on the whole idea of 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.580
 try to be strong always 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.680
 said he receives pointless bets 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.259
 especially a Roman fenati than if 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.940
 we know what the rossano is not so much 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:27.679
 who believed that great details 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:31.729
 concentrated memories you still need 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:34.130
 being yes in front of you is great 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.140
 satisfaction for the whole team 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.500
 braschi and all the guys that i work 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.020
 because let's explain at the end rossano 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.619
 brazzi has also been for many years 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.009
 your mentor 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.470
 yes yes yes it was the you gave me a place 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.080
 they hate kabul one of the hair gowns was 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.840
 overtaking and taught me a lot 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.780
 which sincerely when we had to 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.149
 decide and what to put with Roman and you are 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.640
 immediately came the michele rosato because 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:12.209
 they are mostly with cavani 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:15.480
 the boars, however, is growing 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.580
 that alchemy right and that politi data 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.230
 from that trust that last means 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.880
 according to the last three tenths that 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.120
 in the end they serve 13 billion 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.920
 let's go back a bit on your race 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.190
 detail that has seen protagonist from 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.530
 immediately a mistake and an hour of another 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.870
 you are the person of the other driver 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.120
 very sorry because here too how 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.280
 a style I could get on the podium 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.040
 and a lot of potential retirement speed 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.060
 right and then he sees us playing we remember 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.060
 but they must only god 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.270
 about 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.070
 I do n't know who to take the sheet of 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.020
 shame because sincerely the first 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.040
 they really are in a position 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.620
 perfect 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.650
 they were fine I was already second is 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.150
 certainly the step to probably for per 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.120
 beat Lorenzo to keep behind 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.510
 pedrosa is however after the race has been in 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.609
 climb 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.769
 I must say that I enjoyed it because 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:16.459
 made the cycle that run and race entries 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:19.250
 done 3 and 4 of the first round and then it goes 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.659
 good is a good thing for Sunday 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.940
 next to jerez because this year 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.820
 we can really adopt 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.620
 they are very strong but we are more competitive 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.210
 you are fit for a mistake that has you 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.340
 made to lose a lot of 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.080
 take it in the sense that the pilot who 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.940
 could have a different step let's say 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.630
 maybe he should have taken off a little 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.630
 before 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.400
 yes I think he made a mistake wanted 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.600
 pass never arrived arrived long 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.580
 of course they are things that happen 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.880
 only in that round I think I lost 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.810
 two seconds but then they are more because 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.700
 then I had to pass the glasses 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.890
 central and made me lose my life 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.100
 we have only one last question from 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.870
 study you don't accept what you would like 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.890
 of the honda if we point out that 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.680
 he says those who ask theater to friends 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.780
 given what you would like to take from 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.760
 honda various faculties of choice can 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:16.459
 believe whatever they do 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.010
 they manage to detach that is more than him 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.930
 because they manage to break me in the wheel 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.810
 in front then they can detach 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.610
 easily after and then with 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.740
 this guided by a great advantage 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.630
 then they still have two pilots 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.810
 especially marches but also pedrosa that 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:36.020
 they are driving very strong thanks 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.300
 then it is worth greeting that all and 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:43.760
 the line arrives from the bellofatto part 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:45.200
 that of a great Roman thing 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.150
 like this communicated this 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.150
