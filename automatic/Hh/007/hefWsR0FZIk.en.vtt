00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.840 
the gadget is targeting goggles i don't
really<00:01:07.680> use<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.189> much<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:08.610> gameplay

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
but it's really important to use if

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.890 
but it's really important to use if
you're<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.250> long<00:01:11.430> range<00:01:11.700> map<00:01:11.970> because<00:01:12.780> they

might be a ways up to you on fun fact

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.539 
might be a ways up to you on fun fact
number<00:01:42.840> one<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.350> fleet-footed<00:01:43.649> because<00:01:44.280> being

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
number one is fleet-footed because being

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.130 
number one is fleet-footed because being
burly<00:01:45.030> even<00:01:45.420> though<00:01:45.479> i<00:01:45.509> have<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.720> lot<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.869> health

burly even though i have a lot of health

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.990 
burly even though i have a lot of health
i<00:01:46.290> don't<00:01:46.439> have<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.649> much<00:01:46.829> speed<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.640> i<00:01:47.670> want

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
i don't have that much speed so i want

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.310 
i don't have that much speed so i want

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
and then fun fact 2is kind of

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.819 
and then fun fact 2is kind of
bulletproof<00:01:51.540> or<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:52.140> as<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.500> start<00:01:52.740> getting

the beginning and world action is going
on<00:02:47.969> MOS<00:02:48.969> sensor<00:02:49.209> just<00:02:49.840> put<00:02:50.079> one<00:02:50.230> down<00:02:50.379> there

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
on MOS sensor just put one down there

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.949 
on MOS sensor just put one down there
and<00:02:50.949> will<00:02:51.219> like<00:02:51.549> you<00:02:51.760> see<00:02:52.000> I'm<00:02:52.269> getting<00:02:52.659> so

practically<00:03:01.780> useless<00:03:02.400> like<00:03:03.400> you<00:03:04.000> never<00:03:04.209> want

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:04.419 
practically useless like you never want

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:05.580 
practically useless like you never want
to<00:03:04.480> be<00:03:04.540> alone<00:03:04.659> when<00:03:05.169> you're<00:03:05.319> using<00:03:05.439> the

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
to be alone when you're using the

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.920 
to be alone when you're using the
better-class<00:03:06.129> like<00:03:07.090> I<00:03:07.329> keep<00:03:07.780> getting

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
better-class like I keep getting

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.379

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389 
separated every now and then and sure I

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.149 
separated every now and then and sure I
don't<00:03:10.719> want<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:10.900> die<00:03:11.079> so<00:03:11.500> maybe<00:03:11.680> I<00:03:11.859> run<00:03:12.040> away

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159
