00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
I'm really excited about this year's

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.379 
I'm really excited about this year's
team<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:12.240> think<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:13.320> with<00:00:14.280> our<00:00:14.519> experience

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
team I think that with our experience

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.750 
team I think that with our experience
from<00:00:15.690> our<00:00:15.839> leadership<00:00:16.080> position<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:17.039> lot<00:00:17.609> of

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
from our leadership position a lot of

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.070 
from our leadership position a lot of
people<00:00:18.000> be<00:00:18.119> talking<00:00:18.390> about<00:00:18.510> our<00:00:18.660> youth<00:00:18.869> I

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
people be talking about our youth I

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.420 
people be talking about our youth I
think<00:00:19.109> that'll<00:00:19.560> be<00:00:19.590> nothing<00:00:19.949> more<00:00:20.130> than<00:00:20.189> an

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
think that'll be nothing more than an

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.120 
think that'll be nothing more than an
excuse<00:00:20.930> thing<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.050> I'm<00:00:22.170> excited<00:00:22.470> about<00:00:22.650> is

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
excuse thing that I'm excited about is

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.920

in<00:00:34.380> big<00:00:34.559> games<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.969> think<00:00:36.030> they<00:00:36.360> want<00:00:36.600> that

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.810 
in big games and I think they want that
I<00:00:37.079> think<00:00:37.440> they<00:00:37.559> want<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.980> discipline

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
I think they want that discipline

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.700 
I think they want that discipline
I<00:00:38.850> think<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> good<00:00:39.660> teams<00:00:39.960> will<00:00:40.230> have<00:00:40.410> that

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
I think the good teams will have that

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.010 
I think the good teams will have that
and<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.610> know<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.000> big<00:00:42.390> thing<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.780> that

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
and you know the big thing is that

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.479 
and you know the big thing is that
having<00:00:43.440> be<00:00:43.530> successful<00:00:44.070> once<00:00:44.219> they<00:00:44.340> leave

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
having be successful once they leave

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.139 
having be successful once they leave
