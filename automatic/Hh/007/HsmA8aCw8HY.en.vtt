complete wrap around the boot to give

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.280 
complete wrap around the boot to give
you<00:00:46.430> a<00:00:46.460> maximum<00:00:47.360> power<00:00:47.510> transfer<00:00:47.780> so<00:00:48.080> this<00:00:48.200> is

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
you a maximum power transfer so this is

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.750 
you a maximum power transfer so this is
arguably<00:00:48.650> one<00:00:48.740> of<00:00:48.860> the<00:00:48.980> better<00:00:49.130> power

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
arguably one of the better power

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.340 
arguably one of the better power
transfer<00:00:49.970> skates<00:00:50.480> as<00:00:50.690> far<00:00:50.840> as<00:00:50.930> speed<00:00:51.140> boots

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
wheel setup the difference being in the

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.230 
wheel setup the difference being in the
boot<00:01:21.469> you'll<00:01:22.189> notice<00:01:22.460> a<00:01:22.579> little<00:01:22.700> higher<00:01:22.939> cuff

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
boot you'll notice a little higher cuff

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.270 
boot you'll notice a little higher cuff
area<00:01:23.479> this<00:01:24.170> fits<00:01:24.409> a<00:01:24.499> little<00:01:24.679> bit<00:01:24.770> looser<00:01:25.100> not

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
area this fits a little bit looser not

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.620 
area this fits a little bit looser not
as<00:01:25.399> tight<00:01:25.609> doesn't<00:01:25.789> have<00:01:25.999> that<00:01:26.090> same<00:01:26.270> skeleton

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
as tight doesn't have that same skeleton

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.480 
as tight doesn't have that same skeleton
setup<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:27.289> it's<00:01:27.409> a<00:01:27.499> looser<00:01:27.950> feel<00:01:28.130> but<00:01:28.369> more

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
setup so it's a looser feel but more

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.340 
setup so it's a looser feel but more
comfortable<00:01:28.729> and<00:01:29.509> not<00:01:29.659> so<00:01:29.869> much<00:01:30.020> for<00:01:30.229> the

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
comfortable and not so much for the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.380 
comfortable and not so much for the
speed<00:01:30.619> skater<00:01:30.920> but<00:01:31.850> those<00:01:32.030> that<00:01:32.210> are<00:01:32.270> looking

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
speed skater but those that are looking

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.090 
speed skater but those that are looking
to<00:01:32.539> next<00:01:32.840> step<00:01:32.990> up<00:01:33.140> from<00:01:33.319> a<00:01:33.439> performance<00:01:33.740> skate

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
to next step up from a performance skate

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.410 
to next step up from a performance skate
so<00:01:34.340> this<00:01:34.460> is<00:01:34.579> a<00:01:34.609> very<00:01:34.850> high-end<00:01:35.270> performance

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
so this is a very high-end performance

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.599 
so this is a very high-end performance
skate<00:01:35.869> at<00:01:36.049> 349<00:01:36.799> so<00:01:37.039> a<00:01:37.069> little<00:01:37.159> bit<00:01:37.280> more<00:01:37.460> than

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
skate at 349 so a little bit more than

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.969 
skate at 349 so a little bit more than
the<00:01:37.670> art<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:37.999> still<00:01:38.990> a<00:01:39.020> performance<00:01:39.859> driven

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
the art to still a performance driven

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.399 
the art to still a performance driven
skate<00:01:40.369> but<00:01:41.329> a<00:01:41.359> little<00:01:41.600> higher<00:01:41.749> cuff<00:01:41.990> area<00:01:42.170> a

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
skate but a little higher cuff area a

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.770 
skate but a little higher cuff area a
little<00:01:42.649> looser<00:01:43.039> a<00:01:43.069> fit<00:01:43.399> more<00:01:44.060> comfort<00:01:44.509> still

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
little looser a fit more comfort still

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.419 
little looser a fit more comfort still
