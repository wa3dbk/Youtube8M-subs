obviously<00:00:51.840> because<00:00:52.110> it's<00:00:52.260> an<00:00:52.350> arc<00:00:52.590> but<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.100> was

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
player one which I read maybe three

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.300 
player one which I read maybe three
years<00:01:12.570> ago<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.229> didn't<00:01:13.680> really<00:01:13.770> like<00:01:14.280> it

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
years ago and I didn't really like it

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.130 
years ago and I didn't really like it
although<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.390> been<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.750> long<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.080> don't

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
although it's been so long I don't

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.929 
although it's been so long I don't
entirely<00:01:16.560> know<00:01:16.770> why<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.070> didn't<00:01:17.400> like<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.580> I

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
entirely know why I didn't like it I

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.090 
entirely know why I didn't like it I
think<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.540> big<00:01:18.840> part<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.229> for<00:01:19.439> me<00:01:19.530> was<00:01:19.770> all<00:01:19.950> of

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
think a big part of it for me was all of

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.679 
think a big part of it for me was all of
the<00:01:20.159> 80s<00:01:20.520> references<00:01:20.670> which<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.330> didn't<00:01:21.600> really

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
the 80s references which I didn't really

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.990 
the 80s references which I didn't really
get<00:01:21.869> because<00:01:22.140> I'm<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.439> child<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.070> 90s<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.729> I

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
get because I'm a child of the 90s so I

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.810 
get because I'm a child of the 90s so I
felt<00:01:24.840> left<00:01:25.290> out<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.799> loop<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.610> little

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
felt left out of the loop in a little

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.700 
felt left out of the loop in a little
way<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.390> think<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.720> book<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.110> better<00:01:28.409> in

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
way and I think this book is better in

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.010 
way and I think this book is better in
terms<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.250> toning<00:01:29.880> down<00:01:29.909> those<00:01:30.270> references<00:01:30.720> so

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
terms of toning down those references so

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.630 
terms of toning down those references so
hopefully<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.409> like<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:31.770> one<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:32.040> little<00:01:32.340> more

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
hopefully I like this one a little more

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.730 
hopefully I like this one a little more
honestly<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:33.479> no<00:01:33.630> idea<00:01:33.659> there<00:01:34.380> seem<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.619> be

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
honestly I have no idea there seem to be

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.859 
honestly I have no idea there seem to be
a<00:01:34.799> lot<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.009> mixed<00:01:35.310> reviews<00:01:35.549> out<00:01:35.670> there<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.360> time

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
a lot of mixed reviews out there so time

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.390 
a lot of mixed reviews out there so time
will<00:01:37.020> tell<00:01:37.200> but<00:01:37.560> I'm<00:01:37.799> excited<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.250> read<00:01:38.369> this

will tell but I'm excited to read this
just<00:01:38.759> because<00:01:39.030> it's<00:01:39.180> getting<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.600> much

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
just because it's getting so much

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.289 
just because it's getting so much
attention<00:01:39.869> right<00:01:40.200> now<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.790> idea

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
attention right now and I like the idea

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.670 
attention right now and I like the idea
of<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.720> story<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.200> we'll<00:01:43.409> see<00:01:43.530> what<00:01:43.619> happens

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680

cover design it's a pretty slim book so

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.350 
cover design it's a pretty slim book so
I<00:02:35.220> don't<00:02:35.460> think<00:02:35.790> it'll<00:02:35.910> take<00:02:36.090> me<00:02:36.210> a<00:02:36.240> lot<00:02:36.300> of

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
I don't think it'll take me a lot of

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.090 
I don't think it'll take me a lot of
time<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.690> finish<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.230> it's<00:02:37.380> about<00:02:37.620> two<00:02:37.950> women

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
time to finish and it's about two women

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.030 
time to finish and it's about two women
who<00:02:38.490> live<00:02:38.730> in<00:02:39.090> an<00:02:39.510> ambiguous<00:02:40.260> setting<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.830> don't

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
who live in an ambiguous setting I don't

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.560 
who live in an ambiguous setting I don't
really<00:02:41.190> know<00:02:41.400> where<00:02:41.580> if<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.060> book<00:02:42.210> mentions

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
really know where if the book mentions

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.850 
really know where if the book mentions
Fiji<00:02:42.960> but<00:02:43.110> I<00:02:43.140> don't<00:02:43.290> think<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.530> book<00:02:43.650> takes

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
Fiji but I don't think the book takes

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.160 
Fiji but I don't think the book takes
place<00:02:43.980> in<00:02:44.340> Fiji<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.060> there's<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.690> woman<00:02:45.840> named

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
place in Fiji and there's a woman named

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.010
