00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.299
 Today I have something completely again 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:18.579
 special that is a piece of shaw group 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.300
 the baker I have a spinning thomas 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:23.140
 come 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:26.230
 because breeders of weggefahren de was 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.910
 see the bones here and this one 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:33.850
 I'll do that in now 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.020
 Pack the vacuum bag and then 72 times 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.430
 hours at 60 degrees in and lay bad 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.440
 At the Bakom's, there is an important one 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.390
 thing to note I have the bag 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.480
 turned over here once now 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:50.040
 if I put that meat in the now 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:53.079
 bag that the fat is the most important 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.200
 Do not come to these places of the bag 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:59.320
 where then the regulation or the 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.290
 Sealing needs to come because we 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.059
 especially with a piece of the 72nd 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.009
 hours is to ensure that 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:11.890
 we have an absolutely safe vacuum 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:14.049
 and this undefeated piece is that 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.270
 now completely dry and even 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.619
 not finished it was natural to me 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.079
 not very interesting 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.079
 I do this thing this also contributes 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.409
 perceived 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.950
 They decorate these bags with a double seam 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.780
 and that is usually very 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.420
 very good but i just want to 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.700
 make sure that long duration that 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.159
 I will not have a problem and 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.210
 That's why I'm still packing this 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.210
 in a second bag 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.240
 but here clean double has yes 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.340
 if I look at it now 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.100
 the piece that is really now 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.659
 wonderfully packed I have extra 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.940
 Waited a few minutes for that 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.009
 vacuum is actually tight because 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.560
 I do not feel like doing that after three 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.050
 then the whole meal is ruined 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.780
 by the way, these short ribs are in 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.550
 German quinces and that's one 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.260
 typical piece if you would say so 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.100
 yes, I can make a great out of it 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.269
 but when the food is done here i am 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.769
 then believe one or the other 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.989
 understand of you too 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.000
 it is not necessarily a soup meat 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.650
 as you can what is right all 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.160
 make up 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.660
 the water bath 160 degrees and yes I have to 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.630
 do nothing else now than this 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.590
 to give a packet of space 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.910
 and now we have to wait three days 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.519
 there is one to the tips 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.130
 horseradish is puma I suppose 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:57.700
 this piece of horseradish decided that 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:59.810
 only then I raced the little flakes 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.620
 I still have on this piece I will 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.910
 tomorrow grate fresh and cloudy 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.989
 this horseradish about the itself 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.989
 now with two cups of cream 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.420
 Cover it on and off in the fridge 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:23.500
 until tomorrow the several dense over 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.260
 night marinated in his and thereby 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.200
 his aroma is also released now 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:33.010
 Here I have to go with salt 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.900
 season and then the right one 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:40.810
 Getting consistency was half of it 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:48.400
 gram whole then I feel that 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:04:00.490
 everything in the lid on it injection nozzles 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:04:02.100
 on it and the gas capsule after 72 hours 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.640
 it is finally done 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.440
 this is our piece and now I am yes 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.600
 Let's see what happened 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.100
 is 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.110
 ' ve got a bag of two packed 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.959
 I can forge the first one very much 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.459
 easy and fast remove and one 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.380
 second you can already see that now 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.030
 a lot of liquid in it will 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.290
 But then I also drain it that is 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.950
 I do now only talk to 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.480
 the bag 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.270
 you have just seen that right now 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.420
 That was exactly why you got that 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.360
 meat in two layers or better 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.580
 said to wrap in two sheets because it 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.730
 then actually leaking 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.560
 can be and runs out 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:52.030
 I parted right here at the 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:57.180
 bones look like ever 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:05:02.410
 fantastic now I cut the whole thing 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:08.740
 in small dice the knife that slides 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:11.640
 just through i think i have to too 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.640
 Immediately try a piece 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:23.340
 is of course the hammer extremely 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:26.130
 aromatic and meat the place 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.170
 I now in this key purely what 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.820
 You can see very well here 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.130
 a whole lot of fat but this fat 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.020
 that's just when I'm here with the 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:37.080
 lace goes in then it dissolves 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.400
 that's just stationed that is 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.530
 this connective tissue 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.420
 that has now transformed into 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.940
 gelatin and is now with it too 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.170
 reasonable ground s 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.990
 I now have these meat pieces here 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.780
 I have the whole cooking in here 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:56.000
 she really is only 200 now 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.000
 milliliters over it now 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:04.370
 this will be the same thing 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:06.930
 flavored and now it's about 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:11.400
 that is to pour over it again and again 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:13.140
 the meat is really painted that 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:19.250
 The meat is set to work 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:19.250
 the plate this much of it 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:27.030
 then I put the rain for that 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.100
 potato celery puree on the me 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:33.830
 Do not show you how I do it 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:41.540
 that's just a puree and then the 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:41.540
 Celery is finished grandma
