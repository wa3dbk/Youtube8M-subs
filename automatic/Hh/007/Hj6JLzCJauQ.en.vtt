00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:08.669
 Hmm 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.719
 It is the results head 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.920
 goo 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.210
 wh 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.410
 There 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.570
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:29.320
 wh 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:34.809
 This is a jig that is recommended at home in this jigging season 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:37.870
 This is a 80 g It is en-chan underground procedures out many tail in the example Nchan jig 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:44.440
 Sylhet is also a little bigger 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:47.050
 In En-chan jig is I often use the three type I in 4618 to use in the Well rice 0 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.840
 The big feature is 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:54.500
 Slide when falling free 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:01:01.220
 This is from the heart of this love and love 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:07.460
 Yet depending on shifting the weight balance of the thickness of the weight of the back side and the belly side 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:10.860
 Such is also the year I myself in the water if it will continue to strongly slide by changing 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.710
 I often made to the movement, but in there 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.330
 It moves in this way 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.540
 A hotel with such a movement like sliding on the side, changing the angle of Okajima like this 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.540
 is 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.329
 Four 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.329
 Ibegura is moving 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.770
 I move at a fixed price 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.980
 To the original near 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.310
 Switch on the sea bass that has stopped 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.700
 Was on the Well was operated 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.530
 Even more so when it does not recoil 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:50.180
 Even if it is the nature that moves sideways, it does not move sideways last year 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:53.600
 I think that such a movement is easier to put the fish switch 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:57.640
 Do you know that we will slide sideways 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.640
 We slide sideways at the moment we heard the clutch 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:11.660
 10 will not fall at the same speed 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:15.380
 From the point of being called a Nilai rider to being the future Ryler, 2 looks faster 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.610
 To switch this is to increase the activity of the fish 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:24.090
 I feel like going 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:27.720
 What is the time of this January-February when you can really catch jigging? 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.610
 Because fish is often solidified near the back of the head 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.350
 Through which the solidified 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.080
 To the normal horizontal 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:39.590
 If it moves, it is the next of vertical 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:42.200
 By going off there next to 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:47.140
 Make me interested in myself 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.140
 If you eat this from a group of falling children 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:59.140
 I say that the action is not monotonous, and different actions come out every time it drops 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.140
 I think that is the attraction of this jig 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:07.140
 at once fall will receive stuck from the place called fluttering in or now amazing throw 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.640
 Slide to the left and right 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.640
 I am around do not know where you go 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:19.010
 Of course it is Sly and this is underwater 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:23.660
 In fact so far since the low floor takes more than the line 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:27.260
 I don't know if I'm sliding 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:30.120
 The wrong action is repeated up and down many times 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.069
 In this stool jigging 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:38.629
 Such irregular 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:38.629
 I think that the action of sliding to the side is quite effective
