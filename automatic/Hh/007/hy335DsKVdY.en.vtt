00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 ok hi to all and who their studio just 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.060
 a nice little video is a video 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.160
 on the game revault kraft so what 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.820
 that romo kraft is a game a bit to 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.790
 minecraft light but not in the sense 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.080
 management and creation of a house and in 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.539
 a world in open world 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.970
 no here it's just a game of 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.130
 fight where you create gear all 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.099
 stronger than each other 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.570
 thanks to small asses like this then 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.970
 I will explain to you a little how 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.830
 walk we get to the beginning we have our 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.170
 inventory we have the team we 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.059
 can buy in the deposit cube here 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.100
 there so we have the chassis options so 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.620
 that's all that makes up the chassis of the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.690
 vehicle say the overall look 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.969
 we have the motion options so 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.680
 there we buy the wheels the thrusters 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.690
 the propellers the wings finally everything 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.850
 So we want to hardware we 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.860
 all that is armaments and protection 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.899
 see that's the shades thus 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.730
 energy shields do that these are 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.899
 irrigants have therefore adhered to the canon 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.579
 a bit like a sniper sam and 20 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.379
 seconds to recharge is quite long 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.110
 but when you have many do not know 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.260
 to do badly enough these are plasmas 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.560
 launcher so satire plasma launcher 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.750
 and do area damage and that's what 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.790
 I use my little plane 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.570
 whole nothing we'll say these are 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.159
 tons 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.830
 smg so sng what is 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.580
 machine guns wholesale that pulls in 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.630
 automatic so here it is 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.280
 everything that is really we have 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.290
 then special douala which we have 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.290
 the well pilot seats so the base 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.689
 of the vehicle the radars to detect and 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.369
 half the radars russia wants the wholesaler 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.920
 he is our ally detects a year and a half 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.290
 we will also be on our minima the 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.840
 radar jam hours that allow to be 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.640
 more discreet compared to the enemies that 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.310
 it is india this craze of 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.840
 lamps and rectifier alignment that goes 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.130
 dirt with the new update that 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.810
 lets get right back because 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.549
 sometimes it can be a little 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.840
 practice when we are con it is then 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.909
 than a woman in cosmetics but that's 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.250
 only for those who bought that they 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.570
 buy with real money 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.060
 so that's not about what I'm doing 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.070
 great that aspect 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.030
 free to play but it's not a pay to 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.770
 win if you want it's more a 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.860
 true cri to play or it's pretty much 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.050
 closely balanced so then they will you 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.730
 show the really big fat look 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.709
 aspect of this jose is the tec killed 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.790
 so what are you trying the tree 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.900
 of technology then you see he writes 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.890
 can you be a little one in a 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.000
 narrow so that's it compared 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.000
 at the technology level we have 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.239
 heard g11 technology in Polynesia 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.910
 level 1 102 in the level 250 in the 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.500
 Beautiful 3 what does it match it 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.910
 corresponds to what we have while 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:43.250
 down here is the bar of the bar 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.920
 how is it called hold agen 3 cc 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.930
 the technology bar if you want 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.910
 let's imagine we have the third 1/3 2/3 3 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.040
 wii cream who still believe in 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.660
 shots 4 and still saved for 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.069
 increase in thirds simply he 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.750
 just raise in everything up to 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.430
 left you see the cpu crises 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.420
 so the more we get from his sweaters 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.560
 in the shots and how I'm going to be able 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.660
 more of these mail chips I have a 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.769
 limit to 688 must be increased in 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.480
 players level and when you can for 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.269
 to climb from survey to kill others 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.780
 people so just shelter me I 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.650
 am a nice little plane I 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.750
 will show a little how it is 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.609
 manipulates however it must be noted 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.799
 is that it is a game that is played in 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:20.900
 qwerty so the museum has a keyboard 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.579
 sure qwerty you have on the internet and 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.560
 and then you start with the 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.910
 decorative windows you do 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.260
 simply alt shift if you already have 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.510
 installed it's the shortcut to change 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.760
 type of keyboard I go up a little 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.889
 how is the game different 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.630
 aspects go my rank i can do it 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:37.760
 the gift that there is a small problem 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.840
 so here I 'm going to show you how that 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.370
 is happening so I play only 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.510
 against yatch mode practice and for 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.269
 to practice watching if our vehicle 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.680
 and operational or not so I showed 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.819
 a little stupid so it plays there yes I do 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.239
 left part and if with the missiles 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.950
 by whom tall to aim I ride with 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.840
 space game leaving a shift is a 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.040
 group more game what really 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.040
 more when I have the proof that I tested 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.120
 game then see you 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.859
 and how is this 4 3 shooting 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.730
 it's the places where I shot 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:07.109
 leave and a vehicle just 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.150
 destroy the seat there is going to be you the 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.769
 seat all the vehicle dies then 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.120
 I'm trying to show you here see 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.530
 I destroyed some blocks and sure 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.060
 hopes it's our block but if I 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.769
 find for example its seat 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.120
 there the vehicle will happen all 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.320
 just another thing to know is 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.840
 only in the player versus player mode 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.160
 it's a fashion a little catch domination 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.410
 not something flag what it takes 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.849
 stay you have to take the point of 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.530
 spawn enemies and that's about it 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:38.280
 everything for this mode then what it takes 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.780
 to know also that when one 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.180
 leans and destroys pulls for losses 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.099
 we even imagine time on an airplane 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.110
 and lost a wing wing right on 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:47.699
 shoot on the right wing and ben there we 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.830
 crush 30 meters away otherwise we 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:51.180
 ends up like that since then we know 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.849
 kraton meters away simply 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.889
 the trend will land a little bit 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:58.500
 interim in interest good it's not a 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.580
 cool thing of this important game noted 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.220
 it is possible to join directly 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.720
 our friends imagine you buy your 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.479
 friend on dance chips when you go 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.860
 in social stack 'and there you go on 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.720
 friends and have you join in a 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.699
 plateau in a clan if you want and 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.240
 when you have your friends say I want 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.530
 combat 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.669
 they are waiting for you and there you play in 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.620
 the limit so that was really good 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:20.940
 more elaborate strategies to both of you 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:23.159
 whaou 3 or so on and then there 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.690
 I will tell you the next this 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:28.650
 studio balance for the article of 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.510
 minecraft kraft robot ends i hope that 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.530
 I liked you I did not really support 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.229
 on all these technical aspects of the game 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.340
 like helium all that but if you have 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.039
 want to see I'm sure there's me 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.570
 top scorer like me who 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.130
 explain it the least I hope 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.780
 that it will have pleased you is that they 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.780
 studio at the next
