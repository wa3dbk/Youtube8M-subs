kind<00:00:24.679> of<00:00:24.769> too<00:00:24.949> much<00:00:25.130> so<00:00:25.490> I<00:00:25.759> just<00:00:26.060> kind<00:00:26.539> of<00:00:26.570> like

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
kind of too much so I just kind of like

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
kind of too much so I just kind of like
a<00:00:26.749> way<00:00:26.960> to<00:00:26.990> break<00:00:27.289> it<00:00:27.470> up<00:00:32.170> so<00:00:33.170> to<00:00:33.260> start<00:00:33.560> off<00:00:33.680> you

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:33.740 
a way to break it up so to start off you

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.100 
a way to break it up so to start off you
could<00:00:34.070> either<00:00:34.160> tee<00:00:34.460> the<00:00:34.520> top<00:00:34.850> like<00:00:35.150> you<00:00:35.450> can

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
could either tee the top like you can

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.540 
could either tee the top like you can
see<00:00:36.290> in<00:00:36.410> my<00:00:36.560> other<00:00:36.860> video<00:00:37.190> and<00:00:37.540> that's<00:00:38.540> just<00:00:38.900> a

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
see in my other video and that's just a

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.740 
see in my other video and that's just a
personal<00:00:40.550> preference<00:00:40.790> obviously<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:41.660> the

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
personal preference obviously and the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:42.940 
personal preference obviously and the
whole<00:00:41.870> point<00:00:42.140> is<00:00:42.230> that<00:00:42.260> you<00:00:42.440> want<00:00:42.620> to<00:00:42.650> kind<00:00:42.800> of

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
using these because I feel like these

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.690 
using these because I feel like these
have<00:01:19.390> more<00:01:19.660> hold<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:20.620> like<00:01:20.890> bobby<00:01:21.160> pins<00:01:21.460> do

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
have more hold and like bobby pins do

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.760 
have more hold and like bobby pins do
because<00:01:22.210> they<00:01:22.330> clasp<00:01:22.630> and<00:01:22.840> they<00:01:22.960> kind<00:01:23.590> of<00:01:23.620> hang

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
because they clasp and they kind of hang

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:24.090 
because they clasp and they kind of hang
on

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
on

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.640 
on
so<00:01:24.520> whatever<00:01:25.150> pieces<00:01:25.780> that<00:01:25.960> you<00:01:26.080> want<00:01:26.290> kind<00:01:26.620> of

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
so whatever pieces that you want kind of

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.150 
so whatever pieces that you want kind of
off<00:01:26.860> the<00:01:27.040> face<00:01:27.280> and<00:01:28.440> just<00:01:29.440> kind<00:01:29.710> of<00:01:29.740> clip<00:01:29.950> that

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
off the face and just kind of clip that

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.320 
off the face and just kind of clip that
in<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:33.310> it<00:01:33.400> gives<00:01:33.580> it<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.760> little<00:01:33.910> bit<00:01:34.030> more

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
in and it gives it a little bit more

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:42.719 
in and it gives it a little bit more
support<00:01:34.840> than<00:01:35.050> bobby<00:01:35.290> pins<00:01:35.620> would<00:01:41.550> it's<00:01:42.550> still

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
support than bobby pins would it's still

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.370 
support than bobby pins would it's still
not<00:01:42.910> pinning<00:01:43.150> too<00:01:43.450> much<00:01:43.630> in<00:01:43.840> because<00:01:44.260> the

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
not pinning too much in because the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.110 
not pinning too much in because the
whole<00:01:44.530> point<00:01:44.800> is<00:01:44.950> that<00:01:44.979> you<00:01:45.250> still<00:01:45.520> want<00:01:45.550> it<00:01:45.940> to

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
whole point is that you still want it to

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.850 
whole point is that you still want it to
look<00:01:46.270> kind<00:01:46.420> of<00:01:46.570> voluminous<00:01:47.470> and<00:01:47.860> stuff<00:01:49.860> and

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
look kind of voluminous and stuff and

00:01:50.860 --> 00:02:04.219 
look kind of voluminous and stuff and
then<00:01:51.430> you<00:01:51.610> can<00:01:51.790> pin<00:01:52.030> these<00:01:52.240> pieces<00:01:52.780> off<00:01:53.380> too

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.709 

and<00:02:04.469> then<00:02:04.920> on<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.520> side<00:02:05.579> we<00:02:06.180> kind<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.539> just

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
and then on this side we kind of just

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.509 
and then on this side we kind of just
want<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.020> come<00:02:07.320> around<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:07.979> kind<00:02:08.369> of

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
want it to come around and just kind of

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:20.309 
want it to come around and just kind of
loosely<00:02:09.170> so<00:02:10.170> I'm<00:02:10.349> going<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.590> pin<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:10.890> under

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.140 

then<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.010> can<00:02:21.189> spray<00:02:21.459> it<00:02:21.489> a<00:02:21.670> little<00:02:21.849> bit<00:02:21.999> with

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
then it can spray it a little bit with

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.819 
then it can spray it a little bit with
hairspray<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.719> can<00:02:22.900> curl<00:02:23.170> these<00:02:23.349> end<00:02:23.620> pieces

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
hairspray you can curl these end pieces

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:25.770 
hairspray you can curl these end pieces
if<00:02:24.340> that's<00:02:24.969> something<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.269> you<00:02:25.389> wanted<00:02:25.629> to

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
if that's something that you wanted to

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.839 
if that's something that you wanted to
do<00:02:26.730> anyways<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.230> just<00:02:29.230> very<00:02:29.620> easy<00:02:29.799> and<00:02:30.159> I<00:02:30.459> put<00:02:30.819> a

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
do anyways so just very easy and I put a

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.660 
do anyways so just very easy and I put a
little<00:02:31.090> bit<00:02:31.269> of<00:02:31.420> texture<00:02:31.829> spray<00:02:32.829> in<00:02:33.099> it<00:02:33.340> in<00:02:33.549> the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
little bit of texture spray in it in the

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.729 
little bit of texture spray in it in the
beginning<00:02:33.969> so<00:02:34.540> it<00:02:34.780> just<00:02:34.959> kind<00:02:35.139> of<00:02:35.200> like<00:02:35.349> holds

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
beginning so it just kind of like holds

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.119 
beginning so it just kind of like holds
more<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.269> just<00:02:37.269> like<00:02:37.450> with<00:02:37.569> any<00:02:37.780> updo<00:02:38.170> dirty
