00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.420
 Yup 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.640
 no 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.229
 you would do me a thousand kilometers with this 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.330
 born would be much simpler anymore 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.259
 convenient because I made them with a v7 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.630
 so imagine a little is not so much 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:32.900
 let's say with but it's a note let's say the 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.060
 v7 which allowed me to do a thousand 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.759
 kilometers safely this is 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.610
 clearly much more comfortable more 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.890
 ergonomic facts did not get tired 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.159
 that short path I made is 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.229
 these ergonomic characteristics 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.770
 then arm to the right leg point 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:54.619
 I am 75 m tall so I am tall 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.350
 media feel why the caste is less 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.320
 bearers like this I like the caste 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.860
 the custom bike my passion 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.539
 better twin always says that 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.250
 I imagined it being them the 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.080
 tastes from there you don't run away millet 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.830
 American or better to send in this 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.510
 better case mandello for what reason 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.970
 the city less as they say less 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.560
 more comfortable or less flexibility 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.260
 vibrations are better vibrational 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.420
 good so not so much a choice 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.670
 passionate but a choice one chosen 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.200
 own of exact quality quality 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.740
 a passionate because passion 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.050
 the hard she is the one who is the guzzi 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.950
 equally well they will not be happy with 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.290
 milwaukee 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.700
 but in mandello if happy and what 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.830
 they will not be happy either 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.350
 nicolini to the number one but I this 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.590

 call peter how come you came to 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.420
 try the guzzi because I wanted to know 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.150
 the product not only to cyclists like 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.550
 lady engine because but I have interest in 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.450
 change I stayed very much 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:11.870
 surprised that splendid I aimed at the 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.940
 norge guiding these splendid as 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.570
 especially for you as an engine 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.519
 it drives with the hip in the sense to remove 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.970
 hands from the handlebar now exposed in 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.930
 bend with the hip and gorgeous blue 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.100
 california thousand so it was 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.710
 overlooking the brand better than the 1400s 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.600
 mah 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:35.040
 I found the agility of my il 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.630
 taste the vibrations of my lo 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:43.980
 shake in short, from the standstill so the 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:48.200
 sound of my ounti the scary 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:51.000
 I tried it with raina 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.200
 touring setup in configuration 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.650
 touring 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.560
 I don't know what to expect from our thinking 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.230
 when you put in sport because already so 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.560
 really at any gear the gas opened 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.600
 go away 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.280
 then two generations compared but 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.920
 let's start with the young periti today the 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.210
 target is very high and we take advantage of it 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.040
 have a young whatever your name of 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.340
 virgins eat of David and I come by 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.460
 carvico that the 10 to 1000 bikes now 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.380
 then give up the 2007 2009 with the year there 

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:26.340
 I then soft ways the four-cylinder 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.560
 Japanese to buy one is a no is 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.090
 very beautiful this buzzico the california 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:35.550
 1400 and notable for being a custom 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:38.930
 however, the z1000 goes stronger on the subject 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.130
 the commitment soared but not 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.520
 find it better in other things 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.110
 This is comfortable, but do not 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.470
 even a guide disdains a little more 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.030
 sporty than the usual custom better 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.100
 better than the Harley Davidson 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.340
 california the guzzi when it varies 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:59.940
 vibrate little book what we hear 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:03.120
 Father says and we aimed at the myth 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:07.290
 on my memories as a young man because ai 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.330
 I was aiming for 17 times the old v7 I had 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.550
 a single starling guzzi he had 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.980
 they were stornello and I must say that the 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.530
 driving pleasure exists then there is the 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:20.070
 charm of the guzzi then drive it on 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.140
 lake but now that never a now 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.570
 armille phase so you too four 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.610
 cylinders also you Japanese yes 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.530
 Japanese yes 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.120
 you would be willing to betray it than yours 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.759
 son did not see him so convinced a 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.439
 leave to the kawasaki but I would be 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:37.319
 also willing to buy a motorcycle of the 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:39.569
 kind but I'd like to have two 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:43.800
 only that here in Italy you can't 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:45.120
 to ensure a license plate is true two bikes 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.699
 this could be one thing 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.699
 interesting to move the market 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:52.889
 because the passion of motorcyclists does not 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:55.560
 it is not just a bike maybe more anymore 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:58.020
 bike, unfortunately, so budget 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.330
 allowing because there is also the one from 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.430
 consider them stop buying 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.409
 who knows if one can afford that 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.330
 is the purchase brake 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:08.789
 stamp insurance to all these things 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:13.279
 that then you use it little you like for the in 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:13.279
 garage hand then use okay thanks
