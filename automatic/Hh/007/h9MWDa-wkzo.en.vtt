00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello today we will continue so 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.120
 our kitchen renovation with laying 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.510
 a floating floor finally the floor 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.710
 floating 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:17.070
 so we chose a park and the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.490
 tarkett brand is a special parquet 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:25.820
 so wet room so cooking with 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:29.940
 coating so chen chen dark that's it 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.980
 so the first step so that's going to be 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.530
 to lay the underlayment so here we have 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.879
 the investigation mm underlayment 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.249
 we will put our under layer and then 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.600
 we will attack the laying of the floor then 

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:40.199
 as I explained in my article 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.269
 previous 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.190
 if you do not have room to go out 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:45.749
 all your furniture get rid of a 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.989
 side of the room you attack your 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:51.269
 break like that and you have to have 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.129
 finished the break whatever is there you 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.569
 you will move it does a little bit of 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.949
 handling but if you do not have the 

00:00:54.569 --> 00:01:03.929
 opportunity to take out your furniture is 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:06.390
 when an effective solution to lie down 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:08.460
 of wood fiber it turns out that on 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.020
 this piece for various reasons we're going 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.770
 go double to go up a little bit 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.300
 the level of the room but now 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.870
 that they must follow those 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.030
 unhooked 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.780
 so in fact I'm going to pick it up with a 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.800
 square I measure how much I have here I 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.180
 their door then has it play more than 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.460
 mathias joy until then and for purposes 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.230
 useful so I'm showing enough by having 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.720
 statement to the keys is now in 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.850
 place and then after which I'm going 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.920
 cut my piece there and in whom the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.920
 plate on the discovers 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.060
 so before you also ask your part 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.610
 that we will have to dismantle the doors 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.860
 in order to provide the passage or even 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.630
 cut and his needs before starting on 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.360
 of course check that the soil was 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.310
 full and we dusted it well and 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:03.930
 then once we go to the plates 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.930
 we will confront them to them mixed moves 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.480
 so then to start there for 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.000
 we are going to start along the wall 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.070
 and usually poses them always 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.260
 blades in the sense of the larger 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.780
 length of the piece on the edges 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.000
 periphery one puts a shim of installers or 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.940
 if you do not have a good wand 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.100
 does between 5 and 7 mm who will you 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.390
 allow to can do the seal of 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.820
 dilatation salary for when the 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.470
 bush floor gets wet where gets dry 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.960
 so they can move and who 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.730
 come false salim and departing 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.170
 because he will not be able to 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.080
 move so we put our call here 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.060
 and then we will continue so 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.560
 the abandonment of groups needed when 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.180
 we arrive at length ends as 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.480
 it's advisable to have songs 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.940
 at least 40 cm so to have more 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.160
 40 cm I cut my first white 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.480
 which means that it allows me to 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.930
 do playing here to have a piece 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:09.420
 for less than 40 cm must finish the 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.420
 second row same system on chip soc 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.260
 a period 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.020
 so I'm preparing my two's 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.990
 behind for but with the dawn 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.990
 or morpho 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.450
 at 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:52.560
 which is really important when 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:55.530
 you la meuse floored these gaps here the 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:00.120
 last when you presented 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.620
 your your floor like this you 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.260
 clicked because that's the floor 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.740
 I advise you to click to put a 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.480
 shot with a hammer in hand with a 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.810
 hold of course protection can not 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.480
 slicing for it to be well that in very 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.980
 well because otherwise you 're going 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.150
 LabbÃ© was first seen it will go down badly 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.680
 so we will not hear the click 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.970
 and then you will find yourself 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.160
 like that with a huge gap between 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.660
 two when people are likely to see and 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.320
 in addition you will have all the dirt that 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.870
 go saint cloud 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.850
 so you really need the clip this the 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.850
 their entry into force for the top 16 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.450
 here is the break so had to leave himself 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.750
 is finished and will remain to pose the 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.520
 complaints and then he continued the 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.090
 renovation of the kitchen for the 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.090
 next step
