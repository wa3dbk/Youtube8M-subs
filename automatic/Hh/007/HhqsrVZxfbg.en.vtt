00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.200
 It is a great fog 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.400
 I can not see anything with this 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.500
 Hey, can you hear me? 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.900
 What is that sound? 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.500
 Wow! 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.400
 Fushin! Did you put the back! 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.500
 Don't panic! Another team is coming! Earn time! Let's prolong the battle! 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.700
 Don't take the time! It is a decisive battle! It's a total attack! 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.100
 Ha! 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.430
 Oh, oh, that's Aoinobu! ? 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.200
 Shingen! Ready! 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.400
 Nuu, I believe in ... 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.200
 Oh, what is that? 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.450
 Hall! Another member of Takeda has attacked from Tsumeyama. 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.240
 Squeeze, Shingenme 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.900
 OK, close the army! I will return to Zenkojidaira! 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.000
 Do not chase! 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.579
 The battle is over in the evening of the day 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:04:00.000
 The dead of both sides are said to be 6000 in all 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.050
 It was a step now ... 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.940
 It is a pity that I could not set a flag in Kyoto, oh ... 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.270
 father 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.970
 Good luck 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.240
 I will keep my death for three years 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.900
 And ... strengthen your armaments and make sure to attack Kyoto 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.900
 I understand, Father 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.500
 Oh··· 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.130
 1573, April 12 in Tensho 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.030
 Takeda Shingen ended the life of 53 years old 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.030
 what! Shingen is dead! 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.000
 Yes, in Shinano's Komaba! 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.500
 It was an enemy for a long time but ... 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:25.650
 This trust also died in a sudden illness in 1578 five years later 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.040
 49 years old 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.199
 Did both Shingen and Shinshin die? 

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:41.040
 Now the world is mine 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:13.400
 Looking at you like a kid I will be a small sea 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:29.500
 I feel like I loved you from the distant past 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:44.580
 If you put your ears on your chest, it sounds like a heartwarming life 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:57.700
 The wind in the city is so whimsical that it seems that goodbye will come 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:04.000
 As the flowers are scattered 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:15.100
 Let's meet this next ah life too
