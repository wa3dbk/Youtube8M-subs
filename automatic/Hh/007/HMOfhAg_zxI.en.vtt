camera you know what I'm saying so I

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.420 
camera you know what I'm saying so I
mean<00:03:09.750> bear<00:03:10.170> with<00:03:10.380> me<00:03:10.530> like<00:03:10.710> I<00:03:10.800> said<00:03:11.010> I'm<00:03:11.130> not<00:03:11.310> an

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
mean bear with me like I said I'm not an

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.850 
mean bear with me like I said I'm not an
expert<00:03:11.720> nor<00:03:12.720> am<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:12.990> the<00:03:13.020> one<00:03:13.410> that<00:03:13.650> came<00:03:13.830> up

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
expert nor am I the one that came up

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.410 
expert nor am I the one that came up
with<00:03:14.040> this<00:03:14.280> concept<00:03:14.520> to<00:03:15.030> bling<00:03:15.270> out

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
with this concept to bling out

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.120 
with this concept to bling out
everything<00:03:15.990> I<00:03:16.200> mean<00:03:16.380> there's<00:03:16.530> probably<00:03:16.920> other

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
everything I mean there's probably other

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.670 
everything I mean there's probably other
youtubers<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.330> other<00:03:18.660> YouTube<00:03:19.110> videos<00:03:19.140> out

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
youtubers and other YouTube videos out

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.950 
youtubers and other YouTube videos out
there<00:03:19.920> where<00:03:20.850> you<00:03:20.880> can<00:03:21.060> actually<00:03:21.420> see<00:03:23.960> what

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
there where you can actually see what

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.780 
there where you can actually see what
other<00:03:25.350> people<00:03:25.680> are<00:03:25.770> doing<00:03:25.830> then<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:26.580> can

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
other people are doing then you can

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.670 
other people are doing then you can
choose<00:03:27.270> it<00:03:27.480> yourself<00:03:27.840> on<00:03:27.930> how<00:03:28.110> you<00:03:28.170> want<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.560> do

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
choose it yourself on how you want to do

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.420 
choose it yourself on how you want to do
it<00:03:29.270> so<00:03:30.270> I<00:03:30.660> guess<00:03:31.380> why<00:03:31.530> I'm<00:03:31.800> just<00:03:31.890> gonna<00:03:32.190> do<00:03:32.310> is

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
it so I guess why I'm just gonna do is

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.920 
it so I guess why I'm just gonna do is
I'm<00:03:32.520> gonna<00:03:32.610> try<00:03:33.920> just<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.010> regular<00:03:35.489> glue

00:04:53.890 --> 00:05:04.640 
the glue over the plate but just be
careful<00:04:56.550> not<00:04:57.550> to<00:04:57.610> get<00:04:57.910> it<00:04:58.030> everywhere

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.340 

and<00:05:05.160> this<00:05:05.310> will<00:05:05.460> probably<00:05:05.580> be<00:05:05.850> easy<00:05:09.050> so<00:05:10.050> I<00:05:10.110> mean

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
and this will probably be easy so I mean

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.270 
and this will probably be easy so I mean
just<00:05:10.560> get<00:05:11.400> a<00:05:11.430> nice<00:05:11.669> little<00:05:11.970> coat<00:05:12.919> and<00:05:13.919> you<00:05:14.100> can

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
just get a nice little coat and you can

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.370 
just get a nice little coat and you can
actually<00:05:14.990> do<00:05:15.990> all<00:05:16.400> this<00:05:17.400> whole<00:05:17.610> one<00:05:17.850> side<00:05:18.380> some

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
actually do all this whole one side some

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.080 
actually do all this whole one side some
might<00:05:19.620> leak<00:05:19.860> on<00:05:20.040> the<00:05:20.070> back<00:05:20.370> but<00:05:20.639> it's<00:05:20.790> ok

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
might leak on the back but it's ok

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.490 
might leak on the back but it's ok
because<00:05:21.120> you're<00:05:21.449> gonna<00:05:21.570> be<00:05:21.750> doing<00:05:21.780> that<00:05:22.050> side

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
because you're gonna be doing that side

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:35.490 
because you're gonna be doing that side
anyway

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.250 

you<00:05:36.250> do<00:05:36.430> kind<00:05:36.730> of<00:05:36.790> want<00:05:36.850> to<00:05:37.090> move<00:05:37.330> quickly<00:05:37.840> or

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
you do kind of want to move quickly or

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.660 
you do kind of want to move quickly or
whatever<00:05:38.880> because<00:05:39.880> it<00:05:40.030> will<00:05:40.210> dry<00:05:41.370> and<00:05:42.370> if<00:05:42.490> it

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:42.670 
whatever because it will dry and if it

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.260 
whatever because it will dry and if it
does<00:05:42.850> happen<00:05:43.090> to<00:05:43.330> get<00:05:43.480> like<00:05:44.380> extra<00:05:45.220> dry<00:05:45.430> just

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
does happen to get like extra dry just

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.050 
does happen to get like extra dry just
go<00:05:46.450> back<00:05:46.630> through<00:05:46.870> it<00:05:46.960> with<00:05:47.110> paint<00:05:47.410> I<00:05:48.060> mean

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:41.939 
have foil in my video so you can just

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:46.610 
have foil in my video so you can just
take<00:06:42.210> the<00:06:42.330> fall<00:06:42.599> and<00:06:43.080> kind<00:06:43.470> of<00:06:45.379> press<00:06:46.379> down

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:06.449 
do the other side on camera because I'm

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:08.089

speeding<00:07:06.750> it<00:07:06.900> up<00:07:07.020> and<00:07:07.169> it<00:07:07.349> sounds<00:07:07.530> like<00:07:07.860> a

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:08.099 
speeding it up and it sounds like a
