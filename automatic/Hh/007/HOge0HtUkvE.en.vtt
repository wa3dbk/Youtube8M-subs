00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hello and this is a long-awaited 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.610
 stale video test 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.490
 jars today we have montana black 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.400
 Germany is also a violet can with a review 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.340
 it is almost full to me once 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.109
 paint further flame 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:25.289
 European with blue lights 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:29.789
 brown such a jar and and chrome 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.700
 we will have from the fleet here it is already new 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.980
 the flop in my opinion has changed only 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.590
 label the difference in quality is not 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.340
 felt only like me 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.890
 it seemed the valve got better otherwise 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.920
 all too cheap paint well and quite 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.079
 acceptable I want to say that the test will be in 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.629
 somewhat incomplete by virtue of 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.710
 that the flop is not so bad 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.020
 chrome he covers everything himself 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.010
 perfectly covered 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.449
 so I think with him should not 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.909
 there are problems accordingly 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:08.970
 one hundred percent conclusions about these 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.580
 banks 2 do not need to do i think with 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:20.720
 Bernard they themselves would show quite 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:25.799
 differently and since the cardboard poet 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:31.909
 standard about her any problems with 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:36.049
 the valve is already in my arms 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.049
 i have no idea why 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:52.649
 what could happen try again 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:56.070
 that's fine somehow on the woods hands in paint 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.070
 it's spray 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:08.530
 we have such a rusty 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:10.569
 iron metal box and precisely 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.000
 standing upright as I think it is 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.890
 best way to check on how much 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.840
 paint does not trickle down 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:26.519
 that is, here we are looking at the attraction of the earth 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.709
 this paint was mouth green red 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:47.170
 tried stressed don't look like he 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:51.400
 will block anything such chrome some 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.880
 degree mirrors even a little some 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:03:01.540
 my reflection can be seen there 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:04.720
 but you will not see it further further with us 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.480
 we are test in and of itself 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:16.810
 montana black so far without 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:22.600
 interactions with chromium see that of 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:29.460
 this will come too fat cap orton pretty 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:43.880
 liquid paint before the valve is already softer 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:50.180
 And we will take the smell of priyat closer to 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.180
 raw chrome let it be like this 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.600
 see montana black raw chrome not 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:02.370
 very much as coping 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:05.100
 meat saying a thin layer is pressing down but 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:12.260
 Already a little better on the contour yourself 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:12.260
 saw a little bit corrodes further flame 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:40.590
 European so also quite liquid paint 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.430
 as you can see starts a little bit 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:47.460
 drain I can overdo it where though 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:52.560
 have seen that layer threw neatly 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:56.370
 and thin so let's see chrome in 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.880
 principle already dries out that is to 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.040
 fingers 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:04.440
 nothing remains but in some places 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:07.790
 which are the most mirror- looking flame 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.790
 how he will behave 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:17.100
 I spent two lines and can see in 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:21.120
 some places still chromova 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.990
 eat away even though chrome 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.340
 flop ski 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:32.060
 pretty simple but paint with it somehow 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.060
 not really cope again try with 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:45.720
 Looking at the camera will probably be a little 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:49.169
 not so good but I can see it live 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:52.099
 here part here and here really 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:55.530
 chrome comes out 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:06:04.620
 let's try how flame will cover montale 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:10.889
 black day being there two times pretty 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:18.629
 it covers everything well and see how 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:25.229
 montana black will cover the flame and so flame 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:35.490
 here it is the bottom one time principle 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:38.120
 covers well even if here so 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.120
 under pour 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:46.760
 everyone is happy at a decent level here 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:51.660
 chrome here tread montana black 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:56.520
 so I ask those who paint to consider 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:59.460
 what if florovskogo chrome appears 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:02.550
 montana black yes that is chrome in at least 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:05.280
 Montana appears then I guess 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:09.540
 general trouble will be as not written in 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:12.630
 principle on this I think all of you yourself 

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:16.890
 everyone saw and by the way, here are some more buns 

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:19.280
 here and here are the edges to new meetings 

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:23.630
 subscribe to the put put likes channel 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:26.870
 there will be an overview of new cans of dough wait 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.870
 bye everyone
