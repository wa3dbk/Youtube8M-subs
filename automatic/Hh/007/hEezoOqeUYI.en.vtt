00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 or you would like to know gilberto you 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.390
 that you know all these characters from 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.969
 first hand 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.330
 what did you think the answer honestly 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:17.289
 by Miguel Herrera in this sense that 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.420
 he will be a little bit nery halo 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.520
 I 'm not in Europe and you are 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.769
 here with this roll of that then I 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.390
 I'm going to direct a world cup and tomás was not going 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.970
 to lead a team so that 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.789
 descend I do not know if that really contributes 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.340
 hill if that really finiquite a 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.100
 controversial or on the contrary does not generate 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.750
 still more hatreds out there good I think 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.760
 that always that kind of answers can 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.340
 generate thinking it like you notice that I 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.070
 I have to say we had not 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.109
 talked about in this sense the issue of 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.840
 Miguel's statement I had taken it 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:52.300
 more on the side of wanting and giving it a point 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.890
 final to this I had not taken it like that but 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.739
 Now that you say it, I think there's also 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.420
 something of that I have to admit, not what 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.089
 I had mentioned what we had talked about 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.989
 with they talked with con beto with don giles 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:12.450
 which is one is a mocking response 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:15.740
 ironic but yes 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.740
 but he says he looked at it 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:26.219
 that's why I say that I then agree 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:28.710
 here of irony in that answer but 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.600
 Herrera also remembers that he 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.630
 descended with the veracruz did not want 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.819
 put so much in depth with that 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:43.229
 discussion with tomás boy but eye here 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:45.420
 we achieve the fortune that can not be 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.580
 achieved loses in mexico's policy the 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.520
 pressure for consumption 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.880
 is to forget it or is it today is that you think 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.690
 of those who said tomás boy his problem goes 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.560
 to the other things next question I 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.560
 I want you to tell me what he said 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.420
 I believe that today the miguel herrera what 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.370
 should have said gilberto is really 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.860
 first of all offer an apology 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.190
 for having said that taken I will speak 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.960
 for envious not and then already possibly 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.170
 could have done well and everyone at 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:26.970
 yours up there but I do think that abuse 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.980
 a little shame obviously not 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.980
 it's going to be quiet, obviously it's going 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.080
 to look and well yes I think that part of 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.000
 Miguel Herrera because he is very guarded 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.000
 we are going
