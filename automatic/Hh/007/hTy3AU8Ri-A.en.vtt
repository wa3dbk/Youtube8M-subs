then<00:02:47.470> they<00:02:47.709> have<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:48.069> imagine<00:02:48.340> just<00:02:48.819> how<00:02:49.000> they

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
then they have to imagine just how they

that's<00:03:33.770> alarming<00:03:34.250> at<00:03:34.370> first<00:03:34.670> but<00:03:35.000> bankruptcy

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
that's alarming at first but bankruptcy

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
seen as a prelude to restructuring and

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.050 
seen as a prelude to restructuring and
not<00:03:41.630> liquidation<00:03:42.410> as<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.650> used<00:03:42.860> to<00:03:42.950> be<00:03:43.100> you<00:03:43.850> see

not liquidation as it used to be you see
that<00:03:44.240> with<00:03:44.390> Escada<00:03:44.780> I<00:03:45.050> think<00:03:45.320> they<00:03:45.440> used<00:03:45.710> it<00:03:45.920> to

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
that with Escada I think they used it to

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.190 
that with Escada I think they used it to
get<00:03:46.250> into<00:03:46.490> better<00:03:46.670> shape<00:03:46.820> they<00:03:47.750> have<00:03:47.960> a<00:03:47.990> new

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
get into better shape they have a new

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.660 
get into better shape they have a new
investor<00:03:48.710> and<00:03:48.890> I<00:03:49.010> think<00:03:49.190> they're<00:03:49.340> certainly

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
investor and I think they're certainly

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.850 
investor and I think they're certainly
in<00:03:49.820> a<00:03:49.910> better<00:03:49.940> position<00:03:50.360> for<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.930> future<00:03:51.350> than

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
in a better position for the future than

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.350 
in a better position for the future than
they<00:03:51.980> could<00:03:52.160> have<00:03:52.250> imagined<00:03:52.760> a<00:03:52.910> year<00:03:53.180> and<00:03:53.300> a
