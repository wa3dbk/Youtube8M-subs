I'm going to change the transmission
fluid<00:00:04.650> in<00:00:04.920> my<00:00:05.009> 2004<00:00:05.670> Banshee<00:00:06.120> the

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
fluid in my 2004 Banshee the

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.509 
fluid in my 2004 Banshee the
transmission<00:00:07.799> fluid<00:00:08.069> is<00:00:08.189> going<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.400> lubricate

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
transmission fluid is going to lubricate

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.790 
transmission fluid is going to lubricate
the<00:00:08.880> transmission<00:00:09.450> as<00:00:09.599> well<00:00:09.630> as<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:10.530> clutch

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
the transmission as well as the clutch

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.919 
the transmission as well as the clutch
which<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.490> known<00:00:11.670> as<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.849> wet<00:00:12.210> clutch<00:00:12.509> that<00:00:12.750> just

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
which is known as a wet clutch that just

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.890 
which is known as a wet clutch that just
means<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.290> clutch<00:00:13.500> operates<00:00:14.070> with<00:00:14.309> oil

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
means the clutch operates with oil

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.210 
means the clutch operates with oil
there's<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.960> example<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.859> couple<00:00:17.130> of

transmission with a wet clutch I believe
this<00:00:40.110> one<00:00:40.410> says<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.800> somewhere<00:00:41.190> on<00:00:41.370> there<00:00:41.550> as

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
this one says it somewhere on there as

well

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.250 

I<00:00:44.460> looked<00:00:45.090> up<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.300> specs<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.809> oil<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
I looked up the specs on this oil on the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.400 
I looked up the specs on this oil on the
internet<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.949> what<00:00:47.610> clutch<00:00:47.850> safe<00:00:48.410> so

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
internet and it is what clutch safe so

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.380 
internet and it is what clutch safe so
first<00:00:50.129> thing<00:00:50.340> take<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.670> quad<00:00:50.940> for<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.210> quick

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
first thing take the quad for a quick

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.490 
first thing take the quad for a quick
ride<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:52.379> warm<00:00:52.680> up<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.040> transmission<00:00:53.489> fluid

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
ride to warm up the transmission fluid

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.540 
ride to warm up the transmission fluid
it's<00:00:55.500> going<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.710> flow<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> lot<00:00:56.100> better<00:00:56.339> when

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
it's going to flow a lot better when

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.459 
it's going to flow a lot better when
it's<00:00:56.670> warmed<00:00:56.969> up<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.480> going<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.660> stir<00:00:58.260> up

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
it's warmed up and it's going to stir up

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.880 
it's warmed up and it's going to stir up
all<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.949> the<00:01:00.050> sediments<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.199> metal<00:01:01.649> shavings

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
all of the sediments and metal shavings

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.259 
all of the sediments and metal shavings
and<00:01:02.190> all<00:01:02.280> kind<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.519> stuff<00:01:02.729> that<00:01:02.909> are<00:01:02.940> inside

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
and all kind of stuff that are inside

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.090 
and all kind of stuff that are inside
the<00:01:03.360> transmission<00:01:03.690> rather<00:01:04.080> than<00:01:04.290> just<00:01:04.890> being

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
the transmission rather than just being

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.990 
the transmission rather than just being
settled<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.479> bottom<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:08.000> small

settled in the bottom in the small
waffle<00:01:09.630> like<00:01:10.850> traps<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.149> bottom<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:12.930> not

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
waffle like traps in the bottom it's not

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.550 
waffle like traps in the bottom it's not
going<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.290> drain<00:01:13.440> out<00:01:13.590> any<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:15.320> oil<00:01:16.320> if

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
going to drain out any of the oil if

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.749 
going to drain out any of the oil if
that's<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> case<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.220> take<00:01:17.399> it<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.640> quick

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
that's the case so take it for a quick

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.310 
that's the case so take it for a quick
ride<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.270> it's<00:01:18.450> going<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.660> be<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> 17

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
