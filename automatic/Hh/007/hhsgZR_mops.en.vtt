00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.680 

Kurt<00:02:34.319> was<00:02:34.560> getting<00:02:34.860> ready<00:02:34.980> my<00:02:35.340> son<00:02:36.150> Turtles

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
Kurt was getting ready my son Turtles

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.790 
Kurt was getting ready my son Turtles
get<00:02:36.870> ready<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.379> go<00:02:38.129> to<00:02:38.159> rodeo<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.319> knew

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
get ready to go to rodeo and so I knew

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.369 
get ready to go to rodeo and so I knew
that<00:02:40.830> that<00:02:41.400> would<00:02:41.610> really<00:02:42.140> be<00:02:43.140> something

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
that that would really be something

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.009 
that that would really be something
important<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.129> him<00:02:44.159> and<00:02:45.090> he<00:02:45.390> was<00:02:45.510> about<00:02:45.690> five

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
important to him and he was about five

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.520 
important to him and he was about five
years<00:02:46.290> old<00:02:46.580> and<00:02:47.580> so<00:02:48.480> he<00:02:48.900> was<00:02:49.050> doing<00:02:49.290> something

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
years old and so he was doing something

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.879 
years old and so he was doing something
wrong<00:02:49.830> I<00:02:50.040> don't<00:02:50.220> remember<00:02:50.340> what<00:02:50.670> anymore
