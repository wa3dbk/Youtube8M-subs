I<00:00:59.719> believe<00:01:00.719> fully<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.739> there<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:01.980> probably<00:01:02.280> a

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
I believe fully that there is probably a

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.429 
I believe fully that there is probably a
fairly<00:01:02.910> strong<00:01:03.090> overlap<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.600> Venn<00:01:03.809> diagram

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
fairly strong overlap the Venn diagram

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.670 
fairly strong overlap the Venn diagram
of<00:01:04.650> idiot<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.869> racist<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.200> probably<00:01:07.560> has<00:01:07.650> a

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
of idiot and racist it probably has a

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.179 
of idiot and racist it probably has a
lot<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.920> overlap<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.640> yet<00:01:09.299> even<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.189> racists

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
lot of overlap and yet even so racists

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.060 
lot of overlap and yet even so racists
would<00:01:11.340> have<00:01:11.549> us<00:01:11.760> believe<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.630> they<00:01:13.350> man<00:01:13.920> they

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
would have us believe that they man they

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.219 
would have us believe that they man they
just<00:01:14.220> can't<00:01:14.580> identify<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.479> things<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.110> this

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
just can't identify the things in this

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.170 
just can't identify the things in this
world<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.890> are<00:01:16.920> stereotypically<00:01:17.729> racist

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
world that are stereotypically racist

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.999 
world that are stereotypically racist
it's<00:01:18.689> not<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.200> they<00:01:19.350> don't<00:01:19.500> know<00:01:19.770> that

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
it's not just that they don't know that

would<00:01:35.759> actually<00:01:36.060> be<00:01:36.180> considered<00:01:36.689> racist<00:01:37.350> and

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
would actually be considered racist and

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.890 
would actually be considered racist and
again<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.729> understand<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.479> there's<00:01:39.720> some

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
again I understand that there's some

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.960 
again I understand that there's some
inherit<00:01:40.409> stupidity<00:01:41.009> there<00:01:41.220> but<00:01:41.759> we

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
inherit stupidity there but we

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.050 
inherit stupidity there but we
understand<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.250> terms<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.939> the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
some reason especially considering his

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.520 
some reason especially considering his
history<00:02:30.070> of<00:02:30.790> people<00:02:31.600> going<00:02:32.080> on<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.320> street

history of people going on the street

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.570 
history of people going on the street
and<00:02:32.620> bothering<00:02:32.980> him<00:02:33.070> and<00:02:33.220> things<00:02:33.370> like<00:02:33.520> that

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
and bothering him and things like that

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.580 
and bothering him and things like that
he's<00:02:34.330> he's<00:02:34.720> had<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.900> deal<00:02:34.930> with<00:02:35.050> it<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.260> lot<00:02:35.410> and

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
he's he's had to deal with it a lot and

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.350 
he's he's had to deal with it a lot and
and<00:02:35.770> I<00:02:36.040> think<00:02:36.250> some<00:02:36.520> people<00:02:36.550> see<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.180> as<00:02:37.270> sort

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
and I think some people see it as sort

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.300 
and I think some people see it as sort
of<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.540> challenge<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.410> considering<00:02:39.130> all<00:02:39.220> the

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
of a challenge that considering all the

of a challenge that considering all the
heckling<00:02:39.610> that<00:02:39.730> he's<00:02:39.820> had<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.030> deal<00:02:40.150> with<00:02:40.180> in

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
heckling that he's had to deal with in

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.210 
heckling that he's had to deal with in
past<00:02:40.600> they<00:02:40.780> want<00:02:40.990> to<00:02:41.080> be<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.260> one<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:41.920> take<00:02:42.070> it

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
past they want to be the one to take it

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.320 
past they want to be the one to take it
the<00:02:42.430> next<00:02:42.760> step

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
the next step

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.150 
the next step
and<00:02:43.420> as<00:02:44.050> I've<00:02:44.230> said<00:02:44.260> before<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.860> I'll<00:02:44.920> say<00:02:44.950> it

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
and as I've said before and I'll say it

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.760 
and as I've said before and I'll say it
again<00:02:45.400> it's<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.730> damn<00:02:45.970> shame<00:02:46.000> because<00:02:46.540> I<00:02:46.930> want

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
again it's a damn shame because I want

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.280 
again it's a damn shame because I want
him<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.190> be<00:02:48.910> comfortable<00:02:49.300> performing<00:02:49.630> I<00:02:49.960> want

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
him to be comfortable performing I want

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.560 
him to be comfortable performing I want
him<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.710> do<00:02:50.860> HBO<00:02:51.580> specials<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.180> eventually<00:02:52.480> go

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
him to do HBO specials and eventually go

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.060 
him to do HBO specials and eventually go
back<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.870> doing<00:02:53.080> movies<00:02:53.380> and<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:53.770> maybe

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
back to doing movies and and maybe

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.580 
back to doing movies and and maybe
someday<00:02:54.280> someday<00:02:55.180> doing<00:02:56.140> Chappelle's<00:02:56.500> Show

someday someday doing Chappelle's Show
again<00:02:57.360> but<00:02:58.360> that's<00:02:58.480> unlikely<00:02:58.630> to<00:02:58.960> happen<00:02:59.140> in

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
again but that's unlikely to happen in

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.230 
again but that's unlikely to happen in
an<00:02:59.650> era<00:02:59.860> where<00:03:00.220> people<00:03:00.580> are<00:03:00.730> just<00:03:00.850> they're

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
whatever that's a damn shame because

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.420 
whatever that's a damn shame because
that<00:03:11.230> would<00:03:11.320> be<00:03:11.410> pretty<00:03:11.440> damn<00:03:11.860> amazing<00:03:12.100> to
