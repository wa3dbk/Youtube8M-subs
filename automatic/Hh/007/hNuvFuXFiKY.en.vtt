00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
data redstone here and then a repeater

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.190 
data redstone here and then a repeater
on<00:02:11.459> two<00:02:11.819> ticks<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.180> delay

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
on two ticks a delay

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.530 
on two ticks a delay
and<00:02:13.290> have<00:02:13.770> this<00:02:13.950> guy<00:02:14.190> going<00:02:14.489> into<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.910> dropper

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and have this guy going into a dropper

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.970 
and have this guy going into a dropper
facing<00:02:15.989> up<00:02:16.140> just<00:02:16.500> like<00:02:16.620> that

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
facing up just like that

facing up just like that
and<00:02:17.220> then<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.060> dropper<00:02:18.420> facing<00:02:18.870> sideways<00:02:19.349> just

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
and then a dropper facing sideways just

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.559 
and then a dropper facing sideways just
like<00:02:20.519> so<00:02:20.730> now<00:02:20.849> we're<00:02:20.940> gonna<00:02:21.030> have<00:02:21.209> a<00:02:21.239> hopper

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
like so now we're gonna have a hopper

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.690 
like so now we're gonna have a hopper
going<00:02:21.810> into<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.110> bottom<00:02:22.530> dropper<00:02:23.010> there<00:02:23.550> we

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
going into the bottom dropper there we

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.300 
going into the bottom dropper there we
go<00:02:23.879> and<00:02:24.120> put<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.900> chest<00:02:25.230> on<00:02:25.440> top<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.129> guy

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
flow into the bottom dropper there now

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.430 
flow into the bottom dropper there now
you're<00:02:33.150> going<00:02:33.269> to<00:02:33.330> want<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.630> place<00:02:33.959> a<00:02:34.170> block

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
you're going to want to place a block

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.589 
you're going to want to place a block
there<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:34.739> have<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.250> comparator<00:02:35.910> output<00:02:36.360> from

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
there and have a comparator output from

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.600 
there and have a comparator output from
the<00:02:36.780> top<00:02:36.959> dropper<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.590> then<00:02:38.160> have<00:02:38.310> this<00:02:38.430> guy

going into a block with a redstone dust
on<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.549> and<00:02:41.700> then<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.420> block<00:02:42.750> right<00:02:43.170> there<00:02:43.230> now

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
on it and then a block right there now

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.520 
on it and then a block right there now
what<00:02:44.040> that's<00:02:44.160> going<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.580> do<00:02:45.110> also<00:02:46.110> that

what that's going to do also that

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.050 
what that's going to do also that
repeater<00:02:46.830> two<00:02:47.099> ticks<00:02:47.340> are<00:02:47.459> delay<00:02:47.670> make<00:02:47.910> sure

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
repeater two ticks are delay make sure

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.270 
repeater two ticks are delay make sure
you<00:02:48.209> do<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.599> now<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.440> see<00:02:49.680> when<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:49.920> push<00:02:50.099> the

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
to this redstone dust right here and

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.300 
to this redstone dust right here and
we're<00:03:00.000> going<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.150> go<00:03:00.329> over<00:03:01.049> to<00:03:01.319> just<00:03:01.709> like<00:03:01.890> so

we're going to go over to just like so
and<00:03:02.610> place<00:03:03.269> some<00:03:03.510> redstone<00:03:03.720> going<00:03:04.200> into<00:03:04.440> that

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
and place some redstone going into that

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.860 
and place some redstone going into that
block<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.250> will<00:03:05.579> trigger<00:03:05.880> your<00:03:06.030> trapdoor

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
block that will trigger your trapdoor

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.330 
block that will trigger your trapdoor
now<00:03:07.650> you're<00:03:07.739> going<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:07.920> want<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.069> come<00:03:08.220> down

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
now you're going to want to come down

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.009 
now you're going to want to come down
here<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.880> we're<00:03:09.120> going<00:03:09.209> to<00:03:09.299> build<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.750> little

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
here and we're going to build a little

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.559 
here and we're going to build a little
pathway<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:11.069> goes<00:03:11.130> down<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.209> then<00:03:12.480> we're

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
pathway that goes down to and then we're

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.530 
pathway that goes down to and then we're
