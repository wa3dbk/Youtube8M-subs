Rico here in Hispaniola and Cuba here
and<00:00:09.929> we're<00:00:10.050> all<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.620> way<00:00:10.740> up<00:00:10.860> there<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.190> the

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
and we're all the way up there to the

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.310 
and we're all the way up there to the
northwest<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.150> storm<00:00:12.389> has<00:00:12.750> really<00:00:12.990> grown<00:00:13.290> a

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
northwest the storm has really grown a

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.430 
northwest the storm has really grown a
little<00:00:13.740> bit<00:00:13.980> in<00:00:14.160> size<00:00:14.420> over<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.690> past<00:00:15.960> six<00:00:16.350> to

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
little bit in size over the past six to

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.260 
little bit in size over the past six to
eight<00:00:16.650> hours<00:00:16.680> or<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:17.910> looks<00:00:17.970> much

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
eight hours or so and it looks much

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.730 
eight hours or so and it looks much
stronger<00:00:18.630> than<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.020> did<00:00:19.140> earlier<00:00:19.439> this

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
stronger than it did earlier this

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.769 
stronger than it did earlier this
morning<00:00:20.460> but<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:20.880> want<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.210> point<00:00:21.420> out<00:00:21.539> some

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
morning but I want to point out some

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.070 
morning but I want to point out some
obstacles<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.560> Erika<00:00:22.980> has<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.340> overcome

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
obstacles that Erika has to overcome

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.929 
obstacles that Erika has to overcome
before<00:00:25.080> making<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.830> toward<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.130> Bahamas<00:00:26.730> and

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
before making it toward the Bahamas and

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.570 
before making it toward the Bahamas and
then<00:00:27.260> inevitably<00:00:28.260> if<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.070> makes<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.369> far

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
then inevitably if it makes that far

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.220 
then inevitably if it makes that far
probably<00:00:30.210> up<00:00:30.300> towards<00:00:30.570> South<00:00:30.779> Florida<00:00:31.140> but

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
probably up towards South Florida but

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.659 
probably up towards South Florida but
let<00:00:31.410> me<00:00:31.470> show<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.740> what's<00:00:31.949> going<00:00:32.009> on<00:00:32.309> right

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
let me show you what's going on right

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.120 
let me show you what's going on right
now<00:00:32.880> with<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.390> storm<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.840> light<00:00:34.559> blue<00:00:34.739> here

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
now with the storm in light blue here

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.400 
now with the storm in light blue here
this<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.820> wind<00:00:36.090> shear<00:00:36.510> these<00:00:36.780> are<00:00:36.960> winds<00:00:37.170> that

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
this is wind shear these are winds that

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.250 
this is wind shear these are winds that
cut<00:00:37.860> into<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.370> storm<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.000> helped<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.809> tear<00:00:40.079> it

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
cut into the storm and helped to tear it

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.290 
cut into the storm and helped to tear it
apart<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.550> light<00:00:41.760> blue<00:00:41.969> it's<00:00:42.180> got<00:00:42.270> a

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
apart so in the light blue it's got a

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.850 
apart so in the light blue it's got a
lot<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.540> wind<00:00:42.870> shear<00:00:42.989> out<00:00:43.260> ahead<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.680> here

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
lot of wind shear out ahead of it here

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.560 
lot of wind shear out ahead of it here
the<00:00:44.010> spaghetti<00:00:44.430> models<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.030> can<00:00:45.149> see<00:00:45.210> as

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
the spaghetti models you can see as

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.600 
the spaghetti models you can see as
Erika<00:00:46.320> continues<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.920> move<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> northwest

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
Erika continues to move to the northwest

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.209 
Erika continues to move to the northwest
that<00:00:47.969> wind<00:00:48.270> shear<00:00:48.570> stays<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.500> place<00:00:49.770> there<00:00:50.039> so

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
that wind shear stays in place there so

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.369 
that wind shear stays in place there so
this<00:00:50.340> constantly<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.149> digging<00:00:51.629> into<00:00:51.809> Erika's

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
this constantly is digging into Erika's

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.139 
this constantly is digging into Erika's
it's<00:00:52.590> trying<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.980> make<00:00:53.129> its<00:00:53.309> way<00:00:53.370> up<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
it's trying to make its way up to the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.560 
it's trying to make its way up to the
northwest<00:00:54.480> now<00:00:55.110> once<00:00:55.440> we<00:00:55.680> get<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.370> Saturday<00:00:57.120> if

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
northwest now once we get to Saturday if

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.080 
northwest now once we get to Saturday if
Erika<00:00:58.320> makes<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.770> past<00:00:58.980> Porto<00:00:59.489> Rico<00:00:59.850> and

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
Erika makes it past Porto Rico and

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.729 
Erika makes it past Porto Rico and
Hispaniola<00:01:00.359> doesn't<00:01:01.109> interact<00:01:01.289> with<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
Hispaniola doesn't interact with the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.009 
Hispaniola doesn't interact with the
land<00:01:01.980> too<00:01:02.250> much<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.789> doesn't<00:01:03.390> get<00:01:03.629> torn<00:01:03.930> apart

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
land too much and doesn't get torn apart

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.170 
land too much and doesn't get torn apart
by<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.439> wind<00:01:04.769> shear<00:01:05.070> you'll<00:01:05.580> see<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.970> when

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
by the wind shear you'll see that when

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.200 
by the wind shear you'll see that when
she<00:01:06.210> really<00:01:06.810> decreases<00:01:07.650> here<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.939> will

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
she really decreases here and that will

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.330 
she really decreases here and that will
enable<00:01:09.540> Erika<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.260> possibly<00:01:10.799> strengthened

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
enable Erika to possibly strengthened

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.179 
enable Erika to possibly strengthened
into<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.580> category<00:01:11.670> 1<00:01:12.360> hurricane<00:01:12.390> as<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.950> starts

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
into a category 1 hurricane as it starts

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.070 
into a category 1 hurricane as it starts
to<00:01:14.280> move<00:01:14.400> up<00:01:14.580> towards<00:01:15.210> South<00:01:15.450> Florida<00:01:15.900> and

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
to move up towards South Florida and

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.050 
to move up towards South Florida and
there's<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.650> potential<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.520> here<00:01:17.820> because

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
there's the potential in here because

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.760 
there's the potential in here because
the<00:01:18.180> water<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.659> warm<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.259> wind<00:01:19.470> shear<00:01:19.560> is

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
the water is so warm and wind shear is

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.560 
the water is so warm and wind shear is
gonna<00:01:19.920> be<00:01:20.040> very<00:01:20.280> very<00:01:20.520> light<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.330> could

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
gonna be very very light that it could

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.359 
gonna be very very light that it could
strengthen<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.200> little<00:01:22.439> more<00:01:22.680> than<00:01:23.189> the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
strengthen a little more than the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.480 
strengthen a little more than the
current<00:01:23.729> forecast<00:01:24.270> however<00:01:24.950> this<00:01:25.950> wind<00:01:26.250> shear

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
current forecast however this wind shear

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.120 
current forecast however this wind shear
is<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.640> pretty<00:01:26.820> big<00:01:27.060> obstacle<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.020> will<00:01:28.950> be

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
is a pretty big obstacle and so will be

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.800 
is a pretty big obstacle and so will be
Puerto<00:01:29.430> Rico<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.759> Hispaniola<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.509> it's<00:01:30.659> got<00:01:30.780> a

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
Puerto Rico and Hispaniola so it's got a

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.020 
Puerto Rico and Hispaniola so it's got a
long<00:01:31.259> way<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.470> go<00:01:31.680> before<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.430> gets<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.759> us<00:01:32.880> we

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
long way to go before it gets to us we

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.789 
long way to go before it gets to us we
should<00:01:33.090> know<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.390> lot<00:01:33.750> more<00:01:33.990> about<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.560> storm

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
should know a lot more about this storm

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.359 
should know a lot more about this storm
by<00:01:35.280> Friday<00:01:35.640> if<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.180> makes<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:37.020> long

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
by Friday if it makes it that long
