00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.980
 hello guys and girls here is the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.880
 market and even if I have a lot to do 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.990
 I've obviously not today 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.610
 take 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.220
 download battlefield 3 endgame 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.560
 Currently only for the ps3 for 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.520
 people with premium of course I read 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.869
 short for everyone who does not 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.680
 I know it in the beginning quickly before I 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.630
 start right 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.730
 the release second the releasedaten 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.260
 for the other platforms before so 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.170
 today has appeared primarily for ps3 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.500
 xbox and pc for premium members follows 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.970
 on march 12 ps3 on march 19 for not 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.770
 premium members and xbox and pc 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.620
 player without bremer on 26 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.750
 So that's 20 days earlier that is 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.860
 of course already a lot you can 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.360
 argue over whether that is great and 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.800
 not but it's kind of fact anyway 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.199
 Sony had a contract with them and 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.790
 that's why on the ps3 first I have 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.900
 long on the ps3 can battlefield 3 times 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.699
 played you have to be I 'm not 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.390
 great ps3 friend and i play 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.970
 like on the ps3 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.659
 at least what multiplatform title 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.040
 As for 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.080
 However, I have to say it has changed 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.000
 much improved compared to the beginning 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.909
 since the last patch is the input lag 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.570
 on the ps3 almost gone you can almost feel 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.790
 nothing more 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.770
 that feels almost 12 on the xbox 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.810
 You know, I play with an xbox 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.760
 adapter so say play with xbox 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.200
 controller at ps3 who that 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.000
 I'm interested in how that works 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.960
 make an amazon link again and no 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.290
 look up the container 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.580
 it works with it and with it 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.350
 ultimately play really nice 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.730
 I am here in the middle of the defender 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.930
 Round taken for quite honestly that 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.730
 is now 19h15 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.650
 I can not do that much videos 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.330
 record now and I will be in 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.190
 also can not tell this video 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.940
 endgame is the worst or endgame 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.290
 is shit 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.370
 I can not say that either I am 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.260
 but I played a total of rounds 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.000
 my first experience was of course 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.980
 again there are great stuff in 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.720
 comic french seurat with kick 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.540
 Immediately I could not even save 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.310
 Tell now I kick knows 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.890
 not what is going on for the people and 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.280
 otherwise as I said gameplay as usual 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.100
 snow map people finally I know there was 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:03.870
 with albums mountain albums with z 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.430
 Behind the eighth stage there was also 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.150
 already the topic but I have to 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.280
 say I have a little bit 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.450
 you umgeguckt must say I have I 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.099
 I did not start here I will 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.360
 you dreamed here i just have the 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.620
 taken last few minutes because of me 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.989
 I do not even think I'm crazy and 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.249
 that I'm very nice to look at 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.930
 I think snowman at first 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:19.909
 view 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.049
 I made the sunshine effect very nice 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:23.030
 Hope you see that we are in between 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.950
 again the sun effects I find 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.540
 are on this map clearly fitting 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.400
 as for example on the event peak 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.750
 I always pick this up at the event 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.159
 if somehow smells and looks where the 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.689
 you do not see anything because 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.280
 the sun is static here come the 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.920
 sun out all the time as a cover 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.989
 the left side and also on the stands 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.780
 there is a very nice effect of 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.459
 gameplay yes it's just fast it 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.599
 There are probably some weird new ones 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.370
 armor with which I have not even 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.230
 I'm driving 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.540
 gameplay weapons moderate otherwise no 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.269
 I realized what I noticed and it 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.120
 is not the patch that weapons 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:59.120
 Handling of the m16 is different 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.560
 between ps3 and xbox and I have now 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.209
 the direct comparison because both of me 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.909
 Consoles with the small with the same 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.040
 controller games and it's up to that 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.340
 weapons handling differs in the 16th 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.049
 is on the ps3 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.530
 so she go she does not wobble like that 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.389
 a lot around 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.790
 However, she is also harder 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.900
 down yes because you have some hours of play 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.219
 with the weapon and that on both 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.469
 can compare platforms 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:23.239
 it is noticeable because put 1 is easy 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:26.000
 Rum is also fun 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.099
 why not no idea why that is so 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.540
 is and it is not the patch it is 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.099
 not at the patch so much i can say that 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.329
 Having previously stayed so I only just 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.319
 I especially noticed again 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.729
 also not why that is no idea 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.409
 why that is general does not matter 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:38.209
 that makes a big difference 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:40.729
 not different, what else is there too 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.840
 Escape a bit in total 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:43.159
 four maps there again capture the 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.319
 flag so what's like the capture the 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:48.259
 flag it no battlefield row capture 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.000
 I do not know the name of the flag 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:51.530
 By the way, the map here so you see I 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 know me very well just me 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.079
 I 've played two cards like that 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.430
 It's just that he just times 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.989
 a little bit of gameplay from the new one 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.280
 Not everyone has the new stuff 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.169
 Not everyone has a ps3 premium 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.849
 insofar the film concert is to be viewed 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:03.319
 I have to say the snow off at least 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.780
 also with the pipeline the markets means 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.729
 namely sabbah took small i hope i 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.720
 I have correctly pronounced that 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:10.609
 me very much 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.370
 and not just because it's snow and 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:15.709
 Pipeline reminds me sounds like a lot 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:20.090
 from the optics on board walters from bad 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:23.280
 company 2 from the fast gameplay ago 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.350
 bit on maybe yes 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.750
 So if you compare yourself to the 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:33.120
 Bases look relatively similar to the 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:35.070
 I've always wanted this one 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.620
 enter analytics somewhere where it must 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.030
 his is jumping around 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.680
 otherwise you have to watch how long that 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.800
 I think I'm up at all 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.169
 the 877 minutes so that's where I turn 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.490
 have to keep up with a bit 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.350
 with aplomb not that the knights and 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.940
 I think the train is horny polish means 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.180
 a great man and quake 3 had the 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.620
 Best bid ever was such a free one 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.530
 bit drier acted about like that 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.270
 so over the leaves the majority so 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.640
 important now says he cover well 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.750
 It does not matter because it's not about it 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.970
 a big problem with the whole thing 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.880
 is to escape myself I want to be nothing 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.260
 I was at close quarter back then 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.669
 Leaned very far out of the window 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
 after the first two rounds of the 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.330
 exaggerated horny choices because totally 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.669
 I freaked out and said what for 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.229
 a horny dlcs and in the end I 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.910
 do not play a monastery anymore 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.229
 That's why I'm not going to go now 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.729
 Lean two rounds out of the window 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.410
 and say exaggeratedly cool and otherwise 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.990
 what I can say now with hindsight 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.640
 the last dlc so aftermath the but 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.950
 really cool we have the maps in ali 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.270
 says I play almost only that only fast 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.530
 if most of them are that you 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.870
 to watch more often 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.000
 and i have to say after many diva 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.200
 Schmetz extremely fun before 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.520
 all because of the destruction without 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.060
 fuck you look at this hall left 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.970
 Portugal the first base looks right 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:51.060
 you on board was the first base right 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.470
 yes, exactly where you have to go down the 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.229
 small mountain or also original 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:58.080
 just like this shit here 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:06:00.510
 I think it's cool when you have a few 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.760
 bad company 2 maps would port that 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.780
 I think really cool 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.610
 we will probably not anymore 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.410
 However, many male experience 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.000
 valparaiso or so imagine in 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.250
 battlefield 3 the weather ahead 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.200
 one of my favorite markets maps 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.900
 bad company 2 as well as I would be extreme 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.760
 like actually always been playing 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.340
 revive remember saying out 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.840
 and always just touch let's dance one 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.550
 may people would revive again 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.380
 the defibrillator I can not at all 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.419
 So it's a bit of timing 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:30.180
 did you have control stick right out 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:31.310
 expresses defi pushes retire again 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.560
 on weapon and mars 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:36.140
 the thing is evidence for the people 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.880
 arrived already extremely 16 everywhere else 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.540
 which indeed without fucking people I play on 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.370
 the ps3 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.930
 of course I play the what works best 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.910
 should come now 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.130
 Voluntarily making money on the rich 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.360
 you look again escape now 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.430
 here everyone escaped me fall the 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.600
 of course I want to shoot in 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.000
 Gameplay in the row on the line 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.110
 get today is not about times yes i 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.160
 Hope you have it all the same 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.260
 I like you too now 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.350
 Of course, no one after two rounds deep 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.240
 insight into this dlc could give 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.650
 gameplay itself, I think sometimes even 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.760
 no longer be seen simply that 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.590
 as I said did not have that 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.710
 all ps3 and certainly have it 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.690
 Not all premiums and thus on 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.960
 Decision makes it good until the next one 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.960
 matches
