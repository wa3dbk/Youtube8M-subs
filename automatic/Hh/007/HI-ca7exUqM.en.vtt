00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.520
 hello everyone today second 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.000
 party of mr of firecrackers so he 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.309
 will consist of fireworks so if you do not 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.070
 have not seen part 1 which consists 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.800
 did not go to see her 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.830
 I will put in the description so we 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.680
 starts with the smoke so filmed 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.130
 jean the tiger it's cac 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.859
 So here is a white one yellow one purple 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.539
 pink a blue and a glass so I already 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.600
 did a white so went to see on my 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.920
 chain to find out 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.840
 we consult we pass at worst cracker 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:44.550
 so as you can see the three 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:46.379
 there are empty that they are well in what 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.149
 there they are the three new cities 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.390
 of the small canteen inhabitants and the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.379
 eminent in a debit in one of 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.850
 worst earth attacks 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.449
 so that will give three times the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.649
 power of a pirate hacker geoffrey 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.800
 will be a video to introduce you 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.359
 how we do it's very simple do 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.460
 you have disassembled the worst to 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.650
 cracker this you have a species of 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.710
 paper sheets in it you take off 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.920
 debit me I did that the three 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.150
 then you dismount a full egg you 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.880
 unpack the sheet of paper you 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.619
 put your feet in it you close 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.070
 the little paper thing and families 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.470
 of pirate lakers and then left 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.590
 we go to fire emblem so its limits 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.009
 or worse so that's it over 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.960
 but it's not bad so it's fire blade 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:38.009
 crackling top so its skylights the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.900
 tig again so then we move on to 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.170
 compact volume 1 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.200
 so it's crisis and sibilant so 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.399
 it is compact outdoor so it's 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.290
 better because if you do that to 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.310
 the interior at the harbor do not have to be too 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.369
 happy so there is 21 95 g of material 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.060
 active and so is the case then 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.640
 to the mini rocket passes so it's 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.440
 cyclamens we know pretty little by 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.170
 relation to the hands 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.619
 so it's cyclamens the tiger because 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.630
 I have six packets on May 12th jc put in 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:19.050
 the package as you can see a 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:21.950
 nadja not bad here now is ya de 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.950
 what to do frankly 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:32.970
 so that's what rifle said who leave 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:38.550
 team is in the air of his 99 cents 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:42.030
 the package of November 12 to fun here is in 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.040
 everything there are six times from where so to 72 so 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.920
 after that so here's how you see not 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.630
 too much artifice but I really like 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.330
 bet for rockets but I made a 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:57.030
 big deal so here I showed the 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.790
 surprise do not move hop there it goes 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:05.040
 so heart to heart 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:06.420
 so this is the torpedo set so that 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.840
 it's still heavy me I find 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.590
 that's where 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.690
 for me it's the group have 10 euros 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.850
 so I bought 10 euros on the 24th 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:21.000
 so that's the surprise I saved 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:22.440
 14 euros on his so refused so when 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.180
 you see it's louvre 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.480
 CDU one meter from two lengths is 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.480
 not bad 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.049
 what was lacking air so voila 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.500
 as could see it's heavy 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:43.980
 there are 200 4 70 g of the active ingredients 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:49.439
 for the transfused it's really not 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.879
 badly so to present them so there we have 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:57.109
 a small ignition tube 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:04:01.519
 normal so we have two who are in the picture 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:05.370
 so we have four silver crossfires 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:07.920
 glittering silver so these 10 25 mm one 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.750
 would not bad it feels good 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.730
 and so I'll make you a video on 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.650
 would say if it is so early I wanted 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.709
 to make a video on both is 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.970
 huge rocket 48 m but will say in 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.030
 comment if you want others 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.880
 physical see the effects in hd so 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.440
 filmed with an iphone I specify so we 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.389
 so passes the crossois yesterday to 10 and 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:33.660
 so 7 6 silver 25mm after we pass 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:36.599
 to the bombers so satie in white the 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.030
 people the five cells 30 mm so after 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.710
 So we move on to 40 mm that's 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.460
 really heavy 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.419
 there was one gram of active material 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.770
 not refuse for the 40 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:51.300
 so here it is a pure valouse 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.470
 glittering white and a green 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.650
 glittering green 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.620
 here it is I will make you a video for 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.060
