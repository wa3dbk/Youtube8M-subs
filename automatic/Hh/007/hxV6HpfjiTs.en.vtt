of 150 * so technically this will be a

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.300 
of 150 * so technically this will be a
base<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.960> haven't<00:01:52.140> really<00:01:52.380> attacked<00:01:52.860> yet

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
base that I haven't really attacked yet

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.370 
base that I haven't really attacked yet
uh<00:01:53.549> actually<00:01:54.270> haven't<00:01:54.659> really<00:01:54.840> scouted<00:01:55.290> it

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
uh actually haven't really scouted it

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.080 
uh actually haven't really scouted it
yet<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:56.189> can<00:01:56.310> kind<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.579> think<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:56.909> is

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
yet so you can kind of think of this is

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.240 
yet so you can kind of think of this is
sort<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.450> multiplayer<00:01:58.020> challenge<00:01:58.500> not

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
sort of like a multiplayer challenge not

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.730 
sort of like a multiplayer challenge not
too<00:01:59.610> easy<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.540> base<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:00.930> also<00:02:01.079> not<00:02:01.350> too

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
too easy of a base but also not too

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.920 
too easy of a base but also not too
difficult<00:02:02.189> either<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.030> I'm<00:02:03.659> going<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.840> be

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
difficult either and I'm going to be

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.060 
difficult either and I'm going to be
running<00:02:04.079> with<00:02:04.200> all<00:02:04.380> haste<00:02:04.530> spells<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:04.950> I'll

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
looks to be like a fairly inactive base

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.160

a<00:04:30.280> little<00:04:30.310> bit<00:04:30.610> more<00:04:30.820> in<00:04:30.880> this<00:04:31.000> raid<00:04:31.590> goblins

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
a little bit more in this raid goblins

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.100 
a little bit more in this raid goblins
are<00:04:32.650> going<00:04:32.949> in<00:04:33.100> and<00:04:33.540> looks<00:04:34.540> like<00:04:34.690> there's<00:04:34.930> like

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
are going in and looks like there's like

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.879 
are going in and looks like there's like
one<00:04:35.410> more<00:04:35.590> set<00:04:35.889> of<00:04:35.919> storages<00:04:36.699> to<00:04:37.650> take<00:04:38.650> into

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
one more set of storages to take into

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.659 
one more set of storages to take into
the<00:04:40.050> put<00:04:41.050> into<00:04:41.260> the<00:04:41.350> bank<00:04:41.590> so<00:04:42.160> the<00:04:42.250> hey<00:04:42.340> spells

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
the put into the bank so the hey spells

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.640 
the put into the bank so the hey spells
actually<00:04:43.030> do<00:04:43.210> speed<00:04:43.690> up<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:43.930> goblins<00:04:44.290> a<00:04:44.440> lot

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
actually do speed up the goblins a lot

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.800 
actually do speed up the goblins a lot
keep<00:04:45.100> in<00:04:45.220> mind<00:04:45.250> it<00:04:45.460> doesn't<00:04:45.639> improve<00:04:46.150> or

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
keep in mind it doesn't improve or

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.110 
keep in mind it doesn't improve or
increase<00:04:47.020> in<00:04:47.410> terms<00:04:47.590> of<00:04:47.710> attack<00:04:48.070> speed<00:04:48.460> so<00:04:49.090> you

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
increase in terms of attack speed so you

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.170 
increase in terms of attack speed so you
just<00:04:49.479> want<00:04:49.630> to<00:04:49.690> realize<00:04:50.050> that<00:04:50.889> and<00:04:51.280> it's<00:04:52.060> just

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
just want to realize that and it's just

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.240 
just want to realize that and it's just
purely<00:04:52.449> for<00:04:52.780> a<00:04:52.810> movement<00:04:53.199> speed<00:04:53.470> bonus<00:04:53.889> and

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
purely for a movement speed bonus and

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.890 
purely for a movement speed bonus and
then<00:04:54.580> watch<00:04:54.820> how<00:04:55.000> quickly<00:04:55.270> they<00:04:55.510> go<00:04:55.690> and

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
then watch how quickly they go and

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.010 
then watch how quickly they go and
obliterate<00:04:56.740> those<00:04:57.280> uh<00:04:57.310> those<00:04:57.910> storages<00:04:58.810> or<00:04:58.960> at

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
obliterate those uh those storages or at

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.350 
obliterate those uh those storages or at
least<00:04:59.139> one<00:04:59.289> of<00:04:59.320> those<00:04:59.500> storages<00:05:00.039> so<00:05:00.850> that<00:05:01.120> was

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
least one of those storages so that was

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.650 
least one of those storages so that was
the<00:05:01.630> troll<00:05:01.900> raid<00:05:02.139> that<00:05:02.380> you<00:05:02.500> guys<00:05:02.740> requested

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
below and I'll be happy to do them if

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:17.189 
below and I'll be happy to do them if
it's<00:05:15.970> a<00:05:16.060> serious<00:05:16.270> challenge<00:05:16.630> maybe<00:05:16.990> I'll<00:05:17.169> even

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 
it's a serious challenge maybe I'll even

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.219 
it's a serious challenge maybe I'll even
throw<00:05:17.410> it<00:05:17.830> into<00:05:17.979> a<00:05:18.100> Champions<00:05:18.610> League<00:05:18.850> push<00:05:19.630> to

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:20.229 
throw it into a Champions League push to

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:22.200 
throw it into a Champions League push to
I<00:05:20.560> guess<00:05:20.740> Titans<00:05:21.160> league<00:05:21.340> at<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:21.520> moment<00:05:21.849> now

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210
