00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
in the form of probably not this month

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.060

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.670 
although they do mention wanting to talk
about<00:02:05.250> GDC<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.780> if<00:02:06.930> they<00:02:07.079> wanted<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.500> keep

those memories fresh in their head

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.820 
those memories fresh in their head
there's<00:02:09.479> definitely<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.959> chance<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.410> one<00:02:10.560> soon

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
there's definitely a chance of one soon

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.150 
there's definitely a chance of one soon
however<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.879> hope<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.540> pod

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.800 
however I hope that a pod

that's<00:02:28.940> exactly<00:02:29.120> what<00:02:29.660> I<00:02:29.690> did<00:02:29.780> although<00:02:30.170> it's

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
that's exactly what I did although it's

that's exactly what I did although it's
still<00:02:30.500> in<00:02:30.800> a<00:02:30.920> bit<00:02:31.340> of<00:02:31.370> broken<00:02:31.850> English<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:32.900> does

still in a bit of broken English it does

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.380 
still in a bit of broken English it does
not<00:02:33.320> go<00:02:33.530> into<00:02:33.740> too<00:02:34.250> much<00:02:34.580> different<00:02:35.060> detail

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
not go into too much different detail

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.660 
not go into too much different detail
compared<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.110> polygon<00:02:36.530> article<00:02:36.920> however

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
compared to the polygon article however

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.490 
compared to the polygon article however
that's<00:02:37.910> not<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.540> reason<00:02:38.690> why<00:02:38.960> this<00:02:38.990> article

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
that's not the reason why this article

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.230 
that's not the reason why this article
is<00:02:39.650> important<00:02:40.130> it<00:02:40.280> is<00:02:40.310> because<00:02:40.850> of<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.090> new

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
is important it is because of the new

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.080 
is important it is because of the new
pictures<00:02:41.890> so<00:02:42.890> we<00:02:42.920> have<00:02:43.220> these<00:02:43.370> first<00:02:43.820> three

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
pictures so we have these first three

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.820 
pictures so we have these first three
pictures<00:02:44.480> showing<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.900> hunter<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.440> Warlock

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
pictures showing the hunter the Warlock

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.160 
pictures showing the hunter the Warlock
the<00:02:46.040> Titan<00:02:46.460> all<00:02:46.640> in<00:02:47.120> different<00:02:47.270> armor<00:02:47.660> sets<00:02:47.900> I

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
the Titan all in different armor sets I

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.870 
the Titan all in different armor sets I
don't<00:02:48.860> think<00:02:49.010> we've<00:02:49.100> seen<00:02:49.280> these<00:02:49.460> armor<00:02:49.670> sets

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
don't think we've seen these armor sets

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.130 
don't think we've seen these armor sets
before<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.420> they<00:02:50.480> do<00:02:50.570> look<00:02:50.720> pretty<00:02:50.870> cool

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
before and they do look pretty cool

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.450 
before and they do look pretty cool
they're<00:02:51.410> just<00:02:51.590> kind<00:02:51.740> of<00:02:51.800> showing<00:02:52.010> up<00:02:52.220> more<00:02:52.400> of

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
they're just kind of showing up more of

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.420 
they're just kind of showing up more of
the<00:02:52.550> customization<00:02:53.300> possibilities<00:02:54.430> however

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
the customization possibilities however

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.370 
the customization possibilities however
these<00:02:55.670> next<00:02:56.180> few<00:02:56.360> are<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.690> more<00:02:56.870> interesting

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
these next few are the more interesting

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.740 
these next few are the more interesting
ones<00:02:57.460> will<00:02:58.460> start<00:02:58.700> with<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.850> gear<00:02:59.180> system

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
ones will start with the gear system

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.900 
ones will start with the gear system
concept<00:03:00.380> image<00:03:00.770> you<00:03:01.340> can<00:03:01.460> really<00:03:01.670> see<00:03:01.880> the

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
concept image you can really see the

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.060 
concept image you can really see the
extreme<00:03:02.690> variation<00:03:03.500> in<00:03:03.620> these<00:03:03.770> hunter

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
extreme variation in these hunter

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.070 
extreme variation in these hunter
helmets<00:03:04.460> I<00:03:04.670> say<00:03:05.300> they're<00:03:05.480> hunter<00:03:05.750> helmets

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
helmets I say they're hunter helmets

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.960 
helmets I say they're hunter helmets
because<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.560> article<00:03:06.980> talks<00:03:07.250> about<00:03:07.430> hunters

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
because the article talks about hunters

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.200 
because the article talks about hunters
having<00:03:08.270> gas<00:03:08.570> mask<00:03:09.080> like<00:03:09.890> helmets<00:03:10.640> so<00:03:11.060> that's

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
having gas mask like helmets so that's

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.940 
having gas mask like helmets so that's
why<00:03:11.360> I<00:03:11.420> assume<00:03:11.690> they're<00:03:11.930> hunter<00:03:12.410> helmets<00:03:12.710> and

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
why I assume they're hunter helmets and

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.610 
why I assume they're hunter helmets and
to<00:03:13.790> really<00:03:14.060> expand<00:03:14.540> on<00:03:14.660> the<00:03:14.750> system<00:03:15.110> concept

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
to really expand on the system concept

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.710 
to really expand on the system concept
will<00:03:16.070> move<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.370> this<00:03:16.550> image<00:03:16.910> just<00:03:17.300> showing<00:03:17.600> the
