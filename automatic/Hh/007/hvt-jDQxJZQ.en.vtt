what<00:00:00.930> is<00:00:01.079> cancer<00:00:01.560> there's<00:00:02.250> no<00:00:02.370> simple<00:00:02.790> answer

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
what is cancer there's no simple answer

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.570 
what is cancer there's no simple answer
this<00:00:03.090> question<00:00:03.449> let's<00:00:03.600> try<00:00:04.290> and<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.069> sound<00:00:05.370> bite

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
this question let's try and a sound bite

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.089 
this question let's try and a sound bite
cancer<00:00:06.240> is<00:00:06.420> an<00:00:06.690> unwanted<00:00:07.259> or<00:00:07.440> uncontrolled

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
cancer is an unwanted or uncontrolled

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.459 
cancer is an unwanted or uncontrolled
division<00:00:08.550> of<00:00:08.639> cells<00:00:09.050> you're<00:00:10.050> constantly

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
division of cells you're constantly

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.410 
division of cells you're constantly
dying<00:00:10.769> in<00:00:11.010> tiny<00:00:11.340> bits<00:00:11.670> which<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.059> freaking

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
dying in tiny bits which is freaking

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.030 
dying in tiny bits which is freaking
also<00:00:12.690> many<00:00:12.840> think<00:00:13.019> about<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.410> but<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.920> reason

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
also many think about it but the reason

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.740 
also many think about it but the reason
you<00:00:14.190> don't<00:00:14.250> degrade<00:00:14.429> into<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.969> puff<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.360> dust<00:00:15.599> is

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
you don't degrade into a puff of dust is

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.090 
you don't degrade into a puff of dust is
your<00:00:15.900> cells<00:00:16.170> are<00:00:16.350> constantly<00:00:16.470> placing

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
lead to a cancerous state this means

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.709 
lead to a cancerous state this means
that<00:00:56.129> cancers<00:00:56.579> tend<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.030> be<00:00:57.149> unique<00:00:57.449> for

that cancers tend to be unique for

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.990 
that cancers tend to be unique for
