not too familiar with the matchup
I<00:01:11.220> would<00:01:11.340> imagine<00:01:11.430> Rufus<00:01:12.030> has<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.450> wound<00:01:12.720> from

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.170 
I would imagine Rufus has it wound from
the<00:01:13.170> other<00:01:13.290> side<00:01:13.530> it's<00:01:13.799> actually<00:01:14.340> not<00:01:14.909> it

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
the other side it's actually not it

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.090 
the other side it's actually not it
Blanc<00:01:15.570> has<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.810> lot<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.140> good<00:01:16.350> answers<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.710> Rufus

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
pressure and a lot better buttons on the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.810 
pressure and a lot better buttons on the
ground<00:01:18.930> it's<00:01:19.860> basically<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.430> got<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.670> keep

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
ground it's basically you got to keep

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.010 
ground it's basically you got to keep
them<00:01:20.970> off<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.090> dive<00:01:21.360> kick<00:01:21.630> because<00:01:21.780> he<00:01:21.869> does

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
them off the dive kick because he does

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.240

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.890 
not have a very safe hands
and<00:01:23.550> it's<00:01:23.760> pretty<00:01:23.970> obviously<00:01:24.450> easy<00:01:24.720> to

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
and it's pretty obviously easy to

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.810 
and it's pretty obviously easy to
startup<00:01:25.230> type<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.590> yet<00:01:25.770> but<00:01:26.400> if<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.580> can<00:01:26.700> keep

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
startup type in yet but if you can keep

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.250 
startup type in yet but if you can keep
mount<00:01:27.030> for<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.300> while<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.660> tip<00:01:27.900> aware<00:01:28.110> was
