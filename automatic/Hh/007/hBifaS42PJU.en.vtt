a normal scope the zoom of the infrared
scope<00:04:43.690> also<00:04:44.169> means<00:04:44.410> that<00:04:44.590> you<00:04:44.830> can<00:04:45.040> fire<00:04:45.640> fully

recommend<00:04:52.660> this<00:04:52.810> scope<00:04:53.110> as<00:04:53.260> is<00:04:53.650> highly<00:04:54.190> highly

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520

effective next is the six times rifle
scope<00:05:02.950> I<00:05:03.190> would<00:05:03.610> recommend<00:05:03.880> using<00:05:04.180> it<00:05:04.390> with<00:05:04.479> a

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
scope I would recommend using it with a

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.810 
scope I would recommend using it with a
bipod<00:05:04.990> as<00:05:05.229> you<00:05:05.710> can<00:05:05.860> still<00:05:06.220> go<00:05:06.520> fully

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
bipod as you can still go fully

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.730 
bipod as you can still go fully
automatic<00:05:06.940> and<00:05:07.479> maintain<00:05:08.140> a<00:05:08.169> lot<00:05:08.470> of<00:05:08.590> your

automatic and maintain a lot of your
accuracy<00:05:09.130> I<00:05:09.780> would<00:05:10.890> extremely<00:05:11.890> advise

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
accuracy I would extremely advise

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.640 
accuracy I would extremely advise
against<00:05:12.460> going<00:05:12.700> single<00:05:12.970> fire<00:05:13.270> as<00:05:13.570> for<00:05:14.500> some

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
against going single fire as for some

against going single fire as for some
reason<00:05:14.979> your<00:05:15.280> shots<00:05:15.580> just<00:05:15.850> don't<00:05:16.150> go<00:05:16.390> where

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
reason your shots just don't go where

is<00:05:22.240> actually<00:05:22.600> a<00:05:22.630> surprisingly<00:05:23.260> good

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
is actually a surprisingly good

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220

to<00:05:27.310> use<00:05:27.580> but<00:05:28.060> if<00:05:28.180> you<00:05:28.270> can<00:05:28.390> use<00:05:28.539> it<00:05:28.570> effectively

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
to use but if you can use it effectively

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.250 
to use but if you can use it effectively
you<00:05:30.220> can<00:05:30.400> score<00:05:30.760> pretty<00:05:31.330> long<00:05:31.630> range<00:05:31.900> kills

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
you can score pretty long range kills

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.850 
you can score pretty long range kills
even<00:05:33.190> though<00:05:33.280> you're<00:05:33.430> using<00:05:33.580> an<00:05:33.910> m4<00:05:34.210> 16<00:05:34.860> after

this is the exact same thing as the

this is the exact same thing as the
