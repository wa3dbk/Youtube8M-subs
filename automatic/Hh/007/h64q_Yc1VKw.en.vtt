00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
hey guys I'm nice mark and this speech

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.580 
hey guys I'm nice mark and this speech
much<00:00:21.060> oh<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.630> there<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:21.960> left<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.560> the

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
much oh that there is left to the

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.189 
much oh that there is left to the
village<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.850> almost<00:00:24.420> everything<00:00:24.810> got

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
village so almost everything got

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.330 
village so almost everything got
destroyed<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:26.160> don't<00:00:26.519> see<00:00:26.760> any<00:00:27.029> villagers<00:00:27.750> and

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
destroyed I don't see any villagers and

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.690 
destroyed I don't see any villagers and
we<00:00:29.340> have<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:30.060> massive<00:00:30.480> hole<00:00:31.080> here<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:32.520> is

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
we have this massive hole here this is

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.340 
we have this massive hole here this is
where<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.030> expulsion<00:00:33.540> happened

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
where the expulsion happened

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.420 
where the expulsion happened
and<00:00:36.079> this<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.230> basically<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.680> concept<00:00:38.129> that

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
and this is basically a concept that

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.470 
and this is basically a concept that
allows<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:38.969> create<00:00:39.210> explosive<00:00:39.930> arrows<00:00:40.739> or

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
allows you to create explosive arrows or

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.209 
allows you to create explosive arrows or
God<00:00:42.480> balls<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.320> guess<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.710> would<00:00:43.800> call<00:00:43.860> them

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
God balls I guess you would call them

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.819 
God balls I guess you would call them
that<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.700> create<00:00:45.420> massive<00:00:45.719> explosions<00:00:46.469> like

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
that to create massive explosions like

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.580 
that to create massive explosions like
this<00:00:47.370> one<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:48.539> was<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:49.140> very<00:00:49.530> strong<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.430> and

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
this one this was a very strong one and

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.920 
this one this was a very strong one and
as<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.649> set<00:00:53.070> explosive<00:00:53.820> arrows<00:00:54.210> let<00:00:54.600> me<00:00:54.750> just

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
as a set explosive arrows let me just

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.830 
as a set explosive arrows let me just
demonstrate<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.489> shoot<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.850> it

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
demonstrate it so you shoot it it

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.590 
demonstrate it so you shoot it it
explodes<00:01:00.289> like<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:02.329> now<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
explodes like that and now it's the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.120 
explodes like that and now it's the
Koken<00:01:04.019> at<00:01:04.229> how<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.769> works<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:06.680> we<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.920> a

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
Koken at how this works so we have a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.820 
Koken at how this works so we have a
clock<00:01:08.430> here<00:01:08.820> which<00:01:09.119> leads<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.200> command

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
clock here which leads to this command

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.000 
clock here which leads to this command
work<00:01:11.130> which<00:01:11.760> has<00:01:12.060> an<00:01:12.360> excuse<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.590> which

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
work which has an excuse and which

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.570 
work which has an excuse and which
executes<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.939> test<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.630> block<00:01:15.900> command<00:01:16.580> which

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
executes a test for block command which

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.289 
executes a test for block command which
checks<00:01:18.060> for<00:01:18.530> Minecraft<00:01:19.530> err<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.640> box<00:01:20.939> below

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
checks for Minecraft err to box below

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:28.219 
checks for Minecraft err to box below
the<00:01:21.479> arrow<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:24.770> then<00:01:26.240> we<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.570> another<00:01:27.990> X

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
the arrow and then we have another X

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.010 
the arrow and then we have another X
command<00:01:28.799> which<00:01:29.220> summons<00:01:29.640> primatene<00:01:30.450> see<00:01:30.780> at

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
command which summons primatene see at

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.510 
command which summons primatene see at
the<00:01:31.290> arrow<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:33.770> then<00:01:34.770> we<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.100> kill<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
the arrow and then we just kill the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.690 
the arrow and then we just kill the
arrow<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.560> if<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.590> want<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.040> create<00:01:38.220> massive

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
arrow and if you want to create massive

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.760 
arrow and if you want to create massive
explosions<00:01:39.240> like<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.689> one<00:01:39.930> you're<00:01:40.290> going<00:01:40.470> to

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
explosions like this one you're going to

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.060 
explosions like this one you're going to
use<00:01:40.950> their<00:01:41.460> guest<00:01:41.790> fireball<00:01:42.680> so<00:01:43.680> let<00:01:43.799> me<00:01:43.950> just

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
use their guest fireball so let me just

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.190 
use their guest fireball so let me just
copy<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.460> here<00:01:45.500> okay<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:47.540> again<00:01:48.540> execute

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
copy it here okay so again execute

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.069 
copy it here okay so again execute
command<00:01:49.770> summon<00:01:50.369> fireball<00:01:50.970> at<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.840> arrow

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
command summon fireball at the arrow

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.030 
command summon fireball at the arrow
with<00:01:52.860> explosion<00:01:53.520> power<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:54.090> 20<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:55.500> default

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
with explosion power of 20 the default

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.990 
with explosion power of 20 the default
expulsion<00:01:56.579> power<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.990> guest<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.829> 1<00:01:59.520> so

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
expulsion power of the guest is 1 so

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.100 
expulsion power of the guest is 1 so
this<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.210> 20<00:02:00.719> times<00:02:00.960> stronger<00:02:01.610> then<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
this is 20 times stronger then the

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.940 
this is 20 times stronger then the
projectile<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.500> shot<00:02:04.770> by<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.159> gust<00:02:05.549> and

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
projectile that is shot by the gust and

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.760 
projectile that is shot by the gust and
Direction<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.220> negative<00:02:09.000> zero<00:02:09.780> point<00:02:09.840> 1<00:02:10.500> on

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
Direction is negative zero point 1 on

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.309 
Direction is negative zero point 1 on
the<00:02:11.730> y-axis

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
the y-axis

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.530 
the y-axis
so<00:02:14.319> it's<00:02:14.439> going<00:02:14.680> down<00:02:16.739> alright<00:02:17.739> so<00:02:18.459> let<00:02:19.269> me

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
so it's going down alright so let me

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.380 
so it's going down alright so let me
demonstrate<00:02:19.689> it<00:02:20.109> for<00:02:20.409> you<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:21.670> if<00:02:21.939> we<00:02:22.120> just

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
demonstrate it for you so if we just

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.589 
demonstrate it for you so if we just
shoot<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:25.799> we<00:02:26.799> get<00:02:27.069> this<00:02:27.280> big<00:02:27.760> explosion<00:02:28.180> with

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
shoot it we get this big explosion with

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.580 
shoot it we get this big explosion with
fire<00:02:29.010> but<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.400> works<00:02:30.640> best<00:02:31.150> when<00:02:31.599> we<00:02:32.170> shoot<00:02:32.470> at

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
fire but it works best when we shoot at

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.210 
fire but it works best when we shoot at
the<00:02:32.739> wall<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.810> if<00:02:35.079> we<00:02:35.260> shoot<00:02:35.439> it<00:02:35.620> inside<00:02:36.040> this

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
the wall so if we shoot it inside this

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:44.160 
the wall so if we shoot it inside this
cave<00:02:36.519> for<00:02:36.849> example<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:42.430> is<00:02:42.670> going<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.569> create<00:02:44.109> a

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
cave for example it is going to create a

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.170 
cave for example it is going to create a
big<00:02:44.680> explosion

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.509 

now<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.239> expulsion<00:02:50.079> power<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:50.739> I<00:02:50.829> used<00:02:51.099> for

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
now the expulsion power that I used for

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.530 
now the expulsion power that I used for
this<00:02:51.849> hole<00:02:52.209> is<00:02:53.459> not<00:02:54.459> this<00:02:54.639> one<00:02:54.909> but<00:02:55.060> this<00:02:55.480> one

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
this hole is not this one but this one

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.360 
this hole is not this one but this one
it<00:02:56.260> is<00:02:56.909> 200<00:02:57.909> so<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:59.200> is<00:02:59.349> 10<00:02:59.799> times<00:03:00.010> stronger

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
it is 200 so that is 10 times stronger

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.629 
it is 200 so that is 10 times stronger
than<00:03:00.579> that<00:03:00.970> one<00:03:01.209> and<00:03:01.680> for<00:03:02.680> this<00:03:02.799> one<00:03:02.859> is<00:03:03.340> for

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.639 
than that one and for this one is for

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.539 
than that one and for this one is for
higher<00:03:03.879> than<00:03:04.120> 50<00:03:04.629> and<00:03:04.870> also<00:03:05.709> used<00:03:05.919> a<00:03:06.099> second

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
higher than 50 and also used a second

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.210
