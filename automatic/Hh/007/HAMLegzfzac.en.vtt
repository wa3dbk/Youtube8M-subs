00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.910
 all these numbers which 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.530
 in this project would not be able to be 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.030

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.130
 number 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.290
 which goes on the musical theme all 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.140
 movie from halftime mexico rub 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.520
 Well, well, it's probably the most 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.530
 remembered in the range of performance 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.530

 thank 

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:01.489
 they really have the strongest number 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:02.309
 the room 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:04.269
 in the original hire I managed 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.179
 get rid of the rags of anastasia immediately 

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:08.929
 so when she stayed in it 

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:10.629

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.489
 marine flowers as sung in that song under 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.409
 which guys are potential 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:18.489
 I want to express my hope that if 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:22.360
 will continue next year 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.110
 and again see these performers 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.370
 maybe in another combination all the same 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.370
 one of them would be boring lats 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.789
 today in all pairs of boars 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:36.779
 until russia 

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:39.779
 no starting stages 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.219
 absolutely right 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:43.809
 relatively skated 

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:46.809
 however awesome despite flying 

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:52.430
 I think that we have 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.900
 while work this amazing 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.219
 strip 

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:01.330
 many months every day 4 november 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.569
 then she tries to influence the stage 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:04.870
 of negotiations 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.870
 5 5 thousand 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.879
 power after you left the project 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:16.509
 particular went on the ice passing what 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:18.029
 i.e. cabinets 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:19.649
 to be honest as circumstances 

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:21.399
 It happened so much life was what 

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:24.289
 think about it 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.710
 after i went out on the ice of progress 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.490
 partners be laughing but if 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.449
 Today is the first time the third degree 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:34.020

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.509

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.480

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.520
 I just don't care 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.809
 it's hard for me to evaluate myself 

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:07.289
 does not perceive the whole program as a kind 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.249
 no offense competition like everyone 

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:11.629
