no one has ever seen but we have a good

no one has ever seen but we have a good
guess<00:01:08.689> the<00:01:09.689> eggs<00:01:09.900> go<00:01:10.200> through<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.619> opah

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
guess the eggs go through the opah

guess the eggs go through the opah
Duggal<00:01:11.159> glands<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.700> get<00:01:12.270> coated<00:01:12.689> with<00:01:12.810> a

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
Duggal glands and get coated with a

Duggal glands and get coated with a
protective<00:01:12.990> jelly<00:01:14.090> then<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.540> big<00:01:15.780> neo

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990

demented<00:01:16.350> lands<00:01:16.560> make<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> second<00:01:17.400> kind<00:01:17.610> of

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
demented lands make a second kind of

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.070 
demented lands make a second kind of
jelly<00:01:18.000> which<00:01:18.750> gets<00:01:19.049> mixed<00:01:19.350> with<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.770> eggs<00:01:20.040> and

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
jelly which gets mixed with the eggs and

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.499 
jelly which gets mixed with the eggs and
squirted<00:01:22.080> out<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.409> phone<00:01:22.939> now<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.000> eggs<00:01:24.299> are

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
squirted out the phone now the eggs are

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.030 
squirted out the phone now the eggs are
right<00:01:24.659> next<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.140> sperm<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.680> they<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:25.920> get

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
right next to the sperm so they can get

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.780 
right next to the sperm so they can get
fertilized

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
fertilized

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.520 
fertilized
and<00:01:27.030> finally<00:01:27.420> mom<00:01:27.630> lets<00:01:27.900> go<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.259> whole

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
and finally mom lets go of the whole

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.980 
and finally mom lets go of the whole
mass<00:01:28.790> then<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.970> jelly<00:01:30.270> reacts<00:01:30.750> with<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
mass then the jelly reacts with the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.340 
mass then the jelly reacts with the
seawater<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.590> starts<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.040> expand<00:01:32.780> it<00:01:33.780> expands

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
seawater and starts to expand it expands

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.929 
seawater and starts to expand it expands
and<00:01:35.869> expands<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.549> eventually<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.670> have<00:01:38.909> a

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
and expands and eventually we have a

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.420 
and expands and eventually we have a
gelatinous<00:01:39.240> matrix<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.350> size<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.860> car<00:01:41.130> and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
gelatinous matrix the size of a car and

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.249 
gelatinous matrix the size of a car and
it's<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.030> dilute<00:01:42.420> at<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.780> point<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.200> a

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
it's so dilute at this point that a

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
other so there's no crowding and

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.510 
other so there's no crowding and
everyone<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.540> breathe<00:01:54.920> how<00:01:55.920> many<00:01:56.130> eggs<00:01:56.340> are

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
everyone can breathe how many eggs are

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.969 
everyone can breathe how many eggs are
we<00:01:56.640> talking<00:01:57.030> about<00:01:57.299> well<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.140> one<00:01:58.500> Humboldt

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
we talking about well the one Humboldt

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.709 
we talking about well the one Humboldt
squid<00:01:59.100> egg<00:01:59.430> mass<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.790> we've<00:01:59.939> ever<00:02:00.119> seen<00:02:00.420> has

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
squid egg mass that we've ever seen has

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.450 
squid egg mass that we've ever seen has
somewhere<00:02:01.110> between<00:02:01.290> half<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.829> million<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.340> two

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
somewhere between half a million and two

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.450 
somewhere between half a million and two
million<00:02:02.880> eggs<00:02:03.210> in<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.570> all<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:04.829> them<00:02:04.979> from<00:02:05.219> one

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
million eggs in it all of them from one

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.499 
million eggs in it all of them from one
female<00:02:06.560> yeah<00:02:07.560> we<00:02:07.799> think<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.340> an<00:02:08.550> individual

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
female yeah we think so an individual

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.180 
female yeah we think so an individual
female<00:02:09.840> can<00:02:10.020> have<00:02:10.050> more<00:02:10.410> than<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.590> million<00:02:10.890> eggs

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
female can have more than a million eggs

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.090 
female can have more than a million eggs
ripe<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.730> ready<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.000> go<00:02:12.239> in<00:02:12.450> her<00:02:12.569> oviducts

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
ripe and ready to go in her oviducts

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.070 
ripe and ready to go in her oviducts
as<00:02:14.190> for<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.460> ovary<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:15.150> can<00:02:15.420> contain<00:02:15.780> millions

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
as for the ovary it can contain millions

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.680 
as for the ovary it can contain millions
more<00:02:16.590> unripe<00:02:17.130> eggs<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.940> one<00:02:18.150> mom<00:02:18.360> could<00:02:18.660> make

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
more unripe eggs so one mom could make

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.070 
more unripe eggs so one mom could make
quite<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.170> few<00:02:19.530> egg<00:02:19.740> masses<00:02:20.450> if<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.660> ocean<00:02:21.960> is

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
quite a few egg masses if the ocean is

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.410 
quite a few egg masses if the ocean is
full<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.530> egg<00:02:22.710> masses<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.310> squid<00:02:23.610> babies<00:02:23.790> why

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
full of egg masses and squid babies why

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.540 
full of egg masses and squid babies why
don't<00:02:24.600> we<00:02:24.690> see<00:02:24.870> them<00:02:25.050> more<00:02:25.080> often<00:02:25.500> because<00:02:26.250> the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
don't we see them more often because the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.080 
don't we see them more often because the
egg<00:02:26.700> masses<00:02:27.000> are<00:02:27.420> transient<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:29.090> transparent

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
egg masses are transient and transparent

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.270 
egg masses are transient and transparent
which<00:02:30.750> makes<00:02:31.020> it<00:02:31.170> really<00:02:31.200> unlikely<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.220> a

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
which makes it really unlikely that a

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.060 
which makes it really unlikely that a
diver<00:02:32.580> will<00:02:32.910> stumble<00:02:33.120> across<00:02:33.330> one<00:02:33.570> and

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
diver will stumble across one and

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.770 
diver will stumble across one and
they're<00:02:35.070> too<00:02:35.250> deep<00:02:35.460> underwater<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:36.300> spot<00:02:36.540> from

they're too deep underwater to spot from
