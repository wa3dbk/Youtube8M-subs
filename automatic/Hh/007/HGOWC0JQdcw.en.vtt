00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
mode gun as you guys know i transferred

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.950 
mode gun as you guys know i transferred
over<00:00:59.370> back<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.969> xbox<00:01:00.390> for<00:01:00.600> black<00:01:00.780> ops

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
over back to the xbox for black ops

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.020 
over back to the xbox for black ops
because<00:01:01.410> i<00:01:01.770> was<00:01:02.280> having<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.520> really<00:01:02.670> hard<00:01:02.789> time

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
because i was having a really hard time

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.140 
because i was having a really hard time
I<00:01:03.210> switched<00:01:03.629> 15<00:01:04.140> sensitivity<00:01:04.890> 201<00:01:05.549> because<00:01:06.030> I

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
I switched 15 sensitivity 201 because I

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.789 
I switched 15 sensitivity 201 because I
wasn't<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.479> control<00:01:06.720> my<00:01:07.110> own<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.470> whatsoever

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
wasn't in control my own in whatsoever

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.980 
wasn't in control my own in whatsoever
and<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:09.060> know<00:01:09.180> switching<00:01:09.600> from<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.810> 520<00:01:10.590> one<00:01:10.950> is

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
and you know switching from a 520 one is

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.929 
and you know switching from a 520 one is
right<00:01:12.990> there<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> big<00:01:13.770> gap<00:01:13.799> between<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.790> two

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
right there is a big gap between the two

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.380 
right there is a big gap between the two
sensitivities<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:16.040> you<00:01:17.040> know<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.369> mean<00:01:18.060> I'm

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
sensitivities and you know I mean I'm

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.520 
sensitivities and you know I mean I'm
pretty<00:01:18.659> used<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.900> now<00:01:18.990> I've<00:01:19.350> actually

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
pretty used to it now I've actually

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.770 
pretty used to it now I've actually
settled<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.310> turned<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.270> about<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> to

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
settled and turned to about a to

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.230 
settled and turned to about a to
sensitivity<00:01:22.290> for<00:01:22.680> right<00:01:23.369> now<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.820> I'm<00:01:24.000> pretty

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
sensitivity for right now and I'm pretty

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.890 
sensitivity for right now and I'm pretty
comfortable<00:01:24.420> with<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.790> you<00:01:26.790> know<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.270> feel

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
comfortable with it and you know I feel

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.050 
comfortable with it and you know I feel
like<00:01:28.049> sensitivity<00:01:28.799> from<00:01:29.009> black<00:01:29.340> ops<00:01:29.579> 2<00:01:29.790> modern

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
like sensitivity from black ops 2 modern

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.600 
like sensitivity from black ops 2 modern
143<00:01:30.570> definitely<00:01:30.990> changed<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.470> lot<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.890> usually

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
143 definitely changed a lot I usually

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.789 
143 definitely changed a lot I usually
run<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.790> 3<00:01:33.150> sensitivity<00:01:33.750> model<00:01:34.049> for<00:01:34.200> three<00:01:34.530> and

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
run a 3 sensitivity model for three and

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.190 
run a 3 sensitivity model for three and
I<00:01:35.490> can't<00:01:35.759> seem<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.030> get<00:01:36.119> any<00:01:36.299> higher<00:01:36.600> there<00:01:36.930> too

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
I can't seem to get any higher there too

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.440 
I can't seem to get any higher there too
in<00:01:37.500> black<00:01:38.009> ops<00:01:38.250> i<00:01:38.490> was<00:01:38.610> even<00:01:38.729> running<00:01:39.000> over<00:01:39.240> one

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
in black ops i was even running over one

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.640 
in black ops i was even running over one
for<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> while

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
for a while

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.040 
for a while
ever<00:01:40.740> do<00:01:40.980> but<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.730> actually<00:01:41.910> had<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.300> get<00:01:42.780> my<00:01:42.900> aim

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
ever do but I actually had to get my aim

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.450 
ever do but I actually had to get my aim
was<00:01:43.080> that<00:01:43.440> for<00:01:43.800> so<00:01:45.680> yeah<00:01:46.680> I'm<00:01:46.920> not<00:01:47.100> sure<00:01:47.250> if<00:01:47.370> so

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
was that for so yeah I'm not sure if so

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.380 
was that for so yeah I'm not sure if so
actually<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.970> difference<00:01:48.300> between

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
actually the difference between

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.240 
actually the difference between
sensitivities<00:01:49.230> between<00:01:49.440> the<00:01:49.560> two<00:01:49.710> games<00:01:49.920> but

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
sensitivities between the two games but

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.760 
sensitivities between the two games but
they're<00:01:50.490> definitely<00:01:51.000> feels<00:01:51.420> like<00:01:51.690> it<00:01:51.870> and<00:01:52.020> I

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
they're definitely feels like it and I

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.650 
they're definitely feels like it and I
just<00:01:52.920> cannot<00:01:53.280> use<00:01:53.580> it<00:01:53.730> insensitive<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.510> this

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
just cannot use it insensitive in this

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.960 
just cannot use it insensitive in this
game<00:01:54.840> for<00:01:54.960> some<00:01:55.140> reason<00:01:55.460> man<00:01:56.460> do<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.640> makes<00:01:56.880> me
