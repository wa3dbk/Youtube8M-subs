00:00:00.093 --> 00:00:04.491
 The construction of the medieval manuscript 

00:00:06.514 --> 00:00:11.533
 For over a thousand years, all books have been written and illustrated by hand. 

00:00:13.262 --> 00:00:20.274
 In the Middle Ages, books were made by taking a sheet of parchment, folding in half 

00:00:20.492 --> 00:00:25.548
 and then other sheets were inserted in the same way until the components formed. 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:33.617
 They found themselves side by side at the back of the book, and the entire contents of the book were protected by boards. 

00:00:34.207 --> 00:00:37.953
 Looking at the back of the book, we see its structure. 

00:00:37.953 --> 00:00:42.069
 The component mostly consists of several sheets of folded parchment. 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.704
 Folded sheet of parchment is called double sheet, Latin bifolium. 

00:00:46.704 --> 00:00:50.147
 The party is Latin folio. 

00:00:50.357 --> 00:00:53.450
 Each page has its own number 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.095
 which refers to the front or back, Latin recto and verso. 

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:03.479
 When the book is folded, the pages are behind. 

00:01:03.856 --> 00:01:09.691
 As a good example, the following story, illustrated in one folder, will serve us. 

00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:15.237
 The story begins with St. Catherine, one of the first Christians. 

00:01:15.477 --> 00:01:21.181
 She continues her ability to bring others to faith, annoying the Roman emperor. 

00:01:22.131 --> 00:01:25.436
 Catherine's tortured, but she survives. 

00:01:26.476 --> 00:01:32.197
 The story ends with the torture of Catherine. Her body is taken away by angels on Mount Sinai. 

00:01:33.083 --> 00:01:37.596
 If the book isn't bound, the sheets look messy. 

00:01:40.031 --> 00:01:45.286
 Here you can see that the first and last illustrations are painted on one piece of parchment. 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:55.010
 The book's structure is a sophisticated invention that remains essentially the same to this day.
