to<00:00:04.299> access<00:00:04.509> the<00:00:04.840> hop-up<00:00:05.080> is<00:00:05.410> this<00:00:06.069> lever<00:00:06.310> right

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:06.519 
to access the hop-up is this lever right

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:09.510 
to access the hop-up is this lever right
here<00:00:06.580> it's<00:00:07.000> silver<00:00:07.830> basically<00:00:08.830> you<00:00:08.980> push<00:00:09.340> it

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:09.520 
here it's silver basically you push it

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.520 
here it's silver basically you push it
back<00:00:09.820> for<00:00:10.180> more<00:00:10.330> hop<00:00:10.540> up<00:00:10.750> and<00:00:10.870> push<00:00:11.110> it<00:00:11.230> forward

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.530 
back for more hop up and push it forward

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.339 
back for more hop up and push it forward
for<00:00:11.950> less<00:00:12.130> hop<00:00:12.340> up<00:00:12.550> it<00:00:13.450> is<00:00:13.570> a<00:00:13.599> little<00:00:13.840> stiff<00:00:14.049> but

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:14.349 
for less hop up it is a little stiff but

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.429 
for less hop up it is a little stiff but
you<00:00:14.830> can<00:00:15.040> it<00:00:15.309> it<00:00:16.270> will<00:00:16.570> stay<00:00:16.840> in<00:00:16.869> place<00:00:16.990> ain't

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
you can it it will stay in place ain't

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.409 
you can it it will stay in place ain't
this<00:00:17.529> thing<00:00:17.710> is<00:00:17.830> you<00:00:18.099> can<00:00:18.279> jump<00:00:19.000> this<00:00:19.150> around

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:19.419 
this thing is you can jump this around

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.689 
this thing is you can jump this around
and<00:00:19.660> a<00:00:19.779> lot<00:00:20.199> drop<00:00:20.470> it<00:00:20.650> wouldn't<00:00:21.250> change<00:00:21.400> at<00:00:21.609> all

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:21.699 
and a lot drop it wouldn't change at all

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.090 
and a lot drop it wouldn't change at all
the<00:00:22.180> hop<00:00:22.330> up<00:00:22.510> on<00:00:22.630> this<00:00:22.750> is<00:00:22.900> very<00:00:23.320> good<00:00:23.619> I<00:00:23.830> have

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 
the hop up on this is very good I have

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.630 
the hop up on this is very good I have
found<00:00:24.279> that<00:00:24.539> with<00:00:25.539> i<00:00:26.050> use<00:00:26.650> threes<00:00:27.220> with<00:00:27.460> this

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
found that with i use threes with this

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.599 
found that with i use threes with this
but<00:00:28.060> with<00:00:28.630> two<00:00:28.840> fives<00:00:29.109> as<00:00:29.349> well<00:00:29.529> pop<00:00:29.890> up<00:00:30.130> it

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
but with two fives as well pop up it

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.689 
but with two fives as well pop up it
this<00:00:31.390> thing<00:00:31.630> goes<00:00:31.810> a<00:00:32.590> whole<00:00:33.160> lot<00:00:33.400> farther<00:00:33.580> than

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:33.699 
this thing goes a whole lot farther than

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.539 
this thing goes a whole lot farther than
I<00:00:33.910> m16<00:00:34.480> does<00:00:34.690> mainly<00:00:35.620> because<00:00:35.650> of<00:00:35.890> the<00:00:36.129> barrel

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:36.549 
I m16 does mainly because of the barrel

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:40.530 
I m16 does mainly because of the barrel
barrels<00:00:37.000> is<00:00:37.150> a<00:00:37.180> whole<00:00:37.449> lot<00:00:37.600> longer<00:00:37.780> but<00:00:39.540> also

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
barrels is a whole lot longer but also

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.590 
barrels is a whole lot longer but also
just<00:00:41.159> because<00:00:42.159> the<00:00:42.460> hop<00:00:42.640> up<00:00:42.850> it's<00:00:43.299> a<00:00:43.449> different

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
just because the hop up it's a different

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.299 
just because the hop up it's a different
type<00:00:43.839> of<00:00:43.900> hop<00:00:44.110> up<00:00:44.320> and<00:00:44.440> this<00:00:44.890> thing<00:00:45.159> goes

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
type of hop up and this thing goes

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.719 
type of hop up and this thing goes
really<00:00:45.879> far<00:00:46.120> I<00:00:46.330> definitely<00:00:47.250> would<00:00:48.250> say<00:00:48.460> that

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:48.729 
really far I definitely would say that

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:53.100 
really far I definitely would say that
goes<00:00:48.850> past<00:00:49.089> 250<00:00:49.989> feet<00:00:50.350> I<00:00:50.619> mean<00:00:51.190> I<00:00:51.519> probably<00:00:52.360> i'm

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
will say that this inside just like with

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.650 
will say that this inside just like with
the<00:01:17.230> 1911<00:01:17.860> there<00:01:18.730> is<00:01:18.940> some<00:01:19.180> sort<00:01:19.390> of<00:01:19.420> black

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
the 1911 there is some sort of black

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.890 
the 1911 there is some sort of black
grease<00:01:20.080> inside<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:21.220> bulb<00:01:21.430> housing<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:23.430> it's

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
grease inside the bulb housing and it's

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.600 
grease inside the bulb housing and it's
whatever<00:01:25.900> you<00:01:26.020> loom<00:01:26.230> it<00:01:26.380> sound<00:01:27.160> like<00:01:27.250> dirt

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
whatever you loom it sound like dirt

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.850 
whatever you loom it sound like dirt
pretty<00:01:28.180> much<00:01:28.360> so<00:01:28.600> when<00:01:28.750> you<00:01:28.900> cock<00:01:29.620> the<00:01:29.650> gun

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
pretty much so when you cock the gun

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.240 
pretty much so when you cock the gun
they<00:01:30.610> get<00:01:31.150> some<00:01:31.420> of<00:01:31.510> that<00:01:31.540> off<00:01:31.660> and<00:01:32.200> it<00:01:32.920> doesn't

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
they get some of that off and it doesn't

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.380 
they get some of that off and it doesn't
always<00:01:33.340> happen<00:01:33.580> but<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:33.880> lot<00:01:34.000> of<00:01:34.030> times<00:01:34.240> you'll

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
always happen but a lot of times you'll

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.320 
always happen but a lot of times you'll
see<00:01:34.420> black<00:01:34.840> rings<00:01:35.680> and<00:01:36.070> stuff<00:01:36.550> like<00:01:36.730> that<00:01:36.790> from

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
see black rings and stuff like that from

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.320 
see black rings and stuff like that from
the<00:01:37.690> gun<00:01:37.870> and<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:42.159> I<00:01:42.190> mean<00:01:42.400> it<00:01:42.880> wipes<00:01:43.150> right<00:01:43.270> off

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
the gun and so I mean it wipes right off

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.350 
the gun and so I mean it wipes right off
just<00:01:43.630> like<00:01:43.659> w.e<00:01:44.409> but<00:01:45.040> it's<00:01:45.580> it's<00:01:45.970> all<00:01:46.120> going

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
just like w.e but it's it's all going

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.380 
just like w.e but it's it's all going
and<00:01:46.479> this<00:01:46.630> is<00:01:46.780> also<00:01:46.930> really<00:01:47.710> really<00:01:48.040> shine<00:01:48.820> the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
and this is also really really shine the

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.230 
and this is also really really shine the
bolt<00:01:49.630> is<00:01:49.930> very<00:01:50.320> shiny<00:01:50.560> young<00:01:50.830> it<00:01:51.580> don't<00:01:52.030> won't

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
bolt is very shiny young it don't won't

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.810 
bolt is very shiny young it don't won't
matter<00:01:52.360> too<00:01:52.630> much<00:01:52.659> because<00:01:53.590> if<00:01:54.460> you're<00:01:54.700> going

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
matter too much because if you're going

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.550 
matter too much because if you're going
to<00:01:54.880> paint<00:01:55.060> it<00:01:55.300> you<00:01:55.720> will<00:01:55.870> you<00:01:56.050> brush<00:01:56.380> it<00:01:56.409> and

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
to paint it you will you brush it and

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.100 
to paint it you will you brush it and
think<00:01:56.770> that<00:01:56.950> but<00:01:57.210> if<00:01:58.210> you<00:01:58.450> have<00:01:58.540> a<00:01:58.600> rifle<00:01:58.960> rack

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
think that but if you have a rifle rack

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.840 
think that but if you have a rifle rack
that's<00:01:59.350> another<00:01:59.650> good<00:01:59.860> idea<00:01:59.979> to<00:02:00.760> cover<00:02:01.000> that<00:02:01.240> a

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
that's another good idea to cover that a

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.330 
that's another good idea to cover that a
lot<00:02:03.850> of<00:02:03.880> times<00:02:04.120> I<00:02:04.360> mean<00:02:04.540> this<00:02:05.110> is<00:02:05.170> never<00:02:05.470> really

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
lot of times I mean this is never really
