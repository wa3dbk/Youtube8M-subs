00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
 hello it's nicolas 16 so 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.190
 today I am going to present to you 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.059
 how to put a password of a 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:14.370
 samsung galaxy s advent so served or 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:16.379
 even with gaxie s1 s2 s3 sncf rating so 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.240
 in fact it's very simple then you 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.710
 go to settings applications 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.170
 location and security so there you 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.570
 scroll seven aip in the screens set 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.970
 lock so to you have no so 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.070
 give pin code model your two passes 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.870
 so we will still start with a 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.399
 model so there's actually the thing it's 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.260
 that you have to draw a model 1 like 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.649
 so it says something like 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:46.020
 that's how I do not do that 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.760
 find more make a feature 1 el khor 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.710
 near you do continue see you 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.770
 made for security issues 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.579
 ok so after if you lock your 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.059
 samsung support you where there well then it 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.949
 to give you that dogou done at the trail 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.640
 so very important is that it takes 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.960
 well do it in that sense because if 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.210
 you do in this sense it is only that 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.610
 is still wrong because 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.010
 in fact we had drawn like that and not 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.710
 like that that causes boyer arrows that 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.350
 clash here so that's what you saw 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.700
 after if you disable so you are 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.509
 here you have in the app 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:30.150
 settings the near unified security has it 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.119
 so to you must do them to put 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.020
 no Moroccan 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.189
 now we will show you with the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.409
 pin code word 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.549
 so in fact there I found enough con the 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.860
 first time I saw is that he 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.020
 have to put that your pin code of 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.000
 samsung 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.680
 so normally you do not need to 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.540
 do that so there you put your 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.290
 girlfriend but if you ever are not 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.630
 obliged cd you do password and there 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.869
 you have all of which you can put 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:03.960
 in copy or you want by 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:07.320
 example do h 01 really to put 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.770
 more than four to the m 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:16.870
 2 3 and 4 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:19.480
 yes continue borg the password of 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:28.050
 continuo baulois so you see you 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:28.050
 in one language you show 3.4 n 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.280
 this time it's good 2 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:51.720
 ok so after if you would see you you 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:52.230
 find it so so cuckold and we'll get 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.970
 untangle 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.670
 so here is after all simple for 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.870
 unlock you flip the retape 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:05.489
 and your password 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.140
 but it does not make you any 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.030
 simply 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.030
 thank you and goodbye
