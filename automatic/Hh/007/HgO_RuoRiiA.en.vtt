00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
just going to point something how is

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.090 
just going to point something how is
that<00:05:07.130> took<00:05:08.130> us<00:05:08.280> a<00:05:08.310> few<00:05:08.550> days<00:05:08.669> to<00:05:09.060> figure<00:05:09.720> out

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
that took us a few days to figure out

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.810 
that took us a few days to figure out
the<00:05:11.100> doors<00:05:11.310> like<00:05:11.490> to<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:13.100> material<00:05:14.100> don't

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
the doors like to the material don't

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.590 
the doors like to the material don't
close<00:05:15.390> so<00:05:16.020> that<00:05:16.320> could<00:05:16.830> be<00:05:16.979> a<00:05:17.190> hazard<00:05:17.490> but<00:05:18.000> it's

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
close so that could be a hazard but it's

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.580 
close so that could be a hazard but it's
not<00:05:18.870> actually<00:05:19.350> because<00:05:20.000> they<00:05:21.000> push<00:05:21.270> in

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.800 

so<00:05:25.590> hopefully<00:05:26.580> you're<00:05:27.060> slightly<00:05:27.449> smarter

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
so hopefully you're slightly smarter

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.469 
so hopefully you're slightly smarter
than<00:05:28.110> I<00:05:28.229> don't<00:05:29.069> take<00:05:29.310> five<00:05:29.669> days<00:05:29.849> to<00:05:29.910> figure<00:05:30.240> it

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
than I don't take five days to figure it

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:35.210 
than I don't take five days to figure it
out<00:05:31.370> but<00:05:32.370> they<00:05:32.520> do<00:05:32.580> push<00:05:32.849> it<00:05:33.289> the<00:05:34.289> cable<00:05:34.470> the<00:05:34.949> TV

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
out but they do push it the cable the TV

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.100 
out but they do push it the cable the TV
