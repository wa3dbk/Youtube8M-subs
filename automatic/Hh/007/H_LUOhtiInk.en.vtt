the trend which is little knob I'm

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:36.639 
the trend which is little knob I'm
nothing<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.849> see<00:00:30.859> I'm<00:00:31.859> not<00:00:32.099> right<00:00:33.200> Yeah<00:00:35.630> right

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
here it basically be pointed towards the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.959 
here it basically be pointed towards the
teeth<00:00:43.010> but<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.160> way<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.489> can<00:00:44.610> find<00:00:44.879> that

teeth but the way that you can find that

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.900 
teeth but the way that you can find that
out<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.629> take<00:00:46.320> your<00:00:46.350> plane<00:00:47.420> I<00:00:49.820> don't<00:00:50.820> know

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
out and take your plane I don't know

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.430 
out and take your plane I don't know
what<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.180> called<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:51.680> take<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.829> plane<00:00:54.440> flip

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
what it's called but take the plane flip

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.330 
what it's called but take the plane flip
it<00:00:55.559> on

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:14.240 

and<00:00:59.910> get<00:01:00.060> your<00:01:00.210> mouth<00:01:02.630> turn<00:01:03.630> that<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:13.250> if

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
your trend is awesome and it's going to

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.400 
your trend is awesome and it's going to
sound<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:17.850> one<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.330> going<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.660> the<00:01:18.869> right<00:01:19.080> a

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.310 
the trend but i'm just going to see the
turning<00:01:25.830> piece<00:01:26.300> someone<00:01:27.300> make<00:01:27.510> that<00:01:28.140> like

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
turning piece someone make that like

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.980 
turning piece someone make that like
that<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:29.220> gonna<00:01:30.830> see<00:01:31.830> it<00:01:32.130> sounds<00:01:32.820> like<00:01:32.990> first

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
then we're going at different speeds and

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.540 
then we're going at different speeds and
that's<00:01:36.119> what<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.390> trailer<00:01:36.660> sound<00:01:37.050> like<00:01:37.280> so

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.100 

that's<00:01:41.550> just<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.880> way<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.030> do<00:01:42.300> it<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.690> whenever

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
that's just a way to do it and whenever

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.820 
that's just a way to do it and whenever
you're<00:01:43.350> flying<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:44.750> if<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:46.050> want<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.619> sort

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
you're flying it if you want it to sort

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:54.080 
you're flying it if you want it to sort
of<00:01:46.950> fly<00:01:47.130> load<00:01:47.460> just<00:01:47.790> barely<00:01:48.149> put<00:01:49.080> it<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:53.090> my

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
of fly load just barely put it on my

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.350 
of fly load just barely put it on my
plane<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.539> an<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.170> receiver<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:56.250> don't<00:01:56.729> know<00:01:56.940> what

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
plane is an a receiver I don't know what

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.410 
plane is an a receiver I don't know what
everybody<00:01:57.899> else<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:59.100> its<00:01:59.280> lines<00:01:59.550> of<00:01:59.789> hey<00:01:59.970> um

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
everybody else is so its lines of hey um

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.330 
everybody else is so its lines of hey um
this<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.600> remote<00:02:04.080> it's<00:02:04.440> pretty<00:02:04.920> cool<00:02:05.630> um<00:02:07.100> it<00:02:08.100> is

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
this is remote it's pretty cool um it is

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.219 
this is remote it's pretty cool um it is
a<00:02:08.369> pretty<00:02:08.700> good<00:02:08.910> plane<00:02:09.149> overall<00:02:09.690> i'll<00:02:09.929> give<00:02:10.200> it

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
a pretty good plane overall i'll give it

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.870 
a pretty good plane overall i'll give it
a<00:02:10.610> seven<00:02:11.610> maybe<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.600> nine<00:02:13.020> out<00:02:13.350> of<00:02:13.380> 10<00:02:13.650> stars

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.580 

mostly<00:02:17.880> because<00:02:18.060> i<00:02:18.599> mean<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:18.930> isn't<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.440> best

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
mostly because i mean it isn't the best

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.550 
mostly because i mean it isn't the best
in<00:02:19.830> steering<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:21.480> it's<00:02:21.720> not<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.050> best<00:02:22.290> in<00:02:22.500> a

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
in steering and it's not the best in a

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.199 
in steering and it's not the best in a
windy<00:02:22.920> on<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.280> windy<00:02:23.880> day<00:02:23.910> but<00:02:25.459> you<00:02:26.459> can<00:02:26.790> watch

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
windy on a windy day but you can watch

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.030 
windy on a windy day but you can watch
this<00:02:27.390> up<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.690> train<00:02:27.959> you're<00:02:28.530> pretty<00:02:28.830> good

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
this up the train you're pretty good

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.740 
this up the train you're pretty good
with<00:02:29.099> searing<00:02:29.910> himself<00:02:30.530> but<00:02:32.360> mainly<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:33.720> is

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
with searing himself but mainly it is

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.570 
with searing himself but mainly it is
pretty<00:02:34.200> good<00:02:34.349> plane<00:02:35.209> but<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:38.400> way<00:02:38.520> the

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
pretty good plane but and the way the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.960 
pretty good plane but and the way the
charges<00:02:39.209> you<00:02:39.450> have<00:02:39.599> this<00:02:40.580> this<00:02:41.580> little<00:02:41.730> piece

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
charges you have this this little piece

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:50.340 
charges you have this this little piece
right<00:02:42.120> here<00:02:44.390> little<00:02:45.390> piece<00:02:45.540> right<00:02:45.690> there

and see them to bottom of the plane just

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.940 
and see them to bottom of the plane just
switch<00:03:23.300> it<00:03:23.330> on<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:24.610> there<00:03:25.610> should<00:03:25.790> be<00:03:25.910> a<00:03:26.950> red

it been this little box and messed up

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:01.410 
it been this little box and messed up
whenever<00:03:56.410> 00<00:03:58.720> lot

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
whenever 00 lot

whenever 00 lot
alright<00:04:02.170> so<00:04:02.760> so<00:04:03.760> you<00:04:04.360> can<00:04:04.599> put<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.560> charging

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
alright so so you can put the charging

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.479 
alright so so you can put the charging
cord<00:04:06.790> oh<00:04:09.630> well<00:04:10.709> charging<00:04:11.709> cords<00:04:12.040> you've<00:04:12.130> used

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
cord oh well charging cords you've used

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:20.879 
cord oh well charging cords you've used
up<00:04:12.870> this<00:04:14.970> in<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:18.430> riddle<00:04:19.090> box<00:04:19.650> once<00:04:20.650> you're

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
up this in to the riddle box once you're

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.750 
up this in to the riddle box once you're
done<00:04:21.210> and<00:04:22.210> then<00:04:22.419> you<00:04:22.600> can<00:04:22.750> just<00:04:22.900> close<00:04:23.230> it<00:04:23.760> and

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
done and then you can just close it and

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.879 
done and then you can just close it and
that's<00:04:25.210> pretty<00:04:25.450> much<00:04:25.540> it<00:04:25.780> then<00:04:26.350> they<00:04:26.710> also

that's pretty much it then they also

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.290 
that's pretty much it then they also
added<00:04:27.160> a<00:04:27.400> hole<00:04:27.810> for<00:04:28.810> its<00:04:29.020> going<00:04:29.230> and<00:04:29.919> then<00:04:30.790> you

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
added a hole for its going and then you

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.420 
added a hole for its going and then you
also<00:04:31.480> have<00:04:31.720> a<00:04:33.210> I'll<00:04:34.210> take<00:04:34.600> this<00:04:34.780> is<00:04:34.960> a<00:04:34.990> pretty

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
also have a I'll take this is a pretty

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.820 
also have a I'll take this is a pretty
ok<00:04:36.430> antenna<00:04:37.020> what<00:04:38.020> it<00:04:38.139> is<00:04:38.290> is<00:04:38.500> pretty<00:04:38.650> good

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
ok antenna what it is is pretty good

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.040 
ok antenna what it is is pretty good
enough<00:04:41.160> there's<00:04:42.160> pretty<00:04:42.610> far<00:04:42.820> so<00:04:43.479> the<00:04:43.720> plane

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
enough there's pretty far so the plane

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:51.150 
enough there's pretty far so the plane
can<00:04:44.080> obviously<00:04:44.470> go<00:04:44.830> high<00:04:49.620> three<00:04:50.620> weaving<00:04:51.010> too

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
can obviously go high three weaving too

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.150 
can obviously go high three weaving too
I<00:04:51.490> mean<00:04:52.030> I<00:04:52.090> have<00:04:52.270> one<00:04:52.479> way<00:04:52.810> bigger<00:04:53.169> but<00:04:53.500> it's<00:04:53.860> so

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
just say that this is good plane overall

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.180 
just say that this is good plane overall
and<00:05:09.870> i'll<00:05:10.870> get<00:05:11.169> it<00:05:11.289> before<00:05:11.440> you<00:05:11.620> i<00:05:11.800> would
