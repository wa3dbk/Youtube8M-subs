00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.369 
I don't know how much help that has if I
just<00:01:03.000> AM<00:01:03.180> wailing<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> whole<00:01:03.930> bunch<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.229> moms

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
just AM wailing on a whole bunch of moms

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.810 
just AM wailing on a whole bunch of moms
I<00:01:04.530> don't<00:01:04.680> want<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.860> mouse<00:01:04.949> over<00:01:05.129> each<00:01:05.280> one<00:01:05.369> so

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
I don't want to mouse over each one so

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.609 
I don't want to mouse over each one so
you<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:06.270> change<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.720> few<00:01:06.869> settings<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.409> can

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
you can change a few settings so you can

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.469 
you can change a few settings so you can
see<00:01:07.890> exactly<00:01:08.460> what's<00:01:08.820> going<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> game

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
see exactly what's going on in the game

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.149 
see exactly what's going on in the game
and<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:09.990> think<00:01:10.200> it's<00:01:10.320> crucial<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.950> do

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
and I think it's crucial that you do

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.700 
and I think it's crucial that you do
this<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.610> you'll<00:01:12.330> hit<00:01:12.510> escape<00:01:12.780> go<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.229> options

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
this so you'll hit escape go to options

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.730 
this so you'll hit escape go to options
and<00:01:13.920> go<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.250> gameplay<00:01:15.290> so<00:01:16.290> what<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.530> first

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
and go to gameplay so what you first

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.800 
and go to gameplay so what you first
want<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.979> turn<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.280> display<00:01:18.119> monster<00:01:18.630> health

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
want to turn on display monster health

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.630 
want to turn on display monster health
bar<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.229> what<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.500> allows<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.040> do<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.580> to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
bar so what this allows you to do is to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.429 
bar so what this allows you to do is to
see<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.180> health<00:01:21.509> bar<00:01:21.720> instead<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.259> having<00:01:22.380> to

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
see the health bar instead of having to

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.929 
see the health bar instead of having to
mouse<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.710> over<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.009> now<00:01:23.130> all<00:01:23.189> enemies<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:23.909> the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
mouse it over so now all enemies on the

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.030 
mouse it over so now all enemies on the
screen<00:01:24.119> will<00:01:24.450> have<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.600> little<00:01:24.780> health<00:01:24.960> bar<00:01:25.170> so

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
screen will have a little health bar so

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.640 
screen will have a little health bar so
now<00:01:26.250> see<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.640> health<00:01:27.049> but<00:01:28.049> how<00:01:28.140> much<00:01:28.290> help<00:01:28.470> do

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
now see the health but how much help do

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.260 
now see the health but how much help do
they<00:01:28.770> have<00:01:28.950> how<00:01:29.250> much<00:01:29.400> damage<00:01:29.579> did<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:30.060> do<00:01:30.119> to

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
they have how much damage did I do to

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.480 
they have how much damage did I do to

you<00:01:53.040> need<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.189> change<00:01:53.460> before<00:01:54.210> we<00:01:54.390> start

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
you need to change before we start

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.300 
you need to change before we start
getting<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.960> few<00:01:55.110> others<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.920> item

before<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.899> disappears<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.530> then<00:02:04.680> you'll

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
before it disappears and then you'll

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.740

three the other skills I had looked at
earlier<00:02:43.819> well<00:02:44.819> they<00:02:45.359> tell<00:02:45.599> me<00:02:45.689> a<00:02:45.720> little<00:02:45.840> bit

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
earlier well they tell me a little bit

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.869 
earlier well they tell me a little bit
more<00:02:46.200> does<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.590> in<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.739> straight<00:02:47.010> line<00:02:47.040> for<00:02:47.459> 25

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
more does it in a straight line for 25

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.030 
more does it in a straight line for 25
yards<00:02:48.120> after<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.599> third<00:02:48.840> hit<00:02:49.109> this<00:02:49.620> one<00:02:49.859> does<00:02:50.010> a

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
yards after a third hit this one does a

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.099 
yards after a third hit this one does a
few<00:02:50.280> other<00:02:50.430> things<00:02:50.540> pretty<00:02:51.540> exciting<00:02:52.019> it

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
few other things pretty exciting it

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.569 
few other things pretty exciting it
tells<00:02:52.290> exactly<00:02:52.530> what<00:02:53.099> you're<00:02:53.220> going<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.400> do

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
and I think this is crucial that you

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.490 
and I think this is crucial that you
know<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.099> help<00:02:56.489> maximize<00:02:57.120> your<00:02:57.239> character<00:02:57.719> the

last thing is important that i want to
change<00:03:01.200> is<00:03:01.469> important<00:03:01.950> character

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
change is important character

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.490
