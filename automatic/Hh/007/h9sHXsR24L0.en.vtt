00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:22.790 
through it just go to exactly the place

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.179 
through it just go to exactly the place
I<00:00:22.970> show<00:00:23.210> you<00:00:23.270> on<00:00:23.570> each<00:00:23.750> location<00:00:24.410> it's<00:00:24.890> really

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
I show you on each location it's really

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.010 
I show you on each location it's really
easy<00:00:25.369> for<00:00:25.520> wreckages<00:00:26.180> for<00:00:26.449> treasure<00:00:26.690> chests

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
easy for wreckages for treasure chests

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.480 
easy for wreckages for treasure chests
it's<00:00:27.170> a<00:00:27.230> little<00:00:27.470> bit<00:00:27.560> harder<00:00:27.949> so<00:00:27.980> the<00:00:28.250> first

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
it's a little bit harder so the first

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.130 
it's a little bit harder so the first
thing<00:00:28.699> that<00:00:28.850> I<00:00:28.880> show<00:00:29.090> you<00:00:29.119> is<00:00:29.510> the<00:00:29.930> map

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
thing that I show you is the map

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.870 
thing that I show you is the map
location<00:00:30.830> and<00:00:30.980> then<00:00:31.070> the<00:00:31.160> second<00:00:31.520> thing<00:00:31.670> is

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
location and then the second thing is

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.520 
location and then the second thing is
the<00:00:32.090> location<00:00:32.629> of<00:00:32.809> the<00:00:32.960> treasure<00:00:33.140> chest

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
the location of the treasure chest

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.320 
the location of the treasure chest
itself<00:00:34.100> so<00:00:34.340> you<00:00:34.430> just<00:00:34.550> need<00:00:34.699> to<00:00:34.760> go<00:00:34.940> there<00:00:35.180> and
