felt<00:02:47.580> like<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.850> saw<00:02:48.030> earlier<00:02:48.320> you<00:02:49.320> guys

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
felt like you saw earlier you guys

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.930 
felt like you saw earlier you guys
hadn't<00:02:49.710> seen<00:02:49.800> that<00:02:49.830> video<00:02:50.160> but<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.460> you<00:02:50.820> only

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
hadn't seen that video but the you only

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.610 
hadn't seen that video but the you only
need<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.150> see<00:02:51.330> it<00:02:51.420> now<00:02:51.540> but<00:02:51.750> anyway<00:02:51.990> eighty<00:02:52.440> HD

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
need to see it now but anyway eighty HD

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.710 
need to see it now but anyway eighty HD
that's<00:02:53.130> really<00:02:53.460> really<00:02:53.850> fast<00:02:54.180> forward<00:02:54.480> full

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
that's really really fast forward full

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.240 
that's really really fast forward full
back<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:55.110> i<00:02:55.170> guess<00:02:55.320> it<00:02:55.440> allows<00:02:55.710> the<00:02:55.890> person<00:02:56.040> to

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
back so i guess it allows the person to

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.370 
back so i guess it allows the person to
get<00:02:56.400> out<00:02:56.550> there<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:57.000> keep<00:02:57.750> up<00:02:57.900> with<00:02:58.020> some<00:02:58.140> fast

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
get out there and keep up with some fast

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.870 
get out there and keep up with some fast
running<00:02:58.650> backs<00:02:58.890> plus<00:02:59.100> second<00:02:59.370> probably<00:02:59.670> boost

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
running backs plus second probably boost

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.260 
running backs plus second probably boost
to<00:03:00.120> 100<00:03:00.480> if<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:00.690> guys<00:03:00.840> gotta<00:03:01.110> speed<00:03:01.470> team<00:03:02.270> plus

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
to 100 if you guys gotta speed team plus

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.350 
to 100 if you guys gotta speed team plus
9<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.930> speed<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:04.350> that's<00:03:04.470> really<00:03:04.650> really<00:03:04.920> fast

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
9 to speed so that's really really fast

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.660 
9 to speed so that's really really fast
