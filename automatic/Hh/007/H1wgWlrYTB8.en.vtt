00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:13.619
 hello everyone here is such a military knife 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:17.719
 or rather whose military blade is slightly to him 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.719
 tight liner lock 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:26.640
 linerock very beginning screws 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.100
 all very good spins up 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.550
 unscrewed not bound but 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.360
 Choose the right screwdriver steel 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:42.260
 blade 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:42.260
 d2 really written cpm s30v 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.309
 notches 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.450
 he 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:16.049
 meets the military present 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:18.450
 American as well as on top the hole is not 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.990
 scratched skin does not tear off 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.250
 size is good enough for . 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.860
 note perfectly flat for 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.520
 factory sharpening is just what 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.920
 there must be something that should be on 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:44.420
 doroguschie knives but usually this 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:44.420
 far not so here just great 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.250
 military paper macaroni simply 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.250
 answer without any problems 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.819
 Knife spider to military chinese 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.910
 produced or popularly referred to as 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:16.190
 military first video I said about 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.650
 that this knife has a fairly tight move 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:24.630
 but promised that this problem will be 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:27.420
 easily eliminated and magnitude so and so that 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.440
 i did with this knife first 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:35.250
 polished all surfaces in the second 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.769
 treated with a dry teflon lubricant 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.459
 I teach the rules a number of other significant 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.459
 manipulations but I will not bore you 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.480
 after which the course of the blade became very easy 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:59.519
 that is, the blade fly away without any 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:05.269
 problems, that is, with 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.269
 nodding suspension blade it folds 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:21.900
 no problem at all what you want but when 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:25.920
 This axial screw is tightened strongly, we then 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.230
 there is no backlash no showing here 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.100
 Well, it is clear that in general no, he tightened 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:35.870
 tightly 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.870
 and moving the liner there is no backlash 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:44.130
 at the same time the lock at the very beginning is also 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:48.930
 evidence that the whole mechanism 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:51.380
 firmly wedge our wedge too 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.380
 center 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:09.180
 but I think, and well, our military promised 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:23.910
 show you there is a knife such a vase. 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:28.230
 on him the tip is long-suffering here his 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:40.710
 broke off dragged did not begin to deduce about 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:45.260
 straight show here well and so sharpen here 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:49.850
 we will wait very high quality 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.850
 machine tools too pleased principle good 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.700
 also on the forum here 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:18.610
 no backlash is not present my new Miletus 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:41.200
 I want to note how much the blade oozed 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:53.500
 here and put together with 2 millimeter
