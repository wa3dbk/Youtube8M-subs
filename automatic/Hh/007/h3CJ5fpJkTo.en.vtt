assembly tap browse first bar we want to
bring<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.580> advanced<00:00:30.150> assembly<00:00:30.570> itself<00:00:30.869> is

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
bring in advanced assembly itself is

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.580 
bring in advanced assembly itself is
called<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.380> crank<00:00:32.420> as<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.570> know<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:34.440> drop

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
called the crank as you know I can drop

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.709 
called the crank as you know I can drop
it<00:00:34.739> anywhere<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:35.250> space<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.820> we<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.450> best

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
it anywhere in space and we the best

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.660 
it anywhere in space and we the best
practice<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.260> make<00:00:37.410> parts<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.370> as<00:00:38.520> you

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
practice is to make parts in as you

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.410 
practice is to make parts in as you
bring<00:00:38.910> them<00:00:39.059> in

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
bring them in

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.380 
bring them in
so<00:00:40.050> stop<00:00:40.440> make<00:00:40.710> command<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.640> make<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.090> end

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
so stop make command and make that end

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.340 
so stop make command and make that end
face<00:00:42.809> there<00:00:43.170> flush<00:00:43.770> with<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.129> face<00:00:45.200> and<00:00:46.200> then

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
face there flush with that face and then

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.170 
face there flush with that face and then
it's<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> lyrical<00:00:47.010> mate<00:00:47.219> between<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.850> part

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
it's the lyrical mate between that part

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.900 
it's the lyrical mate between that part
and<00:00:48.680> that's<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.800> cone<00:00:50.070> face<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.640> won't<00:00:50.789> work

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
and that's a cone face that won't work

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.420 
and that's a cone face that won't work
particularly<00:00:51.270> well<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.800> can<00:00:52.800> use<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.129> face

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
particularly well I can use that face

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.080 
particularly well I can use that face
there<00:00:53.989> okay<00:00:55.190> now<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.699> remember<00:00:56.730> before

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
there okay now you remember before

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.060 
there okay now you remember before
explain<00:00:57.629> we<00:00:57.840> bought<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.140> ink<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.440> mine<00:00:58.649> first

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
explain we bought the ink of mine first

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.560 
explain we bought the ink of mine first
the<00:00:59.280> anchor<00:00:59.550> part<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.879> there<00:01:00.120> because<00:01:00.449> we

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
the anchor part is there because we

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.229 
the anchor part is there because we
don't<00:01:00.750> have<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:01.890> cylinder<00:01:02.430> block<00:01:02.550> here<00:01:02.940> for

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
don't have the cylinder block here for

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.859 
don't have the cylinder block here for
these<00:01:03.359> parts<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.989> rotate<00:01:04.409> around<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.869> to

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
these parts to rotate around so to

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.280 
these parts to rotate around so to
enable<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.320> motion<00:01:08.390> we<00:01:09.390> need<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.659> dummy<00:01:09.930> part

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
enable that motion we need to dummy part

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.140 
enable that motion we need to dummy part
and<00:01:10.439> effect<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.040> ground<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.520> that's<00:01:12.000> why

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
and effect just to ground it that's why

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.840 
and effect just to ground it that's why
the<00:01:12.210> anchor<00:01:12.630> part<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.990> there<00:01:13.490> okay<00:01:14.490> we<00:01:14.610> can<00:01:14.760> now

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
the anchor part is there okay we can now

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.450 
the anchor part is there okay we can now
go<00:01:15.000> insert<00:01:15.330> components<00:01:15.960> browse<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.220> we<00:01:17.250> can

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
go insert components browse and we can

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.630 
go insert components browse and we can
bring<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> crank<00:01:18.060> pin<00:01:19.159> about<00:01:20.159> anywhere<00:01:20.490> in

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
bring in the crank pin about anywhere in

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.270 
bring in the crank pin about anywhere in
space<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:21.180> now<00:01:21.619> start<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.680> mate<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.100> that's

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
space for now start the mate so that's

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.179 
space for now start the mate so that's
it<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.570> doesn't<00:01:24.840> axial<00:01:25.320> alignment<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.009> it's

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
it that doesn't axial alignment so it's

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.179 
it that doesn't axial alignment so it's
into<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.610> hole<00:01:27.380> then<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.470> can<00:01:28.619> make<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.890> base

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
into the hole then I can make this base

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.080 
into the hole then I can make this base
flush<00:01:29.520> with<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:29.880> space<00:01:30.409> and<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.500> okay<00:01:31.799> there

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.749 

I<00:01:34.149> can<00:01:34.570> bring<00:01:34.899> in<00:01:35.109> next<00:01:35.829> campaign<00:01:36.219> which<00:01:36.579> is

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
I can bring in next campaign which is

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.109 
I can bring in next campaign which is
another<00:01:37.030> crank<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:39.340> notice<00:01:39.609> the<00:01:39.759> minute<00:01:40.000> this

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
another crank you notice the minute this

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.410 
another crank you notice the minute this
crank<00:01:40.479> should<00:01:40.750> be<00:01:40.929> the<00:01:41.109> other<00:01:41.170> way<00:01:41.380> around<00:01:41.409> now

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
crank should be the other way around now

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.450 
crank should be the other way around now
I<00:01:43.420> can<00:01:43.659> either<00:01:43.780> use<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:45.009> rotate<00:01:45.429> command

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
I can either use the rotate command

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.950 
I can either use the rotate command
button<00:01:46.469> to<00:01:47.469> give<00:01:47.649> it<00:01:47.770> a<00:01:47.859> helping<00:01:48.219> hand<00:01:48.960> let's

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
button to give it a helping hand let's

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.179 
button to give it a helping hand let's
put<00:01:50.140> it<00:01:50.229> back<00:01:50.380> to<00:01:50.560> where<00:01:50.799> it<00:01:50.829> was<00:01:52.920> okay<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.069> if

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
put it back to where it was okay and if

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.069 
put it back to where it was okay and if
I<00:01:54.340> start<00:01:54.579> the<00:01:54.700> make<00:01:54.880> come<00:01:55.060> on<00:01:55.209> now<00:01:55.420> make<00:01:56.020> that

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
I start the make come on now make that

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.719 
I start the make come on now make that
face<00:01:56.649> they're<00:01:56.950> in<00:01:57.069> that<00:01:57.159> face

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
face they're in that face

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.749 
face they're in that face
still<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.509> wrong<00:01:58.659> way<00:01:58.780> around<00:01:59.170> I<00:01:59.640> can<00:02:00.640> get

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
still the wrong way around I can get

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.449 
still the wrong way around I can get
software<00:02:01.359> to<00:02:01.479> spin<00:02:01.719> it<00:02:01.840> around<00:02:01.899> for<00:02:02.229> me<00:02:02.459> long

doesn't<00:02:07.000> see<00:02:07.209> the<00:02:07.299> difference<00:02:07.599> between<00:02:07.750> that

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:07.989 
doesn't see the difference between that

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:09.660 
doesn't see the difference between that
and<00:02:08.229> that's<00:02:08.560> this<00:02:08.829> is<00:02:08.979> where<00:02:09.130> we<00:02:09.250> have<00:02:09.369> to<00:02:09.519> give

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
and that's this is where we have to give

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.800 
and that's this is where we have to give
it<00:02:09.729> a<00:02:09.789> little<00:02:09.940> bit<00:02:10.090> of<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.179> helping<00:02:10.479> hand<00:02:10.509> and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
it a little bit of a helping hand and

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.839 
it a little bit of a helping hand and
that's<00:02:10.989> the<00:02:11.200> one<00:02:11.349> rule<00:02:13.140> can<00:02:14.140> make<00:02:14.319> this<00:02:14.530> face

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
that's the one rule can make this face

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.360 
that's the one rule can make this face
until<00:02:15.849> there<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.269> slide<00:02:16.569> it<00:02:16.720> on<00:02:17.069> now<00:02:18.069> obviously

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
until there to slide it on now obviously

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.860 
until there to slide it on now obviously
when<00:02:18.519> we<00:02:18.640> turn<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.090> crank<00:02:19.239> we<00:02:19.450> want<00:02:19.629> them<00:02:19.720> both

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
when we turn the crank we want them both

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.619 
when we turn the crank we want them both
to<00:02:19.930> turn<00:02:20.319> together<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.030> can<00:02:22.209> do<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.390> meet

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
to turn together so I can do a meet

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.360 
to turn together so I can do a meet
between<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:23.290> face<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:23.980> face

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
between that face and that face

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.830 
between that face and that face
so<00:02:24.790> they<00:02:24.970> both<00:02:25.180> turn<00:02:25.569> exactly<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.200> same<00:02:27.329> okay

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
so they both turn exactly the same okay

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.650 
so they both turn exactly the same okay
so<00:02:29.530> insert<00:02:30.129> components<00:02:30.760> you<00:02:31.150> can<00:02:31.360> now<00:02:31.510> bring

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
so insert components you can now bring

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.309 
so insert components you can now bring
the<00:02:31.840> con<00:02:32.049> rod<00:02:32.079> in<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:33.610> captain<00:02:34.030> what<00:02:34.060> I<00:02:34.480> open

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
the con rod in so captain what I open

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.400 
the con rod in so captain what I open
and<00:02:35.530> just<00:02:35.680> put<00:02:35.829> it<00:02:35.920> anywhere<00:02:36.069> for<00:02:36.280> now

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
and just put it anywhere for now

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.539 
and just put it anywhere for now
the<00:02:38.410> first<00:02:38.650> mate<00:02:38.829> we're<00:02:38.920> going<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.100> put<00:02:39.220> on<00:02:39.340> is

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
the first mate we're going to put on is

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.039 
the first mate we're going to put on is
the<00:02:39.579> axilla<00:02:40.060> line<00:02:40.359> between<00:02:40.690> those<00:02:40.989> two

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
the axilla line between those two

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.759 
the axilla line between those two
symmetrical<00:02:41.620> faces<00:02:41.880> and<00:02:43.200> then<00:02:44.200> I<00:02:44.410> can<00:02:44.590> make

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
symmetrical faces and then I can make

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.500 
symmetrical faces and then I can make
that<00:02:44.980> face<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:46.750> face<00:02:47.970> now<00:02:48.970> what<00:02:49.150> we'll<00:02:49.329> see

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
that face to face now what we'll see

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.110 
that face to face now what we'll see
here<00:02:49.540> is<00:02:50.349> that<00:02:50.410> we've<00:02:50.829> gotta<00:02:51.099> get<00:02:51.400> one<00:02:51.849> side

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
here is that we've gotta get one side

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.839 
here is that we've gotta get one side
and<00:02:52.359> it's<00:02:52.480> flush<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:53.049> other<00:02:53.170> side<00:02:53.579> now<00:02:54.579> what

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
and it's flush the other side now what

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.099 
and it's flush the other side now what
we<00:02:54.970> really<00:02:55.329> want<00:02:55.510> is<00:02:55.599> for<00:02:55.720> that<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:55.900> be

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
we really want is for that to be

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.289 
we really want is for that to be
centered<00:02:56.590> with<00:02:57.430> a<00:02:57.519> little<00:02:57.730> bit<00:02:57.849> of<00:02:57.910> clearance

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
centered with a little bit of clearance

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.750 
centered with a little bit of clearance
I<00:02:58.480> decided<00:02:58.900> now<00:02:59.139> to<00:02:59.410> work<00:03:00.160> out<00:03:00.340> what<00:03:00.489> size<00:03:00.730> that

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
I decided now to work out what size that

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.930 
I decided now to work out what size that
gap<00:03:01.209> is<00:03:01.889> useful<00:03:02.889> feature<00:03:03.130> is<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.459> go<00:03:03.579> tools

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
gap is useful feature is to go tools

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.750 
gap is useful feature is to go tools
measure<00:03:04.829> and<00:03:05.829> pick<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.669> two<00:03:06.940> faces<00:03:08.489> there<00:03:09.489> and

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
measure and pick the two faces there and

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.819 
measure and pick the two faces there and
there<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.209> can't<00:03:10.810> see<00:03:10.930> this<00:03:11.139> box<00:03:11.440> here<00:03:11.650> at<00:03:11.769> the

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
there I can't see this box here at the

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.680 
there I can't see this box here at the
time<00:03:12.160> we<00:03:12.489> can<00:03:12.639> toggle<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:13.060> on<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.209> off<00:03:13.359> there

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
time we can toggle it on and off there

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.539 
time we can toggle it on and off there
and<00:03:14.349> what<00:03:14.500> you'll<00:03:14.620> see<00:03:14.769> there<00:03:14.950> is<00:03:15.069> the<00:03:15.160> normal

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
and what you'll see there is the normal

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.180 
and what you'll see there is the normal
distance<00:03:15.970> between<00:03:16.660> those<00:03:17.079> two<00:03:17.260> faces<00:03:17.709> is<00:03:17.859> two

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
distance between those two faces is two

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.009 
distance between those two faces is two
millimeters<00:03:18.790> so<00:03:19.120> you<00:03:19.209> got<00:03:19.329> two<00:03:19.569> millimeter

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
millimeters so you got two millimeter

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.720 
millimeters so you got two millimeter
gap<00:03:20.260> now<00:03:20.470> close<00:03:20.859> that<00:03:20.889> down<00:03:21.900> go<00:03:22.900> into<00:03:23.139> my<00:03:23.260> mates

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
gap now close that down go into my mates

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.460 
gap now close that down go into my mates
it's<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.910> last<00:03:25.150> one<00:03:25.389> I<00:03:25.419> put<00:03:25.660> on<00:03:25.810> so<00:03:26.230> I<00:03:26.290> can

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
it's the last one I put on so I can

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.379 
it's the last one I put on so I can
right-click<00:03:26.739> an<00:03:27.160> edit<00:03:27.340> feature<00:03:27.579> I<00:03:28.000> thought<00:03:28.299> I

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
right-click an edit feature I thought I

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.449 
right-click an edit feature I thought I
was<00:03:28.510> coincident<00:03:29.169> maybe<00:03:29.440> force<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.829> two<00:03:30.040> faces

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
was coincident maybe force the two faces

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.280 
was coincident maybe force the two faces
will<00:03:30.579> touch<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:31.000> if<00:03:31.599> I<00:03:31.720> change<00:03:31.989> that<00:03:32.109> to<00:03:32.230> a

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
will touch it if I change that to a

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.540 
will touch it if I change that to a
distance<00:03:32.709> mate<00:03:33.239> must<00:03:34.239> be<00:03:34.389> one<00:03:34.630> millimeter<00:03:35.049> gap

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
distance mate must be one millimeter gap

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.860 
distance mate must be one millimeter gap
besides<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:36.120> can<00:03:36.300> change<00:03:36.450> out<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.660> one

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
besides I can change out to one

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.620 
besides I can change out to one
millimeter<00:03:37.020> and<00:03:37.820> it<00:03:38.820> just<00:03:39.030> shifts<00:03:39.330> over

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
millimeter and it just shifts over

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:40.880 
millimeter and it just shifts over
slightly<00:03:39.840> force<00:03:40.170> if<00:03:40.320> it'd<00:03:40.410> gone<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.740> wrong

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
slightly force if it'd gone the wrong

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.940 
slightly force if it'd gone the wrong
way<00:03:40.950> we<00:03:41.460> could<00:03:41.640> a<00:03:41.670> top<00:03:41.910> of<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.120> direction<00:03:42.950> some

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
way we could a top of the direction some

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.500 
way we could a top of the direction some
agreeing<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.430> that<00:03:46.340> okay<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:48.180> that's<00:03:48.360> my

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
agreeing to that okay so that's my

comrade in place in a minute I can now

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.130 
comrade in place in a minute I can now
say<00:03:51.720> insert<00:03:52.080> components<00:03:52.830> vowels<00:03:53.810> let's<00:03:54.810> put

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
say insert components vowels let's put

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.530 
say insert components vowels let's put
the<00:03:55.580> piston<00:03:56.580> head<00:03:56.730> on<00:03:56.880> next<00:03:59.090> okay<00:04:00.090> so<00:04:00.150> you<00:04:00.360> can

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
the piston head on next okay so you can

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.770 
the piston head on next okay so you can
make<00:04:00.750> that<00:04:00.780> face<00:04:01.760> inside<00:04:02.760> face<00:04:03.000> this<00:04:03.240> bear<00:04:03.600> in

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
make that face inside face this bear in

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.430 
make that face inside face this bear in
line<00:04:05.360> so<00:04:06.360> you'll<00:04:06.450> notice<00:04:06.630> that<00:04:06.810> we<00:04:07.170> can

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
line so you'll notice that we can

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.900 
line so you'll notice that we can
actually<00:04:07.590> build<00:04:07.920> this<00:04:08.100> assembly<00:04:08.550> up<00:04:08.610> in<00:04:08.760> our

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
actually build this assembly up in our

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.810 
actually build this assembly up in our
pins<00:04:09.530> as<00:04:10.530> long<00:04:10.740> as<00:04:10.830> we<00:04:10.950> actually<00:04:11.130> align<00:04:11.640> the

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
pins as long as we actually align the

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.550 
pins as long as we actually align the
inside<00:04:12.120> of<00:04:12.210> those<00:04:12.330> holes<00:04:12.600> sort<00:04:13.200> of<00:04:13.260> which<00:04:13.380> does

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
inside of those holes sort of which does

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.440 
inside of those holes sort of which does
not<00:04:13.770> actually<00:04:14.040> need<00:04:14.400> a<00:04:14.460> pin<00:04:14.760> there<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.180> be<00:04:15.300> in

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
not actually need a pin there to be in

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.500 
not actually need a pin there to be in
place

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
place

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:26.890 
place
okay<00:04:18.510> well<00:04:18.840> then<00:04:18.989> bring<00:04:19.530> in<00:04:20.180> piston<00:04:21.180> pin<00:04:25.250> okay

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
okay well then bring in piston pin okay

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.690 
okay well then bring in piston pin okay
again<00:04:27.900> I<00:04:28.170> can<00:04:28.560> wait<00:04:28.710> back<00:04:29.010> into<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.340> center<00:04:29.670> of

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
again I can wait back into the center of

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.870 
again I can wait back into the center of
the<00:04:29.850> hole

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.690 

I<00:04:33.140> can<00:04:34.140> make<00:04:34.290> these<00:04:34.560> two<00:04:34.920> faces<00:04:35.880> flush<00:04:36.420> there

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
I can make these two faces flush there

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.690 
I can make these two faces flush there
and<00:04:38.720> then<00:04:39.720> I<00:04:39.810> can<00:04:40.020> make<00:04:40.230> the<00:04:40.620> inside<00:04:41.220> face<00:04:41.670> of

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
and then I can make the inside face of

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.700 
and then I can make the inside face of
the<00:04:42.000> come<00:04:42.240> on<00:04:42.540> to<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:42.810> inside<00:04:43.350> of<00:04:43.410> this

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
the come on to the inside of this

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.380 
the come on to the inside of this
bracket<00:04:44.340> here<00:04:46.370> okay<00:04:47.370> that's<00:04:47.730> everything<00:04:48.060> now

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
bracket here okay that's everything now

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.480 
bracket here okay that's everything now
in<00:04:48.540> place<00:04:51.110> okay<00:04:52.110> now<00:04:52.680> what<00:04:52.830> you'll<00:04:52.950> notice<00:04:53.100> now

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
in place okay now what you'll notice now

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.980 
in place okay now what you'll notice now
is<00:04:53.640> although<00:04:53.790> this<00:04:54.030> is<00:04:54.210> in<00:04:54.360> place<00:04:54.510> it's<00:04:54.840> all

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
is although this is in place it's all

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.070 
is although this is in place it's all
fixed<00:04:55.650> together<00:04:56.240> it's<00:04:57.240> just<00:04:57.360> moving<00:04:57.630> a<00:04:57.870> really

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
fixed together it's just moving a really

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.480 
fixed together it's just moving a really
random<00:04:58.320> motion<00:04:58.860> there's<00:04:59.040> nothing<00:04:59.370> at<00:04:59.430> the

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
random motion there's nothing at the

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.190 
random motion there's nothing at the
minute<00:04:59.790> stopping<00:05:00.270> that<00:05:00.450> from<00:05:00.660> going<00:05:00.810> up<00:05:01.020> and

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
minute stopping that from going up and

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.630 
minute stopping that from going up and
down<00:05:01.290> so<00:05:01.500> that's<00:05:01.710> what<00:05:01.860> we'll<00:05:01.980> look<00:05:02.100> at<00:05:02.250> fixing

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
down so that's what we'll look at fixing

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.000 
down so that's what we'll look at fixing
next
