Kondos<00:00:54.510> what<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.750> believe<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.530> yeah<00:00:55.949> I

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
Kondos what I believe and I yeah I

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.650 
Kondos what I believe and I yeah I
thought<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.489> exact<00:00:56.969> same<00:00:57.239> thing<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.600> you

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
thought the exact same thing that you

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.869 
thought the exact same thing that you
did<00:00:57.750> Dan<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.320> thought<00:00:58.920> when<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.520> way<00:00:59.699> they

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
did Dan I thought when the way they

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.729 
did Dan I thought when the way they
edited<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.539> line<00:01:00.930> he's<00:01:03.350> one<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.379> our<00:01:04.559> top

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
edited that line he's one of our top

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.380 
edited that line he's one of our top
agents<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.580> way<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.180> was

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
agents like the way that that was

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.120 
agents like the way that that was
clearly<00:01:06.659> not<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.930> way<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.350> line<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.710> said<00:01:07.950> in

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
clearly not the way the line is said in

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.950 
clearly not the way the line is said in
the<00:01:08.220> movies<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.700> got<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> feeling<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.540> that

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
the movies I got a feeling that that

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.620 
the movies I got a feeling that that
that<00:01:10.470> when<00:01:10.680> Robocop<00:01:11.460> says<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.939> line<00:01:12.180> he's

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
that when Robocop says that line he's

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.660 
that when Robocop says that line he's
not<00:01:12.810> referring<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.860> Benedict<00:01:14.189> Cumberbatch<00:01:14.520> I

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
not referring to Benedict Cumberbatch I

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.710 
not referring to Benedict Cumberbatch I
just<00:01:14.850> got<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> feeling<00:01:15.150> once<00:01:15.450> again<00:01:15.630> I'm

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
just got a feeling once again I'm

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.600 
just got a feeling once again I'm
probably<00:01:15.930> wrong<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.409> still<00:01:17.009> believe<00:01:17.250> it's<00:01:17.400> con

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
probably wrong I still believe it's con

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.600 
probably wrong I still believe it's con
personally<00:01:18.210> or<00:01:18.960> directly<00:01:19.650> connected<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.340> con

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
personally or directly connected to con

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.219 
personally or directly connected to con
the<00:01:20.640> guy<00:01:20.850> who's<00:01:21.060> going<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.360> wait<00:01:21.630> Khan<00:01:21.869> up<00:01:22.110> or

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
the guy who's going to wait Khan up or

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.560 
the guy who's going to wait Khan up or
something<00:01:22.590> I'm<00:01:22.740> probably<00:01:23.400> dead<00:01:23.970> wrong<00:01:24.270> I'm

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
something I'm probably dead wrong I'm

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.359 
something I'm probably dead wrong I'm
admitting<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.080> right<00:01:25.290> now<00:01:25.470> Kaleta<00:01:26.100> that's

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
admitting that right now Kaleta that's

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.920 
admitting that right now Kaleta that's
where<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.520> think<00:01:26.549> Jimmy<00:01:26.970> where<00:01:27.119> do<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.659> see<00:01:27.840> it

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
where I think Jimmy where do you see it

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.420 
where I think Jimmy where do you see it
yeah<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.409> seems<00:01:28.619> like<00:01:28.740> they're<00:01:28.920> being<00:01:29.130> really

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
yeah it seems like they're being really

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.140 
yeah it seems like they're being really
secretive<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.390> REI<00:01:30.630> yeah<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.979> guess<00:01:32.970> it's

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
secretive and REI yeah I guess it's

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.450 
secretive and REI yeah I guess it's
gonna<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.360> if<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.840> kind<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> told<00:01:35.310> you

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460

some so maybe they're just screwing with
the<00:01:37.409> audience<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.890> little<00:01:37.920> bit<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.820> say
