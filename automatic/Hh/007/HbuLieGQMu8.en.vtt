 a hot fight on the travel market 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.230
 proving 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.779
 traveler they quickly understood 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.300
 had to democratize cruises so 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.859
 to make them more accessible to all and 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.200

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.420

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.030
 before leaving as for a whole 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.650
 including the traveler will have to land 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.020
 some questions and everything 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.730
 particularly wondered what kind 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.710
 of cruising he wants to do because 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.890
 in every port anyway he 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.570

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.609
 family there is always a boat that 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.500
 wait for him if we have the time and the means 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.840

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.350
 these ships go around 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.770
 the ideal cruise for a beginner to 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.479
 my opinion is seven days during these 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.789
 seven days there must be three or 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.860
 four stopovers which is perfect for 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:18.080
 take the rhythm of the boat and the 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.340
 cruise on a boat from coinsins there 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.750

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.869

 or simply the shopping the 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.050
 cruise that marked me the most 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.180
 obviously and the one I did on 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.400
 one of the biggest ship world the oasis of 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.840
 of 6 it is huge 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.099
 he is 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.530
 it is equivalent to two steamers and especially 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.810
 he does not even try in the storm he 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.610
 is absolutely perfect this ship there for 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.019
 beginners who are very afraid of having 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.900
 seasickness that surprises me 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.580
 still as much despite the number of 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.290
 cruises that I was able to do it's to 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.120
 every time I board a boat 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.610
 I feel exactly the same excitement 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.209
 is what I love above all is 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:53.959
 when the boat honks at the exit of a 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.690
 port and that they convey the coast 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.310
 to get away at that moment I always 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.810
 the impression that I will come back to it 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.810
 good 3 will go all
