00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
today we have a chest workout

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.470 
today we have a chest workout
we<00:00:07.049> had<00:00:07.230> chest<00:00:07.589> shredding<00:00:08.130> workout<00:00:08.490> so<00:00:09.389> it's

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
we had chest shredding workout so it's

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.730 
we had chest shredding workout so it's
gonna<00:00:09.570> be<00:00:09.660> five<00:00:09.900> different<00:00:10.080> movements<00:00:10.620> that

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
gonna be five different movements that

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.740 
gonna be five different movements that
you<00:00:10.800> do<00:00:10.920> in<00:00:11.130> succession<00:00:11.580> it's<00:00:12.330> part<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.599> big

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
you do in succession it's part of a big

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.110 
you do in succession it's part of a big
circuit<00:00:13.170> so<00:00:13.740> start<00:00:13.950> with<00:00:14.040> push-ups<00:00:14.490> doing<00:00:14.820> 20

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
circuit so start with push-ups doing 20

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.480 
circuit so start with push-ups doing 20
reps<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:16.049> we<00:00:16.139> go<00:00:16.289> over<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.560> bench<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.190> hit

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
reps and we go over to a bench and hit

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.510 
reps and we go over to a bench and hit
some<00:00:17.730> eat<00:00:17.940> incline<00:00:18.449> bench<00:00:18.990> pressing<00:00:19.529> then<00:00:20.430> we

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
some eat incline bench pressing then we

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.580 
some eat incline bench pressing then we
do<00:00:20.640> plyo<00:00:21.240> push-ups<00:00:21.630> on<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.109> ground<00:00:22.470> which<00:00:22.560> is

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
do plyo push-ups on the ground which is

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.500 
do plyo push-ups on the ground which is
using<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.980> lot<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.130> force<00:00:23.369> push<00:00:23.850> yourself<00:00:24.300> up

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
using a lot of force push yourself up

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.210 
using a lot of force push yourself up
off<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.350> ground<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:25.740> could<00:00:25.830> also<00:00:25.980> use<00:00:26.189> a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
off the ground you could also use a

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.890 
off the ground you could also use a
bench<00:00:26.460> if<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.760> want<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.060> on<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.330> one<00:00:27.510> and

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
bench if you want to on that one and

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.169 
bench if you want to on that one and
then<00:00:28.140> we<00:00:28.199> go<00:00:28.320> back<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.039> incline<00:00:29.490> bench<00:00:29.760> for

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
then we go back to the incline bench for

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.359 
then we go back to the incline bench for
some<00:00:30.330> incline<00:00:30.720> chest<00:00:30.750> fly<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:32.040> they<00:00:32.070> stretch

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
some incline chest fly so they stretch

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.639 
some incline chest fly so they stretch
out<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.880> muscles<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.510> chest<00:00:33.780> then<00:00:34.590> we

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
out the muscles of the chest then we

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.990 
out the muscles of the chest then we
finish<00:00:34.920> up<00:00:35.070> with<00:00:35.130> more<00:00:35.430> push-ups

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
finish up with more push-ups

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.180 
finish up with more push-ups
this<00:00:36.690> time<00:00:36.930> as<00:00:37.110> many<00:00:37.320> as<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.530> can<00:00:37.620> do<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.920> fail

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
this time as many as you can do to fail

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.420 
this time as many as you can do to fail
so<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.120> between<00:00:39.390> each<00:00:39.629> exercise<00:00:40.200> give<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.190> 30

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
so in between each exercise give you 30

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.729 
so in between each exercise give you 30
seconds<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.270> 1<00:00:42.450> minute<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.870> rest<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.440> then<00:00:43.530> in

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
seconds to 1 minute of rest and then in

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.010 
seconds to 1 minute of rest and then in
between<00:00:44.040> each<00:00:44.160> circuit<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:45.329> do<00:00:45.480> two<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.899> three

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
between each circuit you do two to three

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.510 
between each circuit you do two to three
minutes<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.350> rest<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.710> re-energize<00:00:46.980> all<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
minutes of rest to re-energize all the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.670 
minutes of rest to re-energize all the
muscles<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:48.960> workout<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.469> want<00:00:49.620> to

muscles so for this workout you want to

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.819 
muscles so for this workout you want to
do<00:00:49.829> three<00:00:50.489> total<00:00:50.820> circuits<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.449> then<00:00:52.320> you'll

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
do three total circuits and then you'll

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.590 
do three total circuits and then you'll
be<00:00:52.920> all<00:00:53.039> finished<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.940> can<00:00:54.030> survive<00:00:54.180> all

take 30 seconds rest about a minute

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.660 
take 30 seconds rest about a minute
maybe<00:01:30.340> alright<00:01:31.090> so<00:01:31.240> if<00:01:31.510> the<00:01:31.600> bench<00:01:32.670> incline

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
maybe alright so if the bench incline

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.220 
maybe alright so if the bench incline
specifications<00:01:36.660> can<00:01:37.660> grab<00:01:37.810> your<00:01:37.990> weight<00:01:38.110> so

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
specifications can grab your weight so

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.930 
specifications can grab your weight so
you<00:01:38.320> need<00:01:38.470> to<00:01:38.560> use<00:01:38.770> yourself<00:01:39.220> to<00:01:39.640> kick<00:01:39.820> the

push up so that involves any sort of way
to<00:02:45.390> make<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.350> a<00:02:46.730> faster-moving<00:02:47.730> pushup<00:02:48.690> of

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
to make it a faster-moving pushup of

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.140 
to make it a faster-moving pushup of
pushing<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:49.980> trying<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.250> get<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.490> hands<00:02:50.820> off

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
pushing and trying to get the hands off

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.210 
pushing and trying to get the hands off
the<00:02:51.600> ground<00:02:51.840> in<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.170> powerful<00:02:52.560> movement<00:02:52.920> so

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.300 

that's<00:03:16.850> it<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.090> plyo<00:03:17.270> push-ups<00:03:18.100> take<00:03:19.100> him<00:03:19.220> in

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
that's it the plyo push-ups take him in

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.290 
that's it the plyo push-ups take him in
arrest<00:03:19.580> and<00:03:20.570> you<00:03:20.750> do<00:03:20.930> incline<00:03:21.290> chef's<00:03:21.590> fly<00:03:22.300> so

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
arrest and you do incline chef's fly so

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.170 
arrest and you do incline chef's fly so
you<00:03:23.390> can<00:03:23.510> see<00:03:24.970> getting<00:03:25.970> me<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.120> little

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
you can see getting me a little

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:33.150 
you can see getting me a little
difficult<00:03:29.350> fourth<00:03:30.350> exercise<00:03:30.650> in<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.160> circuit

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
difficult fourth exercise in the circuit

00:03:33.160 --> 00:04:29.650 
difficult fourth exercise in the circuit
10<00:03:34.160> to<00:03:34.250> 12<00:03:34.490> reps<00:03:34.760> in<00:03:35.210> the<00:03:35.780> set

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.399 

cool

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:33.409 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:36.879 

take<00:04:34.399> about<00:04:34.550> a<00:04:34.610> minute<00:04:34.879> rest<00:04:35.499> and<00:04:36.499> these<00:04:36.679> do

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
take about a minute rest and these do

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:42.339 
take about a minute rest and these do
one<00:04:37.489> set<00:04:37.789> of<00:04:37.909> push-ups<00:04:38.319> to<00:04:39.319> failure<00:04:41.110> Isis<00:04:42.110> last

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:42.349 
one set of push-ups to failure Isis last

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.179 
one set of push-ups to failure Isis last
part<00:04:42.679> of<00:04:43.219> the<00:04:43.339> chest<00:04:43.610> shredding<00:04:43.969> circuit<00:04:44.599> here

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:45.189 
part of the chest shredding circuit here

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:48.070 
part of the chest shredding circuit here
so<00:04:46.189> we<00:04:46.279> doing<00:04:46.519> push<00:04:46.909> ups<00:04:46.939> to<00:04:47.179> failure<00:04:47.569> and<00:04:47.719> so

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
so we doing push ups to failure and so

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.659 
so we doing push ups to failure and so
that<00:04:48.259> means<00:04:48.439> failure<00:04:48.769> where<00:04:49.159> you<00:04:49.249> can't<00:04:49.489> do

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
that means failure where you can't do

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.509 
that means failure where you can't do
any<00:04:49.849> more<00:04:50.059> clean<00:04:50.509> reps<00:04:51.219> push-ups<00:04:52.219> that<00:04:52.339> means

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:52.519 
any more clean reps push-ups that means

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:55.179 
any more clean reps push-ups that means
keeping<00:04:52.789> that<00:04:52.909> body<00:04:53.719> and<00:04:53.929> nice<00:04:54.409> stiff<00:04:54.949> as<00:04:55.159> a

00:04:55.179 --> 00:04:55.189 
keeping that body and nice stiff as a

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:56.679 
keeping that body and nice stiff as a
board<00:04:55.249> and<00:04:55.669> straight<00:04:55.909> as<00:04:56.059> an<00:04:56.149> arrow<00:04:56.269> wants<00:04:56.629> to

00:04:56.679 --> 00:04:56.689 
board and straight as an arrow wants to

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:59.259 
board and straight as an arrow wants to
start<00:04:56.869> breaking<00:04:57.080> that<00:04:57.379> that's<00:04:58.129> failure<00:04:58.550> so

00:04:59.259 --> 00:04:59.269 
start breaking that that's failure so

00:04:59.269 --> 00:05:00.939 
start breaking that that's failure so
let's<00:04:59.419> see<00:04:59.539> how<00:04:59.629> many<00:04:59.719> I<00:04:59.809> can<00:04:59.839> get<00:05:00.050> in<00:05:00.199> so<00:05:00.889> you

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:00.949 
let's see how many I can get in so you

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:03.639 
let's see how many I can get in so you
see<00:05:01.159> I'm<00:05:01.249> already<00:05:01.459> winded<00:05:01.789> quite<00:05:02.029> a<00:05:02.059> bit<00:05:02.589> so<00:05:03.589> it

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:03.649 
see I'm already winded quite a bit so it

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:05.799 
see I'm already winded quite a bit so it
might<00:05:03.769> be<00:05:03.830> a<00:05:03.979> little<00:05:04.189> hard<00:05:04.399> to<00:05:04.489> get<00:05:04.669> as<00:05:04.789> many<00:05:05.659> as

00:05:05.799 --> 00:05:05.809 
might be a little hard to get as many as

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:22.810 
might be a little hard to get as many as
I<00:05:05.929> possibly<00:05:06.739> can

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:35.899 

oh<00:05:31.660> all<00:05:32.660> right

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:38.510 

that's<00:05:36.479> about<00:05:36.629> all<00:05:36.689> I<00:05:36.839> can<00:05:37.050> get<00:05:37.169> in<00:05:37.349> at<00:05:38.249> this

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
that's about all I can get in at this

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.959 
that's about all I can get in at this
point<00:05:38.789> so<00:05:39.539> now<00:05:39.860> we<00:05:40.860> end<00:05:41.039> the<00:05:41.249> circuit<00:05:41.669> you<00:05:41.789> take

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:41.969 
point so now we end the circuit you take

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.059 
point so now we end the circuit you take
about<00:05:42.179> 2-3<00:05:42.990> minutes<00:05:43.229> of<00:05:43.349> good<00:05:43.469> solid<00:05:43.709> rest

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:44.069 
about 2-3 minutes of good solid rest

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:47.480 
about 2-3 minutes of good solid rest
grab<00:05:44.399> a<00:05:44.429> drink<00:05:44.639> water<00:05:45.169> and<00:05:46.169> do<00:05:46.349> two<00:05:47.129> more

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
grab a drink water and do two more

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.329 
grab a drink water and do two more
circuits<00:05:47.969> to<00:05:48.119> make<00:05:48.240> a<00:05:48.270> total<00:05:48.599> of<00:05:48.689> three<00:05:49.339> and

00:05:50.329 --> 00:05:50.339 
circuits to make a total of three and

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:52.309 
circuits to make a total of three and
that<00:05:50.550> will<00:05:50.729> be<00:05:51.119> all<00:05:51.330> for<00:05:51.360> your<00:05:51.719> chest<00:05:51.959> reading

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 
that will be all for your chest reading

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:55.999 
that will be all for your chest reading
