00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
let's start with the cactus which I

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.120 
let's start with the cactus which I
think<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.449> lot<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.720> times<00:00:27.960> we<00:00:28.140> get<00:00:28.289> intimidated

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
think a lot of times we get intimidated

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.400 
think a lot of times we get intimidated
with<00:00:29.730> cactus<00:00:30.150> because<00:00:30.300> we<00:00:30.630> buy<00:00:30.869> them<00:00:31.140> as<00:00:31.349> a

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
with cactus because we buy them as a

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.380 
with cactus because we buy them as a
house<00:00:32.040> plant<00:00:32.250> often<00:00:32.519> put<00:00:33.000> them<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.239> house

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
house plant often put them in the house

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.360 
house plant often put them in the house
and<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.110> they<00:00:34.290> die<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:34.769> that<00:00:34.949> tends<00:00:35.159> to<00:00:35.250> be

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
and and they die but that tends to be

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.250 
and and they die but that tends to be
over<00:00:35.549> watering<00:00:35.909> so<00:00:36.150> first<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.870> all<00:00:36.989> tell<00:00:37.199> me

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
over watering so first of all tell me

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.289 
over watering so first of all tell me
what<00:00:37.949> is<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.220> culture<00:00:38.580> of<00:00:38.610> these<00:00:38.820> how<00:00:39.059> should

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:39.299 
what is the culture of these how should

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:40.939 
what is the culture of these how should
people<00:00:39.449> if<00:00:39.900> they<00:00:40.080> buy<00:00:40.229> them<00:00:40.440> take<00:00:40.650> care<00:00:40.799> of

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
people if they buy them take care of

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.700 
people if they buy them take care of
them<00:00:41.100> well<00:00:41.549> this<00:00:41.580> is<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.940> desert<00:00:42.449> species<00:00:42.750> they

like to be dried out very well before

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:50.509 
like to be dried out very well before
you<00:00:47.339> would<00:00:47.549> water<00:00:48.000> them<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:49.140> then<00:00:49.890> fertilizer

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
you would water them and then fertilizer

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:52.910 
you would water them and then fertilizer
they<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.720> be<00:00:51.989> fertilized<00:00:52.409> once<00:00:52.619> a<00:00:52.739> month

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
they like to be fertilized once a month

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.899 
they like to be fertilized once a month
with<00:00:53.220> just<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.699> general<00:00:54.350> Schultz<00:00:55.350> yeah

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:55.909 
with just like a general Schultz yeah

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:58.219 
with just like a general Schultz yeah
fertilizer<00:00:56.909> mix<00:00:57.299> just<00:00:57.659> a<00:00:57.750> general<00:00:58.049> purpose

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:58.229 
fertilizer mix just a general purpose

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:00.759 
fertilizer mix just a general purpose
just<00:00:58.470> a<00:00:58.619> general<00:00:59.159> I<00:00:59.339> think<00:00:59.580> they<00:00:59.820> make<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> cacti

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
just a general I think they make a cacti

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.770 
just a general I think they make a cacti
fertilizer<00:01:01.769> that's<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:03.150> know<00:01:03.269> what<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.449> would

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
fertilizer that's you know what I would

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.600 
fertilizer that's you know what I would
suggest<00:01:03.989> for<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.470> average<00:01:04.650> homeowner<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.460> you

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
suggest for the average homeowner to you

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.610 
suggest for the average homeowner to you
okay<00:01:06.060> because<00:01:06.570> they're<00:01:06.900> really<00:01:07.050> I<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.380> know

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
okay because they're really I you know

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.010 
okay because they're really I you know
it's<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.160> a<00:01:08.310> thing<00:01:09.120> that<00:01:09.300> a<00:01:09.330> lot<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.660> people

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
it's a it's a thing that a lot of people

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.660 
it's a it's a thing that a lot of people
do<00:01:10.110> with<00:01:10.230> houseplants<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.800> over<00:01:11.040> water<00:01:11.220> anyway

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
do with houseplants is over water anyway

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.540 
do with houseplants is over water anyway
so<00:01:11.730> you<00:01:11.940> really<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.540> be<00:01:12.630> aware<00:01:12.920> yes<00:01:13.920> when

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
so you really have to be aware yes when

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.340 
so you really have to be aware yes when
if<00:01:14.880> your<00:01:15.300> if<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.630> don't<00:01:15.810> think<00:01:16.050> it<00:01:16.170> needs

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
if your if you don't think it needs

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.990 
if your if you don't think it needs
water<00:01:16.530> then<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.980> probably<00:01:17.220> would<00:01:17.520> suggest<00:01:17.730> not

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
water then I probably would suggest not

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.730 
water then I probably would suggest not
watering<00:01:18.510> waiting<00:01:18.990> anyway<00:01:19.320> yeah<00:01:19.470> waiting

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
watering waiting anyway yeah waiting

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.130 
watering waiting anyway yeah waiting
maybe<00:01:20.250> waiting<00:01:20.610> another<00:01:21.000> few<00:01:21.360> days<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.020> then

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
maybe waiting another few days and then

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.980 
maybe waiting another few days and then
maybe<00:01:22.410> give<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.830> some<00:01:22.980> water<00:01:23.190> okay<00:01:23.640> now<00:01:24.210> you

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
maybe give it some water okay now you

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.990 
maybe give it some water okay now you
said<00:01:25.320> these<00:01:25.500> were<00:01:25.650> desert<00:01:26.100> cactus<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.760> am

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
said these were desert cactus I am

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.490 
said these were desert cactus I am
assuming<00:01:27.300> then<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.630> there's<00:01:27.900> different

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
assuming then that there's different

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.160 
assuming then that there's different
groupings<00:01:28.950> yes<00:01:29.670> kinda<00:01:30.060> plants<00:01:30.390> are<00:01:30.750> these<00:01:30.990> in

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
groupings yes kinda plants are these in

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.280 
groupings yes kinda plants are these in
a<00:01:31.260> different<00:01:31.380> group<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:32.010> this<00:01:32.550> is<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.290> euphorbia

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
a different group in this is a euphorbia

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.140 
a different group in this is a euphorbia
group<00:01:34.620> right<00:01:34.890> here<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:36.570> they<00:01:37.610> grow<00:01:38.610> all<00:01:38.850> over

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
group right here and they grow all over

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.300 
group right here and they grow all over
from<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.450> desert<00:01:39.870> to<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> mountains<00:01:40.440> they

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
from the desert to the mountains they

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.390 
from the desert to the mountains they
like<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.970> be<00:01:42.470> half<00:01:43.470> Sun<00:01:43.770> or<00:01:43.950> full<00:01:44.610> Sun<00:01:45.020> so<00:01:46.020> finer

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
like to be half Sun or full Sun so finer

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.700 
like to be half Sun or full Sun so finer
finer<00:01:47.400> parts<00:01:49.010> and<00:01:50.390> they<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:52.080> have<00:01:52.680> a

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
finer parts and they like to have a

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.520 
finer parts and they like to have a
moist<00:01:53.040> well-drained<00:01:53.400> soil<00:01:54.060> really<00:01:54.690> mm-hmm

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
moist well-drained soil really mm-hmm

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.350 
moist well-drained soil really mm-hmm
they<00:01:55.680> can<00:01:56.010> also<00:01:56.340> tolerate<00:01:56.550> cold<00:01:57.060> just

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
they can also tolerate cold just

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.630 
they can also tolerate cold just
depending<00:01:57.810> upon<00:01:57.930> their<00:01:58.409> species<00:01:58.710> yeah<00:01:58.979> well

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
depending upon their species yeah well

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.950 
depending upon their species yeah well
and<00:01:59.790> I'm<00:01:59.850> assuming<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.270> when<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.510> say<00:02:00.690> moist

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
and I'm assuming that when you say moist

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.260 
and I'm assuming that when you say moist
it<00:02:01.500> really<00:02:01.830> does<00:02:02.159> depend<00:02:02.310> on<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.610> drainage

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
it really does depend on the drainage

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.149 
it really does depend on the drainage
yeah<00:02:03.630> doesn't<00:02:04.049> want<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.260> set<00:02:04.470> in<00:02:04.620> moisture<00:02:04.830> but
