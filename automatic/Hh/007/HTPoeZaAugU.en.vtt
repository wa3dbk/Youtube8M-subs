easy to get right anyway we're talking

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.680 
easy to get right anyway we're talking
about<00:00:33.930> ND<00:00:34.440> or<00:00:34.649> neutral<00:00:35.520> density<00:00:35.730> filters<00:00:36.450> and

about ND or neutral density filters and

about ND or neutral density filters and
their<00:00:36.809> job<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.649> keep<00:00:37.890> parts<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.309> your<00:00:38.430> scene

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
their job is to keep parts of your scene

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.060 
their job is to keep parts of your scene
or<00:00:38.969> your<00:00:39.540> whole<00:00:39.809> scene<00:00:40.140> as<00:00:40.320> weel<00:00:40.739> get<00:00:40.860> into

later<00:00:41.250> from<00:00:41.790> being<00:00:42.059> too<00:00:42.480> bright<00:00:42.870> ND<00:00:43.440> gels<00:00:43.739> work

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
later from being too bright ND gels work

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.740 
later from being too bright ND gels work
a<00:00:44.040> lot<00:00:44.309> like<00:00:44.550> color<00:00:44.789> temperature<00:00:45.239> gels<00:00:45.539> and

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
a lot like color temperature gels and

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.240 
a lot like color temperature gels and
that<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:45.989> just<00:00:46.230> clip<00:00:46.500> them<00:00:46.649> onto<00:00:46.920> your<00:00:47.039> lights

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
that you just clip them onto your lights

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.160 
that you just clip them onto your lights
for<00:00:47.430> them<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.610> do<00:00:47.730> their<00:00:47.850> job<00:00:48.149> but<00:00:48.480> obviously

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
for them to do their job but obviously

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.500 
for them to do their job but obviously
we're<00:00:50.039> dealing<00:00:50.309> with<00:00:50.340> brightness<00:00:50.670> here<00:00:51.090> not

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
we're dealing with brightness here not

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.569 
we're dealing with brightness here not
color<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.289> they<00:00:52.410> have<00:00:52.530> very<00:00:53.010> different

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
color so they have very different

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.549 
color so they have very different
functions<00:00:54.090> these<00:00:54.420> gels<00:00:54.780> are<00:00:54.989> available<00:00:55.440> most

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
functions these gels are available most

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.200 
functions these gels are available most
commonly<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.190> three<00:00:56.399> grades<00:00:56.670> point<00:00:56.969> three

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
commonly in three grades point three

commonly in three grades point three
point<00:00:57.239> six<00:00:57.840> point<00:00:58.289> nine<00:00:58.379> each<00:00:58.770> getting<00:00:59.070> darker

point six point nine each getting darker

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.549 
point six point nine each getting darker
as<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.879> number<00:01:00.120> rises<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.170> higher<00:01:01.379> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
as the number rises so the higher the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.170 
as the number rises so the higher the
number<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.949> more<00:01:02.579> it's<00:01:02.699> going<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.000> knock<00:01:03.149> down

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
number the more it's going to knock down

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.759 
number the more it's going to knock down
the<00:01:03.480> intensity<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.080> light<00:01:04.229> if<00:01:04.619> your

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
the intensity of the light if your

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.679 
the intensity of the light if your
backlight<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.339> putting<00:01:05.610> too<00:01:05.790> harsh<00:01:06.060> or<00:01:06.270> rim<00:01:06.450> on

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689

your<00:01:06.810> talent<00:01:07.170> stick<00:01:07.740> an<00:01:07.890> ND<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.490> there<00:01:08.820> and

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
your talent stick an ND on there and

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.359 
your talent stick an ND on there and
help<00:01:09.479> bring<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.810> down<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:09.990> notch<00:01:10.260> simple<00:01:11.189> but

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
help bring it down a notch simple but

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.070 
help bring it down a notch simple but
what<00:01:11.790> if<00:01:11.880> your<00:01:12.030> whole<00:01:12.150> scene<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.450> too<00:01:12.810> bright

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
what if your whole scene is too bright

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.289 
what if your whole scene is too bright
well<00:01:13.380> there's<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.740> solution<00:01:14.130> for<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.700> too<00:01:14.820> and

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
well there's a solution for that too and

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.880 
well there's a solution for that too and
I<00:01:15.390> don't<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.720> mean<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:16.110> need<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.380> suck<00:01:16.619> less

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
I don't just mean you need to suck less

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.999 
I don't just mean you need to suck less
of<00:01:17.100> lighting<00:01:17.460> that's<00:01:18.330> not<00:01:18.750> doable<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:19.740> there

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
of lighting that's not doable but there

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.890 
of lighting that's not doable but there
are<00:01:20.220> nd<00:01:20.700> filters<00:01:20.909> available<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.659> screw

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
are nd filters available that screw

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.660 
are nd filters available that screw
right<00:01:22.140> onto<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.500> end<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.710> your<00:01:22.799> lens<00:01:23.009> bringing

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
right onto the end of your lens bringing

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.160 
right onto the end of your lens bringing
the<00:01:23.759> brightness<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.240> your<00:01:24.299> entire<00:01:24.630> scene<00:01:24.930> back

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
the brightness of your entire scene back

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.320 
the brightness of your entire scene back
from<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.680> surface<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.670> Sun<00:01:26.939> look<00:01:27.150> we're

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
from that surface of the Sun look we're

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.480 
from that surface of the Sun look we're
trying<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.720> avoid<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.470> env<00:01:28.829> lens<00:01:29.070> filters

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
trying to avoid the env lens filters

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.219 
trying to avoid the env lens filters
come<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> same<00:01:30.150> intensities<00:01:30.689> as<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.990> gels

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
come in the same intensities as the gels

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.080 
come in the same intensities as the gels
though<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.890> can<00:01:32.070> find<00:01:32.310> different<00:01:32.640> grades<00:01:32.880> if

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
though you can find different grades if

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.940 
though you can find different grades if
you<00:01:33.210> go<00:01:33.420> out<00:01:33.479> there<00:01:33.689> try<00:01:33.960> let's<00:01:34.530> look<00:01:34.680> back<00:01:34.890> on

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
you go out there try let's look back on

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.530 
you go out there try let's look back on
one<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.400> our<00:01:35.460> old<00:01:35.670> videos<00:01:35.970> about<00:01:36.180> depth<00:01:36.420> of

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
one of our old videos about depth of

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.260 
one of our old videos about depth of
field<00:01:36.750> will<00:01:37.259> tell<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.560> hear<00:01:38.000> that<00:01:39.000> one<00:01:39.150> of

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
field will tell you hear that one of

field will tell you hear that one of

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
your factors that determines the depth
