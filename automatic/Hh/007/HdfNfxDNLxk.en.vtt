disturbing we're finding from results of

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.350 
disturbing we're finding from results of
population<00:00:53.039> studies<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.550> fluoride<00:00:53.820> reduces

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
population studies that fluoride reduces

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.689 
population studies that fluoride reduces
IQ<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:54.960> children<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.039> very<00:00:56.219> serious

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
IQ and children it's a very serious

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.700 
IQ and children it's a very serious
problem<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.180> introduce<00:00:57.809> fluoride<00:00:58.350> into<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
problem to introduce fluoride into the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.260 
problem to introduce fluoride into the
human<00:00:58.890> body<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.370> not<00:00:59.430> supposed<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.879> be<00:01:00.059> there

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
human body it's not supposed to be there

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.930 
human body it's not supposed to be there
there's<00:01:01.170> no<00:01:01.440> minimum<00:01:01.710> daily<00:01:02.100> requirement<00:01:02.250> for

there's no minimum daily requirement for

there's no minimum daily requirement for
Floyd<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.449> very<00:01:03.660> poisonous<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:06.360> have

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
Floyd it's very poisonous and so we have

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.380 
Floyd it's very poisonous and so we have
fluoride<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.020> toothpaste<00:01:08.090> turns<00:01:09.090> out<00:01:09.270> that

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
fluoride in toothpaste turns out that

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.820 
fluoride in toothpaste turns out that
there's<00:01:09.600> enough<00:01:09.900> fluoride<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> tube<00:01:10.710> of

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
there's enough fluoride in a tube of

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.130 
there's enough fluoride in a tube of
toothpaste<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.340> kill<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> small<00:01:11.729> child<00:01:12.210> but

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
that that fluoride is mixing with the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.260 
that that fluoride is mixing with the
hydrochloric<00:01:35.130> acid<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.640> stomach<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.180> it

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
hydrochloric acid in the stomach and it

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.090 
hydrochloric acid in the stomach and it
turns<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.570> hydrofluoric<00:01:37.079> acid<00:01:37.320> which<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.829> very

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
turns to hydrofluoric acid which is very

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.010 
turns to hydrofluoric acid which is very
nasty<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> kid<00:01:38.970> your<00:01:39.270> child<00:01:39.540> really<00:01:39.750> does

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
nasty in the kid your child really does

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.289 
nasty in the kid your child really does
have<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> stomachache<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.130> he's<00:01:41.850> poisoning

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
have a stomachache and he's poisoning

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.550 
have a stomachache and he's poisoning
himself<00:01:42.420> with<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.780> toothpaste<00:01:43.200> because<00:01:43.439> he's

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
himself with a toothpaste because he's

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.249 
himself with a toothpaste because he's
swallowing<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.299> so<00:01:45.299> if<00:01:45.570> you've<00:01:46.020> probably

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
swallowing it so if you've probably
