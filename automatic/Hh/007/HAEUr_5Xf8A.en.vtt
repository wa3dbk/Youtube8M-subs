00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 reaction lips like this in the day 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.020
 today we are going to review a special case 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.900
 something good that's happening on radio the 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.910
 true as many know the sanction that 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.210
 has always been applied in radio has been 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:19.080
 first a three day handling and then 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.510
 evaluate in your case and decide if your account 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.510
 is sanctioned permanently or is 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.900
 liberated and good usually always 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.090
 side was men and currently the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.130
 things are currently changing the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.739
 penalties if they detect you with some 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.719
 illegal program which or by some error 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.550
 of the game your account ends up being 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.649
 way gives you sanctions so 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.570
 permanent this is the case of many and 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.129
 that's why I'm doing this video without 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.800
 But I see also that 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.520
 many people who are appealing to 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.280
 this is being given that option that 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.140
 option of a month and that you are going in a month 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.449
 and then they will return the account to you 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.160
 passed this month and that is not only in the 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.190
 current cases but in the cases 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.870
 previous years ago I already tried 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.430
 with an account that was once 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.260
 disconnected 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.660
 was in the game was disconnected me 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.220
 bathed was very small and did not know what 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.130
 do not know if exclamar and everything 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.050
 then I remembered and remembered in my 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.229
 case after my case for attention to 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.120
 client to raquel and he attended and good 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.620
 my account will be released within a month 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.979
 then what we are going to do is 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.900
 just go go to customer service 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.540
 I leave the link in the description of 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.540
 video review what and once they're 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.490
 here they are going to contact us and exposes in 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.040
 your case explain that your account has been 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.800
 valid for no reason or if you have abused 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.540
 illegal program say it honestly 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.970
 because if they have been sanctioned in a way 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.220
 permanent good some reason must have 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.290
 and if there is no also say it in case 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.360
 If they have used and their account is 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.240
 sanctioned by the use of some program 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.860
 illegally say it and explain that never 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.810
 before they had been validated then the 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.360
 answer what reactions they will do is due 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.490
 they do not have a history of banning 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.890
 where it appears that you have already used 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.869
 that previously they will sanction it for a 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.149
 month starting from the day you 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.580
 respond and in a month they can have their 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.390
 account so I guess this this 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.420
 help to 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.450
 many do it please this take advantage 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.090
 are you this opportunity to make them 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.340
 ratio me and do not waste it or not 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.380
 commit again the error that already 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.080
 they committed at some point I wish them 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.660
 good luck if they respond with a 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.760
 negative I suggest you insist that 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.220
 send another message again because 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.620
 Maybe they are taken care of before I leave 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.959
 I wanted to thank everyone yesterday I made a 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.800
 video and good singing a song a 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.380
 rap 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.650
 that I wrote myself for raquel and good 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.720
 and I received a lot of criticism, the good thing is that 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.670
 they were constructive criticisms all me 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.440
 they said the track was very high friends 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.470
 it was not heard and I thank everyone 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.930
 that I get a gift like in this 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.420
 video in the rap video I put it in mode 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.459
 hidden so if you have the link you can 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.650
 keep watching it I put it like that because 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.769
 because what I was looking for were criticisms 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.320
 help me improve and I got it that way 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.480
 I'm going to record the video again not 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.760
 I have a great voice let's say to do 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.829
 songs not even to do these 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.780

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.970

 make a kind of video clip and what 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.410
 would go back up publicly and 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.310
 I thank everyone for following me
