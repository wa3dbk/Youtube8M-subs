00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
all back together simple and clean and

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.729 
all back together simple and clean and
I'm<00:02:18.310> telling<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:18.700> when<00:02:18.880> I<00:02:18.940> say<00:02:19.239> that<00:02:19.870> that<00:02:20.319> jet

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
I'm telling you when I say that that jet

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.210 
I'm telling you when I say that that jet
replacing<00:02:21.549> this<00:02:21.940> jet<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.569> this<00:02:23.220> emulsion

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
replacing this jet and this emulsion

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.940 
replacing this jet and this emulsion
tube<00:02:24.780> makes<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.959> biggest<00:02:26.170> difference<00:02:26.440> on

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
tube makes the biggest difference on

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.690 
tube makes the biggest difference on
these<00:02:27.250> 212<00:02:27.819> engines<00:02:28.239> from<00:02:28.959> Harbor<00:02:29.380> Freight<00:02:29.700> it

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
these 212 engines from Harbor Freight it

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.370 
these 212 engines from Harbor Freight it
gets<00:02:30.940> rid<00:02:31.120> of<00:02:31.180> a<00:02:31.329> lot<00:02:31.360> of<00:02:31.510> that<00:02:31.630> surging<00:02:32.140> and

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
gets rid of a lot of that surging and

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.920 
gets rid of a lot of that surging and
other<00:02:32.500> stuff<00:02:32.829> that<00:02:32.860> you<00:02:33.069> have<00:02:33.250> with<00:02:33.579> these

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
other stuff that you have with these

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.930 
other stuff that you have with these
anyway<00:02:35.130> I'm<00:02:36.130> going<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.430> show<00:02:36.609> you<00:02:36.700> one<00:02:36.819> more

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
anyway I'm going to show you one more

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.090 
anyway I'm going to show you one more
thing<00:02:37.000> here<00:02:37.359> in<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.510> second<00:02:37.870> that<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:38.019> do<00:02:38.079> hang<00:02:38.920> on

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
thing here in a second that I do hang on

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.090 
thing here in a second that I do hang on
I<00:02:39.130> got<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.370> turn<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.970> engine<00:02:40.120> over<00:02:41.100> here's

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
I got to turn the engine over here's

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.250 
I got to turn the engine over here's
another<00:02:42.400> fix<00:02:42.730> that<00:02:42.910> I<00:02:43.000> do<00:02:43.060> on<00:02:43.359> these<00:02:43.600> it<00:02:44.109> works

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
another fix that I do on these it works

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.410 
another fix that I do on these it works
really<00:02:44.440> well<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.950> don't<00:02:45.910> know<00:02:45.970> if<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.090> can<00:02:46.180> see

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
really well I don't know if you can see

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.710 
really well I don't know if you can see
it<00:02:46.540> in<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.870> dark<00:02:47.049> here<00:02:47.410> but<00:02:47.459> there's<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.880> little

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
it in the dark here but there's a little

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.809 
it in the dark here but there's a little
zip<00:02:50.019> tie<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.620> what<00:02:51.400> you<00:02:51.489> do<00:02:51.670> is<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:52.870> take<00:02:53.079> two

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
zip tie and what you do is you take two

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.870 
zip tie and what you do is you take two
zip<00:02:54.819> ties<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:56.560> cut<00:02:56.799> the<00:02:56.980> locking<00:02:57.549> end<00:02:57.730> off

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
zip ties and you cut the locking end off

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.610 
zip ties and you cut the locking end off
of<00:02:58.410> one<00:03:00.720> then<00:03:01.720> you<00:03:01.840> slide<00:03:02.109> the<00:03:02.139> zip<00:03:02.440> tie

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
of one then you slide the zip tie

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.379 
of one then you slide the zip tie
through<00:03:02.650> this<00:03:03.130> spring<00:03:03.639> for<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.680> governor<00:03:06.389> and

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
through this spring for the governor and

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.150 
through this spring for the governor and
you<00:03:07.510> want<00:03:07.690> to<00:03:07.750> leave<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:07.989> a<00:03:08.170> little<00:03:08.500> loose<00:03:08.769> you

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
you want to leave it a little loose you

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.009 
you want to leave it a little loose you
know<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.519> little<00:03:09.760> a<00:03:10.000> little<00:03:10.239> slack<00:03:10.540> in<00:03:10.750> it<00:03:10.810> so

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
know a little a little slack in it so

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.680 
know a little a little slack in it so
can<00:03:11.230> move<00:03:12.329> and<00:03:13.329> all<00:03:13.450> you<00:03:13.540> can<00:03:13.690> see<00:03:13.870> you

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
can move and all you can see you

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.880 
can move and all you can see you
and<00:03:15.840> moves<00:03:16.020> back<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.410> forth<00:03:16.470> in<00:03:16.740> there<00:03:16.860> a

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
and moves back and forth in there a

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.630 
and moves back and forth in there a
little<00:03:17.010> bit<00:03:17.300> and<00:03:19.160> that<00:03:20.160> helps<00:03:20.430> with<00:03:20.550> the

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
little bit and that helps with the

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.400 
little bit and that helps with the
surging<00:03:21.030> -<00:03:21.270> and<00:03:21.870> what<00:03:22.020> you<00:03:22.110> do<00:03:22.170> is<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.380> just

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
surging - and what you do is you just

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.520 
surging - and what you do is you just
zip<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.220> down<00:03:23.660> until<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:25.020> know<00:03:25.110> I<00:03:25.140> got<00:03:25.320> about<00:03:25.470> a

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
zip it down until you know I got about a

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.070 
zip it down until you know I got about a
what<00:03:25.760> half<00:03:26.760> but<00:03:27.330> I'm<00:03:27.420> going<00:03:27.570> to<00:03:27.630> quarter-inch

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
what half but I'm going to quarter-inch

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.500 
what half but I'm going to quarter-inch
there<00:03:28.320> half<00:03:28.680> inch<00:03:28.890> there<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.390> it<00:03:30.390> works

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
there half inch there and it works

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.580 
there half inch there and it works
perfect<00:03:30.960> for<00:03:30.990> when<00:03:31.260> this<00:03:31.350> thing<00:03:31.560> is

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
perfect for when this thing is

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.800 
perfect for when this thing is
accelerating<00:03:32.310> so<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.270> when<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.540> starts<00:03:33.750> to

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
accelerating so that when it starts to

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.200 
accelerating so that when it starts to
surge<00:03:34.140> you<00:03:34.410> can<00:03:34.530> really<00:03:34.710> pull<00:03:35.040> on<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:35.610> it

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
surge you can really pull on it and it

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.380 
surge you can really pull on it and it
actually<00:03:36.330> makes<00:03:36.780> that<00:03:36.990> spring<00:03:37.860> solid<00:03:38.580> really

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
actually makes that spring solid really

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.200 
actually makes that spring solid really
good<00:03:39.570> set<00:03:39.810> up<00:03:39.960> really<00:03:40.140> works<00:03:40.350> nice<00:03:41.030> so<00:03:42.030> there's

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
good set up really works nice so there's

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.640 
good set up really works nice so there's
a<00:03:42.300> couple<00:03:42.510> of<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.810> little<00:03:42.990> fixes<00:03:43.320> you<00:03:43.440> can<00:03:43.560> do

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
a couple of the little fixes you can do

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.620 
a couple of the little fixes you can do
one<00:03:43.860> is<00:03:43.980> that<00:03:44.100> emulsion<00:03:44.610> tube<00:03:44.850> and<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.210> jet

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
one is that emulsion tube and that jet

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.200 
one is that emulsion tube and that jet
9-millimeter<00:03:46.470> jet<00:03:46.740> 140m<00:03:47.490> Olsson<00:03:47.760> tube<00:03:47.970> and

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
9-millimeter jet 140m Olsson tube and

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.230 
9-millimeter jet 140m Olsson tube and
then<00:03:48.930> this<00:03:49.110> is<00:03:49.260> a<00:03:49.290> free-fixed<00:03:49.800> zip<00:03:50.430> tie<00:03:50.670> works

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
then this is a free-fixed zip tie works

00:03:51.240 --> 00:04:03.870 
then this is a free-fixed zip tie works
really<00:03:51.480> well<00:03:51.690> on<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:51.930> governor<00:03:52.700> good<00:03:53.700> luck

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.940 

you
