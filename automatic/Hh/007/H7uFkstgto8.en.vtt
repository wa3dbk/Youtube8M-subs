00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.900
 a scream of fainting after one 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.910
 duel 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.980
 What looks like an everyday foul 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.340
 in football times that are so rough 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:29.250
 it is shocking the fourteenth of august 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:30.359
 1981 is the second Bundesliga matchday 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.090
 it is a problem for me 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.640
 that was on the agenda that you as 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.540
 Striker at the ballgame together 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.360
 was kicked 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.260
 and then we came up against the game 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.200
 Bielefeld 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.670
 that's the scene as it goes left 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.710
 at the edge of the picture ewald lienen the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.289
 left outside and norbert one sees the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.719
 Fullback from Werder Bremen 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.460
 hertha player unit is a brutal one 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.500
 Foul pay attention to the right 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.359
 thighs of lienen because we were then 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.969
 have lived in a time where we as 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.199
 Striker like a game of running around 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.270
 So I did not want to go 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.939
 hurt that can be very slow it was 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.920
 a coincidence and accident becomes a wound 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.320
 to the memorial and to a suspicion 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.030
 and he believes the guilty for this 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.689
 foul to have found them the four 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.869
 on Werder coach Otto Rehhagel go 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:24.270
 They want to hear that Rehhagel in 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.250
 his bremer opponent prompted 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.250
 next time against them 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.130
 neat to go to the thing 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.550
 the fouled reha believes that 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.960
 them that had once been a sign 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.180
 so gave me no sign 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.700
 The striker is still lamenting 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.729
 bedside it is for me completely 1 through 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.170
 a deliberate intentional 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.810
 I've been hurting myself 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.520
 also the football professional will react 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.190
 and querdenker wants to know are 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.350
 Such fuls are punishable 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:02:02.750
 criminal charges remain inconclusive though 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:04.790
 you see one feels persecuted , one sees one 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:12.980
 branded as a flagship object of a 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:14.870
 flap generation lines within 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.120
 four weeks healthy in the return match 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.250
 On seeing one can do without bremen 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.200
 be careful otto rehhagel him no 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.940
 to demonstrate that was one 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.700
 bulletproof vest under his anorak 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.380
 at bremen victory in bielefeld one has 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.470
 Before a game before the game for sure 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.900
 put in again 31 years later 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.150
 bielefeld brings the specialist magazine kicker 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.739
 serve and siekmann 2012 again for the first time 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.739
 together a reconciliation 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.160
 also not correct was a way 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.740
 for each other it was for him 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.380
 intentional for years 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.569
 and I do not know how to serve 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.489
 conciliatory words 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.840
 the pitch had the I in the 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.069
 moment in the thighs in 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.230
 had met thigh that there 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.780
 this spectacular wound has come 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:08.359
 a wound now really closed 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.359
 is for lienen and also for siekmann
