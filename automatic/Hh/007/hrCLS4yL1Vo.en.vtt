going<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.690> start<00:02:37.989> by<00:02:38.140> drawing<00:02:38.200> light<00:02:38.739> lines

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
going to start by drawing light lines

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.380 
going to start by drawing light lines
the<00:02:41.019> lines<00:02:41.319> won't<00:02:41.860> show<00:02:42.250> until<00:02:43.030> you<00:02:43.209> make

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
the lines won't show until you make

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.720 
the lines won't show until you make
several<00:02:43.780> light<00:02:44.200> lines<00:02:44.500> on<00:02:44.860> top<00:02:45.190> of<00:02:45.370> each<00:02:45.519> other

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
several light lines on top of each other

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.979 
several light lines on top of each other
that's<00:02:46.299> the<00:02:46.540> key<00:02:46.840> we<00:02:47.769> want<00:02:47.950> to<00:02:48.040> keep<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.340> light

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
that's the key we want to keep it light

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.630 
that's the key we want to keep it light
that<00:02:49.989> way<00:02:50.110> if<00:02:50.230> you<00:02:50.349> make<00:02:50.470> a<00:02:50.530> mistake<00:02:50.709> you<00:02:51.519> don't

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
that way if you make a mistake you don't

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.140 
that way if you make a mistake you don't
see<00:02:51.970> it

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
see it

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.440 
see it
for<00:02:52.870> example<00:02:54.030> enjoy<00:02:56.670> pardon<00:02:57.670> my<00:02:57.790> intrusion

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
for example enjoy pardon my intrusion

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.479 
for example enjoy pardon my intrusion
but<00:02:58.959> if<00:02:59.079> you're<00:02:59.200> not<00:02:59.349> using<00:02:59.560> an<00:02:59.769> easel<00:03:00.190> or<00:03:00.430> a

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
but if you're not using an easel or a

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.150 
but if you're not using an easel or a
wall<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.170> you're<00:03:02.170> using<00:03:02.319> a<00:03:02.530> flat<00:03:02.799> surface

such as a table or a desk you would do

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.000 
such as a table or a desk you would do
the<00:03:06.370> same<00:03:06.760> method<00:03:07.049> standing<00:03:08.049> up<00:03:08.200> over<00:03:08.410> your

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
the same method standing up over your

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.849 
the same method standing up over your
paper<00:03:09.310> like<00:03:09.819> civil<00:03:12.359> side<00:03:13.359> the<00:03:13.599> side<00:03:13.870> with<00:03:14.829> your

paper like civil side the side with your
whole<00:03:15.190> arm<00:03:15.519> create<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:16.299> straight<00:03:16.569> line<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.890> up

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
whole arm create a straight line and up

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.849 
whole arm create a straight line and up
and<00:03:18.310> down<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.900> want<00:03:20.079> to<00:03:20.139> use<00:03:20.230> your<00:03:20.380> shoulders

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
and down you want to use your shoulders

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:27.210 
and down you want to use your shoulders
in<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.099> same<00:03:21.370> way<00:03:21.700> oh<00:03:23.819> down<00:03:25.859> keep<00:03:26.859> the<00:03:27.010> lines

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
in the same way oh down keep the lines

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.960 
in the same way oh down keep the lines
light<00:03:27.489> now<00:03:28.450> back<00:03:28.810> to<00:03:29.109> the<00:03:29.500> list

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
light now back to the list

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.940 
light now back to the list
I'm<00:03:31.390> drawing<00:03:31.810> straight<00:03:32.620> line<00:03:32.920> up<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:33.460> down

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
I'm drawing straight line up and down

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.210 
I'm drawing straight line up and down
whoops

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
whoops

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.860 
whoops
slipped<00:03:36.880> up<00:03:37.300> you<00:03:38.170> see<00:03:38.350> that<00:03:38.500> mistake<00:03:38.940> now<00:03:39.940> you

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
slipped up you see that mistake now you

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.460 
slipped up you see that mistake now you
can't<00:03:41.110> even<00:03:41.170> see<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.500> line<00:03:41.650> I<00:03:41.710> started<00:03:43.470> we

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
can't even see the line I started we

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.970 
can't even see the line I started we
want<00:03:44.680> that<00:03:44.830> line<00:03:45.100> to<00:03:45.390> gradually<00:03:46.390> show<00:03:46.660> up<00:03:46.980> by

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
want that line to gradually show up by

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.820 
want that line to gradually show up by
piling<00:03:48.550> light<00:03:48.820> lines<00:03:49.180> on<00:03:49.600> top<00:03:50.260> of<00:03:50.470> each<00:03:50.590> other

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
piling light lines on top of each other

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.420 
piling light lines on top of each other
so<00:03:51.750> when<00:03:52.750> we<00:03:52.900> make<00:03:53.080> mistakes<00:03:53.110> whoops

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
so when we make mistakes whoops

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.300 
so when we make mistakes whoops
we<00:03:55.300> don't<00:03:55.450> really<00:03:55.630> see<00:03:55.780> it<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:59.560> best<00:03:59.800> artists

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
we don't really see it the best artists

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:08.850 
we don't really see it the best artists
never<00:04:00.850> need<00:04:01.150> erasers<00:04:01.690> this<00:04:02.590> is<00:04:02.740> why

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.040 

now<00:04:09.460> I<00:04:09.790> don't<00:04:10.060> know<00:04:10.120> how<00:04:10.270> well<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.630> cameras

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
now I don't know how well the cameras

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.310 
now I don't know how well the cameras
picking<00:04:11.290> this<00:04:11.500> up<00:04:12.330> but<00:04:13.330> eventually<00:04:13.690> you

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
picking this up but eventually you

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.130 
picking this up but eventually you
should<00:04:14.350> start<00:04:14.800> to<00:04:14.950> see<00:04:14.980> a<00:04:15.130> line<00:04:15.400> up<00:04:15.580> here<00:04:16.140> you

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
should start to see a line up here you

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.810 
should start to see a line up here you
see<00:04:17.350> a<00:04:17.380> line<00:04:17.620> on<00:04:17.830> the<00:04:17.920> paper<00:04:20.459> I'm<00:04:21.459> going<00:04:21.640> to<00:04:21.700> go

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
see a line on the paper I'm going to go

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.530 
see a line on the paper I'm going to go
ahead<00:04:21.910> and<00:04:22.390> pile<00:04:23.110> more<00:04:23.440> light<00:04:23.680> lines<00:04:23.920> on<00:04:24.130> top

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.510 

so<00:04:28.540> you<00:04:28.570> can<00:04:28.720> see<00:04:28.990> it<00:04:29.080> better<00:04:29.260> you<00:04:29.920> see<00:04:30.250> that

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
so you can see it better you see that

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.290 
so you can see it better you see that
slight<00:04:31.350> lying<00:04:32.350> on<00:04:32.620> there<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:33.730> key<00:04:33.940> is<00:04:34.090> to<00:04:34.270> keep

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
slight lying on there the key is to keep

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.180 
slight lying on there the key is to keep
it<00:04:34.600> light

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
it light

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.760 
it light
once<00:04:36.190> your<00:04:36.370> line<00:04:36.550> appears<00:04:37.000> I<00:04:37.590> want<00:04:38.590> you<00:04:38.650> to

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
once your line appears I want you to

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.840 
once your line appears I want you to
draw<00:04:39.060> another<00:04:40.060> line<00:04:40.180> next<00:04:40.840> to<00:04:41.020> it<00:04:41.640> just<00:04:42.640> to

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
draw another line next to it just to

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.310 
draw another line next to it just to
practice<00:04:43.060> up<00:04:43.570> and<00:04:43.930> down<00:04:44.320> up<00:04:44.680> and<00:04:45.010> down<00:04:46.320> now

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
practice up and down up and down now

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.050 
practice up and down up and down now
some<00:04:47.620> of<00:04:47.650> you<00:04:47.920> might<00:04:48.130> end<00:04:48.310> up<00:04:48.430> with<00:04:48.610> curves

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
some of you might end up with curves

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.660 
some of you might end up with curves
that's<00:04:49.690> because<00:04:50.110> you're<00:04:50.230> using<00:04:50.470> too<00:04:51.310> much<00:04:51.490> of

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
that's because you're using too much of

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.830 
that's because you're using too much of
your<00:04:51.820> arm<00:04:52.060> and<00:04:52.390> wrist<00:04:52.600> in<00:04:53.010> this<00:04:54.010> motion<00:04:54.750> like<00:04:55.750> a

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
your arm and wrist in this motion like a

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.820 
your arm and wrist in this motion like a
windshield<00:04:56.140> wiper<00:04:57.300> we<00:04:58.300> don't<00:04:58.450> want<00:04:58.600> that<00:04:58.830> you

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
windshield wiper we don't want that you

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.150 
windshield wiper we don't want that you
want<00:04:59.860> to<00:05:00.070> use<00:05:00.160> your<00:05:00.310> whole<00:05:00.580> the<00:05:01.540> whole<00:05:01.780> arm

want to use your whole the whole arm
moving<00:05:03.160> it<00:05:03.400> up<00:05:03.640> and<00:05:03.910> down<00:05:04.690> like<00:05:04.990> this<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:06.340> draw

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
moving it up and down like this to draw

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.900 
moving it up and down like this to draw
a<00:05:06.580> steady<00:05:07.110> straight

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.160

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
up and down you may notice that some of

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.940 
up and down you may notice that some of
the<00:05:15.320> lines<00:05:15.560> are<00:05:17.230> looks<00:05:18.230> a<00:05:18.380> little<00:05:18.500> thick

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
the lines are looks a little thick

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.680 
the lines are looks a little thick
