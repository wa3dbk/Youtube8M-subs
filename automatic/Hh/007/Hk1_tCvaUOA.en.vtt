00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.300
 good morning to all thanks a lot to tom's 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.980
 invitation hardware we are more contacts 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.830
 with panasonic and to present the new 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.379
 toughbook cf c2 that inside the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.529
 our toughbook range fits into the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.820
 rugged seed category these new 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.010
 computer enter that mounts windows 8 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.949
 has an ips screen that increases 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.390
 greatly the viewing angle is one 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.820
 multitouch capacitive screen 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.620
 fivefingers usable therefore with the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.960
 hand or with the stylus the technology 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.790
 integrated wacom also allows the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.430
 possibility of continuous application 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.620
 biometric useful in the health field o 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.160
 for horne collection for agents of 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.420
 sale 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.789
 the rotation of the screen is therefore 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.230
 possible thanks to the triple hinge 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:59.640
 which allows you to position the computer 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.160
 in tablet mode the pin 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.159
 mobile in such a way that in the moment 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.170
 where the screen accidentally rests 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.900
 does not ruin the pin does not happen 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.420
 nothing tablet mode is certain c2 turns out 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.880
 extremely portable thanks to this 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.710
 removable ergonomic support that 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.380
 allows use with one hand 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.270
 the lightness of the product is another 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.280
 indispensable feature for the 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.890
 sales agents who work all the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.570
 day in the territory together with this 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.270
 another key feature is 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.280
 battery life thanks to 6 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.160
 cells of our batteries we arrive 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.930
 up to 11 hours of autonomy 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.850
 otherwise an option is also available 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.979
 3 cell battery for 5 hours of 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.600
 autonomy or you can go up to 15 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.550
 hours of battery life with a 9 battery 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.850
 cells for those who need a high one 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.490
 autonomy in the field the toughbook cf cv e 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.060
 has a hot swap technology for the 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.130
 battery 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.310
 this means that it is possible 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.289
 replace the hot battery without 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.479
 machine interruption itself 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.869
 all thanks to a buffer battery 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.210
 the slams that allows precisely the 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.640
 machine change without sponge 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.709
 itself doing instead an overview for 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.500
 regarding the interfaces of this 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:17.670
 new product we have two laterally 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.190
 USB 3.0 ports for rapid rapid 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.549
 data transfer 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:27.420
 an hdmi port on this side instead 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:31.350
 we present a USB 2.0 and a port 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.240
 carries a characteristic network port 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.670
 instead unique 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.420
 the toughbook cf 2 is the possibility of 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.300
 configure additional ports one single 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.310
 certainly the necessary serial port 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.530
 for the maintenance technicians the engineers who 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.450
 they need to connect to 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.250
 further industrial equipment beyond 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.080
 to the serial port and there is also the 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.260
 possibility to always integrate on 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.650
 this side a lie form for whom 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.880
 needs to connect to videos that 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:06.720
 precisely integrate vga technology 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.820
 nfc module and bar with river from this 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.820
 on the other hand it is possible to integrate an area 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.220
 room then a full hd room 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.750
 finally to complete the configurability 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.000
 of the car on this side is 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.330
 You can insert a smart card reader 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.580
 reader or thing airprint that together 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.920
 to the nfc module we have mentioned 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.740
 first appear to be elements 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.150
 essential for data security 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.780
 used within the sector 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.150
 sanitary 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.360
 regarding connectivity 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.880
 we obviously have a wifi module a 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.500
 bluetooth module and the possibility of 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.950
 integrate a sim to also have a 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:48.210
 module 3g like all the products of the 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.190
 our range if miranda the cfc 2 resists 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:53.060
 to bumps to vibrations to falls from 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.920
 73 centimeters and to the payment 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.690
 accidental fluid on the screen e 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.940
 on the keyboard 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.310
 the toughbook cerci 2 will be available in 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.490
 all of europe starting from December to 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.360
 price of 2,149 euros for the model 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.190
 standard 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.570
 thanks again tom's hardware for 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.050
 attention to the next 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.050
 product
