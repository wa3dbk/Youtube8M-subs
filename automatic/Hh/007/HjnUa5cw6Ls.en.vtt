city<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:13.230> they<00:00:13.799> thought<00:00:14.009> that<00:00:14.309> something

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
city and so they thought that something

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.160 
city and so they thought that something
being<00:00:15.059> close<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.599> ocean<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.139> waves

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
was part of it and they knew that we

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.519 
was part of it and they knew that we
were<00:00:18.570> going<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.779> have<00:00:18.869> working<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.439> know
