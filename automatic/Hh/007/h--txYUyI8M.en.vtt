00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.640
 after the notorious 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.689
 bankruptcy interplete became famous 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.300
 also whose company were 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.230
 the rise of the wing one of these companies became 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.759
 blake web studio 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.300
 Well done thorough 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.329
 mikhailov did not lower their heads and 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:30.999
 again decided to take up the old 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:32.850
 and start your business with a clean 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:33.500
 sheet 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.450
 as a result, and formed 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.360
 company discussed inter prima 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.010
 It was founded in 2010 in California 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.270
 famous people also stood at the helm 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.000
 Chris Parker the first collection fact not he 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.450
 passed not without reason monochrome 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.590
 in July, staff 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.060
 replenished with another equally important 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.150
 that person was George 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.049
 Soros distinguished Montyan 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:58.529
 that at one time I did a big 

00:00:58.529 --> 00:01:00.350
 a piece of important work 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.280
 Vlasenko and Louis van der he 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.870
 The first project of the new company has become 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.320
 2 who know many fans of the genre 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.130
 after which guys 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.520
 engaged in the development of measures 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.460
 boarding school 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.549
 fathers of lots had big plans for 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:14.590
 this game 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.160
 in the end they tried to dislodge 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.820
 around 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.659
 so much that in my opinion turned out 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.530
 the vinaigrette 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.119
 the dual of paradise market left a controversial 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.580
 protocol and finally so they got to pugalka 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.020
 nineteenth of october 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.830
 2010 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.410
 he had a lot 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.090
 hopes 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.990
 but not all of them were justified 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.210
 let's take it in order 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.700
 the game was developed on pretty good 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.920
 We are already outdated at that time Bishkek 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.830
 embryos 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.950
 the engine is very old but constantly 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.050
 modifying 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.720
 great gendry feature about good 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.990
 susceptibility to all modern 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.500
 world forum 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.390
 I think of course the pocket 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.400
 previously it was released in such games 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.909
 as 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.230
 client level 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.570
 the picture is certainly not perfect but 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.980
 pretty nice 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.230
 when developed 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.640
 series founders 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.650
 and it was visible from the very first minutes 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.950
 but of course the influence of ssd also made itself felt 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.119
 know the atmosphere is not vegas very much 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.159
 approached the first two parts 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.689
 technically it was the same creative 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:16.199
 labs but with some 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:17.339
 modifications 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:20.099
 one of the innovations is quite control 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.109
 allies 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.569
 team folio meeting to our assistants we 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.279
 were given through dialogue 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:27.339
 I think this menu was implemented 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:30.039
 only for a tick weapon did not suffer 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:31.170
 huge changes 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.080
 with the exception of its modifications by 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.680
 joining to him of all kinds 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.269
 sights 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.729
 and other Labuda 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:39.129
 Now they do it all and sundry 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.839
 nothing interesting again developers 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:42.529
 decided to go by trodden 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:45.309
 paths we requested several ministers 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:48.139
 It seems not the state budget and they sew they thought 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:50.459
 and so appeared in rarely one-armed 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.189
 gangster and would gfk as I remember that 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:54.969
 put there all your th 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:56.889
 but all this we have already seen 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.320
 that's probably all our developers 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.629
 out of five days 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.409
 the story is strangely sad too how am I 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:04.750
 deleted games in which 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.089
 on the first line 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:08.049
 kills everything that happened to him 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.529
 good by example, do not go far 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:11.819
 same stalker 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.449
 has the exact same plot 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:15.409
 we are digging up robots 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:16.839
 in the coming days of the meadows 

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:18.629
 for us and put on our feet 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.669
 because our relationship is taxes and 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:21.769
 specifications 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.289
 this technique is widely used to create 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:26.430
 we go in search of bandits 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.209
 which in turn did not commit 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.769
 assault 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.359
 we leave town a town and not terrible 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:34.319
 has anyone seen our enemies 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.609
 in the end we will find out who is free in the same 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.749
 time with the past seeing chips on 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:40.289
 which is very important 

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:41.259
 information 

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:42.919
 although I think the main plot is not 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.639
 first-class but still it has 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.179
 some very interesting turns 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:48.929
 the most weighty thing they brought with them 

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:51.239
 obsidian is freedom of choice 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.560
 that is, one task we can perform with 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.469
 in several ways for example 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:57.659
 the same thing we can give to the owner or 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:58.649
 to keep for yourself 

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:00.749
 very interesting moment in the game this 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:03.489
 faction ndp and there is a lot of will 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.169
 cosmonauts gang of flights legionnaires 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:07.419
 and so on 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:09.140
 I liked the monastery 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.009
 it was formed very simply 

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:12.959
 seeking refuge guys outside 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.369
 the buildings of the king there they found posters with 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:17.739
 King of the king's music we give where he 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:18.499
 dancing 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:20.559
 and of course they decided to imitate him 

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:22.300
 and as long as the alliance 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.170
 thought you understood what kind of king 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.300
 The reputation of the factions appeared as in many 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.759
 foreign cars in a row 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.229
 that is, earning a reputation by working on 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:31.879
 those or other gentleman we 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:33.800
 get access to different possibilities 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.919
 before the game we are offered 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.509
 choose normal or rink mode 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.270
 thought called hardcore speaks for itself 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.400
 choosing this mode our tests 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.840
 become complicated at times 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.889
 this hardcore 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.090
 undoubtedly for true fans 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.180
 series 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.500
 the highlight of any game would be congresses and is 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.639
 map editor 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.099
 this time it was possible to use 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.690
 map editor as original palau 3 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.220
 so and future especially for her 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.039
 the most 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:04:59.849
 Hector 1.6 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:02.209
 I have one vegas very interesting 

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:03.629
 a reference to one of my favorites 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:04.639
 books 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.569
 the game has a task called 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:07.930
 she obeys 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.810
 it can be passed by children 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.270
 fear of a mustache with a golf club under the pot 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.749
 Andrew Vine 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:15.819
 after beslan andrew and is the name 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:17.270
 this mission 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.169
 book megas was released four 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:20.029
 additions 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:22.690
 which are somehow related to the age 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.349
 unlike the same palau 3 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:27.339
 the first addition is called the dead 

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:28.099
 money 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:29.979
 following the radio signal gg 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.259
 come across a man named elijah 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:34.189
 was also planning a heist using 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:35.770
 three people and offers us 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.669
 will join rob us 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.990
 will be a casino in gray andre ayu go 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.199
 rumors that the store of this casino is the border 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:43.559
 untold wealth 

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:45.459
 initially we have to find three 

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:47.009
 personalities that will help play 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:49.619
 genius this is the mountain mutants girl 

00:05:49.619 --> 00:05:52.479
 next honest heart additions 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.419
 here the player will have to become a member 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.050
 fighting between two tribes 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.729
 savages third supplement and probably 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.189
 the most successful one of the old world 

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:03.009
 but we will have to follow the old 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:05.080
 research center and last 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.409
 supplement called lonely 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.000
 our hero will recognize him 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.160
 that he is not the only one 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.909
 was given to instruct platinum and schools 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:14.540
 return will not give 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.660
 attended by such quite famous 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.430
 actors like motive of city hall ron perlman 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.710
 Chris Christofferson 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.270
 Danny Treho 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.369
 and it's time to draw a line 

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:26.559
 the plan is still the best game 

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:27.800
 quantity rights 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.509
 and he is unlikely to have a decent 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:30.439
 competitor of the year 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:32.239
 but still never fallout 

00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:34.059
 such as the first two parts 

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:35.779
 he himself was not at this year comment 

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:37.729
 rate and please 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:39.149
 subscribe to new meetings
