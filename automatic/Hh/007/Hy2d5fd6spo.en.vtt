00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 olate with out as there is a question that 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.509
 surely many people do and it is 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.550
 it's worth buying the mini version 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.940
 from the phones well let's try 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.450
 Solve that question today by talking about LG G3 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.320
 the big and the lg 3s the mini version 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.320
 we start 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.109
 There are two main reasons why 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.910
 a person may want to get to 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.400
 buy the mini version of a phone 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.529
 one of them obviously is the price not 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.840
 everyone can pay 600 700 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.120
 dollars euros to buy the best 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.400
 mobile market another reason is 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.949
 the size no longer everyone likes 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.079
 have the last zapatÃ³fono that has left 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.239
 the market does not like to take it in the 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.210
 pocket or it is simpler to use it 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.949
 in the hand with smaller versions 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.870
 this practical example that we have here 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.370
 It really goes really well for you 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.050
 realize what you're going to 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.809
 buy when you buy a version 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.309
 mini from a phone because really 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.710
 meets a little bit with all the things that 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.559
 tend to happen as we said here we have 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.690
 the g3 the mobile one of the most mobile 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.050
 powerful market and here we have their 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.240
 mini version that is the 3g 3s the 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.030
 good differences at first sight do not 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.090
 they see too many we can see that in 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.649
 As for the design they are very similar 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.350
 they really are very well done in this 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.670
 case if we see it a little bit with more 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.799
 carefully we are going to realize that 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.820
 for example the frames are a little 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.860
 larger ones above 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.840
 down but this do not you go to account 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.430
 not be that you compare one to the side 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.920
 of the other and look at it like that a little 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.020
 carefully if we turn it around and what 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.880
 we see from behind and others we see that 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.860
 It is also very similar but eye 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.630
 materials are different housing 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.729
 back is different in terms of 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.009
 materials the buttons also do not have 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.320
 so much quality but they really are things 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.360
 that you do not notice too much the problem 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.090
 comes when we see it inside the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.680
 telephones and is that they do not have the same 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.979
 power or the same specifications 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.020
 that bring the most powerful phones in 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.690
 this case for example we are 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.180
 with a screen that is obviously more 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.430
 this small 5.5 inches has this 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.860
 It has 5 inches but it also has 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.200
 less resolution this for example has 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.520
 a resolution 2 here that we go a little 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.830
 too much is not necessary with one of 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.720
 so much but it is instead has a 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.420
 much lower resolution not even 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:23.440
 is full hd is normal hd that is a thousand 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.720
 280 x 720 pixels that really 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.050
 They are not bad but if you come a little closer 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.470
 with a magnifying glass you will see a little 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:35.050
 saw on the sides of the graphics 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.360
 we also have to talk a little bit about what 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.060
 most important and it is the power of the 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.920
 processors not here comes the great 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.110
 savings that are being made for 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.210
 to be able to sell it more economically and we 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.930
 we found a difference almost 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.990
 abysmal 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.540
 for example this phone has a 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.880
 snapdragon 801 one of the last 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.760
 processors of the market and this in 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.800
 change has a snapdragon 400 a 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.230
 quite cheaper version and that 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.500
 it really shows in terms of power 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.780
 but in this case the worst thing of all is the 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.260
 ram memory this has ram memory 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.020
 of 2gb and this has 1 only something that a 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.330
 today for android is pretty little 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.250
 if we talk a bit about the camera other than 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.320
 the important factors also 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.500
 cut benefits but not entirely 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:27.100
 let's discuss it specifically here 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.160
 in the g3 we find a camera 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.280
 3 megapixel with possibility of 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.370
 make videos in 4k with stabilizer 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.630
 optical image and so on that really 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.700
 it's one of the best things about this 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.920
 good phone here we find 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.590
 a few important cuts one of them 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.510
 it's in terms of megapixels because I 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.370
 of having 13 megapixels we have 8 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.910
 something that really is not too much 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.010
 problem for example the iphone 6 has 8 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.950
 megapixels so there you will not have 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.080
 too much trouble what you can 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.530
 get to make a drama truly 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.480
 bone compared to the normal g3 is that 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.820
 does not have the optical stabilizer of 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.700
 image and that makes when you take the 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.500
 photos so a little with your hand and so on 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.540
 is a tad moving they are going to 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.940
 notice more blurry we've tried it and it 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.090
 note quite in this case the side 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.199
 positive that we have to say is that 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.690
 The g3 s incorporates the laser focus one 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:26.610
 lg technology that really is very 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.780
 good that what it does basically is that 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.610
 when we are going to take a picture 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.100
 we click on the point where 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.080
 we want to focus and there what we achieve 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.550
 is that immediately focus 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.850
 using a laser that will bounce and 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.560
 come back no and we can take the picture 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.660
 instantly something that is undoubtedly 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.090
 really great and that gives you a 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.460
 added value actually to this 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.940
 phone that good as we know cut out 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.160
 quite in benefits but good this 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.960
 it's a bit the sample not from when 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.550
 we bought a mini phone which is what 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.840
 we will find but here what 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.120
 I would like to talk is the most 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.520
 important from my point of view the 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:07.020
 operating system and its updates 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:09.330
 are the crux of the matter really what 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.340
 most important to keep in mind when 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.710
 we buy a mobile of the most powerful 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.990
 we know how good many people are going to 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.370
 buy then the brand that manufactures 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.470
 will be much more interested in 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.020
 keep it updated for you 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.129
 you can use them more time and not 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.719
 you caper when 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:27.239
 suddenly new versions of the 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:29.309
 operating system and you can not advance 

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:31.319
 and use those versions 

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:33.689
 good the cheapest versions of 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:36.330
 the two phones usually happen that no 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:38.399
 so many people buy them then they are not 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.219
 so popular and therefore are not 

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:42.839
 updatable to following models or to 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:45.149
 less are not so much 

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:47.729
 even if we delve deeper into the subject 

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:49.499
 example with popular versions 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:51.779
 we have the possibility to install leds 

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:54.419
 already us the mod that is an android 

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:57.029
 modified that is applied to different 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.649
 operating systems and that really goes 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:00.539
 very good and extends the life of our 

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:02.339
 pretty good phone in the versions 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:04.679
 mini and the economical versions so 

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:06.389
 general not the long ones so what 

00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:08.459
 I have to say here from my point of 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:11.490
 view is that you always buy the 

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:13.349
 most popular versions for example to 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.139
 see I'm not saying that you do not buy a 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:17.909
 mini version what I say is that if you 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.589
 are you going to buy a mini version make sure 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:22.169
 that many people have bought him 

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:23.939
 that is very popular because with it you 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:26.219
 you're going to make sure you have support 

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:27.920
 later so that the phone lasts 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:30.530
 for more time 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.480
 this is a bit my opinion and I hope 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.790
 also yours so you can tell me to see 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.890
 if you really agree or think 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.450
 in a different way eye I also want 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.190
 clarify because I'm sure that if someone 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.840
 it will end up remembering that not all 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:45.290
 the mini versions cut into 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:48.410
 benefits is the case of the xperia z 3s 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:50.390
 good the economic version that really 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.780
 Well, it does not have a lot of money, but it does 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:55.940
 it has a lot of power because it is a 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:59.000
 a phone that has everything good that 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.530
 has the xperia z3 in this case is a 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.300
 timely case and apparently it is very 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.310
 popular and as soon as we can we will 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.710
 try to analyze it to give you our 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.330
 opinion so good keep it in mind not 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.940
 it's all the same is not just that 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:13.730
 it's smaller and it's already so that nothing 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.860
 more I await your comments and if we do not 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.690
 I knew you already know subscribe to our 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.880
