00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.850
 three completely ridiculous but true 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.960
 why youtube not why 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.610
 work from black fire phoenix 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.290
 three peoples ridiculous but true 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.289
 why do not youtuber west 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.859
 work there are three reasons or 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.630
 more 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.609
 I only found three now than me 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.710
 have thought about it sometimes you believe 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.100
 Do not you think that's right here 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.010
 proof 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.570
 it could make such an annoying voice 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.210
 Do not let your mustard about it 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.880
 it's italic so do not be surprised 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:38.790
 am your car around such that is me 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.469
 short have me healthy number one 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.090
 you already paid attention to how much 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.760
 eat your characters 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.890
 they are anorexic, all of us 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.590
 do not have to 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.480
 that could be true in any case 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.500
 all eat too little if they are 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.149
 ever eat something 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.579
 I just notice that in mine 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.890
 own fs so if you do that 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.359
 really considered that would have the 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.760
 to die alone of starvation 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.939
 but the author maybe easy 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.010
 to write cambodia yes and hello 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.409
 even in harry potter you eat something 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.780
 and that's not all I'm in the house 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.130
 Elf knows someone knows then gives 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.119
 I'll give you an example 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.670
 Nine-wise please no problem leaves 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.119
 and frodo are on their way to and trallala 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.979
 filet and trallala time flies like this 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.619
 a few hours and then they do 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.270
 to do something 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.070
 most of the time they have been going so look for 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.869
 you open a skatepark and drive there 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.240
 Well, at some point they disappear 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.720
 then either in the uwg or walk to 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.060
 gamble 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.470
 Time passes so fast that 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.780
 she smoothly forgot what we doctor pleased 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.189
 but because it's already so late 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.930
 is go to sleep 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.790
 The next morning they get up and 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.920
 were with their longboard to media force 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.049
 arrived there is turned dr 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.140
 friendly news then there is any 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.710
 meeting and and and and then drive 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.570
 get her back home and sleep again 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.310
 Consider them have been around since 24 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.090
 did not eat for hours 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.619
 so yes it is clear that ff would in real 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.800
 So life works great 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.120
 you do not do any better 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.390
 i never claimed i did 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.940
 just look up 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.069
 max dressed reason number two of 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.880
 Group 1 may have read 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.470
 probably already think about drinking though 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.170
 I have that really nice in the 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.080
 Length drawn and they do at least 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.080
 because, above all, marta in potsdam 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.730
 still coffee that means at least me 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.830
 already read my ff from cologne 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.570
 the drink does not taste mate 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.520
 it does not seem to him and I understand that 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.040
 absolutely not i mean how it tastes 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.420
 great and wait what my had 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.420
 city ​​but still there so dear 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.100
 linate and fritz kola the kölner 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.959
 all over the youtuber house about which 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.350
 just so diligent is not written 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.209
 Does anybody know that ? 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.130
 comes to cologne has in most 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.290
 make quite a big past 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.570
 problem with the lying and the whole 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.730
 drama begins the ossi is fighting on 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.489
 first day in media power with servants and 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.470
 the kf rewind and thoughtfully 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.690
 start felix with easy what to turn for 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.850
 white play after the end of the shoot go the 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.070
 two boys and he asks felix something 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.989
 because go on felix tells him everything and 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.459
 she is sure that the next day 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.380
 everything looks better again 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.600
 At the end , the two decide to gamble 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.030
 with the hope that everything is better today 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.400
 the two will go to the university and then to 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.100
 me de Rossi had a bad time 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.320
 night in which everything came up and meets 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.930
 then the 2 only works everything works and 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.540
 then because of some adversity 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.610
 place where you have the collar and the two 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.170
 zoffen get back and adi burst 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.269
 interior and want to know what's going on 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.799
 she brings the two out of the room with it 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.230
 we can talk to them in peace 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.760
 the three go then turn to one 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.110
 relatively short pronunciation with it 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.500
 ends that the two land in bed 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.720
 sleep hey 24 hours without drinking 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.640
 and has a wonder that rheinland board 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.709
 the two can still walk or what 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.459
 other 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.230
 the two lovebirds become happy 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.170
 the next morning of which the mates 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.989
 awakened and powerful to me dragged the day 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.720
 runs relatively quiet in the evening that 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.100
 I can not find it now for 46 hours 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.380
 without having a drink 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.840
 the situation is no longer there 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.060
 no fantasie I know because of that 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.260
 I'm writing such a kaka in 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.990
 so that there are two reasons 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:32.100
 Number three I'm still going today 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.140
 shower and I'll clean my teeth and 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.610
 why does that really have to do now ? 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:41.920
 I do not like smelly people 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.260
 for example , pronto could be an italian one 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.290
 criticism that should never be quiet 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.330
 claims that I can do that, yes co stands 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.550
 on then goes in the kitchen meets it 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.230
 anyone else from the uwg's 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.780
 black-haired opens up in the university 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.880
 there sits several hours and leaves 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.560
 the lecture on sure go afterwards 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.960
 he disappears thankfully into the media power 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.180
 and turns off mostly what's going on and off 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.220
 text caliber in the evening is usually still 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.540
 in cash and after he is quite full 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.370
 Let's go home 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.680
 but not without bush to celebrate in a 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.240
 I am proud of myself rather than recently 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.320
 written 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.100
 Jacob and a round and the next 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.830
 Tomorrow it will go on like this 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.620
 noticed what do we see again 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.760
 Together, Jako gets up and walks in the 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.320
 pajamas in the kitchen 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.450
 Then he meets another 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.919
 people what is worse now 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.480
 i dont think he was from 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:36.550
 Sleep deprivation looks so bad 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:37.000
 If you have any further argument 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.090
 in the text 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.190
 so jako leaves the pajamas 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.960
 uwg and goes to the university in pajamas 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.960
 if available 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.620
 yes in the morning you have a light one 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.810
 halitosis 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.770
 the guy was neither in the shower nor has 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.040
 he brushed his teeth 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:06:00.250
 I do not want to say anything now but something 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:03.400
 yes understand exactly you have grasped it 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.900
 yes well then I am honest me 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.010
 I have never had it with drowsiness 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.800
 seen camera 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.900
 we should wear the jako 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.140
 Rudiger would die in 1000, death is 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:16.600
 she consciously does not care hashtag diaconal 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.169
 moved in front of the camera in the evening then it goes 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.700
 in the bar 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.370
 mind you still in pajamas 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.110
 brush without teeth and so on now 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.780
 did you destroy yourself in the country ? 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.620
 I'm not allowed to wonder that 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.270
 he is so full then 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.540
 Felix brings you in pajamas 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:34.120
 sticking super blue jacket home 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:37.060
 Poor or Felix goes the next morning 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.380
 it just continues ok sounds then 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.330
 but stops 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.000
 dentist will be happy why so that 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.280
 Now please, well, if you have teeth 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.260
 as long as I do not clean so I believe 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.420
 Teeth cleaning costs 60 euro 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.750
 I might have it then yes 

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:56.820
 really marco over then good luck 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:59.380
 you see you three reasons super shit 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.570
 To get out I go one 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:06.280
 doctor's office search 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:06.790
 Bye end the sf if you like that 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.800
 call come 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.630
 Something has to do at this point 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.890
 I completely forgot and indeed driver 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.990
 Thank you for agreeing with me 

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.360
 borrowed my second personality 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:20.680
 you know 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:23.730

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.950
 messed up but yes I have it 

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:28.930
 Let's forget the topic again 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:30.850
 I should go to write my ff 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:33.240
 I hope we will meet again and see you 

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.240
 next time
