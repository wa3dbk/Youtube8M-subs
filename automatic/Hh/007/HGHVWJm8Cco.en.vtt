00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:08.519
 servus y de why stmv i welcome you 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.160
 for a comment your guests like you 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.809
 So no one of me always stops in the new one 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.330
 game advanced warfighter you see 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.670
 Here is already close so thing conclusion 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.970
 confirmed on the map partially only 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.359
 played or race you hardly believe it 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.109
 with a hd 3 a youth like weapon have 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.769
 then seen 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.539
 and yes conclusion I confirmed so as 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.790
 my favorite word but also only one 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.880
 few games for me discovered from 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.520
 I have social but I have too 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.579
 the most expensive with glasses because I am 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.120
 a very skeptical I believe that 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.410
 I'll just that but it does not matter 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.660
 my first impressions of the game are 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.190
 are ok so i should have now 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.620
 at first I have presented worse 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.640
 made me 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.980
 you never look forward to such a game 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.530
 own the next release will be it 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.409
 the game or other you just go 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.580
 completely neutralize and leaves the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.260
 future o'casey edition or something 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.470
 next at miro play and patch day or 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.030
 no place de because most use 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.439
 leaks at the start I have been on 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.979
 my colleagues heard that too 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.729
 been 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.400
 at some some customers there really in 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.920
 but the whole river is now playing as 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.740
 all this is accompanied how so 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.579
 calls and you can just play it 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.729
 I have the feeling that the mouse is so 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.560
 with me at least it's extremely direct as well 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.000
 at mw3 which I liked 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.950
 Since it has probably spread again 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.899
 if the mouse is spongy what makes 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.270
 mother I can link this here 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.820
 So if the problem with the mouse have 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.280
 The stammering around, I say so 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.729
 back and forth so gay is you know 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.829
 her that is initially pp2 with me then 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.689
 you click on the video and then get 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.540
 right in tip for me as I said 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.090
 I 'm lucky it's extremely direct team 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.519
 off and 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.120
 I just like what I like 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:13.470
 is that I need one more shot 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.690
 at least softcore around the opponent too 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.550
 I even compare with 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.489
 mp3 valdez one of my favorite cds 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.830
 simply there I had a few more 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.830
 shot used to kill the opponents 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.220
 as well as here and that's just something 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.540
 I noticed what I like me 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.790
 of course, this is still noticed 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.230
 great boost yes you need gm place at 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.410
 like me sometimes 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.630
 right and left smuggling that is 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:46.500
 to explain the following I run on mine 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.810
 keyboard so always with the tip 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.599
 operating costs to the right are typed 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.420
 tapped to the left and here in 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.890
 forces that is about driving it is like that 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.879
 that if you double tap on the 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.709
 button then you float in the direction m 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:03.599
 steve I still have to go 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.849
 get used to it a bit I hope so 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:10.430
 will soon be the case that I have it 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:14.069
 baked because well that's just how it is 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:17.069
 then it's not a classic cod anymore 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.109
 as you know it sometimes on one 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.389
 level people see and you have to 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.819
 just stop looking up 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:25.950
 you have to be that or how to buy 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.650
 as with css or something you have in the 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.549
 at head height the crosshairs are here 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.950
 not the case 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.910
 Now you have to go up often 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.620
 look around and can order the map 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.790
 the opponents are so that's really 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.980
 How can you use this booster 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.590
 fly everywhere is always evil crass 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.410
 You have to say so but it has 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.160
 nobody the typical cod how to do it 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.530
 it is known if you absolutely uncouth 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:56.069
 So my first time as I said 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.049
 relatively refreshingly winter high 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.469
 quite positively neutral on the matter 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.469
 answered and is in my opinion 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:05.969
 but positive 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:10.889
 I can feel the us actor 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:13.019
 complains now the big comes from me 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:15.840
 was recently level 12 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:18.810
 you turn things off when I see you 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.729
 that the shield people once did that 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.580
 Shield is also done diligently 12 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:26.729
 unlock 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.699
 so good with all this floating 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:33.120
 and something like it was a shit 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:35.729
 Steve with the insert shield you have that 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.470
 ding photo and then you push him like that 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.770
 you know that's the case with msi 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.570
 where it then wrote that my round 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.250
 around the stream because he thought he had something 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.400
 saved me now and then you know 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.800
 what do you want to know first where forward 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.330
 and the back is a sign you have to 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.030
 maybe get used to it, I hope 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.949
 I get used to it and now I would 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:01.949
 i mean the last degrees 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:05.669
 weapon and why a red polo graphic 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:08.400
 Somehow what happens here shot off gold 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.680
 nice tailors at the end again 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:15.630
 Tailored a bit like yourself 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:18.449
 that belongs to trance and yes that was mine 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.860
 first video editor two times my 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:21.900
 first of all prefer to go so reasonably 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.250
 All right , we have full throttle 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.699
 I'm just lost for 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:29.400
 tinted so I'm not created 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:32.310
 out with first gameplay here 820 too 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:36.720
 Water and new year already works like that 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:39.060
 this year I'm katy and right 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.740
 always immense screen what the right 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.050
 extreme but we are now in 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.110
 mainstream right to the last video 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:49.550
 left on a random in this viz 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:53.659
 out for the third time your klaus s dvb 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.659
 never forgot why the cat
