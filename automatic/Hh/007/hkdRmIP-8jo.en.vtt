key<00:00:45.840> which<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.140> an<00:00:46.289> invention<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.739> made<00:00:46.950> on<00:00:47.879> my

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
key which is an invention I made on my

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.220 
key which is an invention I made on my
private<00:00:48.239> server<00:00:48.629> at<00:00:48.930> like<00:00:49.140> 2am<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:51.230> basically

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
private server at like 2am so basically

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.350 
private server at like 2am so basically
what<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.559> as<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.039> can<00:00:53.190> easily<00:00:53.760> tell<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.239> is

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
what it is as you can easily tell it is

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.069 
what it is as you can easily tell it is
a<00:00:54.449> magic<00:00:54.780> 8-ball<00:00:54.930> butt<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.440> Minecraft<00:00:55.890> and

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
a magic 8-ball butt in Minecraft and

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.020 
a magic 8-ball butt in Minecraft and
it's<00:00:58.079> not<00:00:58.350> like<00:00:58.559> some<00:00:59.010> other<00:00:59.280> magic<00:00:59.850> thing

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
it's not like some other magic thing

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.389 
it's not like some other magic thing
works<00:01:00.239> like<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:01.079> there's<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.590> pattern<00:01:01.949> or<00:01:02.280> it

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
works like just there's a pattern or it

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.270 
works like just there's a pattern or it
switches<00:01:02.730> or<00:01:03.210> something<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.780> um<00:01:04.290> and

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
switches or something like that um and

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.580 
switches or something like that um and
this<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.970> believe<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.299> closest<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.200> true

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
this I believe is closest to true

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.670 
this I believe is closest to true
randomness<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.340> could<00:01:08.490> possibly<00:01:09.119> get

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
randomness is I could possibly get

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.899 
randomness is I could possibly get
because<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.860> does<00:01:10.979> not<00:01:11.010> use<00:01:11.430> anything

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
because it does not use anything

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.359 
because it does not use anything
computer-generated<00:01:12.810> besides<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:14.040> what

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
computer-generated besides like what

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.770 
computer-generated besides like what
powers<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.909> even<00:01:15.330> though<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.600> doesn't

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
powers it even though that doesn't

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.020 
powers it even though that doesn't
really<00:01:15.960> control<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.439> outcome<00:01:16.759> so<00:01:17.759> it's<00:01:17.909> not

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
really control the outcome so it's not

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.719 
really control the outcome so it's not
pseudo-random<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:18.990> completely<00:01:19.650> random<00:01:19.830> so

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
pseudo-random it is completely random so

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.160 
pseudo-random it is completely random so
I'm<00:01:21.060> going<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.330> take<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.600> behind<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.110> scenes

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
I'm going to take you behind the scenes

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.980 
I'm going to take you behind the scenes
and<00:01:22.560> show<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.799> how<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.040> sorts<00:01:23.369> let's<00:01:24.030> go

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.630 

okay<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:28.799> basically<00:01:29.040> what<00:01:29.520> oh<00:01:29.700> my<00:01:30.630> god<00:01:31.250> ok<00:01:32.250> so

okay so basically what oh my god ok so
this<00:01:33.360> pulse<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.200> restaurant<00:01:34.590> pulse<00:01:34.799> that

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
this pulse is the restaurant pulse that

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.440 
this pulse is the restaurant pulse that
is<00:01:35.130> emitted<00:01:35.460> from<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.850> button<00:01:36.149> that<00:01:36.330> you

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
is emitted from the button that you

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.450 
is emitted from the button that you
first<00:01:36.630> press<00:01:36.869> when<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.799> button<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.159> pressed

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
first press when the button is pressed

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.330 
first press when the button is pressed
it<00:01:38.850> comes<00:01:39.119> all<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.479> way<00:01:39.750> down<00:01:40.409> over<00:01:40.830> here<00:01:41.100> to

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
it comes all the way down over here to

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.800 
it comes all the way down over here to
this<00:01:41.460> thing<00:01:41.729> which<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.119> pole<00:01:42.360> shortener<00:01:42.750> I

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
this thing which is a pole shortener I

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.039 
this thing which is a pole shortener I
made<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.200> only<00:01:43.770> lets<00:01:44.159> one<00:01:44.729> tick<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.539> redstone

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
made it only lets one tick of redstone

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.820 
made it only lets one tick of redstone
pulse<00:01:46.439> through<00:01:46.830> before<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.429> cuts<00:01:47.640> itself<00:01:47.909> off

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
pulse through before it cuts itself off

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.310 
pulse through before it cuts itself off
now<00:01:49.830> basically<00:01:50.270> what<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:52.080> one

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
now basically what this is is that one

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.399 
now basically what this is is that one
tick<00:01:52.590> goes<00:01:52.830> into<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.399> 4<00:01:53.909> tick<00:01:54.179> loop<00:01:54.659> consisting

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
tick goes into a 4 tick loop consisting

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.230 
tick goes into a 4 tick loop consisting
of<00:01:55.470> or<00:01:55.649> repeaters<00:01:56.039> what<00:01:56.759> happens<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.149> the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
of or repeaters what happens on the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.070 
of or repeaters what happens on the
first<00:01:57.450> tick<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:58.369> one<00:01:59.369> pair<00:01:59.759> of<00:02:00.000> Pistons<00:02:00.569> these

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
first tick is one pair of Pistons these

finally<00:02:13.799> tick<00:02:14.040> for<00:02:14.280> those<00:02:14.850> Pistons<00:02:15.390> reset<00:02:15.750> and

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
finally tick for those Pistons reset and

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.360 
finally tick for those Pistons reset and
get<00:02:16.019> ready<00:02:16.110> for<00:02:16.290> another<00:02:16.410> loop<00:02:16.709> now<00:02:17.310> the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
get ready for another loop now the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.789 
get ready for another loop now the
reason<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:18.209> am<00:02:18.750> doing<00:02:18.810> like<00:02:19.319> these<00:02:19.470> pairs

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
reason I am doing like these pairs

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.720 
reason I am doing like these pairs
things<00:02:20.069> is<00:02:20.340> like<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:21.810> makes<00:02:22.080> all<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.799> wool<00:02:23.459> and

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
things is like it makes all the wool and

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.789 
things is like it makes all the wool and
glass<00:02:24.030> spin<00:02:24.600> around<00:02:24.750> really<00:02:25.319> really<00:02:25.410> really

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
glass spin around really really really

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.740 
glass spin around really really really
fast<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.549> while<00:02:27.209> it's<00:02:27.360> spinning<00:02:27.450> around

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
fast and while it's spinning around

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.589 
fast and while it's spinning around
since<00:02:28.620> glass<00:02:29.069> does<00:02:29.640> not<00:02:29.849> conduct<00:02:30.120> red<00:02:30.330> stone

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
since glass does not conduct red stone

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.949 
since glass does not conduct red stone
yet<00:02:30.959> wool<00:02:31.200> does<00:02:31.530> when<00:02:32.489> it's<00:02:32.640> on<00:02:32.790> wool<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.510> sends

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
yet wool does when it's on wool it sends

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.680 
yet wool does when it's on wool it sends
out<00:02:34.079> a<00:02:34.290> pulse<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.459> when<00:02:35.820> it's<00:02:35.970> on<00:02:36.090> glass<00:02:36.390> it

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
out a pulse and when it's on glass it

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.699 
out a pulse and when it's on glass it
does<00:02:36.959> not<00:02:38.150> now<00:02:39.150> what<00:02:39.780> happens<00:02:39.810> when<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.500> flip

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
does not now what happens when you flip

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.250 
does not now what happens when you flip
the<00:02:40.829> lever<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.340> one<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.090> well<00:02:42.870> two<00:02:43.079> things

it's in an off state this signal will
not<00:03:13.799> be<00:03:13.920> sent<00:03:14.160> but<00:03:14.519> this<00:03:14.730> one<00:03:14.880> will<00:03:15.060> because

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
not be sent but this one will because

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.660 
not be sent but this one will because
there<00:03:15.540> Peter<00:03:15.780> will<00:03:16.019> be<00:03:16.139> allowed<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.889> send<00:03:17.340> the

there Peter will be allowed to send the

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.319 
there Peter will be allowed to send the
signal<00:03:18.090> now<00:03:18.780> after<00:03:19.079> um<00:03:19.650> I<00:03:20.040> believe<00:03:21.030> it's<00:03:21.180> about

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
signal now after um I believe it's about

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.449 
signal now after um I believe it's about
twelve<00:03:21.750> ticks<00:03:21.900> after<00:03:22.200> about<00:03:22.350> twelve<00:03:22.769> ticks<00:03:23.100> of

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
twelve ticks after about twelve ticks of

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.640 
twelve ticks after about twelve ticks of
that<00:03:23.790> entire<00:03:24.120> rate<00:03:24.510> which<00:03:24.870> is<00:03:25.049> just<00:03:25.470> enough

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
that entire rate which is just enough

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.150 
that entire rate which is just enough
time<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.010> leave<00:03:26.400> their<00:03:26.609> rice<00:03:26.760> stop<00:03:27.000> spinning

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
time to leave their rice stop spinning

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.590 
time to leave their rice stop spinning
one<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.280> two<00:03:29.310> pulses<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:29.970> being<00:03:30.180> sent<00:03:30.420> out

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
one of two pulses is being sent out

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.420 
one of two pulses is being sent out
depending<00:03:31.019> on<00:03:31.139> what<00:03:31.290> that<00:03:31.500> is<00:03:31.680> as<00:03:31.889> I<00:03:31.920> explained

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
depending on what that is as I explained

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.849 
depending on what that is as I explained
earlier<00:03:32.549> this<00:03:33.510> is<00:03:33.569> the<00:03:33.780> yes<00:03:34.170> signal<00:03:34.620> which

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
earlier this is the yes signal which

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.219 
earlier this is the yes signal which
expands<00:03:35.579> that<00:03:35.730> display<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.359> this<00:03:36.989> one

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:37.229 
expands that display and this one

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:40.009 
expands that display and this one
expands<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:38.130> creeper<00:03:38.729> no<00:03:39.209> display<00:03:39.600> I<00:03:39.750> didn't

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
expands the creeper no display I didn't

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.630 
expands the creeper no display I didn't
show<00:03:40.229> no<00:03:40.410> I<00:03:40.440> live<00:03:40.650> show<00:03:40.889> no<00:03:41.190> secret

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
show no I live show no secret

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.930 
show no I live show no secret
anyways<00:03:43.200> so<00:03:44.200> 12<00:03:44.950> takes<00:03:45.220> after<00:03:45.430> that<00:03:45.580> happens

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
anyways so 12 takes after that happens

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.570 
anyways so 12 takes after that happens
these<00:03:46.330> two<00:03:46.660> pistons<00:03:47.140> retract<00:03:47.530> allowing<00:03:48.129> the

results of the magic eight cube now

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.800 
results of the magic eight cube now
really<00:03:54.519> quickly<00:03:54.910> I'm<00:03:55.090> gonna<00:03:55.360> go<00:03:55.540> ahead<00:03:55.629> and

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
really quickly I'm gonna go ahead and

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.770 
really quickly I'm gonna go ahead and
try<00:03:56.319> to<00:03:56.440> get<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:56.590> creeper<00:03:56.980> here<00:03:57.269> and<00:03:58.269> while<00:03:58.720> I'm

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
try to get a creeper here and while I'm

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.270 
try to get a creeper here and while I'm
trying<00:03:59.019> to<00:03:59.110> get<00:03:59.200> a<00:03:59.230> creeper<00:03:59.620> I<00:03:59.650> guess<00:03:59.980> I<00:04:00.099> could

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
trying to get a creeper I guess I could

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.449 
trying to get a creeper I guess I could
say<00:04:00.640> that<00:04:00.910> I<00:04:01.540> have<00:04:02.019> a<00:04:02.049> link<00:04:02.530> oh<00:04:02.709> there's<00:04:03.370> a
