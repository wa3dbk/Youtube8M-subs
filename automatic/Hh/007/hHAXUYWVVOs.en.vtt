last my only white teeth so I figured

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.279 
last my only white teeth so I figured
I'll<00:00:14.730> just<00:00:14.759> do<00:00:15.030> an<00:00:15.120> update<00:00:15.450> video<00:00:15.660> on<00:00:15.870> that

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
I'll just do an update video on that

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.500 
I'll just do an update video on that
because<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.890> feel<00:00:17.220> like<00:00:17.310> dental<00:00:17.910> hygiene<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.480> a

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
because I feel like dental hygiene is a

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.340 
because I feel like dental hygiene is a
big<00:00:19.199> part<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:20.449> no<00:00:21.449> I'm<00:00:21.510> trying<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.840> say<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.109> think

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
big part of no I'm trying to say I think

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.840 
big part of no I'm trying to say I think
it's<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.590> very<00:00:22.710> important<00:00:23.160> thing<00:00:23.279> basically

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
it's a very important thing basically

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.509 
it's a very important thing basically
and<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.510> lot<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.779> people<00:00:25.050> don't<00:00:25.380> really<00:00:25.769> take

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
and a lot of people don't really take

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.689 
and a lot of people don't really take
the<00:00:27.480> right<00:00:27.630> steps<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.199> their<00:00:29.010> teeth<00:00:29.310> turn<00:00:29.580> up

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
the right steps and their teeth turn up

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.600

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
way I'm not really sure um I I really

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.740 
way I'm not really sure um I I really
don't<00:02:02.640> experiment<00:02:03.030> too<00:02:03.299> much<00:02:03.420> with<00:02:03.600> other

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
don't experiment too much with other

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.929 
don't experiment too much with other
toothpastes<00:02:04.229> but<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.409> have<00:02:04.710> found<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.310> this

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
toothpastes but I have found that this

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.660 
toothpastes but I have found that this
3d<00:02:06.390> white<00:02:06.600> does<00:02:06.960> work<00:02:07.170> really<00:02:07.439> well<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.580> yeah

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
3d white does work really well so yeah

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.369

burning feeling although I do have the
Listerine<00:03:20.660> which<00:03:21.430> Total<00:03:22.430> Care<00:03:22.640> I<00:03:22.970> actually

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
Listerine which Total Care I actually

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.180 
Listerine which Total Care I actually
don't<00:03:24.140> know<00:03:24.320> how<00:03:24.470> much<00:03:24.590> I<00:03:24.709> like<00:03:24.890> this<00:03:25.010> one

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
don't know how much I like this one

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.300 
don't know how much I like this one
because<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.930> my<00:03:27.620> teeth<00:03:27.829> have<00:03:27.950> gotten<00:03:28.190> a<00:03:28.220> little

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
because it my teeth have gotten a little

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.710 
because it my teeth have gotten a little
sensitive<00:03:28.760> after<00:03:28.940> using<00:03:29.329> this<00:03:29.420> so<00:03:29.569> I<00:03:29.600> think

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
sensitive after using this so I think

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.479 
sensitive after using this so I think
I'm<00:03:29.930> gonna<00:03:30.019> stop<00:03:30.290> using<00:03:30.620> this<00:03:30.739> but<00:03:31.010> it<00:03:31.280> might

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
I'm gonna stop using this but it might

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.650 
I'm gonna stop using this but it might
be<00:03:31.790> different<00:03:32.030> for<00:03:32.390> you<00:03:32.660> um<00:03:33.430> sometimes<00:03:34.430> in<00:03:35.420> the
