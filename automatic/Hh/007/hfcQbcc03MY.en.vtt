 the street fighter 2 produced by 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.970
 Famous capcom 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:33.770
 the game has a great fighting system 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.160
 and also brought with it several 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.040
 charismatic characters representing 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.530
 the most diverse countries in the world 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.420

 green on the street dropping them 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.770
 monitoring and all this together 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.900
 ended up conquering the whole world in the 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.750
 no super mega drive fan 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:03.260
 nintendo in computers of the time 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.540
 these are the official versions of 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.210

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.850

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.179
 modified 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.369
 I still think even my micro waves 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:27.590
 Must test fighter 2 I'll try 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:29.840
 find out how the impact that the street 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.289
 fighter 2 has caused in the gaming industry 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.560
 in the 90's was very great would not be 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:40.520
 a success that in arcades since the 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.310
 pacman the game in addition to bringing levels of 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.409
 Incredible graphics details presented 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:50.420
 a combination system of blows or 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:53.179
 is the combos funk as the owners of the 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.030
 clippers from around the world with the go back 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.280
 of the machines of this fighting game to put 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.780
 in his establishments he knows what 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.229
 and being successful 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.990
 and the 16-bit console versions 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.300
 were also very striking so much that 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.480
 when you left for super nintendo 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.780
 sales of that same console leverage 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.239
 absurd way the people that I only saw before 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.510
 this game in the clippers is now power 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:23.480
 playing in the comfort of your home is crazy 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.940
 little and successful game 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.630
 soon after several games arrived 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.540
 of fighting like mortal kombat killers tite 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.400
 the king of fighters and many others 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.019
 only that the important role that the 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.110
 street fighter that he had in the 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.110
 games 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:45.019
 there in my childhood Uncle Ben no mega 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.500
 drive imagine a happy child 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.900
 I said that the first game going on 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.220
 that beauty wall street fighter 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:58.940
 dollars 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:01.489
 Lucas soon the comb play well I do not even 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.500
 I need to say that I thought it was sensational and 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.900
 soon that mega drive control 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.560
 novinho taha passil meeting with 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.560
 pounding 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:17.849
 I was very touched by it, losing the 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:21.360
 terror but igor blood because it's the title 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:23.849
 of the video is the infinite and the law is for more 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.810
 bitter buzz lightyear has nothing to 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:30.299
 see with him I'm sorry 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:34.230
 only you will have and capcom has a 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:38.220
 bizarre fame and mercenary attitudes 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.140
 but it's no use throwing lcd clothes 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.680
 for the good resident and charge a 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.989
 Cacetada is just an example there goes others 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.810
 more or less one year after the 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:54.150
 launch of street fighter 2 in April 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:57.870
 1992 new game out of the capcom 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.159
 street fighter 2 champion edition is not 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.849
 it's so new this way 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:05.790
 But that's what changed this time the 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.530
 four heads of the first game could 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.470
 be selected 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.470
 the maximum number of lounges has changed 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.970
 to 4 between these and other small 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.120
 differences 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.010
 some characters had their power 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:24.360
 balance and also some differences between 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:27.870
 okay design techniques capcom you gave a 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.240
 cool upgrade in your crazy game some 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.659
 months after that year in 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.639
 December the capcom launched the game more 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:40.740
 street fighter 3 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:44.639
 Of course not street fighter 2 turbo and 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:48.120
 hyper fighter the cap with suazo eira as 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:50.940
 the word turbo in the title already delivered 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.389
 the main change was a game stayed 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:57.389
 and characters like dalci and 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:01.229
 schulle gained special techniques 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:04.770
 new ones and all the characters gained a 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:07.600
 New design is also that sucked in there 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:12.220
 practically a year later in 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:15.820
 in October 1993, capcom launches the 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.620
 game will be my friend will this factor 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.330

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:25.810
 street fighter 2 the new challengers o 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:29.140

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.540
 version of street fight 2 brought graphics 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:34.870

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.640
 characters from raÃºl who wants to see me 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.860
 far and dj 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.590
 What shorter me is is that because it is 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.660
 Incredible amount of sexy cosplay 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:48.100
 which tends to the internet looks at the god of 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:56.410
 heart goes crazy and the following year in 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:58.690
 March 1994 was released what else 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.380
 The sport fighter 2 I give up this 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.650

 London medium speed fighter 2 billion in 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:23.860
 My curve is basically what has changed 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:27.190
 in this version was the additional blows and 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:31.180
 of the super combo that are the only bodies that 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:33.810

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:37.660
 street fighter 2 time 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:40.180
