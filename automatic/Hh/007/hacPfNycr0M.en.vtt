00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.660 

use<00:00:17.080> a<00:00:17.110> straightedge<00:00:17.560> to<00:00:17.950> finish<00:00:18.250> that<00:00:18.430> line

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670

across the tain make it easier to cut on
I<00:00:21.250> also<00:00:21.970> like<00:00:22.540> to<00:00:22.570> keep<00:00:22.720> things<00:00:23.140> even<00:00:23.860> easier

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
I also like to keep things even easier

I also like to keep things even easier
for<00:00:24.520> myself<00:00:24.850> so<00:00:25.000> I'll<00:00:25.150> use<00:00:25.360> a<00:00:25.390> razor<00:00:25.720> knife<00:00:26.050> and

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.100 
for myself so I'll use a razor knife and

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.040 
for myself so I'll use a razor knife and
score<00:00:27.100> the<00:00:27.340> line<00:00:27.550> just<00:00:28.180> to<00:00:28.300> make<00:00:28.390> sure<00:00:28.540> that<00:00:28.869> my

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
score the line just to make sure that my

to make sure you don't cut the glass I

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.460 
to make sure you don't cut the glass I
just<00:00:46.300> wanted<00:00:46.540> you<00:00:46.660> to<00:00:46.690> hear<00:00:46.930> what<00:00:46.989> it<00:00:47.199> sounds

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
like when this total hits glass now it's

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.070 
like when this total hits glass now it's
time<00:00:54.580> to<00:00:54.699> get<00:00:54.790> mad<00:00:54.970> at<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.210> tank<00:00:55.449> it<00:00:55.690> takes<00:00:55.989> a

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
time to get mad at the tank it takes a

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.390 
time to get mad at the tank it takes a
little<00:00:56.199> bit<00:00:56.379> of<00:00:56.440> effort<00:00:56.830> to<00:00:56.949> work<00:00:57.129> this

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
little bit of effort to work this

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.340 
little bit of effort to work this
silicone<00:00:57.970> free<00:00:58.269> and<00:00:58.600> be<00:00:58.720> able<00:00:58.900> to<00:00:58.960> break<00:00:59.140> the

silicone free and be able to break the
frame<00:01:00.100> off<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:01.449> keep<00:01:01.600> at<00:01:01.780> it<00:01:01.809> and<00:01:02.110> it'll

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
frame off but keep at it and it'll

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.079 
frame off but keep at it and it'll
eventually<00:01:02.799> come<00:01:03.129> apart<00:01:03.519> and<00:01:03.640> yet<00:01:03.820> just<00:01:03.970> don't

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
eventually come apart and yet just don't

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.810 
eventually come apart and yet just don't
break<00:01:04.420> the<00:01:04.570> glass<00:01:04.600> in<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.049> process<00:01:05.729> once<00:01:06.729> the

break the glass in the process once the

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.280 
break the glass in the process once the
frame<00:01:07.060> is<00:01:07.090> off<00:01:07.299> it<00:01:07.510> should<00:01:07.540> look<00:01:07.870> something

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
frame is off it should look something

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.940 
frame is off it should look something
similar<00:01:08.320> to<00:01:08.830> this<00:01:09.010> I<00:01:10.409> like<00:01:11.409> to<00:01:11.530> test<00:01:11.770> fit

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
similar to this I like to test fit

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.500 
similar to this I like to test fit
things<00:01:12.159> before<00:01:12.580> I<00:01:12.610> glue<00:01:12.790> or<00:01:13.060> silicone

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
things before I glue or silicone

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.450 
things before I glue or silicone
anything<00:01:13.840> down<00:01:14.020> so<00:01:14.409> here's<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:14.950> glass<00:01:15.159> in

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
anything down so here's the glass in

to<00:03:09.370> make<00:03:09.489> sure<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:09.879> it<00:03:09.970> fit<00:03:10.239> good<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:11.459> it<00:03:12.459> did

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
to make sure that it fit good and it did

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.270

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
right here is the screen that I use it's

the same box store and there cut it big

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.330 
the same box store and there cut it big
so<00:03:28.870> that<00:03:28.930> it<00:03:29.109> fits<00:03:29.290> good<00:03:29.500> and<00:03:29.769> then<00:03:30.099> you<00:03:30.190> can

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
so that it fits good and then you can

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.759 
so that it fits good and then you can
trim<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:30.730> excess<00:03:31.120> off<00:03:31.359> and<00:03:31.900> this<00:03:32.379> is<00:03:32.530> what<00:03:32.680> it

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
trim the excess off and this is what it

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.379 
trim the excess off and this is what it
looked<00:03:32.980> like<00:03:33.069> with<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.549> paint<00:03:33.760> dry<00:03:33.970> in<00:03:34.269> the

the hole in the tank

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.960 
the hole in the tank
I<00:03:38.230> used<00:03:38.650> plumber's<00:03:39.250> putty<00:03:39.280> to<00:03:39.669> create<00:03:39.940> a

I used plumber's putty to create a

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.000 
I used plumber's putty to create a
reservoir<00:03:40.389> to<00:03:40.660> pour<00:03:40.840> water<00:03:41.079> into<00:03:41.379> to<00:03:41.709> keep<00:03:41.859> the

diamond-tipped hole saw that I use to

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.349 
diamond-tipped hole saw that I use to
cut<00:03:47.470> through<00:03:47.709> that<00:03:47.889> and<00:03:48.099> here's<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.150> finished

finished product here is a 40 B that I
converted<00:03:59.049> to<00:03:59.079> a<00:03:59.199> vertical<00:03:59.799> tank<00:04:00.040> I<00:04:00.669> think<00:04:01.209> it

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299
