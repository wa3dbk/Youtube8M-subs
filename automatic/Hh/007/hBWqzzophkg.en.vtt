of people suffer from basically
hyperpigmentation<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:48.329> mostly<00:00:48.660> caused<00:00:48.930> by

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
hyperpigmentation is mostly caused by

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.010 
hyperpigmentation is mostly caused by
the<00:00:49.200> Sun<00:00:49.559> what<00:00:50.039> happens<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.700> we<00:00:51.000> have<00:00:51.210> melanin

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
the Sun what happens is we have melanin

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.410 
the Sun what happens is we have melanin
in<00:00:52.199> our<00:00:52.289> skin<00:00:52.590> cells<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:54.059> melanocytes

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
in our skin cells and the melanocytes

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.450 
in our skin cells and the melanocytes
are<00:00:54.930> what<00:00:55.050> produced<00:00:55.320> melanin<00:00:55.770> melon<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.280> what

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
are what produced melanin melon is what

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.090 
are what produced melanin melon is what
gives<00:00:56.579> skin<00:00:56.940> its<00:00:57.510> color<00:00:57.629> but<00:00:58.500> basically<00:00:58.680> what

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
gives skin its color but basically what

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.470 
gives skin its color but basically what
can<00:00:59.280> happen<00:00:59.430> sometimes<00:00:59.940> when<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.239> go<00:01:00.329> out

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
can happen sometimes when you go out

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.930 
can happen sometimes when you go out
into<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.870> sun<00:01:01.109> tan<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.980> basically<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> defense

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
into the sun tan is basically a defense

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.850 
into the sun tan is basically a defense
mechanism<00:01:03.210> for<00:01:04.019> your<00:01:04.170> skin<00:01:04.439> that's<00:01:04.710> what

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
mechanism for your skin that's what

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.190 
mechanism for your skin that's what
helps<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.159> protect<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.670> from<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> UV<00:01:06.270> rays<00:01:06.510> but

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
helps to protect it from the UV rays but

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.020 
helps to protect it from the UV rays but
some<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.530> your<00:01:07.710> melanocytes<00:01:08.310> might<00:01:08.729> over

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
some of your melanocytes might over

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.690 
some of your melanocytes might over
produce<00:01:09.330> melanin<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.950> can<00:01:11.130> cause<00:01:11.280> to

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
produce melanin and that can cause to

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.219 
produce melanin and that can cause to
the<00:01:11.729> age<00:01:12.119> spots<00:01:12.540> or<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> hyperpigmentation

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
the age spots or the hyperpigmentation

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.550 
the age spots or the hyperpigmentation

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
or the uneven skin tone that can usually

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.789 
or the uneven skin tone that can usually
be<00:01:16.939> solved<00:01:17.939> by<00:01:18.180> getting<00:01:19.080> chemical<00:01:19.530> peels

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
be solved by getting chemical peels

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.060 
be solved by getting chemical peels
reasoning<00:01:20.520> using<00:01:21.000> some<00:01:21.150> lightening<00:01:21.600> products

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
reasoning using some lightening products

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.830 
reasoning using some lightening products
another<00:01:23.070> really<00:01:23.280> common<00:01:23.520> problem<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.270> redness
