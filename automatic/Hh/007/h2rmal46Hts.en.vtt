00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
combat kind of helped inform sure some

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.030 
combat kind of helped inform sure some
of<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.329> know<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.809> health<00:00:37.410> restoration

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040

of you know the health restoration
animations<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.969> just<00:00:39.180> like<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.450> wind<00:00:39.660> ups

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
animations and just like the wind ups

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.959 
animations and just like the wind ups
for<00:00:40.110> attacks<00:00:40.469> yeah<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.160> see<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> lot<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.790> Dark

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
for attacks yeah I see a lot of the Dark

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.430 
for attacks yeah I see a lot of the Dark
Souls<00:00:42.149> comparisons<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.750> I'd<00:00:42.840> agree<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
Souls comparisons and I'd agree that the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.190 
Souls comparisons and I'd agree that the
methodical<00:00:43.829> paste<00:00:44.399> combat<00:00:44.899> definitely<00:00:45.899> does

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
methodical paste combat definitely does

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.319 
methodical paste combat definitely does
have<00:00:46.559> some<00:00:46.890> similarities<00:00:47.579> but<00:00:47.940> outside<00:00:48.300> of

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
have some similarities but outside of

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.220 
have some similarities but outside of
that<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.870> completely<00:00:49.110> different

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
that it's a completely different

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.420 
that it's a completely different
ballgame<00:00:49.500> you're<00:00:49.860> going<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.039> be<00:00:50.100> killing<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
ballgame you're going to be killing the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.680 
ballgame you're going to be killing the
same<00:00:50.579> monster<00:00:50.879> over<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.239> over<00:00:51.300> if<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.539> want

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
same monster over and over if you want

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.330 
same monster over and over if you want
to<00:00:51.750> get<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:51.870> stuff<00:00:52.140> yeah<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.710> think<00:00:52.949> one<00:00:53.309> thing

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
to get that stuff yeah I think one thing

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.490 
to get that stuff yeah I think one thing
that's<00:00:53.730> really<00:00:54.059> important<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.780> like<00:00:55.020> finding

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
that's really important is like finding

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.439 
that's really important is like finding
a<00:00:55.829> weapon<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.370> works<00:00:56.730> for<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.030> well<00:00:57.239> because

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
a weapon that works for you well because

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.610 
a weapon that works for you well because
I<00:00:57.780> think<00:00:57.870> there's<00:00:58.110> like<00:00:58.170> 15<00:00:58.590> different

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
I think there's like 15 different

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.470 
I think there's like 15 different
weapons<00:00:59.160> throughout<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.520> game<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.940> each<00:01:00.239> one

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
weapons throughout the game and each one

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.670 
weapons throughout the game and each one
of<00:01:00.510> them<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.809> makes<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.109> like<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> different

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
of them it makes it like a different

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.460 
of them it makes it like a different

on<00:01:23.250> older<00:01:23.610> d<00:01:23.759> s<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.450> really<00:01:24.990> gravitated

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
on older d s so I really gravitated

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.929 
on older d s so I really gravitated
toward<00:01:25.619> range<00:01:25.830> weapons<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.670> could<00:01:26.820> just
