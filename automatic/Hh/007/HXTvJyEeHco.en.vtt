00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.070
 Well now that we know how to fine tune 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.250
 the guitar we will move on to learn the 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.230
 first notes are worth the first notes 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.080
 what are we going to learn are these strings 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.449
 thin here below the ropes the 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.939
 let's call this is going to be the first 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.189
 rope second third fourth fifth and 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.230
 sixth string 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.300
 let's start by learning first the 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.599
 three thin strings and then 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.600
 we will learn the three strings above 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.030
 now in principle let's go to give to 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.410
 all the strings this way with a 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.410
 thumb hit down 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.390
 but later we will learn how to use 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.790
 these 2x to the fingers of the hand 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.300
 let's call them finger number 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.240
 one finger number two of do number three and 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.550
 of number four and in these first 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.350
 lessons that we're not going to move much 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.239
 forward on the mast but that 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.750
 we're just going to be in this first 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.790
 position the finger one will always tread 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.640
 the fret one the finger two is going to step on the 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:14.520
 fret two of the three frets 3 and finger 4 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.380
 when we use it fret 4 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.659
 the first notes that we are going to learn 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:25.409
 they are on the second string 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.409
 the number one fret this is the note 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.760
 and with the third finger on the same string 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.330
 second string fret number three is the 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.330
 note re 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.640
 whenever we press a note towards 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.670
 forward we will try to leave the note 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.440
 above the previous finger in place no 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.580
 we will pick you up but we will leave you in 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.560
 your site 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:58.220
 however to go backwards if 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:02.090
 we will need to raise the following note 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:05.090
 that we are going to see is the first string at 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.930
 air without pressing any finger here is the 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.500
 note me 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.500
 all right 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.010
 next note on the number one fret 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:20.000
 same as before but just on the rope 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.959
 of lowered the note fa and on the number fret 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.959
 three the note sun 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:31.860
 then with all that we have do re my 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.860
 fa and sun 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.670
 and backwards 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.670
 Sun 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.000
 we need to see this second string at 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.420
 air 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.510
 and 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.230
 what is the previous note to 2 that is to say is 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.230
 the note yes 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:01.620
 these first these first two 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:05.420
 strings are very easy because we use 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.420
 the same fingers the same frets 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:13.349
 according to the air second rope 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.659
 1 second string fret fret 3 1st 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:19.340
 agreement to the air first agreement to fret 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.340
 1 first accord to fret 3 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.069
 If you do re mi fa sol 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.670
 sun to me yes 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.709
 well in the next video we will see the 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.050
 rope that we lack of these three 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.940
 first but first I want to comment 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.400
 a very important aspect when it comes to 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.620
 touch what is the posture of the body to what 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.069
 over the years a bad position 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.739
 It can cause back problems or 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.739
 whatever it is then it serves that you go to 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.680
 touch you have to have your back well 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.470
 straight if you play in a chair with 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.750
 backing do not rely on the backrest 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.410
 just sitting on the edge of the 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.210
 chair with straight back 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.780
 and with the guitar in a position that 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:12.390
 Be comfortable It's never good to tilt 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.570
 the guitar too much towards us not 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.750
 we have to see a lot the mast now at 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.820
 principle will cost us but with time 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.180
 we have to get used to seeing 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.040
 the neck more and more in profile is worth not 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.080
 we have to see all the strings but 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.940
 that only the first string and the 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.340
 back of the mast no longer us 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.490
 should be worth and very important 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.850
 position of the hands this hand never 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.560
 we must touch with the thumb 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.350
 excelling above is always worth the 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.380
 thumb has to be supported on the 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.300
 center of the mast from the back 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.750
 in the middle 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.970
 and this hand has to be as 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.669
 perpendicular to the mast that the 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:01.069
 fingers fall at an angle the most 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.069
 similar to 90 degrees we can 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.460
 that is, we have to avoid bad 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.470
 customs like this 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.270
 do not touch with your fingers like this 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.449
 side you have to touch with your fingers always 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:18.550
 well straight and well separated with the 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:21.430
 knuckles parallel to the mast 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:24.010
 in this way 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:27.820
 and this other hand the same very important 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:30.610
 the correct posture of this hand is with 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:34.390
 the thumb forward and these fingers 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.580
 inwards it is worth not to put the 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.190
 thumb when we press in 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:43.300
 the hand but out and these fingers 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:45.970
 straight here the same the knuckles that 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:50.200
 go as close as possible to the 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:52.900
 strings nothing twisted parallel each 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:56.890
 once we press with the thumb 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:06:02.590
 we will try to leave it supported in the 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:04.830
 rope down and every time we look 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:08.170
 with these fingers we put them in 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.360
 and never out good for now 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.700
 So far in the next video we'll see 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.200
 the third rope the rope that we 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.480
 lack of seeing in this video and 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:20.370
 we will learn a very first song 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.370
 simple for you to go playing something
