00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.390
 hello people welcome back to this new one 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:32.029
 bet the game we'll see here is a 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.029
 game made by this company 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.520
 well don't expect a big one 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.090
 masterpiece indeed this title had to 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.270
 appear in the takeover ranking on 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.850
 ps1 but unfortunately for copyright reasons 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.120
 I had to cancel no sorry 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.500
 and this time you will see good vision 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.960
 people all remember the character 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.440
 of dragon ball that over the years 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.229
 has become one of the most beloved characters 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.280
 of manga and television anime 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.610
 Well, today we will analyze a title 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.320
 created by the band iii and published 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.810
 on playstation 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.880
 it's called dragon ball final bout 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.140
 known in america as a dragon ball 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.140
 gt final bout 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.899
 in the course of videogame history of 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.659
 many dragon balls had come out 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.149
 video games dedicated to the character but 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:47.920
 they were all in 2d this game 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:52.920
 published on playstation in 1997 was 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.789
 the first made all in 3d 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.110
 analyzing the graphic side 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:01.869
 let's start badly let's start first with some 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.299
 animated sequences in anime style 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.399
 Japanese that are very accomplished 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.580
 well they are really derived from the series 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:12.730
 dragon ball gt television are cute 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.549
 and very beautiful to be sure but 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.319
 worst part is in the part 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.790
 all three-dimensional characters 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.400
 during the time of play I am 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.640
 made in a truly horrible 3d 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.360
 with few badly animated polygons e 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.160
 especially not at all inspired though 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.130
 try to make them look more like 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.060
 those of the manga anime but do not go 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.569
 not at all good 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.480
 but the real worst strong piece is the 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.430
 settings point 2 rests on 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.569
 our characters and to a kind of 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.370
 very pixellated little colored floor 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.220
 and also not very inspired, however, for how much 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.940
 concerns the background of the environments and 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.180
 the arenas are very ugly 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.269
 ugly light and horrible effects 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.150
 similar atmospheric effects that do not go 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:09.150
 in short, nothing good 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.150
 graphically it is a real disappointment 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.700
 instead going through the sound side 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.120
 we must say that it is not badly realized 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.400
 it is discreetly realized we have not 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.610
 many sound effects that are fine though 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.340
 for the game that is very childish and 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.710
 very inspired by the nim manga dragon 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.900
 ball but it is also with regard to the 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:45.260
 Background music are themes 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.540
 cute music to listen to 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:52.560
 we must consider that they have been 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:56.160
 made by a great composer of 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:01.160
 music for video games from hero nobu 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:04.320
 kagayama and also from kenji yamamoto 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.220
 we say they are all very track 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.220
 inspired 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.590
 now let's move on to the playability that the 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.660
 important point of the game itself 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.090
 this game looks like a 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.039
 any beat up ours 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.740
 player has keys where we can 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:36.530
 punch kick a spear 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.289
 the pure even a blast chi and a 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.750
 another one to use the directional keys there 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:45.110
 they are used to move inside 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:48.050
 of the gaming arena and we can too 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.270
 even press precise keys 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.160
 to make it fly 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.349
 also pressing a certain series i 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.060
 our characters can make 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:58.639
 special attacks that can cause 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.610
 serious damage to the enemy 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.830
 in this case one will also be carried out 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.199
 clash of waves in which player will have to 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.000
 press the keys repeatedly to be able to 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.099
 allow his attack to overwhelm 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.410
 that of our opponent to hit 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:13.820
 our enemy 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.650
 as you see also in the upper part of the 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.169
 screen there are two bars but one 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.870
 the player's energy and the other's 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.880
 quay of the character that of the quay 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.130
 character will diminish each time the 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.770
 we will use or we will make an attack 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.050
 special that our zero drops 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.409
 warrior will become exhausted ee 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:38.050
 will become very vulnerable 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:40.669
 in short this game turns out to be 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.620
 poorly realized a missed opportunity for 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.960
 the band iii because in this game 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.810
 there were only potentials 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.320
 that they realized with a 3d that not 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:54.259
 it was not sinful at all, however 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:57.470
 if you haven't found this game yet 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:06:02.240
 dragon ball gt final bout I recommend it 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:03.860
 only to fans of the manga that 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.830
 they don't want to give up any video 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.599
 dragon ball game or to children 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.789
 little ones 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:13.760
 but it is not a game that must be preserved 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:16.670
 in your own video library 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.020
 however with this is everything awaits you 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.410
 to the next review 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.410
 Hello 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.700
 amen 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.260
 no
