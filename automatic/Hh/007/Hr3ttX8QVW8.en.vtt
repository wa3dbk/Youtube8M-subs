in terms of hunting and engaging our
unengaging<00:02:06.020> turns<00:02:06.530> it<00:02:07.250> it's<00:02:07.820> a<00:02:07.940> little<00:02:08.000> bit

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
unengaging turns it it's a little bit

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.680 
unengaging turns it it's a little bit
slower<00:02:08.630> but<00:02:09.289> if<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.830> if<00:02:10.550> you<00:02:10.640> go<00:02:10.820> for<00:02:11.090> it<00:02:11.240> you

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
slower but if you if you go for it you

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.600 
slower but if you if you go for it you
because<00:02:12.200> of<00:02:12.320> the<00:02:12.380> magnatraction<00:02:12.830> you're<00:02:13.430> not

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
because of the magnatraction you're not

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.280 
because of the magnatraction you're not
going<00:02:13.820> to<00:02:13.910> slip<00:02:14.120> out<00:02:14.240> you're<00:02:14.480> not<00:02:14.570> going<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.960> do

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
going to slip out you're not going to do

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.720 
going to slip out you're not going to do
anything<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:15.710> just<00:02:15.890> kind<00:02:15.920> of<00:02:16.100> have<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.250> go<00:02:16.490> for

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
anything to just kind of have to go for

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.330 
anything to just kind of have to go for
it<00:02:16.880> and<00:02:17.000> they'll<00:02:17.870> be<00:02:17.990> good<00:02:18.140> for<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.010> double

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
it and they'll be good for the double

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.570 
it and they'll be good for the double
camber<00:02:19.700> board<00:02:19.970> so<00:02:20.630> it<00:02:20.960> was<00:02:21.350> very<00:02:21.560> stable<00:02:22.280> on

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
camber board so it was very stable on

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.700 
camber board so it was very stable on
the<00:02:22.730> landings<00:02:23.150> one<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.290> most<00:02:24.530> stable

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
the landings one of the most stable

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.100 
the landings one of the most stable
boards<00:02:25.070> I've<00:02:25.190> written<00:02:25.400> for<00:02:25.850> landings<00:02:26.270> but<00:02:26.960> it

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
boards I've written for landings but it

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.590 
boards I've written for landings but it
was<00:02:27.290> also<00:02:27.620> very<00:02:28.160> squirrelly<00:02:28.850> when<00:02:29.240> he<00:02:29.330> wanted

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
was also very squirrelly when he wanted

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.240 
was also very squirrelly when he wanted
it<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.810> be<00:02:29.930> for<00:02:30.140> example<00:02:30.200> it<00:02:30.680> was<00:02:30.800> really<00:02:31.130> good

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
it to be for example it was really good

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.370 
it to be for example it was really good
at<00:02:31.370> writing<00:02:31.520> switch<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.270> it<00:02:32.630> was<00:02:32.720> also<00:02:32.870> really

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
at writing switch and it was also really

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.180 
at writing switch and it was also really
good<00:02:33.620> for<00:02:34.120> spinning<00:02:35.230> off<00:02:36.230> those<00:02:36.530> jumps<00:02:37.010> it

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
good for spinning off those jumps it

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.479 
good for spinning off those jumps it
lands<00:02:37.400> really<00:02:37.820> well<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:39.010> with<00:02:40.010> demands

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
lands really well and with demands

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:41.590 
lands really well and with demands

the dumps great my string was a very
light<00:03:00.980> board<00:03:01.340> it's<00:03:01.580> very<00:03:01.760> light<00:03:02.120> very<00:03:02.420> poppy

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
light board it's very light very poppy

pal if it's really heavy maybe one a

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.850 
pal if it's really heavy maybe one a
little<00:03:15.620> longer<00:03:16.100> but<00:03:17.200> really<00:03:18.200> really<00:03:18.230> fun

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
little longer but really really fun

little longer but really really fun
board<00:03:19.130> I<00:03:19.520> say<00:03:20.300> the<00:03:20.450> sport<00:03:20.780> is<00:03:20.870> probably<00:03:21.140> really

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
board I say the sport is probably really

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.350 
board I say the sport is probably really
good<00:03:21.440> all<00:03:21.740> over<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.100> mountain<00:03:22.460> um<00:03:22.700> you're

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
good all over the mountain um you're

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.210 
good all over the mountain um you're
able<00:03:23.570> to<00:03:23.660> drop<00:03:23.810> clips<00:03:24.140> on<00:03:24.320> it<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:24.710> stroll<00:03:25.040> and

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
able to drop clips on it and stroll and

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.120 
able to drop clips on it and stroll and
well<00:03:25.490> probably<00:03:26.270> also<00:03:26.510> works<00:03:26.960> for<00:03:27.140> jumps<00:03:28.040> in

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
well probably also works for jumps in

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.980 
well probably also works for jumps in
the<00:03:28.160> park<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.880> bat<00:03:29.090> it<00:03:29.330> just<00:03:29.360> feels<00:03:29.690> there's<00:03:29.930> a

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
the park the bat it just feels there's a

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.530 
the park the bat it just feels there's a
sluggish<00:03:30.350> feel<00:03:30.560> cool<00:03:30.800> and<00:03:31.040> it<00:03:31.370> feels<00:03:31.420> maybe<00:03:32.420> a

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
sluggish feel cool and it feels maybe a

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.370 
sluggish feel cool and it feels maybe a
little<00:03:32.570> too<00:03:32.780> wide<00:03:33.080> for<00:03:33.440> me<00:03:34.360> and<00:03:35.360> maybe<00:03:35.930> it<00:03:36.170> may

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
little too wide for me and maybe it may

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.300 
little too wide for me and maybe it may
be<00:03:36.440> a<00:03:36.530> little<00:03:36.650> bit<00:03:36.800> too<00:03:36.980> stiff<00:03:37.280> for

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
be a little bit too stiff for

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.640 
be a little bit too stiff for

speeds in a straight line it just it's a
little<00:03:44.390> unstable<00:03:44.660> I<00:03:45.640> gave<00:03:46.640> this<00:03:46.790> board<00:03:47.030> a<00:03:47.210> 95

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
little unstable I gave this board a 95

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.050 
little unstable I gave this board a 95
first<00:03:48.080> read<00:03:48.320> cred<00:03:48.650> and<00:03:48.860> I<00:03:49.640> just<00:03:49.850> thought<00:03:50.000> that

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
first read cred and I just thought that

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.550 
first read cred and I just thought that
it<00:03:50.300> performed<00:03:50.720> really<00:03:50.840> well<00:03:50.960> I<00:03:51.170> could

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
it performed really well I could

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.290 
it performed really well I could
probably<00:03:51.590> ride<00:03:52.160> anywhere<00:03:52.550> with<00:03:52.790> it<00:03:52.970> and<00:03:53.150> have

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
probably ride anywhere with it and have

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.960 
probably ride anywhere with it and have
fun<00:03:53.540> and<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:54.770> the<00:03:55.100> different<00:03:55.430> cameras<00:03:55.820> and

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
fun and the the different cameras and

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.690 
fun and the the different cameras and
the<00:03:56.000> board<00:03:56.239> made<00:03:56.540> it<00:03:56.720> just<00:03:57.380> super<00:03:58.010> fun<00:03:58.220> to<00:03:58.430> be

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
the board made it just super fun to be

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:10.820 
the board made it just super fun to be
honest<00:03:59.090> drive<00:03:59.750> around

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.540 

I<00:04:10.890> gave<00:04:11.670> this<00:04:11.940> board<00:04:12.270> a<00:04:12.980> 97<00:04:13.980> shred<00:04:14.250> cred

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
I gave this board a 97 shred cred

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.030 
I gave this board a 97 shred cred
because<00:04:15.000> it<00:04:15.330> was<00:04:15.540> awesome<00:04:16.230> it<00:04:16.530> was<00:04:16.769> so<00:04:16.980> much
