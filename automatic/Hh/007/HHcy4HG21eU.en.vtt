00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
actually is already but basically you

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.810 
actually is already but basically you
just<00:00:54.600> want<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.930> get<00:00:55.020> one<00:00:55.530> enemy<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:56.610> just

do<00:04:04.700> with<00:04:04.790> this<00:04:04.880> long<00:04:05.090> if<00:04:05.330> your<00:04:05.450> lower<00:04:05.630> level

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
do with this long if your lower level

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.750 
do with this long if your lower level
it's<00:04:06.140> gonna<00:04:06.230> do<00:04:06.530> it<00:04:06.650> even<00:04:06.770> faster<00:04:07.040> it's

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
it's gonna do it even faster it's

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.490 
it's gonna do it even faster it's
because<00:04:07.970> i<00:04:08.180> was<00:04:08.510> such<00:04:08.630> a<00:04:08.660> high<00:04:08.840> level<00:04:08.870> when<00:04:09.440> i

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
because i was such a high level when i

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.410 
because i was such a high level when i
started<00:04:10.959> so<00:04:11.959> it<00:04:12.260> took<00:04:12.440> forever<00:04:12.620> but<00:04:13.420> my

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
started so it took forever but my

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.440 
started so it took forever but my
blocking<00:04:14.690> went<00:04:15.050> up<00:04:15.140> from<00:04:15.290> 22<00:04:15.890> to<00:04:15.920> 89<00:04:16.640> which<00:04:17.239> is

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
blocking went up from 22 to 89 which is

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.569 
blocking went up from 22 to 89 which is
you<00:04:17.810> know<00:04:17.870> a<00:04:17.959> lot<00:04:18.230> i<00:04:18.470> was<00:04:19.100> doing<00:04:19.310> it<00:04:19.400> for<00:04:19.519> the

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
you know a lot i was doing it for the

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.159 
you know a lot i was doing it for the
levels<00:04:19.880> like<00:04:20.000> i<00:04:20.060> said<00:04:20.359> not<00:04:20.540> for<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.750> blocking

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
levels like i said not for the blocking

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.100 
levels like i said not for the blocking
scale<00:04:21.440> but<00:04:22.160> whatever<00:04:22.910> you<00:04:22.970> do<00:04:23.150> it<00:04:23.300> you<00:04:23.990> know

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
scale but whatever you do it you know

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.870 
scale but whatever you do it you know
it's<00:04:24.440> not<00:04:24.530> a<00:04:24.590> hard<00:04:24.800> thing<00:04:24.919> to<00:04:25.040> do<00:04:25.220> really

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
it's not a hard thing to do really

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.220 
it's not a hard thing to do really
simple<00:04:26.210> part<00:04:26.419> of<00:04:26.480> the<00:04:26.570> easiest<00:04:26.870> way<00:04:26.960> to<00:04:27.020> boost

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
simple part of the easiest way to boost

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.610 
simple part of the easiest way to boost
just<00:04:27.560> takes<00:04:27.710> time<00:04:28.450> if<00:04:29.450> you<00:04:29.600> like<00:04:29.810> that<00:04:30.050> song<00:04:30.410> I

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
just takes time if you like that song I

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.990 
just takes time if you like that song I
played<00:04:30.760> during<00:04:31.760> the<00:04:32.620> duration<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:34.550> fast

free I thought it was amazing and
there's<00:04:55.040> much<00:04:55.250> more<00:04:55.430> to<00:04:55.490> it<00:04:55.729> than<00:04:55.850> what<00:04:56.000> I

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
there's much more to it than what I

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.909 
there's much more to it than what I
actually<00:04:56.240> showed<00:04:56.630> because<00:04:57.229> I<00:04:57.410> ran<00:04:57.620> it<00:04:57.740> done

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
actually showed because I ran it done

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.350 
actually showed because I ran it done
and<00:04:58.130> I<00:04:58.610> didn't<00:04:58.790> want<00:04:58.910> this<00:04:59.000> to<00:04:59.120> be<00:04:59.210> a<00:04:59.240> long

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
and I didn't want this to be a long

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.040 
and I didn't want this to be a long
video<00:04:59.540> Oh<00:05:00.040> longer<00:05:01.040> than<00:05:01.160> it<00:05:01.340> needed<00:05:01.490> to<00:05:01.580> be<00:05:02.050> so

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
video Oh longer than it needed to be so

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.020 
video Oh longer than it needed to be so
a<00:05:03.080> couple<00:05:03.710> things<00:05:03.860> I<00:05:04.190> noticed<00:05:04.669> while<00:05:04.850> doing

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
a couple things I noticed while doing

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.510 
a couple things I noticed while doing
this<00:05:05.240> little<00:05:05.650> blocking<00:05:06.650> marathon<00:05:07.100> here<00:05:07.340> is

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
this little blocking marathon here is

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.860 
this little blocking marathon here is
it's<00:05:08.479> much<00:05:08.750> easier<00:05:08.780> to<00:05:09.940> walk<00:05:10.940> the<00:05:11.240> attacks<00:05:11.570> in

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
it's much easier to walk the attacks in

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.980 
it's much easier to walk the attacks in
the<00:05:12.080> third<00:05:12.290> person<00:05:13.120> as<00:05:14.120> you<00:05:14.330> can<00:05:14.450> see<00:05:14.660> here<00:05:14.960> i

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
the third person as you can see here i

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.390 
the third person as you can see here i
justyou<00:05:15.530> just<00:05:15.590> vaguely<00:05:16.070> have<00:05:16.460> to<00:05:16.640> be<00:05:16.790> a<00:05:17.000> me

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
justyou just vaguely have to be a me

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.879 
justyou just vaguely have to be a me
the<00:05:18.090> same<00:05:18.360> direction<00:05:18.570> as<00:05:19.050> day<00:05:19.259> and<00:05:19.530> they'll

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
the same direction as day and they'll

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.650 
the same direction as day and they'll
hit<00:05:20.009> the<00:05:20.100> field<00:05:20.310> but<00:05:21.060> I<00:05:21.120> found<00:05:21.360> in

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
hit the field but I found in

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.530 
hit the field but I found in
first-person<00:05:22.080> mode<00:05:22.440> you<00:05:23.250> actually<00:05:23.490> have<00:05:24.389> to

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
first-person mode you actually have to

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.020 
first-person mode you actually have to
be<00:05:24.660> directly<00:05:25.229> looking<00:05:25.650> at<00:05:25.800> it<00:05:26.039> for<00:05:26.820> them<00:05:26.970> to

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
be directly looking at it for them to

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.610 
be directly looking at it for them to
actually<00:05:27.210> hit<00:05:27.449> the<00:05:27.509> shield<00:05:27.840> and<00:05:28.050> it's<00:05:28.470> much

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
actually hit the shield and it's much

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.159 
actually hit the shield and it's much
harder<00:05:28.919> to<00:05:29.039> actually<00:05:29.479> block<00:05:30.479> using

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
harder to actually block using

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.529 
harder to actually block using
first-person<00:05:31.860> mode<00:05:31.889> I<00:05:32.100> don't<00:05:32.250> know<00:05:32.340> why<00:05:32.550> I'm

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
first-person mode I don't know why I'm

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:34.760 
first-person mode I don't know why I'm
not<00:05:33.660> sure<00:05:33.870> if<00:05:33.960> it's<00:05:34.020> some<00:05:34.199> sort<00:05:34.350> of<00:05:34.440> detection

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
not sure if it's some sort of detection

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.689 
not sure if it's some sort of detection
a<00:05:35.009> hug<00:05:35.789> or<00:05:36.060> just<00:05:36.419> the<00:05:36.810> way<00:05:36.960> it<00:05:37.080> is<00:05:37.139> but<00:05:38.009> it's

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 
a hug or just the way it is but it's

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:41.029 
a hug or just the way it is but it's
much<00:05:38.940> easier<00:05:38.970> in<00:05:39.389> third<00:05:39.539> person<00:05:39.720> and<00:05:40.680> also<00:05:40.860> you

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
much easier in third person and also you

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:42.710 
much easier in third person and also you
can<00:05:41.280> stay<00:05:41.699> on<00:05:41.729> because<00:05:42.210> they<00:05:42.300> like<00:05:42.449> to<00:05:42.570> move

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
can stay on because they like to move

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.129 
can stay on because they like to move
around<00:05:42.840> you<00:05:43.110> a<00:05:43.139> walk<00:05:44.449> so<00:05:45.449> this<00:05:45.870> is<00:05:45.900> where<00:05:46.110> I

around you a walk so this is where I
kill<00:05:46.470> him<00:05:46.590> which<00:05:46.889> is<00:05:47.039> awesome<00:05:47.220> how<00:05:48.000> it's<00:05:48.150> so

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300

the<00:05:52.860> shield<00:05:53.370> bash<00:05:53.669> which<00:05:54.180> is<00:05:54.300> why<00:05:54.419> his<00:05:54.570> health

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
the shield bash which is why his health

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.570
