we'll<00:03:22.320> keep<00:03:22.470> describing<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:23.040> system

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
we'll keep describing the system

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.520 
we'll keep describing the system
anywhere<00:03:24.600> these<00:03:24.690> scanning<00:03:25.079> lines<00:03:25.260> get

I'm sitting sitting just above the tube

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.789 
I'm sitting sitting just above the tube
is<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:32.060> photomultiplier<00:03:33.060> tube<00:03:33.750> which<00:03:33.989> is<00:03:34.140> being

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
used to receive these missions so the

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.110 
used to receive these missions so the
photomultiplier<00:03:37.769> chief<00:03:38.549> sees<00:03:38.850> all<00:03:39.000> these

photomultiplier chief sees all these

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.470 
photomultiplier chief sees all these

picks them up amplifies them and cause

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.060 
picks them up amplifies them and cause
them<00:03:45.329> well<00:03:46.049> we're<00:03:46.320> calling<00:03:46.470> at<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.769> moment

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
them well we're calling at the moment

left victim over isn't that close can we

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.750 
left victim over isn't that close can we
get<00:04:26.490> a<00:04:26.550> multi-mission<00:04:27.090> family<00:04:28.550> except<00:04:29.550> we<00:04:29.610> get

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
get a multi-mission family except we get

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.020 
get a multi-mission family except we get
them<00:04:29.910> off<00:04:30.030> back<00:04:30.240> yeah<00:04:31.610> I'll<00:04:32.610> just<00:04:32.669> turn<00:04:32.910> it

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
them off back yeah I'll just turn it

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:41.110 
them off back yeah I'll just turn it
down<00:04:33.060> a<00:04:33.180> bit<00:04:34.280> but<00:04:35.280> do<00:04:35.550> it<00:04:35.580> now<00:04:38.540> focus<00:04:39.540> mission

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
down a bit but do it now focus mission

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.850 
down a bit but do it now focus mission
