00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
name yeah well I think this game is it's

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.620 
name yeah well I think this game is it's
pretty<00:05:01.310> much<00:05:01.460> over<00:05:02.919> because<00:05:04.000> well<00:05:05.000> the

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
pretty much over because well the

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.240 
pretty much over because well the
symbiote<00:05:05.990> just<00:05:06.260> has<00:05:06.410> too<00:05:06.740> much<00:05:06.919> of<00:05:07.130> an

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
symbiote just has too much of an

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.760 
symbiote just has too much of an
advantage<00:05:07.370> and<00:05:08.030> yes<00:05:08.270> we<00:05:08.540> do<00:05:08.690> see<00:05:08.960> a<00:05:08.990> GG<00:05:09.470> and<00:05:09.650> I'm

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
advantage and yes we do see a GG and I'm

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.340 
advantage and yes we do see a GG and I'm
just<00:05:09.979> going<00:05:10.130> to<00:05:10.160> pause<00:05:10.400> game<00:05:10.669> right<00:05:10.880> here

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
just going to pause game right here

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.060 
just going to pause game right here
right<00:05:12.350> now<00:05:13.660> the<00:05:14.660> key<00:05:14.930> factors<00:05:15.530> to<00:05:15.560> this<00:05:15.830> game

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
right now the key factors to this game

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.270 
right now the key factors to this game
is<00:05:16.280> really<00:05:16.550> level<00:05:17.210> advantage<00:05:18.100> with<00:05:19.100> the

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
is really level advantage with the

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.580 
is really level advantage with the
morphling<00:05:19.640> being<00:05:20.000> well<00:05:20.750> with<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:21.229> morphing

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
morphling being well with the morphing

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.240 
morphling being well with the morphing
having<00:05:21.860> three<00:05:22.220> deaths<00:05:22.580> and<00:05:23.590> only<00:05:24.590> one<00:05:24.860> kill

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
having three deaths and only one kill

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.140 
having three deaths and only one kill
he's<00:05:26.210> not<00:05:26.450> up<00:05:26.690> he's<00:05:27.050> not<00:05:27.229> up<00:05:27.440> on<00:05:27.590> farm<00:05:28.010> he's<00:05:28.850> not

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
he's not up he's not up on farm he's not

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.710 
he's not up he's not up on farm he's not
up<00:05:29.330> on<00:05:29.510> creep<00:05:29.960> stats<00:05:30.260> as<00:05:30.470> well<00:05:30.770> so<00:05:31.640> they<00:05:32.300> really

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
up on creep stats as well so they really

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:39.230 
up on creep stats as well so they really
can't<00:05:33.729> just<00:05:34.729> rely<00:05:34.940> on<00:05:35.120> the<00:05:35.360> SF<00:05:36.070> to<00:05:37.070> provide<00:05:37.940> the

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
can't just rely on the SF to provide the

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.830 
can't just rely on the SF to provide the
the<00:05:39.960> presence<00:05:40.520> because<00:05:41.520> SF<00:05:41.940> is<00:05:42.120> also<00:05:42.539> a<00:05:42.569> very

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
the presence because SF is also a very

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.890 
the presence because SF is also a very
frail<00:05:43.199> hero<00:05:43.560> and<00:05:44.000> easily<00:05:45.000> taken<00:05:45.240> down<00:05:45.569> by<00:05:45.840> the

much more to say about this game but

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.390 
much more to say about this game but
just<00:06:47.099> well<00:06:47.280> played<00:06:47.580> by<00:06:47.759> the<00:06:47.820> Sentinel<00:06:48.389> and<00:06:49.400> I

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
just well played by the Sentinel and I

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.430 
just well played by the Sentinel and I
guess<00:06:51.270> this<00:06:51.449> is<00:06:51.539> going<00:06:51.719> to<00:06:51.780> this<00:06:52.169> is<00:06:52.259> going<00:06:52.380> to

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
guess this is going to this is going to

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.760 
guess this is going to this is going to
be<00:06:52.530> the<00:06:52.650> end<00:06:52.800> of<00:06:52.860> my<00:06:53.009> solo<00:06:53.280> commentary<00:06:53.930> so
