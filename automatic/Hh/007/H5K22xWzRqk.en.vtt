a pedestal you know and that's what

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.360 
a pedestal you know and that's what
we're<00:00:56.120> trying<00:00:56.300> to<00:00:56.420> do<00:00:56.630> here

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
we're trying to do here

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.500 
we're trying to do here
well<00:00:58.370> technically<00:00:58.790> I've<00:00:59.030> kind<00:00:59.360> of<00:00:59.420> just

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
well technically I've kind of just

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.869 
well technically I've kind of just
started<00:01:00.170> with<00:01:01.600> we<00:01:02.600> we<00:01:03.530> have<00:01:03.829> we've<00:01:04.430> got<00:01:04.640> three

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
started with we we have we've got three

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.560 
started with we we have we've got three
and<00:01:04.939> a<00:01:05.000> half<00:01:05.269> months<00:01:05.689> to<00:01:05.840> go<00:01:07.270> Kari<00:01:08.270> is<00:01:08.390> very

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
and a half months to go Kari is very

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.480 
and a half months to go Kari is very
articulate<00:01:09.200> so<00:01:09.350> I<00:01:09.439> have<00:01:09.590> no<00:01:09.770> issues<00:01:10.250> there

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
articulate so I have no issues there

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.070 
articulate so I have no issues there
she's<00:01:10.729> a<00:01:10.759> really<00:01:11.090> very<00:01:11.270> beautiful

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
and I think she'll make a great

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.970 
and I think she'll make a great
representation<00:01:14.030> of<00:01:14.360> what

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
representation of what

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:21.240 
representation of what
about<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:17.650> a<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:19.000> know<00:01:19.030> so<00:01:19.420> not<00:01:20.020> not<00:01:20.620> many<00:01:20.980> if

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250

you<00:01:21.280> ask<00:01:21.370> me<00:01:21.640> three<00:01:21.790> months<00:01:22.090> later<00:01:22.270> we<00:01:22.720> can

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
you ask me three months later we can

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.870 
you ask me three months later we can
unlike<00:01:23.290> I<00:01:23.440> can<00:01:23.650> give<00:01:24.190> you<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.460> gory<00:01:24.730> details

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
unlike I can give you the gory details

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.610 
unlike I can give you the gory details
to<00:01:25.720> but<00:01:26.340> but<00:01:27.340> for<00:01:27.610> now<00:01:27.850> you<00:01:28.300> know<00:01:28.450> so<00:01:29.170> far<00:01:29.410> it's

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
to but but for now you know so far it's

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:37.230 
to but but for now you know so far it's
been<00:01:29.710> very<00:01:32.400> see<00:01:33.840> like<00:01:34.840> I<00:01:35.080> am<00:01:35.470> I<00:01:35.850> would<00:01:36.850> love<00:01:37.030> to

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
been very see like I am I would love to

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.270 
been very see like I am I would love to
be<00:01:37.390> right<00:01:37.630> now<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:37.870> I<00:01:38.290> think<00:01:38.350> it's<00:01:38.800> really<00:01:39.220> in

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
be right now and I think it's really in

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.190 
be right now and I think it's really in
doubt<00:01:39.460> that<00:01:39.730> you<00:01:39.910> being<00:01:40.150> is<00:01:40.420> on<00:01:40.630> board<00:01:40.990> with

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
doubt that you being is on board with

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.430 
doubt that you being is on board with
this<00:01:41.700> because<00:01:42.700> it<00:01:43.000> also<00:01:43.180> helps<00:01:43.450> me<00:01:43.720> realign<00:01:44.290> my

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
this because it also helps me realign my

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.530 
this because it also helps me realign my
expectations<00:01:45.190> my<00:01:45.370> expectations<00:01:46.060> people

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
expectations my expectations people

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.010 
expectations my expectations people
might<00:01:47.200> not<00:01:47.410> be<00:01:47.710> as<00:01:48.010> accurate<00:01:48.550> as<00:01:49.060> you<00:01:49.420> know

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
might not be as accurate as you know

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.290 
might not be as accurate as you know
office<00:01:50.500> they<00:01:51.010> would<00:01:51.250> be<00:01:51.370> able<00:01:51.430> to<00:01:51.640> prepare<00:01:52.090> me

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
office they would be able to prepare me

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.880 
office they would be able to prepare me
for<00:01:52.330> because<00:01:52.840> she<00:01:52.870> has<00:01:53.140> been<00:01:53.350> through<00:01:53.650> it<00:01:53.680> and

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
for because she has been through it and

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.980 
for because she has been through it and
I<00:01:53.980> think<00:01:54.010> that<00:01:54.850> it's<00:01:55.030> important<00:01:55.570> for<00:01:55.630> someone

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
I think that it's important for someone

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.980 
I think that it's important for someone
who<00:01:56.230> has<00:01:56.440> been<00:01:56.650> to<00:01:56.890> it<00:01:57.040> too<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.570> broadened

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
who has been to it too so the broadened

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.780 
who has been to it too so the broadened
my<00:01:59.050> perspective<00:01:59.470> in<00:02:00.010> what<00:02:00.190> it<00:02:00.310> handles<00:02:00.670> really

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
my perspective in what it handles really

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.360 
my perspective in what it handles really
about<00:02:01.240> I<00:02:01.810> think<00:02:02.350> my<00:02:02.800> knowledge<00:02:03.160> of<00:02:03.280> the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
about I think my knowledge of the

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.730 
about I think my knowledge of the
pageant<00:02:03.760> has<00:02:03.820> always<00:02:04.090> been<00:02:04.420> not<00:02:05.410> so<00:02:05.560> much

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
pageant has always been not so much

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.029 
pageant has always been not so much
first<00:02:06.040> or<00:02:06.790> even<00:02:06.820> second<00:02:07.360> hands

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
first or even second hands

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.369 
first or even second hands
at<00:02:08.759> least<00:02:09.090> now<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.599> think<00:02:09.659> I<00:02:09.869> will<00:02:10.019> be<00:02:10.110> able<00:02:10.229> to

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
at least now I think I will be able to

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.250 
at least now I think I will be able to
get<00:02:10.590> secondhand<00:02:11.189> from
