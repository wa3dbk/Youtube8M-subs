hope of isolating the leak is to close

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.670 
hope of isolating the leak is to close

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
valves that feed oxygen into two of the

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.960 
valves that feed oxygen into two of the
fuel<00:03:23.920> cells<00:03:24.660> but<00:03:25.660> closing<00:03:26.170> these<00:03:26.290> valves<00:03:26.799> is

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
fuel cells but closing these valves is

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.110 
fuel cells but closing these valves is
irreversible

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
irreversible

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.700 
irreversible
those<00:03:28.900> two<00:03:29.169> fuel<00:03:29.500> cells<00:03:29.769> will<00:03:30.549> not<00:03:30.760> work<00:03:30.970> again

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
those two fuel cells will not work again
