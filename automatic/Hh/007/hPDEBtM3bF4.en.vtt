 Hello, my name is Irina Lyamshina and 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.509
 I am glad to welcome you on my own 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.880
 the channel which is called irishka whether i 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:16.260
 Today I will continue my story about 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:19.289
 how i painted dogrose here i'm drawing 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.650
 and leaves for this i use a brush 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.580
 which is called petal as well as 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:31.410
 cat's tongue she has a domed 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:35.250
 the form for painting I used two 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:39.149
 colors 17 green and second where now 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:44.610
 knead white and blue and green 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:53.370
 yellow and dial to the very edge 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:56.070
 tassels and forest leaves transition between 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.730
 these colors are very smooth and 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.730
 beautiful 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.729
 now i will draw 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.909
 sprig 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.470
 and here is the same twig 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:07.840
 after its painted leaves 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:10.860
 the form is clearly in blue which will add 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.220
 the depth of our drawing and cross out 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.220
 White flowers 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:25.750
 fill all spaces 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.750
 empty spaces 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.690
 here i use a lighter tone 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.980
 thus emphasizing the leaves and 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:09.560
 smoothly away from dark to light 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.600
 have our drawing quietly 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.459
 dissolves the run due to the fact 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.030
 what he 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.630
 background leaves on the edge of a lighter 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.630
 by color 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.270
 here I am too 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:36.710
 I take a lighter tone than the leaves 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.710
 surrounding children 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:15.650
 now i'm drawing a sprig not used until 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:17.940
 end on color since the main 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.459
 the function of this twig give 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:25.190
 refinement 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.190
 the main thing is her silhouette on white paper 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.080
 to call 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:39.310
 And I supplement the drawing with a ticket with glasses 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.420
 you can notice that they 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.420
 become much lighter 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.480
 so we're judging too 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.480
 the depth 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:05:00.440
 and the closer the twigs to the compositional 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.620
 the center of which is the white flower 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.630
 full bloom 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.630
 so they were black 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:21.550
 draw the final touches 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.790
 stalks draw in brown 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.740
 our picture is almost ready 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.819
 Thanks for attention
