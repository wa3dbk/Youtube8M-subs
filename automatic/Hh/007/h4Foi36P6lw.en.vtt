00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.750
 So I have not been specifically yet , so I actually lg fashion last year 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:17.580
 For one person to Maestro 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:20.029
 Step by step how you did marketing 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:26.739
 I showed you 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:26.739
 Oh, maybe I'm reading you see this as a sense're coming to work like that 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:34.610
 Oh , this product first came out first. 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:41.090
 Yes, of course we've now kind of marketing when you view the product planning to write a theme 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:46.489
 When I caught the male adult suit their market leading brands 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:52.250
 Maestro logo case Galaxy Dax There's something like this 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:54.620
 The customers who came into the yore brands are in their late 40s and early 30s 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:00.170
 It is rattling men targeted 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:04.970
 In fact, men in their late 30s and 40s are now low on ducks. 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:10.159
 I do not give a shit about the Olympics, and I see my parents' generations. 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:12.740
 I just wore something that would erase it to my mother. 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:18.380
 And then, 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:22.909
 That character that we like to wear differently from brand casual brand 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:28.100
 Then I rather there is no personality in the market without personality 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:34.240
 How different brands have differentiated so consumers 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:38.479
 Oh, I gotta say something homework that will make sure to buy the axle so nakma 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:43.399
 We did not want to take it differentially. 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:47.030
 This element is my passion in my last week. 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:50.509
 Applause is a successful enemy 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:55.069
 It is important that there is expensive Galaxy 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:57.860
 That's the thing along Gauguin him only slightly less crazy boss you have a little age 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:00.619
 Pierce Bros. I want to advertise. 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:06.109
 ps no, not too many 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:08.959
 Then I crossed to take a picture and a very busy trying to live a largely biased 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:13.400
 You can see that the target is the target. 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:18.150
 But how does the Maestro have differentiating about it? 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:21.780
 Not a person to achieve such success 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:27.810
 Towards that success . 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:33.329
 Items required for such a person is passionate chicken and the way up to the top 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:35.360
 If the arrest is in society, 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:40.220
 It's no big deal . 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:44.239
 Because to me that my life is starting with such a slight Fame 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:49.670
 2 Especially on the Fischer side, 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:54.890
 That's the idea seems to be the main problem in the fashion business so 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:59.880
 Wearing a light rope will help you to go for that success. 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:03.390
 Then I unlock the theme and become justified. 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:07.080
 Do you want to live by yourself if you read it? 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:12.270
 If I do so because I am talking macaw 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:16.140
 How can you make it attractive with marketing 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:20.100
 Step d is the part that you have to worry about 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.950
 I like to take pictures of hobbies . 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:27.450
 4 Because I like the second floor too 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:32.220
 After the company is over , I'll try to use the studio with Tuche . 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:35.340
 Until then we have to develop that bright jjikneunde 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:39.480
 There are a lot of sites on the internet that upload photos 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:45.480
 By the way, I can recommend it to people. 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:48.450
 Yeah I know eopdan safe to get a little bit like the time had now 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:54.690
 I am worried about the fact that I am in the marketing 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:57.480
 It's the same thing. After uploading the photos, people will love the photo and the temperature. 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:01.830
 There are a lot of suggestions for why this is happening. 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:04.500
 We are told that the normal part will keep functioning. 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.740
 Similarly, the picture is 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:12.360
 I shot 5 kirt girlfriends. 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.470
 Vikram does the same thing to a dog, but some people some level of Cat rum 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:20.160
 I have not 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:23.400
 Likewise, how to make it attractive with obvious subject 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.480
 I was worried about the way 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.470
 I got 7 . 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:33.790
 Men in the forties, 40 men in the thirties 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:36.190
 Male views are usually a lot of women . 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.610
 This part is beautiful because it is part of y . 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:43.780
 This is a guy . Yeah. 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:50.260
 So, when you are always in touch with the first time, Nan Soon is really good again. 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:53.380
 Try investigating anesthesiologist Joey yogeo Nan Song General of the consumers 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.590
 The tangue area is indifferent at night 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:01.630
 Consumers Yes 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:07.420
 Yes to the librarian of the pair, so get up in the morning and star 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:10.750
 Song heading straight to come home to eat the central government is better this timing 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:16.030
 It is the aggressive Korean pattern of men 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:22.240
 Then I look Where people are not even an ad 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:25.860
 I have to send some of the ads to see the building and affect my clothes to buy strangely 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.900
 Po Come to the investigating Does 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:33.580
 The first one did not have built-in support. 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:37.150
 In store o 's doctor you put this love will 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:42.430
 This will be her inde my application Being 40 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:43.510
 That was the first place that the second is whether the 3rd Department Fame 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.770
 When 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:52.000
 Let's go see it and not live in North Korea too 5 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:55.630
 Oh yeah, but gotta go with Sage passive That 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.420
 But until now, it's not really an advertisement. 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:02.350
 What part of this achievement eoyoung 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:09.490
 In the advertising section, Te is the top- ranked local 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:13.240
 This vertical red line is easily caught underneath the line , 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:18.100
 It's a hard part to buy and connect . 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:22.030
 The vector u in yo u shareholders ppuninde how magazine ads and tv 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:25.690
 When the tv ads once the shop typically contains 50 to 50 go 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:29.260
 What the hell is that company shooting? 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:32.620
 There are more than 100 billion brands in Korea 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:36.700
 There is usually about 10 billion revenue 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:41.350
 There are more than 20 brands in Korea. 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:44.920
 So I spend 5 billion won for the manpower and 10 billion for the manpower. 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:47.860
 Let's think about this very useful. 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:52.720
 If it could have a big impact, 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:57.280
 It is Gwangyang that can not be easily done. 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:07:00.040
 Eopeuni a way to see this team brings you inside me while my two layers of power 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:04.900
 What the mask came up with 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:07.930
 That'll let the rain damage of blood contains blood would have seen minutes 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:12.340
 Play smart to say the project 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:14.830
 It's a way to go to the TV show . 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:19.150
 If you look at a man more than that flower 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:20.410
 If jukjip it.I thought this straight once appeared at home with homework Then the accumulated revenue 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:25.270
 It looks like a climb. 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:28.370
 I do not think you should be ashamed to see how 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:35.180
 All Camry people would have a vision 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:39.920
 So our country is immersed for fertilizer than other Western also be strong 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:47.180
 The fortress has improved a lot but it was a country where there was a great deal of media control conflict 

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:51.320
 Besides kibbi, there's a lot more blood than anything else. 

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:55.790
 Eun-young Park sells TV talk 

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:59.390
 Socially, the wavelengths are cloudy. In the case of the United States, 

00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:04.020
 More than 100 cancellations Anyone say anything 

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:11.389
 So, the conflict is like that . Now , the fragrance of our country is strong in this fragrance. 

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:11.389
 So I decided to make a flow decision to advertise indirectly on TV.
