00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
against 9 on f6 and the bishop on c2 so

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.040 
against 9 on f6 and the bishop on c2 so
I<00:00:30.510> only<00:00:31.050> had<00:00:31.640> really<00:00:32.640> one<00:00:33.030> move<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.329> play<00:00:33.780> here

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
I only had really one move to play here

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.880 
I only had really one move to play here
I<00:00:34.200> have<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.649> play<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.950> move<00:00:35.100> Knight<00:00:35.250> g4

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
I have to play the move Knight g4

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.229 
I have to play the move Knight g4
everything<00:00:37.890> else<00:00:38.070> allows<00:00:38.489> ye<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.000> take<00:00:39.210> a

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
everything else allows ye to take a

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.410 
everything else allows ye to take a
piece<00:00:39.570> pretty<00:00:39.930> much<00:00:40.110> for<00:00:40.350> free<00:00:40.460> so<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:42.120> point

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
piece pretty much for free so the point

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.799 
piece pretty much for free so the point
of<00:00:42.540> 94<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.800> if<00:00:44.100> Queen<00:00:44.610> takes<00:00:44.789> c2<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.570> of

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
of 94 is that if Queen takes c2 I of

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.650 
of 94 is that if Queen takes c2 I of
course<00:00:45.989> take<00:00:46.379> their<00:00:46.860> Bishop<00:00:47.219> on<00:00:47.340> e3<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.969> thus

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
course take their Bishop on e3 and thus

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.270 
course take their Bishop on e3 and thus
dark<00:00:48.870> squared<00:00:49.110> Bishop<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.620> one<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.070> White's

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
dark squared Bishop is one of White's

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.830 
dark squared Bishop is one of White's
most<00:00:50.550> important<00:00:51.090> pieces<00:00:51.239> because<00:00:51.719> it's

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
most important pieces because it's

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.770 
most important pieces because it's
protecting<00:00:52.469> all<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.770> dark<00:00:53.160> squares<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:54.180> I'd

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
protecting all the dark squares so I'd

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.319 
protecting all the dark squares so I'd
be<00:00:55.020> very<00:00:55.199> happy<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.649> trade<00:00:56.070> my<00:00:56.730> bishop<00:00:56.969> for

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
be very happy to trade my bishop for

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.029 
be very happy to trade my bishop for
this<00:00:57.600> Bishop<00:00:57.930> because<00:00:58.170> White's<00:00:58.469> position<00:00:58.920> is

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
this Bishop because White's position is

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.790 
this Bishop because White's position is
probably<00:00:59.480> very<00:01:00.480> loose<00:01:00.780> at<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.199> point<00:01:01.530> and

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
probably very loose at this point and

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.889 
probably very loose at this point and
I'm<00:01:02.280> hitting<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.699> Queen<00:01:02.969> I'm<00:01:03.239> attacking<00:01:03.629> this

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
I'm hitting the Queen I'm attacking this

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.010 
I'm hitting the Queen I'm attacking this
pawn<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.170> d5<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.030> I'm<00:01:06.030> also<00:01:06.360> hitting<00:01:06.780> this

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
pawn on d5 and I'm also hitting this

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.380 
pawn on d5 and I'm also hitting this
other<00:01:07.260> Bishop<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.830> f1<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.729> blacks<00:01:08.939> position<00:01:09.119> is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
other Bishop on f1 so blacks position is

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.990 
other Bishop on f1 so blacks position is
definitely<00:01:09.810> pretty<00:01:10.500> good<00:01:10.799> here<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.070> mean<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.400> I'm

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
definitely pretty good here I mean I I'm

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.240 
definitely pretty good here I mean I I'm
even<00:01:12.299> up<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.570> pawn<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.770> lot<00:01:14.220> of

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
even up a pawn and I have a lot of

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.560 
even up a pawn and I have a lot of
attacking<00:01:14.700> resources<00:01:15.390> left<00:01:16.610> so<00:01:17.610> one<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
attacking resources left so one of the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.510 
attacking resources left so one of the
critical<00:01:18.689> lines<00:01:19.170> here<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.530> course<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:20.189> if

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
critical lines here of course is if

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.060 
critical lines here of course is if
white<00:01:21.420> plays<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.869> intermediate<00:01:22.470> move<00:01:22.619> Bishop

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
white plays the intermediate move Bishop

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.289 
white plays the intermediate move Bishop
takes<00:01:23.280> b6<00:01:24.470> so<00:01:25.470> he<00:01:26.100> takes<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.520> piece<00:01:26.700> attacks<00:01:27.119> my

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
takes b6 so he takes a piece attacks my

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.539 
takes b6 so he takes a piece attacks my
queen<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.810> recapture<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.680> he<00:01:29.009> takes<00:01:29.250> this

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
queen I recapture and he takes this

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.819 
queen I recapture and he takes this
Bishop<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:30.990> now<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.470> no<00:01:31.619> way<00:01:31.799> of

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
Bishop so now I have no way of

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.980 
Bishop so now I have no way of
recapturing<00:01:32.610> my<00:01:32.790> piece<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.079> do<00:01:34.320> have<00:01:34.740> this

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
recapturing my piece but I do have this

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.560 
recapturing my piece but I do have this
interesting<00:01:36.990> check<00:01:37.259> on<00:01:37.500> f2<00:01:38.150> and<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.299> had<00:01:39.450> to

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
interesting check on f2 and I had to

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.289 
interesting check on f2 and I had to
calculate<00:01:40.049> all<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.820> from<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.850> very

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
calculate all this from the very

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.880 
calculate all this from the very
beginning<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.049> video<00:01:43.229> when<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.619> played

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
beginning of this video when I played

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.770 
beginning of this video when I played
works<00:01:44.100> yet<00:01:44.430> which<00:01:45.090> i<00:01:45.240> think<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.540> pretty

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
works yet which i think is pretty

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.899 
works yet which i think is pretty
interesting<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.380> as<00:01:46.530> you'll<00:01:46.710> see<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:46.890> had<00:01:47.759> to

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
interesting and as you'll see I had to

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.749 
interesting and as you'll see I had to
find<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.299> really<00:01:48.509> creative<00:01:49.380> move<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.189> justify

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
find a really creative move to justify

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.170 
find a really creative move to justify
this<00:01:51.390> whole<00:01:51.450> sacrifice<00:01:52.460> so<00:01:53.460> after<00:01:53.670> Queen<00:01:53.880> f2

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
this whole sacrifice so after Queen f2

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.020 
this whole sacrifice so after Queen f2

draw<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:11.039> was<00:02:11.700> trying<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.030> find<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.420> way<00:02:12.569> to

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
draw I was trying to find a way to

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.000 
draw I was trying to find a way to
continue<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.599> attack<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:15.349> then<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.530> found<00:02:15.800> the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
continue the attack and then I found the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.630 
continue the attack and then I found the
very<00:02:16.160> strong<00:02:16.489> move<00:02:16.700> Bishop<00:02:16.940> d8<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:19.340> point

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
very strong move Bishop d8 and the point

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.699 
very strong move Bishop d8 and the point
of<00:02:19.730> this<00:02:19.849> move<00:02:20.030> is<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.959> bishop<00:02:21.140> is<00:02:21.500> going

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
of this move is that the bishop is going

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.650 
of this move is that the bishop is going
to<00:02:21.769> be<00:02:21.890> relocated<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:22.670> either<00:02:22.790> be<00:02:23.150> six<00:02:23.450> or<00:02:23.629> a

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
to be relocated to either be six or a

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.040 
to be relocated to either be six or a
five<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:25.030> my<00:02:26.030> last<00:02:26.209> piece<00:02:26.480> is<00:02:26.599> coming<00:02:26.810> into

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
five and my last piece is coming into

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.570 
five and my last piece is coming into
the<00:02:27.260> attack<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:27.800> White's<00:02:28.010> position<00:02:28.160> is

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
the attack and White's position is

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.970 
the attack and White's position is
pretty<00:02:29.239> much<00:02:29.420> on<00:02:29.599> the<00:02:29.690> verge<00:02:29.900> of<00:02:30.140> collapse

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
pretty much on the verge of collapse

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.640 
pretty much on the verge of collapse
what<00:02:31.940> I<00:02:31.970> have<00:02:32.239> to<00:02:32.390> realize<00:02:32.780> here<00:02:33.049> is<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:33.260> why

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
what I have to realize here is that why

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.369 
what I have to realize here is that why
it<00:02:33.709> doesn't<00:02:33.950> actually<00:02:34.220> have<00:02:34.610> an<00:02:34.879> easy<00:02:35.239> way<00:02:35.390> to

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
it doesn't actually have an easy way to

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.430 
it doesn't actually have an easy way to
untangle<00:02:37.209> his<00:02:38.209> king<00:02:38.540> is<00:02:38.660> stuck<00:02:38.870> in<00:02:39.019> the<00:02:39.110> center

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
untangle his king is stuck in the center

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.039 
untangle his king is stuck in the center
his<00:02:39.650> rooks<00:02:39.950> are<00:02:40.160> disconnected<00:02:40.849> and<00:02:41.049> there's

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
his rooks are disconnected and there's

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:47.199 
his rooks are disconnected and there's
no<00:02:42.319> obvious<00:02:42.620> way<00:02:43.780> for<00:02:44.780> them<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.670> sort<00:02:46.670> of<00:02:46.819> repel

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
no obvious way for them to sort of repel

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.620 
no obvious way for them to sort of repel
the<00:02:47.420> attack<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:48.790> I'll<00:02:49.790> show<00:02:50.120> you<00:02:50.150> what<00:02:50.390> I<00:02:50.420> mean

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
the attack and I'll show you what I mean

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.250 
the attack and I'll show you what I mean
so<00:02:50.930> for<00:02:51.590> example<00:02:52.040> if<00:02:52.130> King<00:02:52.340> c1<00:02:53.019> trying<00:02:54.019> to<00:02:54.140> get

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
so for example if King c1 trying to get

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.210 
so for example if King c1 trying to get
the<00:02:54.349> King<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.709> safety

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
move I was looking at is rook h-street

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.110 
move I was looking at is rook h-street
with<00:03:15.349> the<00:03:15.470> point<00:03:15.739> of<00:03:15.950> covering<00:03:16.549> this<00:03:16.910> e3

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.970 
with the point of covering this e3
square<00:03:17.630> so<00:03:17.840> now<00:03:17.959> black<00:03:18.200> doesn't<00:03:18.620> even<00:03:18.739> have<00:03:18.950> a

e5<00:03:44.480> check<00:03:45.200> a<00:03:45.609> very<00:03:46.609> nice<00:03:46.880> move<00:03:47.180> king<00:03:48.109> d4<00:03:48.680> and

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
e5 check a very nice move king d4 and

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.849 
e5 check a very nice move king d4 and
then<00:03:49.010> Bishop<00:03:49.190> b6<00:03:49.760> check<00:03:50.060> if<00:03:50.750> King<00:03:51.109> efore<00:03:51.620> then

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
then Bishop b6 check if King efore then

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.890 
then Bishop b6 check if King efore then
this<00:03:52.040> Knight<00:03:52.250> is<00:03:52.280> going<00:03:52.730> to<00:03:52.849> move<00:03:53.030> with<00:03:53.840> a

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
this Knight is going to move with a

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.650 
this Knight is going to move with a
discovery<00:03:54.560> and<00:03:54.739> white<00:03:55.669> is<00:03:55.849> definitely<00:03:56.269> going

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
discovery and white is definitely going

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.089 
discovery and white is definitely going
to<00:03:56.690> lose<00:03:56.930> for<00:03:57.829> example<00:03:58.250> King<00:03:58.549> e4<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.709> I<00:04:00.709> think

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
to lose for example King e4 and I think

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.900 
to lose for example King e4 and I think
knight<00:04:01.760> c6<00:04:02.090> check<00:04:02.690> is<00:04:02.989> pretty<00:04:03.910> sufficient

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
knight c6 check is pretty sufficient

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.170 
knight c6 check is pretty sufficient
king<00:04:05.359> d3<00:04:05.980> night<00:04:06.980> before<00:04:07.190> check<00:04:07.700> when's<00:04:08.000> the

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
king d3 night before check when's the

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.589 
king d3 night before check when's the
Queen<00:04:08.419> or<00:04:09.069> okay<00:04:10.069> King<00:04:10.579> before<00:04:10.760> Bishop<00:04:11.150> e6

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
Queen or okay King before Bishop e6

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.120 
Queen or okay King before Bishop e6
there's<00:04:12.590> a<00:04:12.650> nice<00:04:12.829> mate<00:04:13.130> and<00:04:14.230> if<00:04:15.230> King<00:04:15.440> f5<00:04:15.829> I

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
there's a nice mate and if King f5 I

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.170 
there's a nice mate and if King f5 I
believe<00:04:16.639> I<00:04:16.910> can<00:04:17.180> play<00:04:17.709> rook<00:04:18.709> c5<00:04:19.720> king<00:04:20.720> g4<00:04:21.469> and

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
believe I can play rook c5 king g4 and

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.750 
believe I can play rook c5 king g4 and
yeah<00:04:23.180> Rick<00:04:23.630> takes<00:04:23.900> g5

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
yeah Rick takes g5

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:33.580 
yeah Rick takes g5
in<00:04:25.820> 95<00:04:26.450> mate<00:04:27.520> so<00:04:30.610> if<00:04:31.610> F<00:04:31.850> takes<00:04:32.090> e5<00:04:32.540> then<00:04:33.050> Queen

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
in 95 mate so if F takes e5 then Queen

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.030 
in 95 mate so if F takes e5 then Queen
f5<00:04:33.920> check<00:04:34.250> and<00:04:34.750> I'm<00:04:35.750> at<00:04:35.900> least<00:04:35.930> winning<00:04:36.620> whites

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
f5 check and I'm at least winning whites

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.060 
f5 check and I'm at least winning whites
Queen<00:04:37.630> so<00:04:38.630> seeing<00:04:38.960> this<00:04:39.110> line<00:04:39.380> seeing<00:04:39.830> that

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
Queen so seeing this line seeing that

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.430 
Queen so seeing this line seeing that
White<00:04:40.730> has<00:04:40.910> no<00:04:40.940> way<00:04:41.390> to<00:04:41.420> really<00:04:41.750> untangle

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
White has no way to really untangle

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.860 
White has no way to really untangle
their<00:04:42.650> pieces<00:04:42.890> I<00:04:43.130> realized<00:04:43.520> that<00:04:43.700> black<00:04:44.570> must

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
their pieces I realized that black must

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.420 
their pieces I realized that black must
be<00:04:45.020> winning<00:04:45.290> here<00:04:45.500> because<00:04:45.860> the<00:04:46.010> bishop<00:04:46.160> is

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
be winning here because the bishop is

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.740 
be winning here because the bishop is
gonna<00:04:46.610> come<00:04:46.880> to<00:04:47.060> a5<00:04:47.480> or<00:04:47.510> b6<00:04:48.350> and<00:04:49.450> some<00:04:50.450> very<00:04:50.660> bad

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
gonna come to a5 or b6 and some very bad

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.020 
gonna come to a5 or b6 and some very bad
things<00:04:51.200> are<00:04:51.350> gonna<00:04:51.410> be<00:04:51.560> happening<00:04:52.030> along

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
things are gonna be happening along

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.750 
things are gonna be happening along
whites<00:04:53.720> dark<00:04:54.170> squares<00:04:54.440> remember<00:04:55.310> when<00:04:55.460> I<00:04:55.490> said

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
whites dark squares remember when I said

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.040 
whites dark squares remember when I said
that<00:04:55.790> White's<00:04:56.060> dark<00:04:56.360> squared<00:04:56.600> Bishop<00:04:56.900> was<00:04:57.020> a

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
that White's dark squared Bishop was a

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.050 
that White's dark squared Bishop was a
very<00:04:57.290> important<00:04:57.710> piece<00:04:57.860> well<00:04:58.550> this<00:04:58.880> is

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
very important piece well this is

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:07.270 
very important piece well this is
exactly<00:04:59.990> why<00:05:04.000> so<00:05:05.000> my<00:05:05.150> opponent<00:05:05.450> saw<00:05:05.870> that<00:05:06.280> he

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
exactly why so my opponent saw that he

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.740 
exactly why so my opponent saw that he
was<00:05:07.460> probably<00:05:07.820> in<00:05:08.090> trouble<00:05:08.240> after<00:05:08.630> Bishop

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
was probably in trouble after Bishop

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.280 
was probably in trouble after Bishop
takes<00:05:08.900> b6<00:05:09.560> and<00:05:09.860> he<00:05:10.220> found<00:05:11.200> definitely<00:05:12.200> the

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
takes b6 and he found definitely the

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.960 
takes b6 and he found definitely the
best<00:05:12.440> practical<00:05:12.950> chance<00:05:13.310> here<00:05:13.550> he<00:05:13.730> played

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
best practical chance here he played

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.990 
best practical chance here he played
Bishop<00:05:14.150> H<00:05:14.420> Street<00:05:15.400> during<00:05:16.400> the<00:05:16.760> game<00:05:16.970> I

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
Bishop H Street during the game I

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.730 
Bishop H Street during the game I
actually<00:05:17.300> overlooked<00:05:17.990> this<00:05:18.140> move<00:05:18.440> in<00:05:18.620> my

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
actually overlooked this move in my

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.910 
actually overlooked this move in my
initial<00:05:19.220> calculations<00:05:20.150> after<00:05:20.450> rook<00:05:20.630> c8

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
initial calculations after rook c8

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.530 
initial calculations after rook c8
because<00:05:21.920> I<00:05:21.950> assume<00:05:22.400> that<00:05:22.670> if<00:05:22.850> I<00:05:22.970> can<00:05:23.180> take<00:05:23.390> this

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
because I assume that if I can take this

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.820 
because I assume that if I can take this
Bishop<00:05:23.900> on<00:05:23.990> e3<00:05:24.140> I<00:05:25.240> should<00:05:26.240> probably<00:05:26.540> be<00:05:27.260> fine<00:05:27.590> I

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
Bishop on e3 I should probably be fine I

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.350 
Bishop on e3 I should probably be fine I
mean<00:05:27.890> the<00:05:28.310> dark<00:05:28.520> squares<00:05:28.760> are<00:05:28.880> gonna<00:05:28.970> be<00:05:29.150> weak

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
mean the dark squares are gonna be weak

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.380 
mean the dark squares are gonna be weak
and<00:05:30.220> more<00:05:31.220> likely<00:05:31.550> than<00:05:31.700> not<00:05:31.730> I'm<00:05:32.030> gonna<00:05:32.180> have

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
and more likely than not I'm gonna have

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.390 
and more likely than not I'm gonna have
very<00:05:32.420> good<00:05:32.870> attacking<00:05:33.440> chances<00:05:33.860> even<00:05:34.100> if<00:05:34.280> I'm

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
very good attacking chances even if I'm

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.290 
very good attacking chances even if I'm
down<00:05:34.580> a<00:05:34.880> piece<00:05:35.480> or<00:05:35.750> in<00:05:35.870> exchange<00:05:37.060> but<00:05:38.060> after<00:05:38.270> a

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
down a piece or in exchange but after a

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.570 
down a piece or in exchange but after a
bishop<00:05:38.570> h3<00:05:39.020> I<00:05:39.050> realized<00:05:39.560> that<00:05:39.830> if<00:05:40.220> Knight

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
bishop h3 I realized that if Knight

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.210 
bishop h3 I realized that if Knight
takes<00:05:40.850> III<00:05:41.390> he<00:05:42.170> doesn't<00:05:42.500> have<00:05:42.620> to<00:05:42.770> play<00:05:42.890> Queen

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
takes III he doesn't have to play Queen

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.030 
takes III he doesn't have to play Queen
takes<00:05:43.400> e3<00:05:43.910> after<00:05:44.330> which<00:05:44.480> I<00:05:44.810> can<00:05:45.410> move<00:05:45.560> my<00:05:45.620> rook

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
takes e3 after which I can move my rook

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.940 
takes e3 after which I can move my rook
and<00:05:46.280> my<00:05:46.490> bishop<00:05:46.670> will<00:05:47.000> be<00:05:47.150> safe<00:05:47.360> on<00:05:47.570> d3<00:05:48.020> but<00:05:48.770> he

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
and my bishop will be safe on d3 but he

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.590 
and my bishop will be safe on d3 but he
can<00:05:49.190> simply<00:05:49.400> play<00:05:49.850> Bishop<00:05:50.540> takes<00:05:50.720> c8<00:05:51.110> and<00:05:52.600> my

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
can simply play Bishop takes c8 and my

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.300 
can simply play Bishop takes c8 and my
knight<00:05:53.810> is<00:05:53.960> hanging<00:05:54.410> and<00:05:54.680> if<00:05:55.040> the<00:05:55.160> knight

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
knight is hanging and if the knight

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.380 
knight is hanging and if the knight
moves<00:05:55.640> my<00:05:55.760> Bishop<00:05:56.060> is<00:05:56.210> hanging<00:05:56.540> so<00:05:58.390> what's

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
moves my Bishop is hanging so what's

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.180 
moves my Bishop is hanging so what's
going<00:05:59.720> on<00:05:59.840> here<00:06:00.110> is<00:06:00.200> that<00:06:00.230> black<00:06:00.590> is<00:06:00.800> probably

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
going on here is that black is probably

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.790 
going on here is that black is probably
losing<00:06:01.460> in<00:06:01.760> exchange<00:06:02.240> so<00:06:02.540> like<00:06:02.720> Knight<00:06:03.350> G<00:06:03.590> to

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
losing in exchange so like Knight G to

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.050 
losing in exchange so like Knight G to
check<00:06:04.130> King<00:06:04.460> F<00:06:04.640> 1<00:06:04.910> I<00:06:05.590> take<00:06:06.590> on<00:06:06.800> c8<00:06:07.220> he<00:06:07.460> takes<00:06:07.760> on

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
check King F 1 I take on c8 he takes on

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:14.020 
check King F 1 I take on c8 he takes on
g2<00:06:08.900> and<00:06:09.850> I<00:06:11.050> can<00:06:12.050> give<00:06:12.230> a<00:06:12.260> check<00:06:12.590> but<00:06:12.830> 93<00:06:13.250> I<00:06:13.820> can

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
g2 and I can give a check but 93 I can

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.910 
g2 and I can give a check but 93 I can
save<00:06:14.240> my<00:06:14.390> Bishop<00:06:14.720> but<00:06:15.320> why<00:06:15.470> it<00:06:15.530> is<00:06:15.650> up<00:06:15.800> in

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:15.920 
save my Bishop but why it is up in

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.470 
save my Bishop but why it is up in
exchange<00:06:16.370> and<00:06:16.610> the<00:06:16.670> position<00:06:17.030> is<00:06:17.120> actually

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 
exchange and the position is actually

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.190 
exchange and the position is actually
closed<00:06:17.810> because<00:06:18.790> there<00:06:19.790> are<00:06:20.030> very<00:06:20.600> few<00:06:20.720> open

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:21.200 
closed because there are very few open
