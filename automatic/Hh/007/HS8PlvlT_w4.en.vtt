here's<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.879> blue<00:02:51.090> test<00:03:13.040> okay<00:03:14.040> now<00:03:14.220> remember<00:03:14.459> the

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
here's a blue test okay now remember the

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.140 
here's a blue test okay now remember the
blue<00:03:14.939> test<00:03:15.239> I<00:03:15.480> just<00:03:15.840> switched<00:03:16.260> over<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.709> green

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:30.129 

so<00:03:21.150> now<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.359> barrels<00:03:21.840> are<00:03:22.019> no<00:03:22.139> longer<00:03:22.379> blue

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:35.379 

the<00:03:31.139> green<00:03:31.349> isn't<00:03:31.650> going<00:03:32.099> to<00:03:32.220> be<00:03:32.370> as<00:03:32.459> dramatic

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.520 

because<00:03:36.389> there's<00:03:36.599> a<00:03:36.659> lot<00:03:36.959> of<00:03:37.109> green<00:03:37.319> out<00:03:37.500> here

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
because there's a lot of green out here

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:45.610 
because there's a lot of green out here
the<00:03:38.129> skies<00:03:38.400> are<00:03:38.639> very<00:03:38.819> blue<00:03:40.280> so<00:03:41.280> up<00:03:41.430> is<00:03:41.549> great

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.110 

there's<00:03:46.620> not<00:03:46.799> a<00:03:46.829> whole<00:03:47.129> lot<00:03:47.370> of<00:03:47.400> contrast<00:03:47.909> on

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
there's not a whole lot of contrast on

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:55.330 
there's not a whole lot of contrast on
the<00:03:48.209> green<00:03:52.189> okay<00:03:53.189> let's<00:03:53.370> find<00:03:53.609> something<00:03:54.000> else

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
the green okay let's find something else

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.030 
the green okay let's find something else
still<00:03:56.340> set<00:03:56.579> in<00:03:56.609> green<00:03:57.000> I'm<00:03:57.480> going<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.620> switch

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
still set in green I'm going to switch

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.009 
still set in green I'm going to switch
over<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.579> color<00:03:59.819> of<00:04:00.030> these<00:04:00.150> flowers<00:04:00.690> which

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
over to the color of these flowers which

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.619 
over to the color of these flowers which
is<00:04:02.930> more<00:04:03.930> like<00:04:04.049> a<00:04:04.079> fuchsia<00:04:04.440> I<00:04:04.560> guess<00:04:04.889> and<00:04:05.819> here

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
is more like a fuchsia I guess and here

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:29.150 
is more like a fuchsia I guess and here
are<00:04:06.780> my<00:04:06.900> flowers

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.800

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
and they have one more thing to test

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.200 
and they have one more thing to test
over<00:04:32.050> here<00:04:32.260> some<00:04:32.470> more<00:04:32.560> in<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:32.740> pond<00:04:33.090> see<00:04:34.090> how

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
over here some more in the pond see how

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:49.130 
over here some more in the pond see how
they<00:04:34.360> work<00:04:34.870> in<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.110> shade

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.260 

okay<00:04:50.140> now<00:04:50.320> one<00:04:50.530> more<00:04:50.710> thing<00:04:50.770> to<00:04:51.070> test<00:04:51.280> a<00:04:51.640> Red

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
okay now one more thing to test a Red

Barn<00:04:52.950> okay<00:04:53.950> now<00:04:54.130> it's<00:04:54.310> set<00:04:54.490> to<00:04:54.520> the<00:04:54.640> color<00:04:54.880> of

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
Barn okay now it's set to the color of

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:10.370 
Barn okay now it's set to the color of
the<00:04:55.090> barn

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.390 

this<00:05:10.980> is<00:05:11.130> handheld<00:05:12.860> and<00:05:13.860> I<00:05:13.920> think<00:05:14.160> I'm<00:05:14.280> in

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
this is handheld and I think I'm in

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.650 
this is handheld and I think I'm in
digital<00:05:14.700> zoom<00:05:17.000> so<00:05:18.000> it's<00:05:18.120> still<00:05:18.270> picking<00:05:18.540> up

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
digital zoom so it's still picking up

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:26.440 
digital zoom so it's still picking up
some<00:05:18.840> of<00:05:18.960> the<00:05:19.020> pinks<00:05:19.410> and<00:05:21.680> definitely<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:22.800> red

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.940 

has<00:05:27.450> some<00:05:27.630> gas<00:05:27.810> cans<00:05:28.110> behind<00:05:28.440> me<00:05:28.560> I'll<00:05:28.650> go<00:05:28.800> get

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
has some gas cans behind me I'll go get

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.790 
has some gas cans behind me I'll go get
them<00:05:29.100> too

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.430 
them too
okay<00:05:31.800> I<00:05:31.830> think<00:05:31.920> it<00:05:32.220> turned<00:05:32.460> out<00:05:32.580> more<00:05:32.820> red<00:05:33.440> the

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
okay I think it turned out more red the

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.330 
okay I think it turned out more red the
gas<00:05:34.620> cans<00:05:34.890> are<00:05:35.040> kind<00:05:35.160> of<00:05:35.190> old<00:05:35.340> faded<00:05:36.740> so<00:05:37.740> that

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
gas cans are kind of old faded so that

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
gas cans are kind of old faded so that
is<00:05:38.580> the<00:05:38.820> test<00:05:39.090> of<00:05:39.330> the<00:05:39.600> one-step<00:05:40.230> color<00:05:41.360> pretty

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360
