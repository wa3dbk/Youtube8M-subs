00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
so what could ever be the purpose of a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.700 
so what could ever be the purpose of a
prayer<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.360> supplication<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:25.140> mean<00:01:25.380> if<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.560> ask

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
prayer of supplication I mean if you ask

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.620 
prayer of supplication I mean if you ask
God<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:25.950> something<00:01:26.490> for<00:01:26.820> example<00:01:27.150> say<00:01:27.299> for<00:01:27.570> a

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
God for something for example say for a

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.240 
God for something for example say for a
sick<00:01:27.810> person<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.170> become<00:01:28.290> well<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.860> mean<00:01:29.130> an

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
sick person to become well I mean an

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.770 
sick person to become well I mean an
omniscient<00:01:29.549> God<00:01:29.880> would<00:01:30.180> already<00:01:30.450> know<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
omniscient God would already know the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.359 
omniscient God would already know the
outcome<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.409> if<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.530> person<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.009> meant<00:01:32.250> to

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
outcome so if that person is meant to

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.520 
outcome so if that person is meant to
die<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:33.329> means<00:01:33.540> your<00:01:33.720> prayer<00:01:34.140> won't<00:01:34.320> change

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
die that means your prayer won't change

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.950 
die that means your prayer won't change
God's<00:01:34.770> mind<00:01:35.070> right<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:36.659> for<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.810> sake<00:01:36.930> of

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
God's mind right but for the sake of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.270 
God's mind right but for the sake of
argument<00:01:37.229> let's<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.619> say<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.920> your<00:01:38.040> prayer

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
argument let's just say that your prayer

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.490 
argument let's just say that your prayer
does<00:01:38.670> make<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.119> sick<00:01:39.420> person<00:01:39.600> better<00:01:39.960> well

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
does make the sick person better well

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.140 
does make the sick person better well
that<00:01:40.619> means<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.950> God<00:01:41.189> changed<00:01:41.790> his<00:01:41.850> mind

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
that means that God changed his mind

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.969 
that means that God changed his mind
which<00:01:42.689> also<00:01:42.899> means<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.229> God<00:01:43.409> was<00:01:43.560> wrong<00:01:43.829> in

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
which also means that God was wrong in

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.330 
which also means that God was wrong in
the<00:01:44.040> first<00:01:44.070> place<00:01:44.369> which<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.210> impossible<00:01:45.750> um

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
the first place which it's impossible um

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.190 
the first place which it's impossible um
so<00:01:47.340> changing<00:01:47.759> God's<00:01:47.909> mind<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.270> impossible<00:01:48.750> so

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
so changing God's mind is impossible so

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.899 
so changing God's mind is impossible so
there's<00:01:49.770> no<00:01:49.890> point<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.159> supplicating<00:01:50.790> him

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
there's no point in supplicating him

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.670 
there's no point in supplicating him
like<00:01:51.060> he<00:01:51.210> were<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> mortal<00:01:51.780> King<00:01:51.810> because<00:01:52.290> that

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
like he were a mortal King because that

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.530 
like he were a mortal King because that
would<00:01:52.799> be<00:01:52.829> both<00:01:53.100> futile<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.880> an<00:01:54.149> insult<00:01:54.479> to

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
would be both futile and an insult to

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.709 
would be both futile and an insult to
God<00:01:54.630> no<00:01:55.020> no<00:01:55.229> no<00:01:55.579> that<00:01:56.579> can't<00:01:56.790> be<00:01:56.850> right<00:01:56.909> you

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
God no no no that can't be right you

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.209 
God no no no that can't be right you
must<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:57.960> some<00:01:58.170> flaw<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.530> your<00:01:58.680> logic<00:01:58.740> get
