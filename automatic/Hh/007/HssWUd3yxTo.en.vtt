00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
the tutorial what we're going to be

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:22.210 
the tutorial what we're going to be
making<00:00:14.759> is<00:00:15.269> something<00:00:15.660> like<00:00:15.780> this<00:00:20.390> right<00:00:21.390> so

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
making is something like this right so

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.740 
making is something like this right so
you<00:00:23.220> can<00:00:23.369> see<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.789> rocks<00:00:24.210> are<00:00:24.359> floating

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
you can see that the rocks are floating

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.740 
you can see that the rocks are floating
and<00:00:24.930> their<00:00:25.170> motion<00:00:25.769> track<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.359> you<00:00:27.359> need

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
and their motion track so you need

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.250 
and their motion track so you need
elements<00:00:28.529> free<00:00:28.769> d<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.750> don't<00:00:30.750> care<00:00:30.900> if<00:00:30.960> you've

so<00:02:03.150> now<00:02:04.150> we're<00:02:04.450> going<00:02:04.540> to<00:02:04.600> go<00:02:04.750> into<00:02:04.780> scene<00:02:05.590> set

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
so now we're going to go into scene set

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.850 
so now we're going to go into scene set
up<00:02:06.990> no<00:02:09.509> we<00:02:10.509> go<00:02:10.660> we're<00:02:11.020> going<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.230> go<00:02:11.380> into<00:02:11.410> the

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
starter pack which everybody has and

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.590 
starter pack which everybody has and
then<00:02:15.220> we're<00:02:15.430> going<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.610> get<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.060> floor

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
then we're going to get the floor

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.740 
then we're going to get the floor
fracture<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:18.040> it's<00:02:18.400> just<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.820> normal<00:02:19.060> floor

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
fracture and it's just a normal floor

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.210 
fracture and it's just a normal floor
fingy<00:02:20.020> like<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:21.060> yeah<00:02:22.230> just<00:02:23.230> press<00:02:23.410> ok<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.980> then

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
fingy like a yeah just press ok and then

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.820 
fingy like a yeah just press ok and then
we'll<00:02:24.550> get<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.150> in<00:02:25.300> our<00:02:25.450> clip<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.140> we<00:02:26.560> can<00:02:26.680> see

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
we'll get it in our clip and we can see

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.070 
we'll get it in our clip and we can see
that<00:02:26.980> its<00:02:27.100> motion<00:02:27.430> tracked<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:30.750> what<00:02:31.750> this<00:02:31.900> is

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
that its motion tracked and what this is

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.830 
that its motion tracked and what this is
basically<00:02:32.620> going<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.520> do<00:02:33.700> is<00:02:33.910> it's<00:02:34.450> going<00:02:34.750> to

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
basically going to do is it's going to

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.470 
basically going to do is it's going to
be<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:35.170> rock<00:02:35.380> so<00:02:35.770> if<00:02:36.010> we<00:02:36.220> scatter<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.880> it<00:02:37.360> will

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
be the rock so if we scatter it it will

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.780 
be the rock so if we scatter it it will
turn<00:02:37.690> into<00:02:37.750> like<00:02:38.110> rock<00:02:38.530> so<00:02:38.830> I'm<00:02:39.070> just<00:02:39.610> going<00:02:39.730> to

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
turn into like rock so I'm just going to

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.500 
turn into like rock so I'm just going to
show<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.090> that<00:02:40.209> now<00:02:40.450> we<00:02:41.080> go<00:02:41.200> into<00:02:41.230> group<00:02:41.620> 1<00:02:41.890> and

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
show you that now we go into group 1 and

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.270 
show you that now we go into group 1 and
open<00:02:43.510> particle<00:02:44.080> replicate<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:44.800> particle

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
open particle replicate and particle

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.630 
open particle replicate and particle
look<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:47.070> particle<00:02:48.070> lick<00:02:48.190> we<00:02:48.310> have<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.550> go

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
look and particle lick we have to go

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.600 
look and particle lick we have to go
into<00:02:49.020> multi<00:02:50.020> objects<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.740> click<00:02:51.160> on<00:02:51.400> the

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
into multi objects and click on the

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.960 
into multi objects and click on the
enable<00:02:52.270> button<00:02:52.770> and<00:02:53.770> then<00:02:54.040> we<00:02:54.130> get<00:02:54.310> this<00:02:55.320> so<00:02:56.970> we

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
enable button and then we get this so we

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.240 
enable button and then we get this so we
have<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.270> scatter<00:02:58.630> it<00:02:58.870> and<00:03:01.440> which<00:03:02.440> is<00:03:02.620> CSF<00:03:03.070> you

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
have to scatter it and which is CSF you

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.100 
have to scatter it and which is CSF you
see<00:03:04.560> we<00:03:05.560> scatter<00:03:06.190> it<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.610> then<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:07.930> basically

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
see we scatter it and then it basically

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.660 
see we scatter it and then it basically
just<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:09.450> expands<00:03:10.450> makes<00:03:11.230> like<00:03:11.470> rock<00:03:12.160> fingers

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
just the expands makes like rock fingers

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.360 
just the expands makes like rock fingers
and<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:14.110> I'm<00:03:14.410> just<00:03:14.650> going<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:14.830> turn<00:03:14.980> this<00:03:15.190> to

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
and the I'm just going to turn this to

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:25.259 
and the I'm just going to turn this to
about<00:03:17.370> 85<00:03:19.830> this<00:03:20.830> to<00:03:21.070> our<00:03:21.299> verde<00:03:23.670> vista<00:03:24.670> 30<00:03:25.120> as

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
about 85 this to our verde vista 30 as

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.520 
about 85 this to our verde vista 30 as
well

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.559 

so<00:03:29.340> we<00:03:29.490> have<00:03:29.670> that<00:03:31.880> you<00:03:32.880> can<00:03:33.030> see<00:03:33.240> that<00:03:33.270> a<00:03:33.450> lot

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
so we have that you can see that a lot

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.480 
so we have that you can see that a lot
of<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.930> rocks<00:03:34.230> are<00:03:34.440> in<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.860> floor<00:03:35.160> which<00:03:35.459> is

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
of the rocks are in the floor which is

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.730 
of the rocks are in the floor which is
pretty<00:03:35.790> ugly<00:03:36.360> so<00:03:36.600> we're<00:03:36.810> just<00:03:36.840> going<00:03:37.080> to<00:03:37.170> this

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
pretty ugly so we're just going to this

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.400 
pretty ugly so we're just going to this
tutorial<00:03:37.920> I'm<00:03:38.370> just<00:03:38.520> going<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:38.870> put<00:03:39.870> this<00:03:39.900> up<00:03:40.230> a

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
tutorial I'm just going to put this up a

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.250 
tutorial I'm just going to put this up a
bit<00:03:40.440> alright<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:41.700> that's<00:03:41.880> pretty<00:03:42.150> cool<00:03:45.260> maybe

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
bit alright so that's pretty cool maybe

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.280 
bit alright so that's pretty cool maybe
up<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.709> bit<00:03:46.890> more<00:03:47.250> yeah<00:03:47.700> that's<00:03:47.910> perfect<00:03:48.290> so

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
up a bit more yeah that's perfect so

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.229 
up a bit more yeah that's perfect so
we've<00:03:49.440> got<00:03:49.530> this<00:03:50.930> now<00:03:52.370> we<00:03:53.370> are<00:03:53.520> almost<00:03:53.850> done

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
we've got this now we are almost done

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.050 
we've got this now we are almost done
but<00:03:55.080> as<00:03:55.230> you<00:03:55.470> can<00:03:55.590> see<00:03:55.890> we<00:03:56.400> go<00:03:56.520> through<00:03:56.819> and

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
but as you can see we go through and

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.100 
but as you can see we go through and
it's<00:03:57.390> a<00:03:57.780> bit<00:03:57.959> dull<00:03:59.390> with<00:04:00.390> dulla<00:04:00.630> mean<00:04:00.900> like

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
it's a bit dull with dulla mean like

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.949 
it's a bit dull with dulla mean like
nothing<00:04:01.980> is<00:04:02.100> moving<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:03.030> like<00:04:03.060> that<00:04:03.180> so

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
nothing is moving and like that so

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.750 
nothing is moving and like that so
we're<00:04:04.530> going<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:04.739> do<00:04:04.950> like<00:04:05.400> you're<00:04:05.550> floating

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
we're going to do like you're floating

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.720 
we're going to do like you're floating
effects<00:04:06.300> so<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:07.410> rocks<00:04:07.709> are<00:04:07.980> going<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.489> turn

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
effects so the rocks are going to turn

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
effects so the rocks are going to turn
and<00:04:10.459> how<00:04:11.459> are<00:04:11.519> we<00:04:11.550> going<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:11.760> do<00:04:11.880> this<00:04:12.030> is<00:04:12.269> very

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
and how are we going to do this is very

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.500 
and how are we going to do this is very
simple<00:04:13.110> we're<00:04:13.350> just<00:04:13.500> going<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.650> go<00:04:13.830> on<00:04:14.069> to<00:04:14.510> the

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
simple we're just going to go on to the

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.440 
simple we're just going to go on to the
rotation<00:04:15.810> x<00:04:16.470> y&amp;z<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.400> key<00:04:17.669> frame<00:04:17.970> it<00:04:18.150> at<00:04:18.299> the

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
rotation x y&amp;z and key frame it at the

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.840 
rotation x y&amp;z and key frame it at the
start<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.200> I'm<00:04:20.040> going<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.250> go<00:04:20.310> right<00:04:20.549> to<00:04:20.729> the

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
start and I'm going to go right to the

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.890 
start and I'm going to go right to the
end<00:04:21.890> where<00:04:22.890> the<00:04:22.950> cinematic<00:04:23.760> stops<00:04:24.210> and<00:04:24.510> then

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
end where the cinematic stops and then

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.219 
end where the cinematic stops and then
we're<00:04:25.080> going<00:04:25.200> to<00:04:25.290> do<00:04:25.470> a<00:04:26.330> by<00:04:27.330> X<00:04:27.630> we're<00:04:27.990> going<00:04:28.139> to

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229
