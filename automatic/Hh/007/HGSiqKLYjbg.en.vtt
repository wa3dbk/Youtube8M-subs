 accessories but recognize this fact that in 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.099
 in some cases they would not prevent 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.900
 for example some wide angle 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.120

 capture small or distant parts 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.850
 if the situation with macro shooting is resolved 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.770
