00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.920 

you<00:00:15.820> know<00:00:15.910> I<00:00:15.940> did<00:00:16.120> the<00:00:16.210> research<00:00:16.390> for<00:00:16.720> a<00:00:16.750> long

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930 
you know I did the research for a long

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.990 
you know I did the research for a long
time<00:00:17.200> and<00:00:17.530> I<00:00:17.980> wrote<00:00:18.160> scenes<00:00:18.460> here<00:00:18.760> and<00:00:18.880> there

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
time and I wrote scenes here and there

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.820 
time and I wrote scenes here and there
and<00:00:19.300> so<00:00:19.480> I<00:00:19.540> had<00:00:19.720> bits<00:00:20.170> and<00:00:20.320> pieces<00:00:20.410> but<00:00:20.680> I

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
and so I had bits and pieces but I

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.410 
and so I had bits and pieces but I
didn't<00:00:21.100> I<00:00:21.250> really<00:00:21.610> did<00:00:21.820> years<00:00:22.180> with<00:00:22.360> the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
didn't I really did years with the

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.240 
didn't I really did years with the
research<00:00:22.690> before<00:00:22.869> I<00:00:23.020> ever<00:00:23.140> started<00:00:23.950> trying<00:00:24.189> to

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
research before I ever started trying to

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.550 
research before I ever started trying to
construct<00:00:24.610> it<00:00:24.760> into<00:00:25.000> a<00:00:25.029> book<00:00:25.510> and<00:00:25.750> that<00:00:26.320> was<00:00:26.529> a

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
construct it into a book and that was a

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.350 
construct it into a book and that was a
several<00:00:26.920> year<00:00:27.070> long<00:00:27.310> process<00:00:27.550> once<00:00:27.910> I<00:00:28.000> started

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.360 
several year long process once I started

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.630 
several year long process once I started
and<00:00:28.570> you<00:00:29.260> know<00:00:29.290> it's<00:00:29.920> three<00:00:30.220> narratives

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
and you know it's three narratives

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.140 
and you know it's three narratives
grated<00:00:31.119> together<00:00:31.390> jumps<00:00:31.960> around<00:00:32.050> in<00:00:32.230> time

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.150 
grated together jumps around in time

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.430 
grated together jumps around in time
back<00:00:34.150> and<00:00:34.329> forth<00:00:34.540> between<00:00:34.810> the<00:00:35.260> three

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
back and forth between the three

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.740 
back and forth between the three
different<00:00:35.560> narratives<00:00:36.070> and<00:00:36.220> I<00:00:36.760> realized<00:00:37.480> that

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
different narratives and I realized that

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.360 
different narratives and I realized that
I<00:00:37.810> needed<00:00:38.110> to<00:00:38.290> do<00:00:38.440> that<00:00:38.650> in<00:00:38.860> part<00:00:39.100> once<00:00:39.250> I

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
I needed to do that in part once I

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.630 
I needed to do that in part once I
realized<00:00:39.700> I<00:00:39.850> had<00:00:39.880> to<00:00:40.120> be<00:00:40.210> in<00:00:40.300> the<00:00:40.420> book<00:00:40.630> because

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
realized I had to be in the book because

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.520 
realized I had to be in the book because
if<00:00:42.640> I<00:00:42.790> told<00:00:43.060> it<00:00:43.210> chronologically<00:00:43.930> would<00:00:44.440> have

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
if I told it chronologically would have

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.810 
if I told it chronologically would have
just<00:00:44.680> been<00:00:44.739> this<00:00:44.950> historic<00:00:45.460> story<00:00:45.700> of

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
just been this historic story of

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.100 
just been this historic story of
Henrietta<00:00:46.210> and<00:00:46.390> then<00:00:46.510> the<00:00:46.660> cells<00:00:46.870> would<00:00:47.020> have

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
Henrietta and then the cells would have

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.480 
Henrietta and then the cells would have
been<00:00:47.200> taken<00:00:47.590> and<00:00:47.710> then<00:00:47.860> her<00:00:47.980> children<00:00:48.370> would

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.490 
been taken and then her children would

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.190 
been taken and then her children would
have<00:00:48.550> been<00:00:48.670> used<00:00:48.910> in<00:00:49.000> research<00:00:49.300> and<00:00:49.510> then<00:00:49.630> like

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
have been used in research and then like

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.750 
have been used in research and then like
I<00:00:50.440> would<00:00:50.500> appear<00:00:50.890> in<00:00:51.010> the<00:00:51.100> final<00:00:51.250> third<00:00:51.550> of<00:00:51.670> the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
I would appear in the final third of the

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.980 
I would appear in the final third of the
book<00:00:51.880> and<00:00:52.090> then<00:00:52.150> Deborah<00:00:52.480> would<00:00:52.630> become<00:00:52.870> the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:52.990 
book and then Deborah would become the

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.840 
book and then Deborah would become the
main<00:00:53.110> character<00:00:53.680> and<00:00:53.860> it<00:00:53.980> would<00:00:54.070> just<00:00:54.250> it<00:00:54.400> sort

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
main character and it would just it sort

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.560 
main character and it would just it sort
of<00:00:54.970> would<00:00:55.390> have<00:00:55.510> been<00:00:55.660> all<00:00:55.870> a<00:00:56.230> little<00:00:57.160> off<00:00:57.570> in

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
of would have been all a little off in

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.990 
of would have been all a little off in
terms<00:00:58.840> of<00:00:59.020> that<00:00:59.320> character<00:01:00.040> balance<00:01:00.400> but<00:01:00.970> also

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
terms of that character balance but also

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.240 
terms of that character balance but also
that<00:01:01.420> really<00:01:02.050> once<00:01:02.290> you<00:01:02.440> if<00:01:02.740> you<00:01:02.860> see<00:01:03.100> the

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
that really once you if you see the

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.820 
that really once you if you see the
story<00:01:03.520> of<00:01:03.869> her<00:01:04.869> family<00:01:05.170> particularly<00:01:05.439> Deborah

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
story of her family particularly Deborah

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.020 
story of her family particularly Deborah
at<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.189> same<00:01:06.369> time<00:01:06.640> that<00:01:06.820> you're<00:01:06.909> learning

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
at the same time that you're learning

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.310 
at the same time that you're learning
about<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.420> cells<00:01:07.600> I<00:01:07.750> realized<00:01:08.080> that<00:01:08.170> that

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
about the cells I realized that that

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.840 
about the cells I realized that that
would<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:09.009> cells<00:01:09.220> would<00:01:09.400> take<00:01:09.549> on<00:01:09.700> a<00:01:09.759> very

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
would the cells would take on a very

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.910 
would the cells would take on a very
different<00:01:10.060> weight<00:01:10.360> if<00:01:10.689> you<00:01:11.350> watch<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.799> way

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
different weight if you watch the way

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.319 
different weight if you watch the way
their<00:01:12.070> her<00:01:12.189> daughter<00:01:12.340> was<00:01:12.640> responding<00:01:13.210> to

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
their her daughter was responding to

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:15.270 
their her daughter was responding to
them<00:01:13.450> so<00:01:14.259> I<00:01:14.290> knew<00:01:14.470> I<00:01:14.500> had<00:01:14.590> to<00:01:14.770> do<00:01:14.950> this<00:01:15.040> weaving

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
them so I knew I had to do this weaving

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.600 
them so I knew I had to do this weaving
thing<00:01:15.729> and<00:01:16.060> I<00:01:16.570> spent<00:01:17.500> I<00:01:17.650> had<00:01:17.829> index<00:01:18.250> cards<00:01:18.520> I

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
thing and I spent I had index cards I

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.310 
thing and I spent I had index cards I
sort<00:01:19.240> of<00:01:19.300> mapped<00:01:19.480> out<00:01:19.659> the<00:01:19.810> whole<00:01:19.930> book<00:01:20.110> with

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
sort of mapped out the whole book with

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.899 
sort of mapped out the whole book with
three<00:01:20.650> different<00:01:20.920> colors<00:01:21.340> of<00:01:21.370> index<00:01:21.850> cards

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
three different colors of index cards

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:23.550 
three different colors of index cards
one<00:01:22.300> for<00:01:22.450> each<00:01:22.510> narrative<00:01:22.900> and<00:01:23.230> I<00:01:23.290> had<00:01:23.440> this

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
one for each narrative and I had this

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.140 
one for each narrative and I had this
huge<00:01:23.770> wall<00:01:24.070> where<00:01:24.340> I<00:01:24.370> would<00:01:24.520> attack<00:01:24.820> them<00:01:25.030> up

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
huge wall where I would attack them up

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.390 
huge wall where I would attack them up
and<00:01:25.360> move<00:01:25.510> them<00:01:25.690> around<00:01:25.780> and<00:01:26.200> there<00:01:26.950> was<00:01:27.130> in

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
and move them around and there was in

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.280 
and move them around and there was in
West<00:01:27.850> Virginia<00:01:28.270> where<00:01:28.720> a<00:01:28.750> friend<00:01:28.930> of<00:01:28.990> mine<00:01:29.110> had

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
West Virginia where a friend of mine had

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.560 
West Virginia where a friend of mine had
a<00:01:29.320> house<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:29.970> there's<00:01:30.970> a<00:01:31.030> small<00:01:31.270> local

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
a house and there's a small local

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.760 
a house and there's a small local
bookseller<00:01:31.840> there<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.200> I<00:01:32.260> just<00:01:32.409> went<00:01:32.560> in<00:01:32.650> and

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
bookseller there and I just went in and

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.310 
bookseller there and I just went in and
I<00:01:32.800> said<00:01:32.860> find<00:01:33.580> me<00:01:33.790> every<00:01:34.210> book<00:01:34.420> every<00:01:34.990> novel

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
I said find me every book every novel

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.270 
I said find me every book every novel
you<00:01:35.440> can<00:01:35.590> find<00:01:35.800> that<00:01:35.979> has<00:01:36.100> multiple

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
you can find that has multiple

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.190 
you can find that has multiple
characters<00:01:36.880> multiple<00:01:37.390> time<00:01:37.570> periods<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:38.080> it

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
characters multiple time periods and it

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.649 
characters multiple time periods and it
jumps<00:01:38.470> around<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:39.010> so<00:01:39.970> she<00:01:40.060> just<00:01:40.360> started

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
jumps around and so she just started

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.140 
jumps around and so she just started
ordering<00:01:40.930> me<00:01:41.200> this<00:01:41.350> blood<00:01:41.680> books<00:01:42.220> and

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
ordering me this blood books and

sort of the facts of what was going on
at<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:04.810> time<00:02:05.020> and<00:02:05.290> then<00:02:05.400> initially<00:02:06.400> I<00:02:06.430> thought

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
at the time and then initially I thought

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.249 
at the time and then initially I thought
well<00:02:06.820> I<00:02:06.850> could<00:02:07.090> do<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.420> story<00:02:07.690> of<00:02:07.780> me<00:02:07.960> and<00:02:08.080> ever

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
well I could do the story of me and ever

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.869 
well I could do the story of me and ever
the<00:02:08.530> story<00:02:08.709> of<00:02:08.799> Henrietta<00:02:09.159> and<00:02:09.340> then<00:02:09.759> I

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
the story of Henrietta and then I

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.250 
the story of Henrietta and then I
actually<00:02:10.209> thought<00:02:10.539> I<00:02:10.599> would<00:02:10.780> write<00:02:10.929> little

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
actually thought I would write little

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.720 
actually thought I would write little
news<00:02:11.439> stories<00:02:11.769> but<00:02:11.980> science<00:02:12.370> and<00:02:12.580> I<00:02:12.610> would

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
news stories but science and I would

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.000 
news stories but science and I would
have<00:02:12.879> like<00:02:13.150> news<00:02:13.540> clippings<00:02:13.959> instead<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.739> I

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
have like news clippings instead of I

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.890 
have like news clippings instead of I
think<00:02:15.580> that<00:02:15.760> was<00:02:15.879> mostly<00:02:16.000> me<00:02:16.330> just<00:02:16.510> not<00:02:16.659> being

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
think that was mostly me just not being

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.600 
think that was mostly me just not being
able<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:17.049> imagine<00:02:17.260> how<00:02:17.650> I<00:02:17.680> could<00:02:17.830> possibly<00:02:18.370> put

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
able to imagine how I could possibly put

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.399 
able to imagine how I could possibly put
this<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:19.480> science<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.019> do<00:02:20.080> some<00:02:20.200> kind<00:02:20.379> of

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
this the science and do some kind of

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.070 
this the science and do some kind of
narrative<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:21.159> then<00:02:21.450> interesting<00:02:22.450> that<00:02:22.599> just

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
narrative and then interesting that just

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.020 
narrative and then interesting that just
at<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.770> certain<00:02:23.920> point<00:02:24.160> I<00:02:24.340> started<00:02:24.880> watching

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
at a certain point I started watching

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.800 
at a certain point I started watching
movies

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
movies

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.660 
movies
had<00:02:26.050> a<00:02:26.080> similar<00:02:26.470> structure<00:02:26.709> so<00:02:27.010> I<00:02:27.040> knew<00:02:27.250> that<00:02:27.280> I

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
had a similar structure so I knew that I

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.040 
had a similar structure so I knew that I
was<00:02:27.850> going<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.000> do<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.270> jumping<00:02:28.569> around<00:02:28.690> and

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
was going to do the jumping around and

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.140 
was going to do the jumping around and
it<00:02:29.830> turns<00:02:30.040> out<00:02:30.130> that<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.310> lot<00:02:30.370> of<00:02:30.550> movies<00:02:31.000> are

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
it turns out that a lot of movies are

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.090 
it turns out that a lot of movies are
structured<00:02:31.510> like<00:02:31.540> that<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.860> movie

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
structured like that and the movie

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.830 
structured like that and the movie
hurricane<00:02:33.580> about<00:02:34.120> hurricane<00:02:34.480> Carter<00:02:34.750> the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
boxer that is the structure of my book

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.970 
boxer that is the structure of my book
and<00:02:37.209> it<00:02:37.870> has<00:02:38.050> similar<00:02:38.410> three<00:02:38.709> different

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
that I realized I was jumping around I

chapters and really part of what worked
with<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:18.550> structure<00:03:18.970> of<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.450> movie<00:03:19.660> was<00:03:19.840> it

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
with the structure of the movie was it

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.870 
with the structure of the movie was it
happened<00:03:20.290> really<00:03:20.380> fast<00:03:20.519> so<00:03:21.519> I<00:03:21.580> had<00:03:21.730> written

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
happened really fast so I had written

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.160 
happened really fast so I had written
all<00:03:22.090> three<00:03:22.300> of<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:22.420> narratives<00:03:22.750> and<00:03:22.959> then

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
all three of the narratives and then

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.130 
all three of the narratives and then
went<00:03:24.010> with<00:03:24.250> my<00:03:24.430> kind<00:03:24.940> of<00:03:25.030> hurricane<00:03:25.750> slash

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
went with my kind of hurricane slash

went with my kind of hurricane slash
fried<00:03:26.440> green<00:03:26.680> tomatoes<00:03:27.209> structure<00:03:28.209> idea<00:03:28.480> and

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
fried green tomatoes structure idea and

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.620 
fried green tomatoes structure idea and
actually<00:03:30.280> braided<00:03:30.579> them<00:03:30.700> on<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.269> computer

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
actually braided them on the computer

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.569 
actually braided them on the computer
and<00:03:31.750> then<00:03:31.900> you<00:03:32.170> just<00:03:32.920> sat<00:03:33.040> down<00:03:33.070> and<00:03:33.340> print<00:03:33.519> it

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
and then you just sat down and print it

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:34.830 
and then you just sat down and print it
out<00:03:33.670> and<00:03:33.790> read<00:03:33.910> it<00:03:33.970> beginning<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.570> end<00:03:34.720> and

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
out and read it beginning to end and

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.970 
out and read it beginning to end and
then<00:03:34.959> was<00:03:35.079> like<00:03:35.200> I<00:03:35.290> don't<00:03:35.350> know<00:03:35.470> this<00:03:35.590> estimate

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
then was like I don't know this estimate

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.560 
then was like I don't know this estimate
there<00:03:36.130> in<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.430> second<00:03:36.670> area<00:03:36.820> so<00:03:37.209> then<00:03:37.360> a<00:03:37.390> lot

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
there in the second area so then a lot

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.180 
there in the second area so then a lot
of<00:03:37.600> rearranging<00:03:38.170> happens<00:03:38.500> in<00:03:38.709> the<00:03:38.890> various

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
of rearranging happens in the various

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.430 
of rearranging happens in the various
drafts<00:03:39.700> and<00:03:40.660> every<00:03:40.959> wrote<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.290> book

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
drafts and every wrote the book

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.680 
drafts and every wrote the book
completely<00:03:42.090> beginning<00:03:43.090> down<00:03:43.239> probably<00:03:43.540> five

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
completely beginning down probably five

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.350 
completely beginning down probably five
times<00:03:43.930> before<00:03:44.320> I<00:03:44.350> even<00:03:44.920> put<00:03:45.250> it<00:03:45.370> in<00:03:45.459> there<00:03:46.030> many

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
times before I even put it in there many

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.020 
times before I even put it in there many
times<00:03:46.630> after<00:03:46.840> that<00:03:47.079> to<00:03:47.230> my<00:03:47.350> editors<00:03:47.769> dismay<00:03:48.340> so

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
times after that to my editors dismay so

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.910 
times after that to my editors dismay so
really<00:03:49.329> it<00:03:49.390> was<00:03:49.570> it<00:03:49.930> was<00:03:50.230> a<00:03:50.260> combination<00:03:50.590> of

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
really it was it was a combination of

00:03:50.920 --> 00:04:01.800 
really it was it was a combination of
fiction<00:03:51.250> and<00:03:51.370> movies

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810
