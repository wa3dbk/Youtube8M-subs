00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.960
 mobile.fr and watches point en we are on 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.690
 the samsung wave stand double it's 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.690
 2014 and I have the bracelet in my hand 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.000
 war fit then whose price did not 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.430
 still been unveiled but that a device 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.029
 ferry one arm is pretty cool at 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:28.380
 level of specs it's a 1.84 screen 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:31.050
 more curved it's the first screen 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.430
 curved super super bowl is so that 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.800
 it's still a beautiful screen it is at 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.960
 queens cry the twins twins the screen 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.750
 sensitive a touch screen sorry the 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:47.010
 ip67 water resistant and wizards 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.629
 to dust but it's not like 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.629
 example it is not water proof to 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.649
 strictly speaking it is compatible with 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.719
 sf and he has a sensor system that 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.520
 allows you to calculate your frequency 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.710
 cardiac just below rhythm 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.609
 cardiac 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.840
 he has an access the put back they 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.470
 compatible bluetooth 4.0 low energy and 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.900
 hylas 1 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.590
 an infrared port that I was looking for the 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.860
 term 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.320
 ok so what are we finally there 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.100
 we have connectors ben there we have the 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.040
 censor the censor the sensor has for 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.400
 know the heart rate 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.920
 the up one has a button on off all 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.780
 just right here I'm trying to get you 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.510
 show that there is a bit complicated 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.930
 we have the arm which very very very 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.600
 classic like that she looks 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.220
 comfortable and at the interface 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.960
 and opportunities I will try to 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.670
 show you that he's busy with the little 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.830
 smartphone case here finally small it's a 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:53.860
 galaxy s 4 yes and so we'll go there 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.950
 so we have a lot we have a sporting axis to 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.280
 its marks and a hunger counter 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.350
 step counter running a training mode 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.630
 woking guanine ok we can go running 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.729
 you put your watch alas it goes 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.880
 measure my heart rate this kind of 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.470
 thing I do not do it here it's rather 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.690
 have done quite well I like a lot 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.010
 the screen is rare even on 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.050
 down it's like that to have a real screen 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.600
 the question is more with autonomy 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.959
 he's not talking about it during and selling 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.769
 it will take a heartbeat test 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:32.790
 I can try to put it like that 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.790
 will try to do something 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.440
 dickie measure and he measure is a 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.780
 measure no I do not know I may have 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.260
 not wait three hours but priori 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.140
 yeah I do not know it works maybe 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.420
 not ok well it's okay we're not going 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:59.190
 measured for today 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:03.060
 this is then a timer in 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:06.510
 stopwatch we have parameters we have them 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.770
 of course we have notifications that 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.690
 come with your smartphone because 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.140
 your smartphone is at stake with the 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.260
 bracelet 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.790
 we have a media controller it is rather 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.290
 Nice it's a bit futuristic 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.990
 with the curved screen I like a lot 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.500
 so here I can start reading a 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.940
 incessant to play on it but it 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.890
 can do anything rice flour 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.240
 device is there he is in the process of 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.480
 ring it does not show and I can cancel 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.640
 his voice there rather nice rather nice 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.620
 it is not yet the price but 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.030
 I really like 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.940
 the curved screen like that makes it very 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.920
 very very well and it seems to be 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.130
 very targeted features but who 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.670
 are I honestly running that can 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.530
 be interesting 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.970
 after that I do not necessarily use sf 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.420
 I use apps instead 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.640
 third 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.110
 but why not consider 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.000
 so here is an interesting product 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.220
 to see how much it will be offered and 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.760
 especially by a complement of knowledge 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.890
 autonomy 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.240
 that's about all I hope that 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.990
 this little video you liked and I 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.990
 say it to the next
