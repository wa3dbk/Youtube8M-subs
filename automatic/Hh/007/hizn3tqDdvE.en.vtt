 if you choose and more or less in base 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.670
 what you thought you registered but what 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.380
 it happens all players evaluated when 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.870
 is evaluated when he starts his first 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.020
 match if in that match it's going to be the 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.300
 player seen to see at what level is 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.190
 always while they're playing that 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.760
 first match and it's not going to take 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.760
 no decision 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.310
 you have fun that is the central objective 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.750
 that we look for if and at the end 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.060
 we tell you how is the theme of the 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.100
 live what happens with the evaluation can 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.320
 give yourself two pieces that we have to 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.090
 correct the category because we do not have 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.730
 to correct category either upload 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.350
 or glasses of the level always always in 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.030
 this first and only time and because 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.760
 we said only once now they should samos 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.280
 you will receive 50 percent of the 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.110
 inscription that we are going to pay you 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.750
 to give a clear example if osasuna its 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.520
 registration of 150 pesos we will have here 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.830
 the category suppose an example 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.900
 categories or seventh we climb to the sixth 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.700
 as we are at the eighth you will receive 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.280
 a bonus of 70 pesos on your 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.970
 account 75 would be the value plus or minus 107 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.860
 450 always 50 percent if by the 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.360
 simple reason that you as a player do not 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.620
 we knew the categories and we 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.750
 we are inside what is the 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.050
 competition then the idea is that there 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.030
 a fair question for both sides yes 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.530
 and because that first time as well 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.690
 We said because we have to be 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.610
 talking constantly is always going to be 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.020
 an evaluation that will follow you in 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.090
 each of the parties inside would be 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.850
 by circuit without prisoners is already by 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.680
 circuit suddenly at some point of 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.000
 our day three months of two months a 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.890
 month in mid-year 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.530
 we have to correct the level because 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.660
 evolves this or involution to this one of 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.890
 suddenly it was not going very well of each 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.230
 category but there is the difference 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.820
 as you subscribe you have is indicated 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.010
 game you have a competition history 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.540
 with us if we modify the category 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.790
 we're going to give you one hundred percent of the 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.770
 Registration then this 50 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.770
 cent is only in the
