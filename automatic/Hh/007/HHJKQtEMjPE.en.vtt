00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
it got quite a bit of oil at the top and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.280 
it got quite a bit of oil at the top and
it<00:01:14.760> does<00:01:14.909> say<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.450> jar<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.200> know

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
it does say on the jar that you know

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.740 
it does say on the jar that you know
stir<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.890> before<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.310> use<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.549> however<00:01:18.390> when

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
stir it before you use it however when

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.210 
stir it before you use it however when
you<00:01:18.869> actually<00:01:19.049> get<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.619> bottom<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
you actually get to the bottom of the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.840 
you actually get to the bottom of the
jar<00:01:20.990> sometimes<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.619> doesn't<00:01:23.130> have<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.520> much

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
jar sometimes it doesn't have that much

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.569 
jar sometimes it doesn't have that much
oil<00:01:24.030> left<00:01:24.439> so<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:26.430> will<00:01:26.549> look<00:01:26.580> like<00:01:26.810> this<00:01:28.579> now

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
oil left so it will look like this now

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.550 
oil left so it will look like this now
if<00:01:30.200> you<00:01:31.200> need<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.590> cover<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.670> marinate<00:01:33.180> with

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
if you need to cover the marinate with

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.280 
if you need to cover the marinate with
enough<00:01:34.560> pace<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.310> going<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.670> be<00:01:35.820> one<00:01:36.090> very

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
enough pace it's going to be one very

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.749 
enough pace it's going to be one very
spicy<00:01:37.290> if<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.740> like<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.159> that's<00:01:38.280> fine<00:01:38.549> but

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
spicy if you like it that's fine but

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.310 
spicy if you like it that's fine but
some<00:01:38.909> people<00:01:39.150> don't<00:01:39.329> like<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.540> that's<00:01:39.810> spicy

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
some people don't like it that's spicy

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.920 
some people don't like it that's spicy
um<00:01:41.689> then<00:01:42.689> all<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.829> need<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.009> do<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.780> to<00:01:45.780> have<00:01:45.899> a

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
um then all you need to do is to have a

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.749 
um then all you need to do is to have a
box<00:01:46.610> put<00:01:47.610> your<00:01:47.909> paste<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:49.220> add<00:01:50.220> some<00:01:50.640> oil

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
box put your paste in add some oil

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.109 
box put your paste in add some oil
cooking<00:01:51.390> oil<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.189> thin<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.220> out<00:01:53.540> then<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.930> will

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
cooking oil and thin it out then it will

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.380 
cooking oil and thin it out then it will
become<00:01:57.119> consistence<00:01:58.079> like<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.490> so<00:02:00.299> you

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
become consistence like this so you

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.389 
become consistence like this so you
don't<00:02:00.659> need<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.869> use<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> lot<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.649> yet<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:02.250> know

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
don't need to use a lot and yet you know

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.139 
don't need to use a lot and yet you know
it<00:02:02.640> can<00:02:02.880> cover<00:02:03.689> everything<00:02:04.049> up

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
it can cover everything up

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.699
