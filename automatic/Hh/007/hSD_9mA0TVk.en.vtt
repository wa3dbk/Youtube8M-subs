ready to take the next section which I

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.650 
ready to take the next section which I
was<00:03:36.430> going<00:03:36.519> to<00:03:36.640> weave<00:03:36.940> so<00:03:37.660> a<00:03:37.690> few<00:03:39.510> strands<00:03:40.510> of

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
was going to weave so a few strands of

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:48.010 
was going to weave so a few strands of
blonde<00:03:40.870> would<00:03:41.080> show<00:03:41.260> through<00:03:41.470> as<00:03:41.709> well

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.620

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.620 

that's<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.550> whole<00:03:57.730> slice<00:03:58.030> in<00:03:58.240> the<00:03:58.330> entirety

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
that's the whole slice in the entirety

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.050 
that's the whole slice in the entirety
but<00:03:59.110> I<00:03:59.140> just<00:03:59.380> weaved<00:03:59.680> out<00:03:59.920> sections<00:04:00.430> it's<00:04:00.910> a

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
few blonde bits would show through the

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:11.600 
few blonde bits would show through the
purple<00:04:06.000> or<00:04:07.000> magenta<00:04:07.030> purple

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610

yone applied that liberally did about

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.530 
yone applied that liberally did about
three<00:04:16.780> sections<00:04:17.230> there<00:04:17.910> and<00:04:18.910> lift<00:04:19.180> it<00:04:19.300> on<00:04:19.390> for

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
about thirty minutes then once it's

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.290 
about thirty minutes then once it's

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:57.290 

so<00:04:45.450> I'm<00:04:45.570> just<00:04:45.780> roughly<00:04:46.110> drying<00:04:46.440> it<00:04:46.620> off<00:04:56.300> it's

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
so I'm just roughly drying it off it's

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.760 
so I'm just roughly drying it off it's
quite<00:04:57.510> a<00:04:57.540> tricky<00:04:57.750> thing<00:04:57.840> about<00:04:58.020> ooh<00:04:58.230> a<00:04:58.380> pixie

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
quite a tricky thing about ooh a pixie

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.980 
quite a tricky thing about ooh a pixie
cut<00:04:58.980> and<00:04:59.100> have<00:04:59.550> some<00:04:59.790> purple<00:05:00.180> going<00:05:00.810> through

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
cut and have some purple going through

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:09.800 
cut and have some purple going through
the<00:05:01.080> front<00:05:01.290> I<00:05:01.410> think<00:05:01.590> it<00:05:01.680> works<00:05:01.830> quite<00:05:02.010> well<00:05:08.810> so

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
the front I think it works quite well so

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.770 
the front I think it works quite well so
this<00:05:09.930> once<00:05:10.230> it<00:05:10.350> was<00:05:10.470> dry<00:05:10.590> I<00:05:10.980> then<00:05:11.640> what<00:05:12.630> they

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
this once it was dry I then what they

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.390 
this once it was dry I then what they
call<00:05:12.960> personalize<00:05:13.560> it<00:05:13.800> just<00:05:13.980> tighten<00:05:14.280> it<00:05:14.370> up

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
call personalize it just tighten it up

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.040 
call personalize it just tighten it up
and<00:05:14.730> it<00:05:14.850> loose<00:05:15.000> ends<00:05:15.330> I<00:05:15.450> thought<00:05:15.720> that<00:05:16.020> just

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
and it loose ends I thought that just

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.200 
and it loose ends I thought that just
needed<00:05:16.470> sharpening<00:05:17.010> up<00:05:17.840> and<00:05:19.340> then<00:05:20.340> I<00:05:20.520> used<00:05:20.910> a

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
needed sharpening up and then I used a

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:28.550 
needed sharpening up and then I used a
matte<00:05:22.110> wax<00:05:25.790> here<00:05:26.790> just<00:05:27.030> to<00:05:27.270> tweak<00:05:28.020> some<00:05:28.170> of<00:05:28.410> the

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
matte wax here just to tweak some of the

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.980 
matte wax here just to tweak some of the
sections<00:05:29.010> just<00:05:29.250> to<00:05:29.340> make<00:05:29.490> it<00:05:29.520> look<00:05:29.910> a<00:05:30.630> little

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
sections just to make it look a little

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:37.460 
sections just to make it look a little
bit<00:05:31.200> more<00:05:34.430> chunky<00:05:35.990> chunky<00:05:36.990> is<00:05:37.050> not<00:05:37.230> the<00:05:37.320> right

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
bit more chunky chunky is not the right

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.920 
bit more chunky chunky is not the right
word<00:05:37.680> I<00:05:37.920> don't<00:05:38.100> know<00:05:38.190> try<00:05:38.430> to<00:05:38.460> make<00:05:38.580> it<00:05:38.930> more
