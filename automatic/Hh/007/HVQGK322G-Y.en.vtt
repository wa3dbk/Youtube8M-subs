00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.289 

now<00:03:41.680> that<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.040> kids<00:03:42.249> are<00:03:42.430> getting<00:03:42.730> older<00:03:42.879> we

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
now that the kids are getting older we

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.780 
now that the kids are getting older we
can<00:03:44.049> start<00:03:44.290> focusing<00:03:44.560> on<00:03:45.010> passing<00:03:45.639> and

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
can start focusing on passing and

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.270 
can start focusing on passing and
shooting<00:03:45.819> and<00:03:46.299> separating<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:46.989> two<00:03:47.200> this<00:03:48.069> is

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
shooting and separating the two this is

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.759 
shooting and separating the two this is
a<00:03:48.310> great<00:03:48.579> passing<00:03:49.060> exercise<00:03:49.599> that<00:03:50.409> involves

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
a great passing exercise that involves

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.569 
a great passing exercise that involves
four<00:03:51.459> lines<00:03:51.790> in<00:03:52.150> a<00:03:52.780> box<00:03:53.049> formation<00:03:53.469> all<00:03:54.129> they

four lines in a box formation all they

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.369 
four lines in a box formation all they
are<00:03:54.670> simply<00:03:54.879> doing<00:03:55.299> is<00:03:55.480> passing<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:56.170> ball<00:03:56.349> to

fast now they're going to go the other

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:27.110 
fast now they're going to go the other
way<00:04:04.900> with<00:04:05.169> it

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
versus hitting a ball that's just

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.740 
versus hitting a ball that's just
sitting<00:05:31.870> still<00:05:33.120> working<00:05:34.120> on<00:05:34.240> balls<00:05:34.480> that<00:05:34.690> are

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
just sitting still hitting the ball is

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.370 
just sitting still hitting the ball is
not<00:05:38.410> very<00:05:38.680> very<00:05:39.160> realistic<00:05:40.020> there's<00:05:41.020> very

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
not very very realistic there's very

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.470 
not very very realistic there's very
little<00:05:42.160> times<00:05:42.460> in<00:05:42.670> a<00:05:42.730> soccer<00:05:43.000> game<00:05:43.240> where<00:05:43.420> you

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
little times in a soccer game where you

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.850 
little times in a soccer game where you
get<00:05:43.630> to<00:05:43.750> hit<00:05:43.900> the<00:05:44.020> ball<00:05:44.170> when<00:05:44.410> it's<00:05:44.560> hitting

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
get to hit the ball when it's hitting

get to hit the ball when it's hitting
sitting<00:05:45.370> still<00:05:45.640> so<00:05:45.670> that's<00:05:46.210> why<00:05:46.540> we<00:05:46.780> are

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
sitting still so that's why we are

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:56.279 
sitting still so that's why we are
tapping<00:05:47.140> the<00:05:47.320> ball<00:05:47.470> forward

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289
