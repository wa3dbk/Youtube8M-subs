absorbent<00:00:40.590> layer<00:00:41.129> right<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.090> middle<00:00:42.270> and

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
absorbent layer right in the middle and

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.720 
absorbent layer right in the middle and
that's<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.469> little<00:00:43.559> bit<00:00:43.800> higher<00:00:43.980> but<00:00:44.219> yet<00:00:44.460> these

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
that's a little bit higher but yet these

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.979 
that's a little bit higher but yet these
things<00:00:45.059> are<00:00:45.270> thinner<00:00:45.960> than<00:00:46.170> paper<00:00:46.230> um<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.989> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
things are thinner than paper um and the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.229 
things are thinner than paper um and the
backing<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.469> them<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.920> really<00:00:50.489> really<00:00:50.640> sticky

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
backing on them is really really sticky

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.029 
backing on them is really really sticky
and<00:00:51.480> as<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.110> can<00:00:52.230> see<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.469> translucent

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
and as you can see it's translucent

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.860 
and as you can see it's translucent
these<00:00:53.460> are<00:00:53.670> kind<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.059> pain<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.480> get<00:00:54.600> off

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
these are kind of a pain to get off

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.350 
these are kind of a pain to get off
because<00:00:55.620> they're<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.010> thin<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.730> find<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.210> they

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
because they're so thin I find that they

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.020 
because they're so thin I find that they
stick<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.140> kind<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.469> leave<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.160> don't<00:00:59.879> know

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
stick and kind of leave I don't know

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.549 
stick and kind of leave I don't know
like<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.270> stickiness<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.109> your<00:01:01.320> underwear

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
like a stickiness and your underwear

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.880 
like a stickiness and your underwear
that's<00:01:01.770> one<00:01:01.949> gross<00:01:02.280> but<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.730> does<00:01:03.739> it's<00:01:04.739> from

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
that's one gross but it does it's from

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.920 
that's one gross but it does it's from
like<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.189> back<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> adhesive<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.510> but
