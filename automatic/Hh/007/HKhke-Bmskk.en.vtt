like and much better video quality you
can<00:02:27.750> see<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.170> coupler<00:02:28.650> where<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.130> goes<00:02:29.370> into

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
can see the coupler where it goes into

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.160 
can see the coupler where it goes into
the<00:02:30.150> turbo<00:02:30.630> itself<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:32.600> you<00:02:33.600> have<00:02:33.900> the

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
the turbo itself and you have the

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.300 
the turbo itself and you have the
crankcase<00:02:34.830> vent<00:02:35.900> port<00:02:36.900> right<00:02:37.290> here<00:02:37.320> attached

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
crankcase vent port right here attached

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.170 
crankcase vent port right here attached
to<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.760> stock<00:02:39.420> hose<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.170> runs<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:41.180> valve

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
to the stock hose and runs to the valve

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.070 
to the stock hose and runs to the valve
cover<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.980> as<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.100> can<00:02:44.310> see<00:02:44.610> I<00:02:44.640> do<00:02:45.600> not<00:02:45.750> have

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
cover and as you can see I do not have

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.760 
cover and as you can see I do not have
the<00:02:46.910> recirculation<00:02:47.910> port<00:02:48.480> connected<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.350> opted

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
the recirculation port connected I opted

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.449 
the recirculation port connected I opted
out<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:50.430> I'm<00:02:50.580> venting<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.330> atmosphere

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
out of it so I'm venting to atmosphere

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.370 
out of it so I'm venting to atmosphere
and<00:02:53.459> then<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.730> can<00:02:53.910> take<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.180> good<00:02:54.450> look<00:02:54.690> as<00:02:55.020> to

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
and then you can take a good look as to

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
and then you can take a good look as to
the<00:02:55.650> placement<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:57.470> filter<00:02:58.470> itself

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
the placement of the filter itself

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.750 
the placement of the filter itself
you<00:03:00.300> can<00:03:00.720> see<00:03:00.930> that<00:03:01.140> it's<00:03:01.290> really<00:03:01.680> well<00:03:02.459> in

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
you can see that it's really well in

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.000 
you can see that it's really well in
there<00:03:03.290> not<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:06.050> you<00:03:07.050> know<00:03:07.140> cramped<00:03:07.680> up<00:03:07.800> or

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
there not to you know cramped up or

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.460 
there not to you know cramped up or
anything<00:03:08.220> like<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.690> seems<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.290> be

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
anything like that and it seems to be

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.380 
anything like that and it seems to be
pulling<00:03:10.709> pretty<00:03:11.160> good<00:03:11.370> pretty<00:03:12.120> good

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
pulling pretty good pretty good

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.420 
pulling pretty good pretty good
air<00:03:12.600> I<00:03:12.630> mean<00:03:12.959> there<00:03:13.739> may<00:03:13.890> be<00:03:13.920> some<00:03:14.070> small<00:03:16.430> you

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
air I mean there may be some small you

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.280 
air I mean there may be some small you
know<00:03:17.550> worry<00:03:17.820> of<00:03:18.090> heat<00:03:18.330> soak<00:03:18.690> but<00:03:18.930> it's<00:03:19.080> really

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
know worry of heat soak but it's really

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.800 
know worry of heat soak but it's really
not<00:03:20.010> as<00:03:20.190> bad<00:03:20.430> as<00:03:20.580> you<00:03:20.700> think<00:03:20.970> since<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.510> air<00:03:21.660> is

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
not as bad as you think since the air is

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.330 
not as bad as you think since the air is
going<00:03:22.019> into<00:03:22.350> a<00:03:22.380> turbo<00:03:22.769> anyway<00:03:23.220> the

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
going into a turbo anyway the

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.850 
going into a turbo anyway the
temperature<00:03:23.790> rises<00:03:24.239> regardless<00:03:24.870> so<00:03:25.170> it's

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
temperature rises regardless so it's

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.530 
temperature rises regardless so it's
really<00:03:26.100> up<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.459> intercooler<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.209> keep<00:03:27.390> it

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
really up to the intercooler to keep it

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.070 
really up to the intercooler to keep it
to<00:03:28.260> keep<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:28.620> down<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:30.000> ifs<00:03:30.299> of<00:03:30.480> course<00:03:30.780> is

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
to keep it down and ifs of course is

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.910 
to keep it down and ifs of course is
after<00:03:31.890> GCP<00:03:32.640> has<00:03:32.790> done<00:03:33.030> his<00:03:33.299> testing<00:03:33.959> with<00:03:34.799> the

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
after GCP has done his testing with the

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.840 
after GCP has done his testing with the
different<00:03:36.019> intake<00:03:37.019> air<00:03:37.350> temperature

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
different intake air temperature

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.650 
different intake air temperature
readouts<00:03:38.850> based<00:03:39.780> on<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.230> various<00:03:41.630> you<00:03:42.630> know

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
readouts based on the various you know

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.740 
readouts based on the various you know
placements<00:03:43.500> of<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:45.120> mouths<00:03:45.330> of<00:03:45.600> the

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
placements of the of the mouths of the

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.770 
placements of the of the mouths of the
intake<00:03:46.200> so<00:03:46.590> this<00:03:47.010> was<00:03:47.190> really<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:48.120> best

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
intake so this was really the the best

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.830 
intake so this was really the the best
choice<00:03:49.110> as<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.790> keeping<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:50.910> practical<00:03:51.450> small

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
choice as to keeping it practical small

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.540 
choice as to keeping it practical small
enough<00:03:52.140> and<00:03:53.269> very<00:03:54.269> functional<00:03:54.959> so

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.339 

just<00:03:58.550> wanted<00:03:58.849> to<00:03:58.910> show<00:03:59.120> you<00:03:59.180> all<00:03:59.300> a<00:03:59.720> little<00:04:00.110> bit

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
just wanted to show you all a little bit

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:05.619 
just wanted to show you all a little bit
of<00:04:00.470> that<00:04:03.640> and<00:04:04.640> let<00:04:05.000> me<00:04:05.030> know<00:04:05.180> if<00:04:05.300> you<00:04:05.390> have<00:04:05.480> any

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
of that and let me know if you have any

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:07.989 
of that and let me know if you have any
questions
