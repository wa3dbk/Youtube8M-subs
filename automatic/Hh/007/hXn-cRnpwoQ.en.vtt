00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
that didn't and we could see the

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.230 
that didn't and we could see the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.670 
you know they didn't have the dunes that
we'd<00:01:50.550> built<00:01:50.700> here<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.660> the<00:01:51.780> dunes<00:01:51.990> really<00:01:52.500> did

we'd built here so the dunes really did

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.910
