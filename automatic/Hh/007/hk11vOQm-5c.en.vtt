00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060 

we're<00:00:00.120> using<00:00:00.390> just<00:00:00.630> a<00:00:00.930> regular<00:00:01.319> drill<00:00:01.680> press

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
we're using just a regular drill press

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.390 
we're using just a regular drill press
and<00:00:02.399> what<00:00:02.939> we're<00:00:03.120> doing<00:00:03.149> is<00:00:03.780> we're<00:00:04.560> using<00:00:04.830> a

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
and what we're doing is we're using a

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.849 
and what we're doing is we're using a
drill<00:00:05.790> bit<00:00:06.060> that's<00:00:06.330> just<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.779> hair<00:00:07.020> under<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.529> hat

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
drill bit that's just a hair under a hat

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.129 
drill bit that's just a hair under a hat
pinch<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.610> then<00:00:09.179> we'll<00:00:09.389> switch<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:10.019> the

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
pinch and then we'll switch to the

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.830 
pinch and then we'll switch to the
reamer<00:00:10.410> can<00:00:10.830> see<00:00:11.160> we<00:00:11.519> drill<00:00:11.849> that<00:00:12.030> Center<00:00:12.570> bolt

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
reamer can see we drill that Center bolt

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.770 
reamer can see we drill that Center bolt
hole<00:00:13.110> right<00:00:13.410> here<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.299> gives<00:00:15.599> us

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
hole right here so that it gives us

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.740 
hole right here so that it gives us
access<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.440> put<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.920> tubes<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:18.000> trick<00:00:18.330> is

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
access to put the tubes the trick is

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.200 
access to put the tubes the trick is
using<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.500> drill<00:00:19.800> bit<00:00:20.070> first<00:00:20.400> takes<00:00:20.789> out<00:00:21.029> the

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
using the drill bit first takes out the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.009 
using the drill bit first takes out the
raw<00:00:21.390> material<00:00:22.369> so<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.939> reamer<00:00:24.210> can<00:00:24.750> then

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
raw material so that the reamer can then

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.259 
raw material so that the reamer can then
be<00:00:25.230> shot<00:00:25.560> through<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.310> leave<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> really<00:00:27.060> good

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
be shot through and leave a really good

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.109 
be shot through and leave a really good
finish<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.689> texture<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.890> tubes<00:00:29.189> still<00:00:29.849> won't

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
finish and texture the tubes still won't

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.359 
finish and texture the tubes still won't
go<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.599> at<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:30.929> point<00:00:31.199> I'll<00:00:31.740> have<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.130> take<00:00:32.309> a

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
go in at this point I'll have to take a

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.240 
go in at this point I'll have to take a
Sandro<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.450> actually<00:00:33.630> hand<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.530> them<00:00:34.739> to

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
Sandro and I actually hand on them to

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.910 
Sandro and I actually hand on them to
get<00:00:35.430> about<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.790> 1000<00:00:36.719> Crush<00:00:37.050> filled<00:00:37.590> with<00:00:37.829> epoxy

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
get about a 1000 Crush filled with epoxy

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.130 
get about a 1000 Crush filled with epoxy
so<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.760> we<00:00:38.879> don't<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.270> no<00:00:39.480> leak<00:00:39.750> between

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
so that we don't have no leak between

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.160 
so that we don't have no leak between
the<00:00:40.559> two<00:00:41.190> cylinders<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.360> we'll<00:00:42.600> go<00:00:42.719> ahead<00:00:42.750> and

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
the two cylinders so we'll go ahead and

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.369 
the two cylinders so we'll go ahead and
do<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.250> drilling<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.090> get<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.390> cut<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.020> then

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
do this drilling and get it cut and then

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.260 
do this drilling and get it cut and then
we'll<00:00:46.530> step<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.309> reamer<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:48.000> heads

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
we'll step up to the reamer the heads

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.220 
we'll step up to the reamer the heads

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
is one of the main tricks I go we just

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.190 
is one of the main tricks I go we just
Ram<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.460> down<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.119> bottom<00:01:09.330> where<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.990> goes

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
Ram it down to the bottom where it goes

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.530 
Ram it down to the bottom where it goes
on<00:01:10.470> through<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.010> table<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:12.150> like<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.479> said

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
on through the table and like I said

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.770 
on through the table and like I said
this<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.470> drill<00:01:13.770> bit

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
this is the drill bit

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.180 
this is the drill bit
drill<00:01:15.380> bit<00:01:15.620> size<00:01:15.920> at<00:01:16.450> 0.49<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:17.780> six<00:01:18.050> the<00:01:18.920> ring

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
drill bit size at 0.49 and six the ring

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.990 
drill bit size at 0.49 and six the ring
size<00:01:19.610> in<00:01:20.030> point

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000

Hey<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.750> there's<00:01:21.930> about<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.430> 2030

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.300 

can<00:02:13.360> always<00:02:13.780> feel<00:02:14.200> when<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:14.680> comes<00:02:14.950> through

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
can always feel when it comes through

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.009 
can always feel when it comes through
how<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:15.790> blends<00:02:16.269> is<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.629> bottom<00:02:17.049> and<00:02:17.230> release

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
how it blends is the bottom and release

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.630 
how it blends is the bottom and release
that<00:02:20.019> right<00:02:20.290> there's<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.860> little<00:02:21.010> step<00:02:21.430> to

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
that right there's that little step to

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.940 
that right there's that little step to
the<00:02:21.760> reamer<00:02:22.180> in<00:02:22.329> just<00:02:22.629> a<00:02:22.780> minute<00:02:22.930> here<00:02:23.560> we<00:02:23.709> back

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
the reamer in just a minute here we back

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.630 
the reamer in just a minute here we back
are<00:02:24.220> on<00:02:24.519> the<00:02:24.879> 601<00:02:25.629> casting<00:02:26.319> and<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.590> sing<00:02:26.950> what

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
are on the 601 casting and you sing what

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.640 
are on the 601 casting and you sing what
we<00:02:27.819> did<00:02:28.090> with<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.510> drill<00:02:28.780> bit<00:02:29.049> but<00:02:29.200> now<00:02:29.379> we're

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
we did with the drill bit but now we're

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.190 
we did with the drill bit but now we're
going<00:02:29.829> to<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.190> reamer<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:30.840> basically<00:02:31.840> what

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
going to the reamer and basically what

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.930 
going to the reamer and basically what
that<00:02:32.230> does<00:02:32.440> is<00:02:33.010> this<00:02:33.159> going<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.489> give<00:02:33.670> us<00:02:33.790> a

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
that does is this going to give us a

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.020 
that does is this going to give us a
nice<00:02:34.180> clean<00:02:34.810> hole<00:02:35.280> going<00:02:36.280> all<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.610> way<00:02:36.640> from

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
nice clean hole going all the way from

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.270 
nice clean hole going all the way from
the<00:02:37.120> top<00:02:37.329> to<00:02:37.390> bottom<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.319> the<00:02:38.620> tube<00:02:38.890> will

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
the top to bottom so that the tube will

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.059 
the top to bottom so that the tube will
line<00:02:39.909> up<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.480> press<00:02:40.870> firmly<00:02:41.349> with<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.769> epoxy

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
line up and press firmly with the epoxy

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.429 
line up and press firmly with the epoxy
in<00:02:42.400> place<00:02:42.700> so<00:02:43.060> let's<00:02:43.209> go<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.840> wringer<00:02:44.140> and

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:44.439 
in place so let's go the wringer and

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:45.720 
in place so let's go the wringer and
let's<00:02:44.590> pour<00:02:44.859> on<00:02:45.099> through

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
let's pour on through

let's pour on through
they<00:02:46.420> usually<00:02:46.720> slice<00:02:47.319> like<00:02:47.680> butter<00:02:48.069> because

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
they usually slice like butter because

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.930 
they usually slice like butter because
after<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:48.940> drill<00:02:49.769> it<00:02:50.769> pretty<00:02:51.099> much<00:02:51.340> does<00:02:51.700> the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
after the drill it pretty much does the

after the drill it pretty much does the

the area work both those Hornby so the
tubes<00:02:58.810> will<00:02:59.079> have<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.230> good<00:02:59.560> fight<00:02:59.859> in<00:03:00.099> place<00:03:00.629> it

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
tubes will have a good fight in place it
