00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
backyard and it's the one happy memory

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.550 
backyard and it's the one happy memory
that<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.430> think<00:01:17.700> somehow<00:01:18.290> even<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:19.320> this

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
that I can think somehow even with this

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.710 
that I can think somehow even with this
tough<00:01:19.920> exterior<00:01:20.220> even<00:01:21.000> with<00:01:21.119> all<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.600> his

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
tough exterior even with all of his

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.929 
tough exterior even with all of his
issues<00:01:21.900> even<00:01:22.470> as<00:01:22.590> much<00:01:22.860> as<00:01:23.100> he<00:01:23.220> hurt<00:01:23.400> me<00:01:23.700> I

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
issues even as much as he hurt me I

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.359 
issues even as much as he hurt me I
think<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.810> can<00:01:24.900> let<00:01:25.350> my<00:01:25.560> brain<00:01:25.770> settle<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.340> that

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
think I can let my brain settle in that

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.149 
think I can let my brain settle in that
one<00:01:26.820> happy<00:01:27.270> memory<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.320> did<00:01:28.710> show<00:01:29.130> me

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
one happy memory that that did show me

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.890 
one happy memory that that did show me
that<00:01:29.490> there<00:01:29.640> was<00:01:29.759> some<00:01:29.939> inkling<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.509> love<00:01:30.720> with

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
that there was some inkling of love with

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.200 
that there was some inkling of love with
my<00:01:31.049> dad<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.710> have<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.100> suspect<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.820> my

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
my dad and I have to suspect that my

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.580 
my dad and I have to suspect that my
dad's<00:01:33.479> fingerprints<00:01:34.079> were<00:01:34.259> on<00:01:34.409> that

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
dad's fingerprints were on that

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.350 
dad's fingerprints were on that
sprinkler<00:01:34.920> but<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.280> think<00:01:35.610> God's<00:01:35.820> fingerprints

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
sprinkler but I think God's fingerprints

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.390 
sprinkler but I think God's fingerprints
were<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.780> sprinkler<00:01:37.079> too<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.130> think

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
were on that sprinkler too and I think

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.249 
were on that sprinkler too and I think
that<00:01:38.549> was<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:39.270> was<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.390> significant<00:01:40.110> thing

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
that was a that was a significant thing

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.749
