A and then they stop and think about
life<00:06:31.840> and<00:06:32.199> then<00:06:32.380> decide<00:06:32.650> stop<00:06:32.860> playing<00:06:33.070> again

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
life and then decide stop playing again

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.580 
life and then decide stop playing again
so<00:06:33.940> what<00:06:34.270> do<00:06:34.449> is<00:06:34.750> it<00:06:35.139> would<00:06:35.229> be<00:06:35.320> a<00:06:35.350> bit<00:06:35.560> too

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
so what do is it would be a bit too

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.560 
so what do is it would be a bit too
complicated<00:06:36.010> to<00:06:36.340> explain<00:06:36.430> where<00:06:37.120> that<00:06:37.150> all

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:37.570 
complicated to explain where that all

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.960 
complicated to explain where that all
happens<00:06:37.960> but<00:06:38.470> basically<00:06:39.460> it's<00:06:39.639> kind<00:06:39.789> of<00:06:39.910> like

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:39.970 
happens but basically it's kind of like

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.060 
happens but basically it's kind of like
and<00:06:40.389> also<00:06:40.630> I<00:06:40.750> can't<00:06:40.960> be<00:06:41.050> asked<00:06:41.289> so<00:06:41.650> what<00:06:41.680> ideas

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
and also I can't be asked so what ideas
