went from the beginning stages this is

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.670 
went from the beginning stages this is
actually<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.580> second<00:00:15.210> step<00:00:15.450> here<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.560> the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
actually the second step here to the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.120 
actually the second step here to the
final<00:00:17.039> stage<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:18.199> you'll<00:00:19.199> see<00:00:19.410> how<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.650> I

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
final stage and you'll see how I I

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.310 
final stage and you'll see how I I
mentioned<00:00:20.850> earlier<00:00:21.180> about<00:00:21.359> making<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.109> neck

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
mentioned earlier about making the neck

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.500 
mentioned earlier about making the neck
a<00:00:22.350> lot<00:00:22.590> darker<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.340> adding<00:00:23.670> your<00:00:23.789> shading<00:00:24.269> in

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
a lot darker and adding your shading in

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.259 
a lot darker and adding your shading in
and<00:00:25.050> using<00:00:25.470> different<00:00:25.769> colors<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:27.090> is

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
and using different colors and this is

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.330 
and using different colors and this is
why<00:00:27.470> so<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.560> just<00:00:28.740> brings<00:00:28.949> out<00:00:29.099> more

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
why so it just brings out more

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.310 
why so it just brings out more
definition<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.480> pops<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.199> face<00:00:31.470> out

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
definition and it pops the face out

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.959 
definition and it pops the face out
right<00:00:34.320> here<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.739> have<00:00:35.040> going<00:00:35.340> through<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969
