00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.860
 this video has already had is show the most common errors in printing with 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.379
 cartridges and toner and also only possible frauds take note the first 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.820
 error is when the semen of the beneficado state if you let the cylindrical 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.609
 dropping cartridge on the floor 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.829
 you may damage the cylinder like this one 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:30.899
 the impression was to stick with the same mark as the cylinder to solve this 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.080
 problem just replace the part 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.460
 another defect is the lack of death pension 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.810
 the cartridge without the ball is by forgetfulness to reposition it 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.380
 or by the breakdown of the plants 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.700
 generates poorly printed one-sided printing to solve this problem 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.870
 just putting the ball on the spotted stalk also impairs the impression 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.680
 whether it is stained by grease or some other dirt the impression gets poorly 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.930
 mansion column little spots in the format similar to the dirt that is on the pcb 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.380
 to solve this problem basically to realize with cotton 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.290
 hial because the deco itself 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.810
 After a long time of use the cylinder may become clogged. 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.810
 print 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.560
 just replace the cylinder to solve this problem 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.890
 Another problem that arises with the usage time is the burned cylinder 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.300
 the impression that is left with a stain that extends from top to bottom and in the field 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.300
 the foliage and the solution is also exchanged a saddle 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.320
 the use time can also punish German nadine company 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.270
 and thus generate an impression with problems if it is granted when 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.480
 it hurts the august the impression that stays with a line 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.810
 the fine throughout the extension of the folia well in that place that the silicone and the mud 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.490
 is damaged and to solve this just change the cleaning letter 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.310
 if the ball does not roll magnetic is broken is a bore 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.880
 will also cause printing problems 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.400
 during printing you heard a crack 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.700
 and his party will have a missed line in another normal 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:12.219
 because the ball is not supposed to be appearing 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:18.109
 she is so tall they have rights to the ball putting it higher and 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.329
 slopes 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.419
 the ball should not appear 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:26.319
 the last one is something that we will highlight when the dosing slurry is not with the 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.639
 right dosage 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.729
 when the london stock exchange is wrong 

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:33.729
 the print gets all stained 

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:39.809
 Look how side that smeared the foliage is to match I'm seeing that the other 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:44.249
 if you have any questions or want more tips on common themes 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:45.099

 just enter our blog that will mess with double the br point or on our site 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:53.000
 for us it's the point with the br 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.450
 and talk to our attendants
