is<00:03:00.579> fantastic<00:03:01.359> and<00:03:01.600> you<00:03:01.989> know<00:03:02.079> might<00:03:02.380> just

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
is fantastic and you know might just

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.629 
is fantastic and you know might just
score<00:03:02.709> free<00:03:02.889> or<00:03:03.040> for<00:03:03.220> a<00:03:03.250> little<00:03:03.459> bit<00:03:03.549> of

score free or for a little bit of
confidence<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:04.329> I<00:03:04.660> think<00:03:05.079> if<00:03:05.199> you<00:03:05.260> look<00:03:05.380> at

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
confidence and I think if you look at

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.820 
confidence and I think if you look at
the<00:03:05.530> Asian<00:03:05.859> midfielders

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830
