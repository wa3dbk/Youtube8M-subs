00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.470
 So they have definitely here 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.699
 seen can also call specific names 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.880
 We are lucky with the Niedersachsen 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.460
 van slooten a great player of and 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.460
 that makes me very happy here on the outside 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.199
 even makes the ball lecture 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.449
 player already clearly over 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.850
 190 is and I for very very 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.440
 promising if he is there 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.719
 Keep up the good base has around 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:51.210
 to be Bundesliga player 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:52.289
 maybe the most recent thing you name 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.629
 May is Paul 17 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.239
 it is one of the candidates at 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.949
 bavaria munich now hopefully then 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.270
 so much play in the game against 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.359
 that you notice it 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:07.020
 jan niklas wimberg in the pro b in 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.000
 Oldenburg in the squad of the pro I say in 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.229
 So the Bundesliga games are there 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.229
 already a few guys doing the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.590
 meanwhile from the programs here 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.390
 have emerged 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.390
 who made it in the Bundesliga 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.030
 Of course this is very young and we are here 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.520
 Here are some talents at the beginning 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.460
 your career and it certainly is 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.270
 some with where you can say that 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.270
 Potential is available 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.520
 to keep saying that is yes 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.620
 just a snapshot and we leave 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.080
 now drive 72 players home 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.420
 without them are nominated and that is 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.920
 Certainly it will be there too 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.570
 could have made the big enough 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.160
 were to be there 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.500
 but then you have to end up one 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.170
 make the decision we have enough 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.209
 other views it is now in one 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.610
 year in october 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.190
 bundesjugendlager or then u16 and u18 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.440
 U20 nomination as there are every year 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.810
 again a new possibility for the 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.100
 players to present themselves and the 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.720
 give up will be the first 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.250
 only those who continue to fall down fall 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.930
 and then believe your chance and for that 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.500
 they will also work one another 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.500
 to have a chance
