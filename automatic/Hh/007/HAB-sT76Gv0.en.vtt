 get a weather note of klement jeremy 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.959
 is about playing a defender himself 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.690
 to play a second and defend 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:19.160
 then shoot right through the middle 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.510
 nice outbreak from young ajax to jeremy 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.720
 get insufficient direction in it 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.720
 shot 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.890

 goal from django warmerdam 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.019
 then young ajax changes three in the break 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.880
 times in those big houses in the plow 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.010
 lerin duarte in the team and robert muric 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.360
 in the team and in those big houses can 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.060
 straight to the box 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:54.040
 the stab owners is the shot 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:57.510
 less nicely upright in that big house 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.510
 the shot of the dennis folkers 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:04.109
 wide houses prevents a hit 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.109
 warmerdam 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.670
 nice pass in by clearing it 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:14.769
 and there is the g50 danny baker 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:18.519
 shoot the ball hard on the post now and then 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:21.280
 point must be young ajax that we are hefty 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:24.099
 what opportunities create in this competition that 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.370
 you are going through elton acolatse well 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.840
 chases and retains his opponent 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.450
 the overview puts him back on sam 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.269
 hendriks and now it is five zero 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.689
 the rush hour that last week in austria 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.250
 ricardo kishna replaced so little week 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:41.980
 measurement training with ajax one and now 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.319
 effective for young ajax acolatse 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:49.120
 here it is again 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:50.169
 Shedding on Hendriks Hendriks to Muric 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.939
 we have to get in and he has one 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:56.019
 excellent thick legs that leave here 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:58.079
 see it is 6 0 for young ajax after 70 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.079
 minutes 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.739
 ajax it in the second half 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.879
 something at the beginning of the second half 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.859
 harder than in the first half 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.150
 but finally in the last 10 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.519
 minutes on the goal balance 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.120
 works here is jenny sent away by 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.819

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.919
 Jeremy made seven outs in the 80th 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.139

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:19.299
 journey was replaced at rest 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.340
 let's let the team in for a moment 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.770
 elton acolatse 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.720
 we make seven of them moritz that 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.720

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.449
 thank you people 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.419

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:41.500
 opening this is a nice ball on vaslav 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:44.260
 Jeremy and he made eight out of zero in the 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:49.289
 83rd minute and then the double 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.289
 figures in sight again moritz 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:56.979

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.360

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.059
 hendriks and 9 9 is ultimately none 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.650
 ten goals because that's it 

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:07.449
 in the final phase of the match 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.939
 some chances but young ajax wins the 2nd 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.960
 match of preparation with 9 0 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:12.610
 of wells 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.990
 I think we have some excellent ones 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.400
 goal have made nice attack 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.559
 have shown until the last minute 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.439
 have been looking for more goals 

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:21.069
 yes and also satisfied in the drive and 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:23.499
 where the the 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:24.879
 were able to read the results immediately 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:26.710
 what we would like to see too 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:30.430
 too satisfied and none in that area 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.990
 injuries so great prima already 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.789
 early in the preparation a good deal 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.699
 number of players which plays a bit long 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:38.080
 some follow me 90 minutes also played 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.149
 you have trained hard I understood 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.979
 for the competition of some people around 

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:44.529
 the team 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:46.689
 are you on schedule yes so far yes 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:48.009
 you always have to wait and see with 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:49.870
 usually in such a preparation that is the 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:52.149
 two to three weeks it is always the prima 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.819
 ok too today see how fresh and 

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:57.789
 the group is eager and there was the 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:59.319
 Resistance today may not be in that 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:01.779
 sense of that you also really tested and tested 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:03.789
 but we are in that area too well 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:05.949
 for one 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:07.479
 so what that goes yes have the basics 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.839
 to further the coming weeks 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:09.839
 make steps
