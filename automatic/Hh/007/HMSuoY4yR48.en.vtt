00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
going to try to demonstrate how the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.270 
going to try to demonstrate how the
glove<00:01:15.930> works<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.560> can<00:01:16.680> see<00:01:16.830> I'm<00:01:16.950> using<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
glove works you can see I'm using the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.820 
glove works you can see I'm using the
fingertip<00:01:17.729> here<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.299> move<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.409> controls

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
fingertip here to move the controls

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.830 
fingertip here to move the controls
around<00:01:20.040> really<00:01:20.970> difficult<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.450> get<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.720> to

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
around really difficult to get this to

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.660 
around really difficult to get this to
work<00:01:21.869> on<00:01:22.170> camera<00:01:22.590> because<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:23.040> can't<00:01:23.460> hold

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
work on camera because you can't hold

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.940 
work on camera because you can't hold
anything<00:01:23.909> naturally<00:01:24.600> when<00:01:24.720> you're<00:01:24.900> on<00:01:25.500> camera

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
anything naturally when you're on camera

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.710 
anything naturally when you're on camera
especially<00:01:26.189> if<00:01:26.580> that's<00:01:26.790> just<00:01:27.180> do<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.420> don't

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
especially if that's just do I don't

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.780 
especially if that's just do I don't
have<00:01:27.810> somebody<00:01:28.049> holding<00:01:28.409> camera<00:01:28.680> here<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.700> you

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
have somebody holding camera here so you

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.539 
have somebody holding camera here so you

see I'm able to use any finger you

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.219 
see I'm able to use any finger you
probably<00:01:32.909> even<00:01:33.030> use<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.360> palm<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.570> my<00:01:33.810> hand<00:01:34.049> to

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
probably even use the palm of my hand to

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.090 
probably even use the palm of my hand to
do<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:35.450> great<00:01:36.450> for<00:01:36.630> passive

create<00:01:45.329> messages<00:01:45.840> if<00:01:46.020> you're<00:01:46.140> careful<00:01:46.380> and

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
create messages if you're careful and

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.789 
create messages if you're careful and
rely<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:48.600> autocorrect<00:01:48.869> function<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.710> i'll

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
rely on the autocorrect function so i'll

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.330 
rely on the autocorrect function so i'll
type<00:01:50.100> down<00:01:50.340> here<00:01:50.790> say<00:01:53.000> this

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:06.169 

is<00:01:56.429> a<00:01:58.909> test<00:02:01.009> and<00:02:02.149> I'll<00:02:03.149> change<00:02:03.450> over<00:02:04.939> to<00:02:05.939> the

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
is a test and I'll change over to the

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:08.389 
is a test and I'll change over to the
swype<00:02:06.840> input<00:02:07.229> method<00:02:07.950> which<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.220> actually

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
swype input method which I actually

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.059 
swype input method which I actually
works<00:02:08.729> better<00:02:08.819> because<00:02:09.619> it<00:02:10.619> recognized<00:02:10.950> this

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
works better because it recognized this

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:17.660 
works better because it recognized this
more<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.519> general<00:02:11.910> pattern<00:02:16.519> sticketh<00:02:17.519> out

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
more the general pattern sticketh out

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.380 
more the general pattern sticketh out
and<00:02:17.790> wrong<00:02:21.110> overall<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.200> works<00:02:22.379> pretty<00:02:22.530> nicely

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
and wrong overall it works pretty nicely

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.640 
and wrong overall it works pretty nicely

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
any of the multi-touch features work

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.150 
any of the multi-touch features work
obviously<00:02:35.970> we<00:02:36.329> can<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:37.230> know<00:02:37.319> pen<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.890> scroll

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
obviously we can you know pen and scroll

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.119 
obviously we can you know pen and scroll

tap to get into things question is are

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:44.990 
tap to get into things question is are
we<00:02:43.920> going<00:02:44.099> to<00:02:44.160> be<00:02:44.220> able<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.489> effectively

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
we going to be able to effectively

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.750 
we going to be able to effectively
multi-touch<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:46.709> looks<00:02:46.890> like<00:02:47.010> i<00:02:47.099> can

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.339 

definitely<00:02:53.760> easier<00:02:54.269> just<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.599> double<00:02:55.200> tap

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349
