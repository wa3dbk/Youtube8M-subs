00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
like wanted or death match how quickly

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.860 
like wanted or death match how quickly
you<00:01:35.770> need<00:01:36.010> to<00:01:36.220> either<00:01:36.520> get<00:01:37.000> to<00:01:37.180> your<00:01:37.270> target<00:01:37.540> or

maybe not need to get your target so for

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.580 
maybe not need to get your target so for
example<00:01:40.360> imagine<00:01:40.870> if<00:01:41.140> you<00:01:41.320> just<00:01:41.380> actually

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590

have this target come up and it then has
one<00:01:46.210> x<00:01:46.570> that<00:01:47.020> means<00:01:47.080> that<00:01:47.350> you're<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.590> only

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
one x that means that you're the only

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.430 
one x that means that you're the only
person<00:01:48.160> hunting<00:01:48.970> that<00:01:49.120> target<00:01:49.570> if<00:01:50.050> you<00:01:50.260> have

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
person hunting that target if you have

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.200 
person hunting that target if you have
your<00:01:50.530> target<00:01:50.920> come<00:01:51.070> up<00:01:51.220> and<00:01:51.460> like<00:01:51.820> you<00:01:52.000> see

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
had three that would be in it to you

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.750 
had three that would be in it to you
plus<00:02:02.110> two<00:02:02.440> other<00:02:02.650> people<00:02:03.070> going<00:02:03.340> for<00:02:03.640> that

plus two other people going for that

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.670 
plus two other people going for that
target<00:02:04.210> so<00:02:04.540> you<00:02:04.600> might<00:02:04.810> need<00:02:04.960> to<00:02:05.080> get<00:02:05.290> and<00:02:05.470> kill

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
target so you might need to get and kill

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.500 
target so you might need to get and kill
that<00:02:05.800> tug<00:02:06.040> a<00:02:06.070> little<00:02:06.250> bit<00:02:06.550> quicker<00:02:06.730> that's<00:02:07.240> why

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
that tug a little bit quicker that's why

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.630 
that tug a little bit quicker that's why
having<00:02:07.870> this<00:02:07.960> on<00:02:08.200> is<00:02:08.379> a<00:02:08.440> very<00:02:08.920> important

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
having this on is a very important

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.660 
having this on is a very important
option

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
option

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.309 
option
the<00:02:11.240> other<00:02:11.450> one<00:02:11.720> that<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:11.900> would<00:02:12.110> like<00:02:12.290> to

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
the other one that you would like to

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.080 
the other one that you would like to
have<00:02:12.590> on<00:02:12.770> and<00:02:12.950> i<00:02:13.010> would<00:02:13.190> suggest<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:13.700> have<00:02:13.880> one

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
have on and i would suggest you have one

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.990 
have on and i would suggest you have one
is<00:02:14.349> target<00:02:15.349> game<00:02:15.620> attack<00:02:15.950> so<00:02:16.400> what<00:02:16.580> that<00:02:16.610> does

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
is target game attack so what that does

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000 
is target game attack so what that does
is<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.209> lets<00:02:17.599> you<00:02:17.750> know<00:02:18.020> what<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.650> gamertag

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
is that lets you know what the gamertag

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.610 
is that lets you know what the gamertag
is<00:02:19.220> of<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.940> target<00:02:20.330> you're<00:02:20.510> playing<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:21.380> the

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
is of the target you're playing so the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.020 
is of the target you're playing so the
reason<00:02:21.770> why<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:22.010> is<00:02:22.190> important<00:02:22.640> is<00:02:22.730> if

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
reason why this is important is if

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.339 
reason why this is important is if
you're<00:02:23.150> playing<00:02:23.390> with<00:02:23.569> people<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:24.200> know

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
you're playing with people and you know

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:25.720 
you're playing with people and you know
their<00:02:24.530> tendencies<00:02:25.099> or<00:02:25.130> if<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:25.430> know<00:02:25.550> they're

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
their tendencies or if you know they're

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.090 
their tendencies or if you know they're
wild<00:02:26.150> or<00:02:26.270> sneaky<00:02:26.690> like<00:02:26.840> for<00:02:26.989> example<00:02:27.050> i<00:02:27.500> play
