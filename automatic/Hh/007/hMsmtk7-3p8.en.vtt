 Now that you know how the garden is freese 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.140
 It is time to start the ground 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.480
 To process the device is called 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.880
 freese hoe is called because the mantis 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.490
 has elements that have a dual function 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.439
 by simply repositioning this 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.319
 elements from one side to the other 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.789
 you can alternate to deep milling 

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:23.869
 and to chop on the surface 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.869
 be used 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.610
 To mill with it, fasten it like this 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.190
 that the cutting points forward from the 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.030
 Show operator away and first the 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.030
 touch ground 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.289
 to hack they return the has elements 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.479
 now their tips are pointing backwards 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.280
 towards the operator and the long flat 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:52.579
 Part of the cutting touches the ground 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.579
 first 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.989
 the hug elements are easy to handle 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.659
 they will turn on though 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.019
 notice that the throttle is locked 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:05.540
 is 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.460
 the hug elements do not turn until 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.380
 she with the palm dena advises her 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.930

 let go of the throttle completely 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.860
 Put the garden freese in the beginning 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.090
 the row or the area at the 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.280
 to be milled 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.290
 turn on the hak elements and 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.030
 pull the machine backwards 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.039
 Then follow it up a little

 this way you can see the floor up 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.700
 to the desired deep milling or chopping

 become 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.869
 and the handlebars let themselves be 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.550
 fold in to fold in the handle

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.820
 In addition, the cutter is so light that 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.360
 They are easily hung on a wall 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.360
 can be 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.230
 Do not store the cutter on the machine 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.510
 page and do not just lay it down 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.950
 on the ground the cutter fits too

 is about a motor damage too 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.720
 Prevent it is very important that they
