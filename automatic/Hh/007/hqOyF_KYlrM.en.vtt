pretty<00:01:08.950> much<00:01:09.070> what<00:01:09.130> you<00:01:09.370> expect<00:01:09.790> so<00:01:10.750> I<00:01:10.780> think

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
pretty much what you expect so I think

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.660 
pretty much what you expect so I think
the<00:01:11.140> thing<00:01:11.170> to<00:01:11.350> do<00:01:11.470> now<00:01:11.620> is<00:01:11.650> let's<00:01:12.130> compare<00:01:12.520> it

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
the thing to do now is let's compare it

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.160 
the thing to do now is let's compare it
to<00:01:12.850> some<00:01:13.090> of<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.240> devices<00:01:13.480> that<00:01:13.840> are<00:01:13.990> actually

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
to some of the devices that are actually

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.080 
to some of the devices that are actually
the<00:01:14.500> competing<00:01:14.980> devices<00:01:15.160> on<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:15.700> market<00:01:15.730> out

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
the competing devices on the market out

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.390 
the competing devices on the market out
there<00:01:16.120> today<00:01:16.480> and<00:01:16.750> the<00:01:17.710> first<00:01:17.920> one<00:01:18.130> I'm<00:01:18.310> going

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
there today and the first one I'm going

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.980 
there today and the first one I'm going
to<00:01:18.460> put<00:01:18.670> it<00:01:18.760> up<00:01:18.850> against<00:01:19.210> is<00:01:19.420> you<00:01:19.690> know<00:01:19.780> the

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
to put it up against is you know the

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.770 
to put it up against is you know the
treo<00:01:20.200> 680<00:01:20.650> the<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:21.280> GSM<00:01:21.730> consumer<00:01:22.270> trio<00:01:22.510> as

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
treo 680 the the GSM consumer trio as

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.530 
treo 680 the the GSM consumer trio as
it's<00:01:22.960> known<00:01:23.290> and<00:01:23.650> you<00:01:24.580> can<00:01:24.700> see<00:01:24.880> it<00:01:25.060> is<00:01:25.240> much

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
it's known and you can see it is much

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.350 
it's known and you can see it is much
shorter<00:01:25.870> and<00:01:26.200> a<00:01:26.680> little<00:01:26.860> bit<00:01:27.250> thinner<00:01:27.490> it's

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
shorter and a little bit thinner it's

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.670 
shorter and a little bit thinner it's
hard<00:01:28.540> really<00:01:28.750> to<00:01:28.870> show<00:01:29.110> you<00:01:29.170> here<00:01:29.440> but<00:01:29.590> it

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
hard really to show you here but it

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.070 
hard really to show you here but it
really<00:01:29.920> does<00:01:30.160> feel<00:01:30.190> way<00:01:30.760> way<00:01:31.000> smaller<00:01:31.360> it's

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
really does feel way way smaller it's

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.200 
really does feel way way smaller it's
more<00:01:32.260> rounded<00:01:32.740> feels<00:01:33.490> a<00:01:33.640> lot<00:01:33.730> better<00:01:33.910> in<00:01:34.120> the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
more rounded feels a lot better in the

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.210 
more rounded feels a lot better in the
hand<00:01:35.670> not<00:01:36.670> nearly<00:01:37.090> as<00:01:37.240> wide<00:01:37.540> just<00:01:38.470> much<00:01:38.980> much

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
hand not nearly as wide just much much

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.960 
hand not nearly as wide just much much
better<00:01:39.550> form<00:01:39.910> factor<00:01:40.300> than<00:01:40.540> 680<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:41.110> really<00:01:41.440> is

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
better form factor than 680 it really is

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.990 
better form factor than 680 it really is
and<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:44.320> other<00:01:44.470> thing<00:01:44.770> that<00:01:44.800> you<00:01:45.190> also<00:01:45.520> notice

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
and the other thing that you also notice

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.530 
and the other thing that you also notice
it<00:01:46.210> still<00:01:46.480> is<00:01:46.630> a<00:01:46.659> 320<00:01:47.170> x<00:01:47.290> 320<00:01:47.650> screen<00:01:48.190> and<00:01:48.540> what

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
it still is a 320 x 320 screen and what

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.560 
it still is a 320 x 320 screen and what
that<00:01:49.720> does<00:01:50.020> is<00:01:50.050> it<00:01:50.500> means<00:01:50.860> that<00:01:51.159> it<00:01:51.520> it<00:01:52.090> looks

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
that does is it means that it it looks

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.600 
that does is it means that it it looks
much<00:01:53.020> better<00:01:53.320> than<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.740> 680<00:01:54.100> screen<00:01:54.460> just

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
much better than the 680 screen just

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.950 
much better than the 680 screen just
because<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.000> pixels<00:01:55.390> are<00:01:55.510> packed<00:01:55.750> in<00:01:55.930> that

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
because the pixels are packed in that

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.399 
because the pixels are packed in that
much<00:01:56.229> smaller<00:01:56.560> space<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:58.570> there<00:01:58.720> you<00:01:58.810> go<00:01:58.870> now

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
much smaller space so there you go now

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.320 
much smaller space so there you go now
let's<00:01:59.680> also<00:02:00.010> take<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:00.370> look<00:02:00.580> of<00:02:00.729> it<00:02:00.850> next<00:02:01.120> to<00:02:01.270> the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
let's also take a look of it next to the

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.990 
let's also take a look of it next to the
blackjack<00:02:01.990> blackjack<00:02:02.229> is<00:02:02.770> also<00:02:03.100> on<00:02:03.220> AT&amp;T<00:02:03.550> it's

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
blackjack blackjack is also on AT&amp;T it's

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.890 
blackjack blackjack is also on AT&amp;T it's
a<00:02:04.270> sort<00:02:05.200> of<00:02:05.260> it<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.470> be<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.620> media<00:02:06.340> smartphone<00:02:07.180> it

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
a sort of it to be a media smartphone it

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.050 
a sort of it to be a media smartphone it
is<00:02:08.439> not<00:02:08.619> as<00:02:08.769> wide<00:02:08.979> or<00:02:09.280> as<00:02:09.429> tall<00:02:09.729> as<00:02:10.030> the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
is not as wide or as tall as the

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.420 
is not as wide or as tall as the
blackjack<00:02:10.749> it<00:02:11.469> is<00:02:11.650> thicker<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.159> course

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
blackjack it is thicker of course

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.870 
blackjack it is thicker of course
although<00:02:12.790> if<00:02:12.969> you<00:02:13.090> include<00:02:13.540> that

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
although if you include that

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.100 
although if you include that
humph<00:02:14.060> at<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.240> top<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.570> blackjack<00:02:14.960> the

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
humph at the top of the blackjack the

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.620 
humph at the top of the blackjack the
difference<00:02:15.410> isn't<00:02:15.560> that<00:02:15.860> big<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:17.240> of<00:02:17.600> course

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
difference isn't that big and of course

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.960 
difference isn't that big and of course
it<00:02:18.200> is<00:02:18.350> as<00:02:18.560> I<00:02:18.710> said<00:02:18.830> a<00:02:18.890> little<00:02:19.130> bit<00:02:19.250> thicker<00:02:19.430> but

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
it is as I said a little bit thicker but

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.640 
it is as I said a little bit thicker but
it<00:02:20.120> feels<00:02:20.450> really<00:02:20.900> great<00:02:21.110> in<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.350> hand<00:02:21.380> it

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
it feels really great in the hand it

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.140 
it feels really great in the hand it
feels<00:02:21.680> much<00:02:22.130> more<00:02:22.310> phone<00:02:22.550> like<00:02:22.790> than<00:02:23.030> the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
feels much more phone like than the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.180 
feels much more phone like than the
blackjack<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.930> here's<00:02:24.770> another<00:02:24.890> one

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
blackjack and here's another one

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.550 
blackjack and here's another one
t-mobile<00:02:26.000> dash<00:02:26.180> also<00:02:26.840> a<00:02:26.870> consumer<00:02:27.410> level

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
t-mobile dash also a consumer level

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.030 
t-mobile dash also a consumer level
smartphone<00:02:27.770> t-mobile<00:02:28.730> dash<00:02:28.880> is<00:02:29.240> much<00:02:29.510> thinner

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
smartphone t-mobile dash is much thinner

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.010 
smartphone t-mobile dash is much thinner
but<00:02:31.040> you<00:02:31.460> know<00:02:31.580> still<00:02:32.000> I<00:02:32.180> still<00:02:32.480> think<00:02:32.900> it

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
but you know still I still think it

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.660 
but you know still I still think it
feels<00:02:33.230> much<00:02:33.470> better<00:02:33.680> now<00:02:33.950> here's<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.460> razor

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
feels much better now here's the razor

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.090 
feels much better now here's the razor
to<00:02:34.970> sort<00:02:35.510> of<00:02:35.570> the<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:36.110> device<00:02:36.380> that<00:02:36.740> the

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
to sort of the the device that the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.460 
to sort of the the device that the
sentra<00:02:38.090> was<00:02:38.240> meant<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.540> be<00:02:38.570> up<00:02:38.810> against<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.380> as

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
sentra was meant to be up against and as

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.130 
sentra was meant to be up against and as
you<00:02:39.590> can<00:02:39.740> see<00:02:39.770> it<00:02:40.340> is<00:02:40.910> taller<00:02:41.270> and<00:02:41.540> thicker<00:02:41.780> of

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
you can see it is taller and thicker of

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.230 
you can see it is taller and thicker of
course<00:02:42.410> then<00:02:42.770> the<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.430> razor<00:02:43.640> but<00:02:43.970> you<00:02:44.180> know

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240

course then the the razor but you know
of<00:02:44.330> course<00:02:44.480> it<00:02:44.660> also<00:02:44.780> does<00:02:45.020> quite<00:02:45.290> a<00:02:45.350> bit<00:02:45.530> more

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
of course it also does quite a bit more

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.700 
of course it also does quite a bit more
the<00:02:47.150> really<00:02:47.540> surprising<00:02:48.080> thing<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.320> me<00:02:48.440> though

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
the really surprising thing to me though

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.440 
the really surprising thing to me though
first<00:02:49.340> of<00:02:49.460> all<00:02:49.520> you<00:02:49.580> know<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.940> screen<00:02:50.240> is

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
first of all you know the screen is

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.960 
first of all you know the screen is
actually<00:02:50.930> smaller<00:02:51.470> in<00:02:52.250> some<00:02:52.460> ways<00:02:52.610> than<00:02:52.880> the

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
actually smaller in some ways than the

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.690 
actually smaller in some ways than the
razors<00:02:53.300> but<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.200> keyboard<00:02:54.770> is<00:02:54.980> actually<00:02:55.490> in<00:02:55.610> a

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
razors but the keyboard is actually in a

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.360 
razors but the keyboard is actually in a
smaller<00:02:56.150> space<00:02:56.540> than<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:57.140> regular<00:02:57.890> you<00:02:58.280> know

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
smaller space than the regular you know

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.060 
smaller space than the regular you know
10<00:02:58.640> 12<00:02:58.910> key<00:02:59.090> keyboard<00:02:59.420> on<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.720> the<00:03:00.440> razor<00:03:00.710> the

10 12 key keyboard on the the razor the
razors<00:03:01.340> got<00:03:01.490> that<00:03:01.670> big<00:03:02.030> keypad<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:02.570> they<00:03:02.840> fit

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
razors got that big keypad and they fit

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.570 
razors got that big keypad and they fit
a<00:03:03.110> corded<00:03:03.530> keyboard<00:03:03.920> in<00:03:04.070> a<00:03:04.130> smaller<00:03:04.460> area

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
a corded keyboard in a smaller area

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.640 
a corded keyboard in a smaller area
overall<00:03:05.270> than<00:03:05.450> they<00:03:05.570> had<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:05.870> on<00:03:05.960> the<00:03:06.230> razor

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650

for<00:03:06.890> its<00:03:06.980> regular<00:03:07.280> keyboard<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:08.360> now<00:03:09.260> we're

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
for its regular keyboard and now we're

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.740 
for its regular keyboard and now we're
taking<00:03:09.740> a<00:03:09.800> look<00:03:10.070> at<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.670> screen<00:03:11.330> as<00:03:11.570> you

taking a look at the the screen as you
can<00:03:11.900> see<00:03:12.140> it<00:03:12.380> is<00:03:12.530> really<00:03:13.310> sharp<00:03:13.610> there<00:03:13.910> it<00:03:13.970> is

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
can see it is really sharp there it is

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.540 
can see it is really sharp there it is
up<00:03:14.210> against<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.510> 680<00:03:14.930> as<00:03:15.110> i<00:03:15.230> said<00:03:15.440> before<00:03:15.560> much

up against the 680 as i said before much

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.270 
up against the 680 as i said before much
much<00:03:16.880> sharper<00:03:17.180> looks<00:03:17.660> so<00:03:17.930> much<00:03:18.110> better<00:03:18.320> and

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280
