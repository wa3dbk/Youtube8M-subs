00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
so you know I've had my training block

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.050 
so you know I've had my training block
and<00:05:16.889> they've<00:05:17.039> had<00:05:17.190> their<00:05:17.400> so<00:05:17.610> I<00:05:17.669> think<00:05:17.910> we're

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
and they've had their so I think we're

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.940 
and they've had their so I think we're
all<00:05:18.210> a<00:05:18.450> bit<00:05:18.930> worn<00:05:19.139> down<00:05:19.320> it's<00:05:19.590> been<00:05:19.710> a<00:05:19.740> long

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
all a bit worn down it's been a long

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.070

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
season especially for Mitch and myself I

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.930 
season especially for Mitch and myself I
think<00:05:22.200> we<00:05:22.349> started<00:05:22.680> cross<00:05:23.310> country<00:05:23.460> back<00:05:23.760> in

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
think we started cross country back in

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.400 
think we started cross country back in
January<00:05:24.570> for<00:05:24.810> the<00:05:24.870> world<00:05:25.080> cross<00:05:25.229> country

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
January for the world cross country

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.350 
January for the world cross country
trials<00:05:25.860> and<00:05:26.099> then<00:05:26.190> will<00:05:26.430> cross<00:05:26.700> itself<00:05:27.030> so

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
trials and then will cross itself so

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.690 
trials and then will cross itself so
it's<00:05:27.570> been<00:05:27.690> a<00:05:27.720> long<00:05:27.900> time<00:05:28.220> moving<00:05:29.220> on<00:05:29.430> to<00:05:29.580> the
