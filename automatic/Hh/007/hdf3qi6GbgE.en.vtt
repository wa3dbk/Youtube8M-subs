00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.560 

also<00:01:32.170> think<00:01:32.290> I<00:01:32.410> might<00:01:32.620> have<00:01:32.650> gotten<00:01:32.890> sick

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.600 
also think I might have gotten sick
while<00:01:34.570> I<00:01:34.600> was<00:01:34.840> in<00:01:34.990> that<00:01:35.110> jury<00:01:35.740> room<00:01:35.800> whatever

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
while I was in that jury room whatever

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.580 
while I was in that jury room whatever
that<00:01:36.670> was<00:01:36.790> because<00:01:37.090> there's<00:01:37.330> like<00:01:39.479> like<00:01:40.479> 80<00:01:41.140> 90

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
that was because there's like like 80 90

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.430 
that was because there's like like 80 90
people<00:01:41.740> were<00:01:42.070> probably<00:01:43.800> like<00:01:44.800> three<00:01:45.130> rows<00:01:46.440> was

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
people were probably like three rows was

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.870 
people were probably like three rows was
a<00:01:47.470> bunch<00:01:47.710> of<00:01:47.770> us<00:01:48.180> but<00:01:49.180> our<00:01:50.400> room<00:01:51.400> was<00:01:51.520> full<00:01:51.729> to

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
a bunch of us but our room was full to

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.440 
a bunch of us but our room was full to
the<00:01:51.940> rim<00:01:52.119> a<00:01:53.790> bunch<00:01:54.790> of<00:01:54.850> people<00:01:54.910> cough<00:01:55.210> and

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
the rim a bunch of people cough and

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.990 
the rim a bunch of people cough and
stuff<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:58.030> I<00:01:58.119> may<00:01:58.330> have<00:01:58.420> gotten<00:01:58.630> sick<00:02:00.000> that

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:56.000 

then<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.470> bad<00:03:46.680> spot

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010

00:05:59.649 --> 00:06:01.469 
weird feeling to be on one wheel I've
never<00:05:59.860> actually<00:06:00.069> been<00:06:00.249> on<00:06:00.430> one<00:06:00.729> wheel<00:06:00.909> and

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 
never actually been on one wheel and

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:05.179 
never actually been on one wheel and
held<00:06:01.719> it<00:06:01.889> but<00:06:02.889> I<00:06:02.919> just<00:06:03.129> got<00:06:03.279> it<00:06:03.399> up<00:06:03.520> for<00:06:03.729> like<00:06:03.879> I

00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:05.189 
held it but I just got it up for like I

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:08.209 
held it but I just got it up for like I
don't<00:06:06.189> know<00:06:06.279> it's<00:06:06.669> a<00:06:06.729> second<00:06:07.059> a<00:06:07.119> half<00:06:07.270> second

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:08.219 
don't know it's a second a half second

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:10.139 
don't know it's a second a half second
or<00:06:09.219> else<00:06:09.339> think<00:06:09.520> it's<00:06:09.550> a<00:06:09.639> good<00:06:09.729> time<00:06:09.789> because

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:10.149 
or else think it's a good time because

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:11.339 
or else think it's a good time because
I've<00:06:10.330> already<00:06:10.449> lay<00:06:10.629> this<00:06:10.689> motorcycle<00:06:11.259> down

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:11.349 
I've already lay this motorcycle down

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:16.139 
I've already lay this motorcycle down
once<00:06:11.649> i'm<00:06:12.490> about<00:06:12.729> to<00:06:12.879> sell<00:06:13.089> it<00:06:14.879> and<00:06:15.879> maybe<00:06:15.999> i'll

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:16.149 
once i'm about to sell it and maybe i'll

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:18.650 
once i'm about to sell it and maybe i'll
study<00:06:16.300> only<00:06:16.449> those<00:06:16.659> on<00:06:16.749> my<00:06:16.779> new<00:06:16.930> bike

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660
