00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
work good so it's pretty awesome and

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.159 
work good so it's pretty awesome and
just<00:06:03.040> when<00:06:03.130> I<00:06:03.190> suppose<00:06:03.460> the<00:06:03.580> size<00:06:03.850> difference

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
just when I suppose the size difference

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:09.240 
just when I suppose the size difference
here<00:06:05.169> between<00:06:05.199> these<00:06:05.650> two<00:06:05.919> is<00:06:07.770> one<00:06:08.770> of<00:06:08.889> the

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
here between these two is one of the

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.250 
here between these two is one of the
main<00:06:09.400> reasons<00:06:09.910> that<00:06:10.030> don't<00:06:10.330> sell<00:06:10.930> anymore

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 
main reasons that don't sell anymore

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.200 
main reasons that don't sell anymore
cast<00:06:11.740> of<00:06:11.979> this<00:06:12.130> helmet<00:06:12.520> is<00:06:12.580> because<00:06:12.940> it's<00:06:13.150> a

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
cast of this helmet is because it's a

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.629 
cast of this helmet is because it's a
lot<00:06:13.389> smaller<00:06:13.540> than<00:06:13.870> this<00:06:14.020> one<00:06:14.229> and<00:06:14.500> I<00:06:14.800> thought

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 
lot smaller than this one and I thought

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.330 
lot smaller than this one and I thought
it<00:06:15.790> unfair<00:06:15.910> to<00:06:16.300> sell<00:06:16.590> you<00:06:17.590> know<00:06:17.710> casts<00:06:18.220> that

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
it unfair to sell you know casts that

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.950 
it unfair to sell you know casts that
were<00:06:18.550> too<00:06:18.729> small<00:06:18.760> and<00:06:19.150> I<00:06:19.270> didn't<00:06:19.540> really<00:06:19.660> think

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
were too small and I didn't really think

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.230 
were too small and I didn't really think
about<00:06:20.889> it<00:06:21.039> until<00:06:21.310> after<00:06:21.460> I'd<00:06:21.699> sold<00:06:21.940> quite<00:06:22.180> a

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
about it until after I'd sold quite a

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.170 
about it until after I'd sold quite a
few<00:06:22.449> and<00:06:22.600> nobody<00:06:23.110> complained<00:06:23.500> about<00:06:23.770> a<00:06:24.180> you

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
few and nobody complained about a you

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.140 
few and nobody complained about a you
know<00:06:25.270> still<00:06:25.570> and<00:06:26.440> plus<00:06:26.710> the<00:06:26.889> mold<00:06:27.100> of<00:06:27.310> that<00:06:28.000> one
