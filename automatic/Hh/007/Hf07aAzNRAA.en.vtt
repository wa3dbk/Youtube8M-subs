they<00:00:26.760> schooled<00:00:27.529> significantly<00:00:28.529> better<00:00:28.769> but

they schooled significantly better but
we<00:00:29.760> still<00:00:29.789> um<00:00:30.359> because<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.170> car<00:00:31.349> doesn't<00:00:31.650> have

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
we still um because the car doesn't have

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.020 
we still um because the car doesn't have
a<00:00:31.769> trans<00:00:32.099> brake<00:00:33.230> when<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.640> launch<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.850> car

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.940 
the 50s it doesn't 60-foot like it
should<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:42.000> we<00:00:42.930> decided<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.320> go<00:00:43.440> ahead<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.860> do

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
should so we decided to go ahead and do

should so we decided to go ahead and do
something<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.280> little<00:00:44.399> bit<00:00:44.579> different<00:00:45.180> which

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
something a little bit different which

about 4500 rpm the car makes

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.060 
about 4500 rpm the car makes
approximately<00:01:12.439> 585<00:01:13.439> foot-pounds<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.010> torque

at the tires with a lot converter this

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.330 
at the tires with a lot converter this
was<00:01:18.299> enough<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.720> physically<00:01:19.140> unlock<00:01:19.680> or

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
was enough to physically unlock or

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.179 
was enough to physically unlock or
overpower<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.420> clutch<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.830> converter

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
overpower the clutch in the converter

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.640 
overpower the clutch in the converter
and<00:01:23.400> cause<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.860> slippage<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.299> subsequently<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
and cause a slippage in subsequently the

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.469

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
power on the vehicle flatlined

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.940 
power on the vehicle flatlined
it's<00:01:33.479> neat<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.290> should<00:01:34.439> run<00:01:34.560> at<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.710> track

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
it's neat so we should run at the track

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:44.520 
it's neat so we should run at the track
here<00:01:35.159> pretty<00:01:35.189> soon
