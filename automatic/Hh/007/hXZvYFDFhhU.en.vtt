00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:13.049
 great fighters my name is mikhail and 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.660
 today we will talk about side 12 on this 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.910
 time in more detail as I said in 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.310
 your previous video bypass 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.710
 battlefield 4 ak-12 maybe repeat 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:28.849
 they will probably be called but you fight for them 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.160
 shoot it very precisely the scatter has 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.410
 minimum control recoil 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.800
 makes it very easy and rechargeable 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.500
 extremely fast even I am a person playing 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.500
 gait well maximum slightly above average 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.200
 I constantly dominate when I hold in my hands 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.000
 data type of weapons for the beginning let's 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.000
 find out what imba is 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.570
 imba words come from the word im balance 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.820
 i.e. weapons go beyond 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.329
 balance it's pretty funny because 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.309
 they consider the fight m16 which in my opinion 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.100
 just exactly 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.830
 absolutely perfectly balanced and 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.830
 that's why most of them run with her 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.680
 players because she's good as 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.520
 close so on medium so on distant 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.979
 distances 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.030
 that is, battlefield 3 there are plenty 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.850
 weapons superior to m16 in certain 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.369
 situations like abakan much better 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.640
 than 16 m at long distances 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.549
 but near it is much worse the same famas 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.869
 or a nut is much better than you 16 on 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.900
 close range 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.920
 but far away they are much worse that is what 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.920
 same imba 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.549
 this weapon which is perfect for 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.640
 every situation in every situation she 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.840
 shows itself perfectly with such weapons 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.380
 bf3 was m 16 and 3 beat the same battlefield 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.259
 four 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.380
 this ak-12 of it is equally convenient 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.960
 shoot both near so on medium and on 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.049
 long distances he is very fast 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.460
 rechargeable and has a small scatter 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.920
 it would seem imba 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.310
 but there is one big but 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.739
 the fact is that it is beta and not only that 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.780
 we have not yet seen just huge 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.040
 quantities of weapons that are 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.200
 battlefield 4 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.250
 so also the characteristics of all kinds 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.700
 weapons 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.459
 far from the final and there are still many of them. 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.250
 change times maybe they have already changed 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.640
 article characteristics some of them 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.360
 already become known for example 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:39.450
 firing rate ak-12 compared to 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.750
 ak-74m which was in bf3 increased by 80 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.340
 minute shots then there is a figure of 600 to 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.160
 680 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.549
 the damage was almost the same 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.170
 very important factor increased distance with 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:58.049
 whom this damage began to fall that is 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:01.590
 ak-74m had a maximum damage of 25 x p on 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:04.290
 distances up to eight meters ak-12 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.330
 has the same maximum damage but on 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.810
 distance up to 10 meters 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:13.769
 the same with minimum damage ak-74 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:17.579
 had a minimum damage of 18 4 hp on 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:21.000
 distance after 50 meters ak-12 same on 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.109
 the same distance of 50 meters has damage 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.870
 20 kb 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:27.239
 other weapon characteristics such as 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.790
 reload rate or recoil 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.120
 horizontally and vertically i'm still 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.730
 not 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:37.290
 Well , let's make a conclusion personally, I 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:40.769
 I think that it is too early to make an AK-12 they 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.560
 let's wait for the game and decide there 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:47.070
 good machine actually 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.560
 or we hurried our labels but in beta 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.700
 really good oh well i think mine 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.069
 conclusions and dreams 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.799
 and now i would like to hear your opinion 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:59.640
 write in the comments how do you think 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:02.340
 will there be ak-12 new battle in battlefield 4 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.400
