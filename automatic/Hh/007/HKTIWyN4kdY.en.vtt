00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
good for first book but it is very

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.420 
good for first book but it is very
mass-market<00:02:41.879> issue<00:02:42.440> so<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.470> is<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.280> is

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
yeah I think it's good for a first book

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.860 
yeah I think it's good for a first book
but<00:03:47.190> it's<00:03:47.340> not<00:03:47.549> great<00:03:47.940> now<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.239> writing<00:03:48.660> was

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
but it's not great now the writing was

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.039 
but it's not great now the writing was
okay<00:03:49.349> but<00:03:49.950> it<00:03:50.670> wasn't<00:03:50.880> spectacular<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.690> wasn't

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
okay but it wasn't spectacular it wasn't

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.129 
okay but it wasn't spectacular it wasn't
a<00:03:52.139> four-star<00:03:52.680> read<00:03:52.889> no<00:03:53.549> way<00:03:53.730> but<00:03:54.480> that's<00:03:54.959> just

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
a four-star read no way but that's just

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.860 
a four-star read no way but that's just
my<00:03:55.410> personal<00:03:55.680> opinion<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:56.519> don't<00:03:57.180> often<00:03:57.450> be

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
my personal opinion I don't often be

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.710 
my personal opinion I don't often be
thrillers<00:03:58.440> anyway<00:03:59.959> but<00:04:00.959> this<00:04:01.470> one<00:04:01.739> wasn't

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
thrillers anyway but this one wasn't

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.479 
thrillers anyway but this one wasn't
thrilling<00:04:03.720> me<00:04:04.319> that<00:04:04.739> is<00:04:04.859> to<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.099> point<00:04:05.340> where

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
thrilling me that is to the point where

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.110 
thrilling me that is to the point where
I<00:04:05.519> would<00:04:05.700> give<00:04:06.000> it<00:04:06.150> four<00:04:06.450> stars<00:04:07.310> so<00:04:08.310> that's<00:04:08.849> all

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
I would give it four stars so that's all

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.530 
I would give it four stars so that's all
I<00:04:09.150> have<00:04:09.480> for<00:04:09.510> you<00:04:09.840> today<00:04:10.940> I'll<00:04:11.940> be<00:04:11.970> back<00:04:12.299> with
