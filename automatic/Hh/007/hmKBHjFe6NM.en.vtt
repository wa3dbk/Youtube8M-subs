00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.360
Second day at Gamescom and we are back on PES 2016 Preview

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.360
So we start with menus

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.280
Menus didn't change a lot actually

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.860
Drag and drop system if though more soft

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.720
and they operate tiny visual ajustments

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.260
like player's photos and more statistics,

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.320
A card system according to players and goalkeepers

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.240
And for strategy it's the same and you can manage your game plan

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.480
by form, abilities, or manually

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.540
Graphics

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.170
Graphics were improved in this gamescom code

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.970
It's not a revolution but a cool evolution

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.420
faces are even better,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.280
the grass is green even in winter configuration

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.600
lightning are quite good, the result is more convincing

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.840
Gameplay

00:00:52.337 --> 00:00:56.877
About gameplay, this year pass assistance changes

00:00:56.877 --> 00:01:00.597
It's not classic system anymore but a level system

00:01:00.597 --> 00:01:06.177
Level 1 is standard assist and level 2 and 3 helps the player to build his game

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.540
and level "No", ...no logic i don't why it's called "no" is the Full Manuel configuration

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.320
Full manuel configuration will be explained in part 2 of this video

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.700
but for the moment look at this gameplay fluidity

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.220
It's as good as Fifa Fluidity

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.320
Players move in a real (finally) 360 Â° configuration

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.200
the reactivity is impressive

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.920
and passes are easy but not too much

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.380
well PES 2016's Gameplay is really (really) good

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.520
Collision System

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.580
Another major improvement in PES 2016 is the collision system

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.340
For a start it's really good, contacts are convincing

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.360
as you can see with Pirlo and look at Pogba's feet trying to take the ball away

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.160
This is a real new feature which was missing in PES 2015

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.000
an other cool stuff, look at Totti chassing by Pirlo and Arturo Vidal,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.560
They never give up until they take the ball back

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.360
A.I

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.900
AI is a strong chapter in this preview

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.140
I'v decided to talk about it even if i never play against the computer in PES

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.760
But i'v decided to talk about (i prefere  human gameplay)

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:22.169
But look at this situation

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:23.738
Let's analyse it

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.640
I'v been able to orientate the game to the left wing

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.120
and quickly, you can see all three defensive lines with Matuidi, Schneiderlin and Sakho

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.700
All three defenders will follow the game action closely and nearly at the same time

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.020
Comparing with what i saw last year on PES 2015, there is a huge improvement

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.080
with defenders reaction, and even in the way the computer built his game

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.960
Computer has a better rythm, they dribble

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.780
They don't hesitate to attack the ball keeper

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.780
It's sometimes nearly as good as playing against a human player

00:02:55.867 --> 00:02:59.287
it's quite impressive at the beginning

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.480
to be honest it's more a huge improvement than a real revolution

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.980
but i wanted to say that because Konami did  a good job with computer's reactions in superstar level

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.100
Look again at Pogba sliding tackle

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.500
this for example i didn't see it coming

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.800
i didn't even try to dribble Paul Pogba

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.200
because i was suprised to see that behavior in PES

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.280
and now these kind of situations are part of the game

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.160
at least in Gamescom code which will surprise angry players i think

00:03:28.175 --> 00:03:31.335
Remember you last rage quit...

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.800
Hanzapad, Bandage of angry gamers

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.720
Hanzapad, Bandage of angry gamers

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.940
Hanzapad, Bandage of angry gamers

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.500
Hanzapad, Bandage of angry gamers

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.640
as you can see look at the movements in the goal area

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.960
It's quite hard to find your players because you will always face one, two or three players at the same time

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:17.580
The computer presses the ball keeper but in the good way, not too much, no cheating

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.480
and when you finally find a weakness, you will have to beat the goalkeeper

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:33.760
The  weak shot was not a real shot, i'v tried the L2+ O cheating combinaison and they fixed it

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.420
According to my 2 hours game situations, i think they really fixed it

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.860
and to  finish with A.I improvements, look at this situation where i try to play on the wings

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.880
Look at juventus players rushing back toward their goal to defend

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.100
you have a lot less liberty to play quietly your game

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.170
you don't have to keep too long the ball, not playing in ping pong pass

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.780
even in automatic mode, you will faces a real challenge to build your game and try to score goals

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.160
because sliding tackles are effective and collisions better take in consideration

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.900
and because the defenders are a lot more agressive

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.240
like in this situation with a good recuperation, i wasn't fast enough

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.740
and look at this moment with Chellini rushing toward me to close the angle for a back pass

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.840
It's one among a lot examples of the new gameplay situation

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.160
i can easily make 10 videos to talk about it

00:05:26.636 --> 00:05:32.076
and even with 10 videos, we wouldn't see all of the new situations in the game

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.140
A.I is more logic in it"s behavior, i tried again to play on the wings

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.260
One A.I player stays on me  while the other rush back to cover the left side

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.740
In PES 2015, the players would have defend on the ball keeper

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.780
which would have created an opening on the left side

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.543
Sincerly, just try the Demo on August the 13th

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.600
Make your own opinion on playing in Superstar level

00:05:53.084 --> 00:05:55.604
in my case i'v scored my first goal after three games

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.300
it's a good experience and a good point on PES 2016

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.080
Cameras

00:06:01.935 --> 00:06:03.935
About cameras, i will show you two of them

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.380
The first one, new on PES 2016, is the dynamic camera

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.280
which follow the action, it's really good idea with a better feeling in termes of immersion

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.160
and for the visibility of the game

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:17.754
The second one is the supporter view ( the poor one ^^)

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.920
I don't know how you can play in this configuration but

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.000
i've found it interesting for tactics,for your strategies

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.060
and see how your players react, especially in trainer mode

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.280
so for players which love tactics in football game you will be able evaluate the impact of your gameplan

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.580
Look at all the players following their opponents

00:06:38.261 --> 00:06:40.261
Well it's quite good (again) in this area

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.280
That will be all for this first part of PES 2016 Preview

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.420
We will be back on saturday for part 2 with improvements of the game

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:58.900
and full manual mode, during this time we leave you with this goalkeeper compilation which were interesting
