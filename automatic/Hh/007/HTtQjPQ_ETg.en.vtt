00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
why is the sheet of paper eight and a

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.799 
why is the sheet of paper eight and a
half<00:00:52.059> by<00:00:52.629> eleven<00:00:53.199> who<00:00:54.039> decided<00:00:54.460> on<00:00:54.789> that<00:00:54.969> why

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
half by eleven who decided on that why

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.559 
half by eleven who decided on that why
can't<00:00:56.140> it<00:00:56.199> be<00:00:56.260> four<00:00:56.679> by<00:00:56.949> four<00:00:57.280> so<00:00:58.239> that<00:00:58.269> this

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:58.569 
can't it be four by four so that this

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:00.899 
can't it be four by four so that this
lonely<00:00:59.140> paragraph<00:00:59.800> would<00:01:00.010> look<00:01:00.309> like<00:01:00.519> a<00:01:00.550> lot

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
lonely paragraph would look like a lot

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:03.809 
lonely paragraph would look like a lot
more<00:01:01.829> eventually<00:01:02.829> the<00:01:02.979> words<00:01:03.219> begin<00:01:03.699> to

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:03.819 
more eventually the words begin to

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:06.180 
more eventually the words begin to
trickle<00:01:04.089> into<00:01:04.390> a<00:01:04.510> stream<00:01:05.019> and<00:01:05.350> if<00:01:05.890> you<00:01:06.070> are

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190
