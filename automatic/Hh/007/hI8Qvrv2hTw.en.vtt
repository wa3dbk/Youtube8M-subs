a<00:03:50.820> lot<00:03:51.300> of<00:03:51.510> you<00:03:51.600> said<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.810> lot<00:03:52.020> a<00:03:52.320> very<00:03:52.830> high

a lot of you said a lot a very high
number<00:03:53.540> but<00:03:54.540> i<00:03:54.690> think<00:03:54.960> it's<00:03:55.110> bear<00:03:55.290> if<00:03:55.350> we<00:03:55.440> have

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
number but i think it's bear if we have

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.900 
number but i think it's bear if we have
smaller<00:03:55.860> episodes<00:03:56.280> so<00:03:56.400> you<00:03:56.490> can<00:03:56.610> get<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.820> hear

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
smaller episodes so you can get to hear

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.640 
smaller episodes so you can get to hear
