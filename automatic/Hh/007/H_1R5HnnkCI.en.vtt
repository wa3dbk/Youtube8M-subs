about<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.670> uniqueness<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.480> del<00:01:03.870> Norte<00:01:04.379> is

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
about the uniqueness of del Norte is

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.200 
about the uniqueness of del Norte is
campus<00:01:04.979> life<00:01:05.189> everything<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:05.970> constantly

campus life everything is constantly

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.130 
campus life everything is constantly
improving<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.750> think<00:01:06.900> that's<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> little

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
improving I think that's a little

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.580 
improving I think that's a little
different

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
different

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.899 
different
I<00:01:07.710> normal<00:01:08.220> schools<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.549> have<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> set

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
I normal schools that have a set

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.460 
I normal schools that have a set
tradition<00:01:09.360> because<00:01:09.840> they<00:01:09.930> kind<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.140> get<00:01:10.229> stuck

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
tradition because they kind of get stuck

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.410 
tradition because they kind of get stuck
in<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.680> certain<00:01:11.010> mindset<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.030> things<00:01:12.240> don't

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
in a certain mindset and things don't

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.760 
in a certain mindset and things don't
necessarily<00:01:12.510> improve<00:01:13.290> they<00:01:13.470> kind<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.650> just

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
necessarily improve they kind of just

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.469 
necessarily improve they kind of just
stay<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.010> same<00:01:14.189> right<00:01:14.820> now<00:01:14.970> all<00:01:15.180> we're<00:01:15.330> really

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
stay the same right now all we're really

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.670 
stay the same right now all we're really
doing<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.840> moving<00:01:15.960> forward<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.560> think

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
doing is moving forward so I think

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.070 
doing is moving forward so I think
that's<00:01:16.979> kind<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.700> biggest<00:01:17.909> thing<00:01:18.090> for<00:01:18.210> me

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
that's kind of the biggest thing for me

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.359 
that's kind of the biggest thing for me
