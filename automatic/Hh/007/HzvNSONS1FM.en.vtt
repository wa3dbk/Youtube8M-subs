00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.549
 today is going to be a make-up that all the 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.440
 emphasis is on the eyes and most 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.570
 of the time that we can and almost all the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.360
 ability to make eye makeup but in 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.099
 this case we wanted to give it as a way 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.110
 make up that will always be super 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.119
 quick and we call it pro makeup 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.450
 because it's a makeup you want to see 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.610
 profound professional provocative all 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.070
 this is own, so it's great 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.660
 because it's very very simple to do goes to 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.700
 get attention and it's not going to be a 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.489
 extreme if you want a makeup like 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.010
 too much but it's also a balance 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.810
 between a very nice makeup very easy 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.220
 but neither do the super 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.440
 natural but it goes well when you 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.090
 you want to see make-up but neither 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.250
 recharged that always what we try 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.320
 do because we remember that we want 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.270
 we also can transmit and 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.280
 highlight our natural beauty so 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.770
 these steps that we are going to do can 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.540
 apply varying the colors but they are 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.610
 very common to do with silver and 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.439
 black more than everything for the night if 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.060
 they want to go out to an album or something for the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.530
 style so if you want to learn to 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.250
 make this look with a look but 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.250
 keep looking 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:25.520
 but let's talk to him in metal 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:28.250
 black and let's create how to outline a 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.040
 patita in our outer part of the 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.480
 eye what I'm going to do is see more or 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.980
 less like I want to do what patita 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.650
 you can be better guided by your 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.650
 eyebrows and it's going to be a stroke 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.820
 and connect it with my eyelids 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.680
 and you do not find it easy to create this little foot 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.880
 with a gesture that can be very thick 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.590
 you can take it and with a pincelito 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.400
 review and you're going to take all the pigment 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.050
 that comes in your country there and they do the 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.220
 shape with the pincelito that you are going to 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.220
 be a little more step 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.459
 the people 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.470
 the most important thing here is that this is 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.939
 as if it were a cat outlined a b2 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.299
 then make a delicate little point 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:24.299
 with the other 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.420
 but for me 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.260
 and I want to compare that it looks more or 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.400
 less ever although to identical but that 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.400
 one down 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.420
 now take this do not forget to get in and 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.120
 it serves and then apply in this space 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.030
 What is left empty and what is going to do 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.400
 is to apply it and blur it like the other 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.590
 colour 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.390
 or make circular movements with life 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.390
 then to soften 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.680
 Now all the colors that are 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.450
 using the black and the silver and I'm going 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.430
 to start with the color black and I'm going to 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.129
 take it back with my pincelito and what's 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.140
 to do is to draw on me and my goals 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:29.019
 in black and what he's going to do with that is 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.849
 settle my shadows that a shadow that 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.980
 it is creams and with this it will last a little 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.889
 more from nokia gy and also make sure that 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.650
 the edges look a little bit more 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:40.269
 nice that is a little more professional 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.090
 so simply with the same 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:45.599
 I'm going to brush up to give them a little brush 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.599
 finish 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.230
 to return to its silver color and then 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.230
 apply where I have my goal six figures 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.550
 this one is much brighter so it's going to 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:15.130
 make that part even more prominent 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.420
 and if I do not blur it with 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.420
 circular movements 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.479
 super good if you do not want to recharge more 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.460
 tells us to do it can apply 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.990
 mask but also if this time 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.150
 you have a little more impact you can 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.509
 add your black eyeliner use the 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.699
 6 are many in black comet and it is 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:39.380
 used the little tip so do not take it out 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.210
 more tip because he wants to make a line 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.070
 thick any misfortune you do not want 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.919
 have it super sharp like that I was 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.570
 going on top of the eyelid 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.800
 and what I'm going to do this forget 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.930
 stick my eyelashes with it and 17 thick 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.080
 and to complete the champions also in 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.360
 the lower part we're totally going to 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.000
 align the whole eye by the part 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.740
 inside ok and trying to seat the 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.270
 lower part of black with more shadow 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.770
 black add a little bit of silver 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.389
 because by greeting it was not 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.340
 I really need to know so you can 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.900
 do this can add raised here 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.340
 You can add the whole lengths can 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.930
 vary a little the silver and for 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.669
 last r is a more expensive capital already 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.770
 use pole mania in black mania 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.340
 both the upper lashes as in 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.340
 the lower ones 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.710
 ready the eyes 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:40.770
 because it's great with this you can 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.779
 use it stronger or more clearly and 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.819
 apart from requesting benito we would like 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:46.259
 a hilux that is life that is super 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:48.360
 multi motion can be used to 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:50.550
 many minutes not only for this one 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.080
 but I want to apply doing so for 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.699
 let it be a bit clearer because 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.699
 true the eyes are quite strong 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:05.449
 I have finished this makeup I hope but 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.740
 no deep and professional look if 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:09.559
 wants product memories we use 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:13.210
 all of us who are working for the 

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:13.210
 model we use shadows 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.930
 in black comment the volume mask and I 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:22.490
 the laws the shadows their price hooks 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.979
 because I think it 's great for 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:29.770
 settle everything you did and also in 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:29.770
 lipstick we use the most seriously 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.690
 your look is definitely ready it's a 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.360
 look to use more at night not 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.980
 it's super eye-catching is not too 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.930
 makeup but it's not something like that either 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:46.650
 natural maybe I could use it to 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:51.419
 go to eat or for movies or theater but 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:53.610
 I do not think it was an efficient 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:55.289
 tell us if you refuse to use it to 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.009
 I think that's how they used it and see you 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:58.009
 the next video
