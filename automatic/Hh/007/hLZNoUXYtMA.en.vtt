00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 there are very good guys how are you waiting 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.180
 that they are very good I am kingson in a 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.639
 video more this time we're going to talk about not 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.380
 of the slaughter massacre suit of 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.030
 massacre but the red baron ok that I at 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.320
 It took me a lot of work to know that it was 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.940
 the massage the red ball and the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.380
 headhunter the headhunter the truth 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.020
 He has not spent time researching what 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.600
 well and I do not know if a video came up 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.010
 explaining the red ball but it was fake 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.400
 how I got it I was a game 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.730
 taking out the medal 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.470
 of aerial combat I think 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.760
 that the enemy has to be in the 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.430
 air and you in the air to get it den 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.500
 with just killing one they will give you the 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.660
 helmet that looks very bad on the lenses 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.860
 that they are very bad and the ex of the baron that 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.829
 it looks pretty good in fact it's the one that 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.390
 I'm wearing it and I've already taken two as 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.570
 I know how it works because it really is very 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.310
 good 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.079
 another thing that I was going to tell you since 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.720
 that came to them as I suggest for 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.500
 improve in 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.320
 in here then in advance warfare in the 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.989
 beautiful multiplayer, one thing 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.120
 that I suggest that they start from 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.830
 sheathed fast they will say but to 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.060
 who cares, well, if they are from 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.460
 those who pull the hip because there is no 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.480
 no problem but for example 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.920
 fucking 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.640
 but good that I am one of those people 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.110
 that point so well I recommend 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.910
 much more kill them since I 'm always 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.890
 in the air the second advice is that 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.510
 always be in the air why then 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.030
 because they are killing, let's say 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:33.460
 that we want to give to the center of 4 shit 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.460
 if it is too small at 6 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.020
 Y 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.530
 and since they are killing if they try to 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.689
 then make medals why then 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.880
 because how are they going to be killing in the 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.380
 air will give them many medals and for 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.220
 so they will receive more xp and a 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.320
 minimum receipt per item 15000 xp well 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.600
 which is not there is nothing that I 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.420
 have to worry since I'm almost an 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.100
 level each game but other advice that 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.640
 I was going to give you this 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.200
 if they play in the air one or the other day 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.790
 get to play on the land without using 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.830
 the nexus and they will see how good they are because 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.720
 Yes, with instability, they can 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.280
 shoot them and kill them all now 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.870
 imagine how good they would be with this 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.700
 Sardon's success hits and as a 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.800
 nothing else movement that would be the enemy 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.630
 and you are at rest as well 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.310
 call it and well that would be all 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.140
 guys I just wanted to tell you how 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.150
 take out the red ball now I'm going to 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.100
 investigate yourself as stakes the case is 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.900
 slow but really do not even know 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.230
 where to start since I always take it out 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.480
 of pure luck and it's good to wait 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.850
 I hope wait, wait, wait 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.250
 see how it looks 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:47.210
 and I think that I had it here is good 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.130
 there's sex and it's all I think I put in the 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.840
 children's helmet glasses because it grows a lot 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.840
 we see the next video bye bye
