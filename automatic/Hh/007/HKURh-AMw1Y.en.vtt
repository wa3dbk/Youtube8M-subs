00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.610
 hello I'm yannick robert so I 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.200
 welcome to this master 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.369
 class it's going to be devoted to 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.660
 finger accompaniment mainly 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.480
 on different types of pulsations 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.990
 different groups we will focus on 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.970
 stop 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.380
 especially about doing groove is 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.400
 what are we going to play so to do something 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.289
 balancing thing that advances all this 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.020
 with mainly the addition of small 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.690
 percussion you produce by hand 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.769
 right 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.660
 so it's that the guitar is a 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.190
 polyphonic instrument and allows 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.719
 produce bases and a laugh of 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.850
 chords to play melodies obviously 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.920
 but it also makes it possible to produce 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.390
 percussion by tapping the strings into 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.219
 tapping two innings to the right on the left 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.610
 so we will work that very 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.960
 progressively element by element and 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.370
 we will try to work on that 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.370
 different types of pulsations 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.790
 and 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.080
 and 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.590
 then you will see for yourself at the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.420
 following this work and after having 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.360
 worked some time I think 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.500
 you'll know how to play 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.159
 instinctive way of small 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.170
 percussion 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.060
 you will know how the rank masters 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.780
 all types of accompaniment you 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.869
 can be done eventually be jazz 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.549
 swatch apple - have funk together 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.530
 also we may see more at this 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:45.810
 Latin music bug and bossa nova 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.190
 then for each of the styles we will do 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.330
 the following serious things ready raspberry ready 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.130
 between 8 and 10 exercises to work 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.850
 quite a short exercise since you have to see 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.040
 between one and four measurements will require 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.049
 go to work like this without any 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.090
 support then do them with a 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.350
 metronome for some of them 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.450
 do them with a rhythm pad 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.740
 who turns behind rap make to 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.420
 listen to the drums it's not 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.940
 important that plays music with a 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.670
 group for example and reproduce so 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.080
 it's rhythmic pattern with the drums 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.280
 behind 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.690
 you will also see once you 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.330
 will have work and most of these 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.750
 rhythmic pattern you risk them 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.910
 meet 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.810
 very often in a lot of pieces 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.810
 you will work after 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.040
 or 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.240
 d 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.269
 in addition to the exercises we have 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.459
 worked so there will be some 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.569
 pieces at the end of a meter put in 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.950
 in application a little bit all these 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.080
 techniques them 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.660
 among these pieces there will be a piece 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.819
 of mechanical pulp called james and 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.739
 of a very nice piece Latin dances a 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.290
 little bit hard a piece of stevie 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.130

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.580
 there will be a piece of sting also 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.330
 I like the bangers visitors 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.280

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.290

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.450
