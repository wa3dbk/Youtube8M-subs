project I like how it started I remember

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.310 
project I like how it started I remember
it<00:00:10.130> starts<00:00:10.460> in<00:00:10.640> a<00:00:10.700> very<00:00:10.880> mythic<00:00:11.360> way<00:00:11.570> in<00:00:11.870> it<00:00:12.020> and

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
it starts in a very mythic way in it and

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.720 
it starts in a very mythic way in it and
it<00:00:12.410> ends<00:00:12.650> up<00:00:13.269> mythic<00:00:14.269> and<00:00:14.450> and<00:00:15.200> and<00:00:15.800> I<00:00:16.340> remember

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
it ends up mythic and and and I remember

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.489 
it ends up mythic and and and I remember
reading<00:00:16.970> it<00:00:17.300> thinking<00:00:17.660> it<00:00:17.779> kind<00:00:18.109> of<00:00:18.169> put<00:00:18.470> the

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:18.499 
reading it thinking it kind of put the

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:20.230 
reading it thinking it kind of put the
hair<00:00:18.769> up<00:00:18.890> on<00:00:19.039> the<00:00:19.130> back<00:00:19.310> of<00:00:19.339> my<00:00:19.550> neck<00:00:19.640> made<00:00:20.089> my

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
hair up on the back of my neck made my

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.089 
hair up on the back of my neck made my
face<00:00:20.509> kind<00:00:20.839> of<00:00:20.900> tangle<00:00:21.320> and<00:00:21.409> I<00:00:21.499> thought<00:00:21.710> that's

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099 
face kind of tangle and I thought that's

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.870 
face kind of tangle and I thought that's
what<00:00:22.310> movies<00:00:22.640> are<00:00:23.320> can<00:00:24.320> do<00:00:24.579> they<00:00:25.579> don't<00:00:25.789> always

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
what movies are can do they don't always

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.729 
what movies are can do they don't always
do<00:00:26.179> it<00:00:26.269> but<00:00:26.419> they<00:00:26.509> can<00:00:26.749> do<00:00:26.989> it<00:00:27.109> in<00:00:27.259> it<00:00:27.409> in<00:00:27.619> this

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:27.739 
do it but they can do it in it in this

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.439 
do it but they can do it in it in this
instance<00:00:28.130> when<00:00:28.279> I<00:00:28.310> read<00:00:28.579> that<00:00:28.609> I<00:00:28.759> thought<00:00:28.849> this

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
instance when I read that I thought this

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.779 
instance when I read that I thought this
movie<00:00:29.659> could<00:00:29.929> do<00:00:30.109> that<00:00:30.319> and<00:00:30.560> so<00:00:30.710> I<00:00:30.739> I<00:00:31.460> believe

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
movie could do that and so I I believe

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.450 
movie could do that and so I I believe
in<00:00:31.939> that<00:00:32.060> emotion<00:00:32.930> of<00:00:33.140> your<00:00:33.380> face<00:00:33.740> tingling<00:00:34.310> I

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
in that emotion of your face tingling I

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.060 
in that emotion of your face tingling I
went<00:00:34.760> into<00:00:34.880> the<00:00:35.180> film<00:00:35.650> expecting<00:00:36.650> you<00:00:36.950> know<00:00:37.040> a

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
fundamental but this was set against a

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.510 
fundamental but this was set against a
you<00:00:58.490> know<00:00:58.610> a<00:00:58.640> big<00:00:58.940> canvas<00:00:59.450> of<00:01:00.010> action<00:01:01.010> of<00:01:01.160> water

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
and a machine and that can make for

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.390 
and a machine and that can make for
exciting<00:01:04.820> movie<00:01:05.570> making<00:01:05.810> but<00:01:06.500> if<00:01:06.710> you<00:01:06.860> lose<00:01:07.070> if

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
that was pretty noble especially in a

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.550 
that was pretty noble especially in a
day<00:02:29.600> where<00:02:29.780> you<00:02:29.870> can't<00:02:30.080> watch<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.350> football

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
day where you can't watch a football

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.559 
day where you can't watch a football
game<00:02:30.739> without<00:02:31.069> seeing<00:02:31.610> some<00:02:31.760> guys<00:02:31.970> stand<00:02:32.390> over

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
game without seeing some guys stand over

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.809 
game without seeing some guys stand over
the<00:02:33.260> guy<00:02:33.410> he<00:02:33.530> just<00:02:33.560> tackled<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.400> then<00:02:34.519> have<00:02:34.700> to

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
the guy he just tackled and then have to

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.610 
the guy he just tackled and then have to
tell<00:02:35.060> him<00:02:35.269> about<00:02:35.420> how<00:02:35.690> he<00:02:35.720> just<00:02:36.049> tackled<00:02:36.530> him
