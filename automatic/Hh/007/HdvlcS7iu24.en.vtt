00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:04.149
 between the lines of endorsement to california from a meeting with josé luis de 

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:08.029
 white and that country the beauty and the knowledge of the subject very important since sometimes 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.500
 We take what you need is something that we are here there are many and very angry not ce 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.500
 we know what amounts there are and to be here our stylist friend who 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.269
 such an end was made to the coast 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:23.349
 arcati that for example for women of hair the very aseptic cidh 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.409
 alderman commented good for that kind of hair percent already recommended to create 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:30.720
 a little more degrafilado senna the area of ​​the front 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.150
 there is little more internal texture 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.750
 and work a little more complex 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.070
 something that we should not do when we are doing this team and in 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.969
 this type of styles is also 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.250
 of the team of russo decade real people 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.090
 and depending on this is what we are going to ask the stylist 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.230
 one of the mistakes that we make quite ban that we commit the tennis players 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.479
 including clients 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:56.159
 is that when the client is working for example that in a 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:57.260
 very square face 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.970
 asks what was in a project very especially as the marker 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.690
 and that makes the face look much bigger 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.240
 I recommend if you have that kind of face so you can work a little more 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.740
 This precocious diagonal or long asymmetric this makes it cost your face 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.850
 get a little longer and look more stylized no and stop and work it 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.170
 for example if your hair is too heavy to create percent always let's say 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.170
 some media texture we aim 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.290
 will not ask sometimes we make the mistake of applying d for example to very texture 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.560
 inside and what he does is that at the moment he is very father but not when 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.680
 begins to grow the hair starts sponge a long time ago 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.840
 It is not ashes what they fix you asking you to have returned for saenz 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.720
 actually if the claim is perfect and left me 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.030
 now the case of the east 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.590
 there must be yes no 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.300
 this what options we have that does not think in this case is on the contrary we clean 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.350
 that the curly hair was spreads 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.630
 First, ask the stylist to create 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.719
 percent a cut 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:07.359
 that quique peso we are going to say creating layers but removing the weight of above 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:12.660
 asia towards the tips creating that kind of shape that makes the hair 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:17.680
 who of stripping shop weights also the artists between taking out but 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.650
 also molds the growth to the tips and not work more than media 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.969
 at points this causes the volume to decrease 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:29.479
 I do not recommend very short fringes here is he who the opposite is not 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:35.069
 those very short fringes what they do is that they expose too much the hair i poses 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.539
 I know what sessegnon appears very very very big 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:40.479
 I also recommend is 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:44.339
 we have also created very short layers remember that curly hair 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:48.529
 when it is cut it stretches but when it is drying it comes back and be happy 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:54.259
 against the longer non-layers and especially with a lot of media texture to 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:56.269
 tips that what I would recommend 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.939
 very well topics we have also seen different advanced techniques 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.680
 the dry hair cut is recommended to be of your hair good look everything is 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.270
 a complement to cut with a razor to cut the hair wet and dry 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.100
 it is always there what you should say 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.379
 the wet hair what we do is that we see a way 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:20.499
 and when the hair is already dry you give the final texture there what makes one the 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:25.889
 stylist is to eliminate weight give it greater form but mainly because unemployment and 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.170
 we are looking at it dry 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.130
 p work in a way for the client when he is at home 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.430
 so it's much easier not but there are many techniques to hippie working 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.000
 with thinning scissors working with large razor the tips another 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.930
 going down with scissors and creating texture between the hair that is to say efe thinking 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.770
 that this is the hair while killing more texture read these stretches streets 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.600
 shorter longer and that to the end effect time vaivenes of the east 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.010
 uce that it must be for having 40 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.370
 europe can be in conduct and in the health quarters yes there are many doubts 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.760
 can communicate to the phone that appears on the screen of josé luis r 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:06.809
 we express the study
