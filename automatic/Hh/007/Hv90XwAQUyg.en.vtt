imagine<00:00:04.930> you<00:00:05.050> step<00:00:05.680> in<00:00:05.800> an<00:00:05.890> elevator<00:00:06.310> and

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:06.520 
imagine you step in an elevator and

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.730 
imagine you step in an elevator and
someone<00:00:06.820> asks<00:00:07.180> what's<00:00:07.870> up<00:00:08.050> with<00:00:08.259> human

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:08.740 
someone asks what's up with human

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.709 
someone asks what's up with human
activity<00:00:09.339> and<00:00:09.370> global<00:00:09.820> warming<00:00:12.089> well<00:00:13.089> the

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:13.719 
activity and global warming well the

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:15.329 
activity and global warming well the
first<00:00:13.959> thing<00:00:14.110> about<00:00:14.169> climate<00:00:14.709> warming<00:00:15.009> is

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:15.339 
first thing about climate warming is

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:17.610 
first thing about climate warming is
that<00:00:15.579> the<00:00:15.999> physical<00:00:16.539> basis<00:00:16.930> we've<00:00:17.170> known<00:00:17.440> it

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:17.620 
that the physical basis we've known it

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.760 
that the physical basis we've known it
for<00:00:17.890> centuries<00:00:18.190> this<00:00:18.700> is<00:00:18.910> nothing<00:00:19.390> new<00:00:19.600> in<00:00:19.960> the

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
for centuries this is nothing new in the

on<00:00:45.160> biodiversity<00:00:45.550> which<00:00:46.120> in<00:00:46.420> my<00:00:46.570> opinion<00:00:46.720> has

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
on biodiversity which in my opinion has

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.630 
on biodiversity which in my opinion has
been<00:00:47.050> bigger<00:00:47.410> than<00:00:47.649> sea<00:00:47.890> level<00:00:47.920> rise<00:00:48.310> right

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
been bigger than sea level rise right

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.060 
been bigger than sea level rise right
there<00:00:48.910> the<00:00:49.450> decay<00:00:49.750> of<00:00:49.899> species<00:00:50.380> in<00:00:50.770> the<00:00:50.950> end

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
there the decay of species in the end

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.310 
there the decay of species in the end
what<00:00:51.880> we're<00:00:52.090> saying<00:00:52.300> what<00:00:52.809> most<00:00:53.110> of<00:00:53.230> the

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
what we're saying what most of the

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.750 
what we're saying what most of the
science<00:00:53.620> is<00:00:53.739> saying<00:00:53.980> is<00:00:54.190> this<00:00:54.370> changing

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
science is saying is this changing

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.780 
science is saying is this changing
occurring<00:00:55.300> very<00:00:55.480> fast<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:57.010> on<00:00:57.130> a<00:00:57.190> very<00:00:57.489> fast

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
occurring very fast we on a very fast

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.060 
occurring very fast we on a very fast
train<00:00:58.030> heading<00:00:58.480> for<00:00:58.690> the<00:00:58.780> wall<00:00:59.020> and<00:00:59.410> that's

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
train heading for the wall and that's

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.330 
train heading for the wall and that's
not<00:01:00.280> good<00:01:00.579> so<00:01:00.820> we<00:01:01.600> have<00:01:01.809> to<00:01:01.930> change<00:01:02.260> we<00:01:03.100> have<00:01:03.130> to

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
not good so we have to change we have to

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.880 
not good so we have to change we have to
change<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.760> way<00:01:03.850> we<00:01:04.030> live<00:01:04.210> and<00:01:04.629> I<00:01:05.470> often<00:01:05.740> say

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
change the way we live and I often say

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.180 
change the way we live and I often say
it's<00:01:06.580> it's<00:01:07.180> common<00:01:07.540> sense<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:08.830> didn't<00:01:09.040> leave

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
it's it's common sense we didn't leave

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.219 
it's it's common sense we didn't leave
the<00:01:09.460> Stone<00:01:09.700> Age<00:01:09.729> because<00:01:10.090> we<00:01:10.420> we<00:01:10.870> ran<00:01:11.049> out<00:01:11.200> of

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
the Stone Age because we we ran out of

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.440 
the Stone Age because we we ran out of
stone<00:01:11.590> we<00:01:11.979> have<00:01:12.100> we<00:01:12.280> have<00:01:12.370> to<00:01:12.520> leave<00:01:12.909> the<00:01:13.270> oil

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
stone we have we have to leave the oil

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.320 
stone we have we have to leave the oil
age<00:01:13.810> because<00:01:14.770> all<00:01:14.950> burning<00:01:15.430> all<00:01:15.700> is<00:01:15.880> not<00:01:16.119> good

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
age because all burning all is not good

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.320 
age because all burning all is not good
for<00:01:16.510> the<00:01:16.600> climate<00:01:16.930> it's<00:01:17.049> not<00:01:17.200> good<00:01:17.409> for<00:01:17.440> us<00:01:18.330> but

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
for the climate it's not good for us but

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.990 
for the climate it's not good for us but
it's<00:01:19.479> a<00:01:19.659> huge<00:01:19.990> shift<00:01:20.500> in<00:01:20.770> our<00:01:21.070> society<00:01:21.700> it's

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
it's a huge shift in our society it's

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.280 
it's a huge shift in our society it's
it's<00:01:22.600> a<00:01:22.750> use<00:01:22.960> shift<00:01:23.260> in<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.500> way<00:01:23.590> we<00:01:23.619> live<00:01:25.290> it's

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
it's a use shift in the way we live it's

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.899 
it's a use shift in the way we live it's
not<00:01:26.530> going<00:01:26.710> to<00:01:26.770> take<00:01:26.920> a<00:01:26.950> few<00:01:27.190> scientists<00:01:27.640> to

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
not going to take a few scientists to

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.550 
not going to take a few scientists to
raising<00:01:28.299> the<00:01:28.390> red<00:01:28.510> flag<00:01:28.750> to<00:01:29.049> make<00:01:29.200> this<00:01:29.320> happen

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
raising the red flag to make this happen

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.910 
raising the red flag to make this happen
it<00:01:29.830> has<00:01:29.950> to<00:01:30.100> be<00:01:30.250> a<00:01:31.090> big<00:01:31.450> social<00:01:32.080> movement<00:01:32.740> where

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
it has to be a big social movement where

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.850 
it has to be a big social movement where
everybody<00:01:33.280> says<00:01:33.549> hey<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:35.170> want<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.439> stop<00:01:35.680> this

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
everybody says hey we want to stop this

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.120 
everybody says hey we want to stop this
and<00:01:36.720> my<00:01:37.720> only<00:01:37.990> hope<00:01:38.140> right<00:01:38.409> now<00:01:38.470> that<00:01:38.920> this<00:01:39.070> is

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
and my only hope right now that this is

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.160 
and my only hope right now that this is
gonna<00:01:39.369> happen<00:01:39.460> is<00:01:39.909> the<00:01:40.150> new<00:01:40.390> generation<00:01:40.990> the

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
gonna happen is the new generation the

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.179 
gonna happen is the new generation the
young<00:01:41.860> people<00:01:42.189> from<00:01:42.430> twenty<00:01:42.880> to<00:01:43.030> thirty

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
young people from twenty to thirty

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.469 
young people from twenty to thirty
because<00:01:45.189> I<00:01:45.549> think<00:01:45.610> they're<00:01:45.880> more<00:01:45.909> sensitive

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
because I think they're more sensitive

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.090 
because I think they're more sensitive
to<00:01:46.659> this<00:01:47.549> they<00:01:48.549> don't<00:01:48.759> want<00:01:48.970> this<00:01:49.570> kind<00:01:49.810> of

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
to this they don't want this kind of

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.429 
to this they don't want this kind of
world<00:01:51.100> down<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.670> line<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:52.229> they<00:01:53.229> probably

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
world down the line and they probably

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.170 
world down the line and they probably
are<00:01:53.650> the<00:01:53.770> first<00:01:53.979> generation<00:01:54.490> we<00:01:54.640> can<00:01:54.820> actually

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
are the first generation we can actually

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.749 
are the first generation we can actually
change<00:01:55.689> it<00:01:55.869> we<00:01:56.710> have<00:01:56.829> the<00:01:56.950> power<00:01:57.159> to<00:01:57.369> change<00:01:57.549> it

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759
