Kings urban assault from matchbox this

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.519 
Kings urban assault from matchbox this
is<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.930> first<00:00:19.970> matchbox<00:00:20.970> toy<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.170> have

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
is the first matchbox toy that I have

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.189 
is the first matchbox toy that I have
ever<00:00:22.740> purchased<00:00:23.330> to<00:00:24.330> say<00:00:24.600> which<00:00:24.869> one<00:00:25.080> is

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
ever purchased to say which one is

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.279 
ever purchased to say which one is
better<00:00:25.410> matchbox<00:00:26.010> or<00:00:26.340> Hot<00:00:26.760> Wheels<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.390> kind<00:00:27.930> of

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
better matchbox or Hot Wheels is kind of

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.800 
better matchbox or Hot Wheels is kind of
ridiculous<00:00:28.529> because<00:00:29.510> you<00:00:30.510> know<00:00:30.630> they're

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
ridiculous because you know they're

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.940 
ridiculous because you know they're
owned<00:00:31.050> by<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.470> same<00:00:31.710> company<00:00:33.590> matchbox<00:00:34.590> seems

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
owned by the same company matchbox seems

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.600 
owned by the same company matchbox seems
to<00:00:35.130> be<00:00:36.140> the<00:00:37.140> cars<00:00:37.530> are<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> little<00:00:38.129> bit<00:00:38.370> more

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
to be the cars are a little bit more

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.780 
to be the cars are a little bit more
like<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:40.020> realistic<00:00:40.649> side<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.219> Hot

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
like on the realistic side and Hot

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.670 
like on the realistic side and Hot
Wheels<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> little<00:00:42.809> bit<00:00:42.960> more<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
Wheels is a little bit more on the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.680 
Wheels is a little bit more on the
fantasy<00:00:44.070> side<00:00:44.520> although<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.210> know<00:00:45.450> there's

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
fantasy side although you know there's

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.920 
fantasy side although you know there's
exceptions<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.410> both<00:00:47.210> this<00:00:48.210> review<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.690> not

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
exceptions to both this review is not

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.720 
exceptions to both this review is not
going<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.110> be<00:00:49.260> necessarily<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.890> very<00:00:50.129> serious

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
going to be necessarily a very serious

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.880 
going to be necessarily a very serious
review<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:51.840> not<00:00:51.989> like<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.320> really<00:00:52.590> need<00:00:52.770> to

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
review so it's not like I really need to

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.400 
review so it's not like I really need to
take<00:00:53.070> time<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.460> examine<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.210> toy<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.809> look

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
take time and examine the toy and look

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.319 
take time and examine the toy and look
for<00:00:55.680> important<00:00:56.250> details<00:00:56.430> or<00:00:56.969> anything<00:00:57.059> like

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
for important details or anything like

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.479 
for important details or anything like
that<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.930> doubt<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.739> anyone<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.219> really

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
that I doubt that anyone is really

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.389 
that I doubt that anyone is really
looking<00:00:59.670> for<00:01:00.030> those<00:01:00.180> kinds<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.480> details<00:01:00.660> on

entire<00:01:16.530> said<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.250> urban<00:01:17.610> assault<00:01:17.880> said<00:01:18.210> was

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
entire said this urban assault said was

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.410 
entire said this urban assault said was
it<00:01:19.080> was<00:01:19.200> about<00:01:19.409> five<00:01:19.680> dollars<00:01:19.979> okay<00:01:20.759> which<00:01:21.270> is

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
it was about five dollars okay which is

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.170 
it was about five dollars okay which is
kind<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.750> difficult<00:01:21.960> for<00:01:22.590> me<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:23.009> justify<00:01:23.670> I

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
kind of difficult for me to justify I

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.510 
kind of difficult for me to justify I
think<00:01:24.750> that's<00:01:24.900> kind<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.530> expensive<00:01:25.830> because

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
think that's kind of expensive because

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.330 
think that's kind of expensive because
each<00:01:27.360> vehicle<00:01:28.200> pretty<00:01:28.590> much<00:01:28.770> like<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> Hot

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
each vehicle pretty much like a Hot

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.550 
each vehicle pretty much like a Hot
Wheels<00:01:29.549> type<00:01:29.820> car<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.600> costs<00:01:30.990> about<00:01:31.079> let's<00:01:31.439> say

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
Wheels type car it costs about let's say

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.460 
Wheels type car it costs about let's say
about<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.920> dollar<00:01:32.280> right<00:01:32.850> per<00:01:33.420> vehicle<00:01:33.869> there's

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
about a dollar right per vehicle there's

two here's one and two so that's what
two<00:01:37.979> dollars<00:01:38.400> right<00:01:38.610> there<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.060> that's<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
two dollars right there and that's the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.719 
two dollars right there and that's the
main<00:01:39.869> attraction<00:01:40.049> here<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.040> vehicles<00:01:41.520> and

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
the vehicles are okay so let's say that

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.300 
the vehicles are okay so let's say that

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
comes out to two dollars then what this

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.460 
comes out to two dollars then what this
tent<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.909> thing<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.360> dollar<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.049> then

the<00:01:53.369> people<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:54.000> leftover<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.689> another

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
the people the leftover is another

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.010 
the people the leftover is another
dollar<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:56.009> can't<00:01:56.579> really<00:01:56.700> justify<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.600> you

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
dollar I I can't really justify that you

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.620 
dollar I I can't really justify that you
know<00:01:58.140> how<00:01:58.469> good<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.850> whole<00:02:00.119> thing<00:02:00.360> costs

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
know how good this whole thing costs

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.209 
know how good this whole thing costs
five<00:02:00.960> dollars<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:01.770> doesn't<00:02:02.070> make<00:02:02.159> any

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
five dollars it just doesn't make any

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.050 
five dollars it just doesn't make any
sense<00:02:02.780> but<00:02:03.860> so<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.890> do<00:02:05.009> think<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.490> expensive

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
sense but so I do think it is expensive

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.180 
sense but so I do think it is expensive
but<00:02:06.420> alright<00:02:06.930> I'm<00:02:07.170> going<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.409> open<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.740> up<00:02:07.860> okay

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
I've opened the package the first thing

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.740 
I've opened the package the first thing
that<00:02:30.739> I<00:02:30.890> noticed<00:02:30.950> is<00:02:31.489> these<00:02:31.760> little<00:02:32.150> soldiers

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750

that I noticed is these little soldiers
here<00:02:33.019> these<00:02:33.200> guys<00:02:33.439> are<00:02:33.590> supposed<00:02:33.739> to<00:02:33.890> be

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
here these guys are supposed to be

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.750 
here these guys are supposed to be
special<00:02:34.519> forces<00:02:34.849> there's<00:02:35.689> three<00:02:36.140> of<00:02:36.170> them<00:02:36.290> and

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
special forces there's three of them and

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.190 
special forces there's three of them and
they're<00:02:37.760> actually<00:02:38.329> the<00:02:38.569> plastic<00:02:39.049> that

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
they're actually the plastic that

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.649 
they're actually the plastic that
they've<00:02:39.379> made<00:02:39.650> their<00:02:40.280> they're<00:02:40.609> squishy<00:02:41.120> so

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
they've made their they're squishy so

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:43.869 
they've made their they're squishy so
they're<00:02:42.170> actually<00:02:42.560> soft<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.549> this<00:02:43.639> was<00:02:43.849> a

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
they're actually soft and and this was a

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.660 
they're actually soft and and this was a
surprise<00:02:44.150> I<00:02:44.720> didn't<00:02:45.170> expect<00:02:45.500> them<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:45.859> be<00:02:46.010> you

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
surprise I didn't expect them to be you

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.089 
surprise I didn't expect them to be you
know<00:02:46.819> so<00:02:47.060> squishy<00:02:47.480> like<00:02:47.810> that<00:02:48.079> so<00:02:48.590> that's<00:02:48.709> that

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
know so squishy like that so that's that

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.629 
know so squishy like that so that's that
was<00:02:49.250> crazy<00:02:50.349> okay<00:02:51.349> so<00:02:51.739> i'll<00:02:51.859> throw<00:02:52.040> those<00:02:52.430> guys

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:52.639 
was crazy okay so i'll throw those guys

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.509 
was crazy okay so i'll throw those guys
decide<00:02:53.000> they<00:02:53.299> give<00:02:53.690> us<00:02:53.930> two<00:02:54.349> missiles<00:02:54.889> right

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
decide they give us two missiles right

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.690 
decide they give us two missiles right
in<00:02:55.989> two<00:02:56.989> different<00:02:57.200> colors<00:02:57.769> for<00:02:57.799> some<00:02:58.280> reason

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
in two different colors for some reason

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.490 
in two different colors for some reason
which<00:02:59.060> is<00:02:59.299> you<00:02:59.750> know<00:02:59.780> actually<00:03:00.079> perhaps

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
which is you know actually perhaps

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.220 
which is you know actually perhaps
clever<00:03:01.129> maybe<00:03:01.849> the<00:03:02.090> red<00:03:02.299> one<00:03:02.510> does<00:03:03.200> more

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
clever maybe the red one does more

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.699 
clever maybe the red one does more
damage<00:03:03.470> you<00:03:04.340> know<00:03:04.489> so<00:03:04.790> that's<00:03:05.709> actually

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
damage you know so that's actually

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.740 
damage you know so that's actually
better<00:03:06.889> than<00:03:07.010> just<00:03:07.340> having<00:03:07.760> him<00:03:08.000> in<00:03:08.030> one<00:03:08.510> color

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
better than just having him in one color

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.190 
better than just having him in one color
and<00:03:09.019> so<00:03:10.010> maybe<00:03:10.220> get<00:03:10.430> more<00:03:10.579> points<00:03:10.819> if<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.569> the

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
and so maybe get more points if you the

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.869 
and so maybe get more points if you the
whole<00:03:12.349> premise<00:03:12.620> is<00:03:13.010> you're<00:03:13.370> supposed<00:03:13.700> to

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
whole premise is you're supposed to

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.619 
whole premise is you're supposed to
shoot<00:03:14.750> this<00:03:14.959> cannon<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:16.329> you<00:03:17.329> know<00:03:17.449> the

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
shoot this cannon and you know the

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.390 
shoot this cannon and you know the
missile<00:03:18.169> flies<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:18.769> your<00:03:18.859> suppose<00:03:19.069> they<00:03:19.190> hit

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
missile flies and your suppose they hit

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.369 
missile flies and your suppose they hit
this<00:03:19.609> thing<00:03:19.669> and<00:03:20.150> you're<00:03:20.780> supposed<00:03:20.989> to<00:03:21.139> hit<00:03:21.230> it

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 
this thing and you're supposed to hit it

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.140 
this thing and you're supposed to hit it
hard<00:03:21.590> enough<00:03:21.680> that<00:03:22.010> you<00:03:22.340> know<00:03:22.459> it<00:03:22.579> caves<00:03:22.910> in

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
hard enough that you know it caves in

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.879 
hard enough that you know it caves in
and<00:03:23.449> it<00:03:23.569> you<00:03:23.810> know<00:03:23.900> it<00:03:23.989> breaks<00:03:24.199> it<00:03:24.500> doesn't

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
and it you know it breaks it doesn't

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.740 
and it you know it breaks it doesn't
really<00:03:25.129> break<00:03:25.549> apart<00:03:25.910> but<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:26.239> does<00:03:26.389> like<00:03:26.569> this

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
really break apart but it does like this

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.990 
really break apart but it does like this
kind<00:03:26.959> of<00:03:27.019> action<00:03:27.230> right<00:03:27.620> there<00:03:27.650> so<00:03:28.459> if<00:03:28.669> you<00:03:28.849> do

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
kind of action right there so if you do

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.270 
kind of action right there so if you do
it<00:03:29.150> like<00:03:29.239> that<00:03:29.299> then<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:30.079> guess<00:03:30.530> bullseye<00:03:31.069> or

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
it like that then I guess bullseye or

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.470 
it like that then I guess bullseye or
something<00:03:31.669> and<00:03:31.790> let's<00:03:31.940> say<00:03:32.090> if<00:03:32.150> you<00:03:32.239> hit<00:03:32.389> it

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
something and let's say if you hit it

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.509 
something and let's say if you hit it
with<00:03:32.510> a<00:03:32.629> red<00:03:32.870> you<00:03:33.019> get<00:03:33.169> more<00:03:33.349> points<00:03:33.620> whatever

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
with a red you get more points whatever

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.610 
with a red you get more points whatever
you<00:03:35.150> know<00:03:35.269> so<00:03:35.419> that's<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.780> whole<00:03:35.930> premise<00:03:36.169> not

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
you know so that's the whole premise not

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.890 
you know so that's the whole premise not
not<00:03:36.919> that<00:03:37.129> great<00:03:37.400> I<00:03:37.669> know<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:38.319> this<00:03:39.319> this

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
not that great I know and this this

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.500 
not that great I know and this this
target<00:03:41.900> thing<00:03:42.139> is<00:03:42.699> pretty<00:03:45.699> not<00:03:46.699> all<00:03:46.909> that<00:03:47.120> you

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
target thing is pretty not all that you

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.569 
target thing is pretty not all that you
know<00:03:47.659> I<00:03:47.690> guess<00:03:48.019> it's<00:03:48.199> not<00:03:48.349> super<00:03:48.949> bad<00:03:49.159> but<00:03:49.459> it's

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
know I guess it's not super bad but it's

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.339 
know I guess it's not super bad but it's
not<00:03:49.639> that<00:03:49.940> great<00:03:49.970> either<00:03:50.389> look<00:03:50.870> a<00:03:50.959> look<00:03:51.139> at<00:03:51.260> the

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
not that great either look a look at the

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.830 
not that great either look a look at the
back<00:03:51.560> here<00:03:51.919> and<00:03:52.099> I<00:03:52.819> guess<00:03:53.030> it<00:03:53.239> you<00:03:53.419> can<00:03:53.599> house

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
back here and I guess it you can house

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.110 
back here and I guess it you can house
the<00:03:54.109> guys<00:03:54.319> in<00:03:54.590> there<00:03:54.829> but<00:03:55.489> other<00:03:55.790> than<00:03:56.060> that

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
the guys in there but other than that

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.170 
the guys in there but other than that
and<00:03:56.720> this<00:03:57.290> whole<00:03:57.590> feature<00:03:57.919> I<00:03:58.370> mean<00:03:58.699> nothing

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
and this whole feature I mean nothing

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.259 
and this whole feature I mean nothing
falls<00:03:59.449> apart<00:03:59.900> but<00:04:00.430> you<00:04:01.430> know<00:04:01.579> it's<00:04:01.790> it's<00:04:02.030> just

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
falls apart but you know it's it's just

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.629 
falls apart but you know it's it's just
one<00:04:02.419> of<00:04:02.449> those<00:04:02.569> it's<00:04:03.260> just<00:04:03.530> a<00:04:03.650> target<00:04:04.159> really

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
one of those it's just a target really

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:08.589 
one of those it's just a target really
and<00:04:05.260> yeah<00:04:06.260> it's<00:04:06.470> it's<00:04:06.829> not<00:04:07.010> that<00:04:07.190> great<00:04:07.599> okay

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
and yeah it's it's not that great okay

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.599 
and yeah it's it's not that great okay
so<00:04:08.659> this<00:04:08.900> is<00:04:09.079> the<00:04:09.199> truck<00:04:09.560> hits<00:04:09.889> a<00:04:09.949> Chevrolet

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
so this is the truck hits a Chevrolet

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.569 
so this is the truck hits a Chevrolet
and<00:04:10.879> I<00:04:11.870> really<00:04:12.769> have<00:04:12.919> nothing<00:04:13.069> good<00:04:13.400> to<00:04:13.459> say

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
and I really have nothing good to say

structions<00:04:24.790> right<00:04:25.419> so<00:04:25.690> I<00:04:25.720> read<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.110> whole

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:26.259 
structions right so I read the whole

thing that's that's my personality is I

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.090 
thing that's that's my personality is I
always<00:04:28.900> look<00:04:29.139> at<00:04:29.259> the<00:04:29.290> instructional<00:04:29.860> booklet

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
always look at the instructional booklet

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.790 
always look at the instructional booklet
first<00:04:30.490> and<00:04:30.850> I<00:04:31.120> read<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:32.110> heck<00:04:32.259> out<00:04:32.440> of<00:04:32.470> it<00:04:32.650> even

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
first and I read the heck out of it even

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.860 
first and I read the heck out of it even
if<00:04:33.009> it's<00:04:33.160> something<00:04:33.310> as<00:04:33.580> simple<00:04:33.729> as<00:04:33.970> this<00:04:34.210> and

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
if it's something as simple as this and

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.360 
if it's something as simple as this and
I<00:04:34.990> was<00:04:35.110> just<00:04:35.169> thinking<00:04:35.710> you<00:04:35.800> know<00:04:35.830> they<00:04:36.160> gave

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
I was just thinking you know they gave

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.610 
I was just thinking you know they gave
us<00:04:36.490> this<00:04:36.639> cannon<00:04:37.180> and<00:04:37.389> I<00:04:37.780> was<00:04:37.930> like<00:04:37.990> you<00:04:38.470> know

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
us this cannon and I was like you know

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.279 
us this cannon and I was like you know
if<00:04:38.979> these<00:04:39.190> if<00:04:39.940> these<00:04:40.240> people<00:04:40.720> were<00:04:40.990> a<00:04:41.020> little

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
if these if these people were a little

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:42.900 
if these if these people were a little
bit<00:04:41.470> more<00:04:41.590> creative<00:04:41.919> they'd<00:04:42.430> make<00:04:42.639> it<00:04:42.789> to

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
bit more creative they'd make it to

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.999 
bit more creative they'd make it to
where<00:04:43.000> they<00:04:43.150> can<00:04:43.330> and<00:04:43.539> attaches<00:04:44.139> to<00:04:44.320> the

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
where they can and attaches to the

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.040 
where they can and attaches to the
vehicles<00:04:45.490> or<00:04:45.610> something<00:04:45.970> and<00:04:46.120> then<00:04:46.750> I<00:04:46.780> found

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
vehicles or something and then I found

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.020 
vehicles or something and then I found
out<00:04:47.259> in<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:47.919> instruction<00:04:48.400> booklet<00:04:48.580> that's

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
out in the instruction booklet that's

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.390 
out in the instruction booklet that's
what<00:04:49.240> they<00:04:49.360> actually<00:04:49.539> recommend<00:04:50.259> so<00:04:50.590> it<00:04:51.160> was

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
what they actually recommend so it was

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.010 
what they actually recommend so it was
cool<00:04:51.669> I<00:04:51.910> was<00:04:52.060> like<00:04:52.210> oh<00:04:52.389> just<00:04:52.720> what<00:04:52.870> I<00:04:52.900> was

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
cool I was like oh just what I was

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.740 
cool I was like oh just what I was
thinking<00:04:53.080> the<00:04:53.860> only<00:04:54.130> problem<00:04:54.430> is<00:04:54.820> it<00:04:55.479> doesn't

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
thinking the only problem is it doesn't

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.710 
thinking the only problem is it doesn't
fit<00:04:56.320> well<00:04:56.710> it<00:04:57.160> it's<00:04:57.639> like<00:04:58.090> I<00:04:58.300> know<00:04:58.389> it<00:04:58.570> looks

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
fit well it it's like I know it looks

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.409 
fit well it it's like I know it looks
cool<00:04:59.020> here<00:04:59.350> you<00:04:59.889> know<00:05:00.039> and<00:05:00.370> and<00:05:00.669> it<00:05:00.820> might<00:05:01.270> be

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
cool here you know and and it might be

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.990 
cool here you know and and it might be
seem<00:05:01.930> kind<00:05:02.169> of<00:05:02.229> solid<00:05:02.620> but<00:05:03.010> it's<00:05:03.160> not<00:05:03.370> it's<00:05:03.669> it

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
seem kind of solid but it's not it's it

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.779 
seem kind of solid but it's not it's it
doesn't<00:05:04.360> even<00:05:04.979> connect<00:05:05.979> to<00:05:06.130> anything<00:05:06.400> it's

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
doesn't even connect to anything it's

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:08.460 
doesn't even connect to anything it's
just<00:05:06.910> I'm<00:05:07.210> just<00:05:07.240> kind<00:05:07.630> of<00:05:07.660> squeezing<00:05:08.199> it<00:05:08.320> on

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
just I'm just kind of squeezing it on

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
just I'm just kind of squeezing it on
there<00:05:08.710> and<00:05:08.949> other<00:05:09.490> than<00:05:09.580> that<00:05:09.760> it<00:05:10.120> doesn't

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
there and other than that it doesn't

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.070 
there and other than that it doesn't
there's<00:05:12.490> really<00:05:12.729> nothing<00:05:12.880> for<00:05:13.330> it<00:05:13.600> to<00:05:13.720> clasp

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
there's really nothing for it to clasp

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.040 
there's really nothing for it to clasp
on<00:05:14.560> here<00:05:15.250> on<00:05:15.400> the<00:05:16.180> three<00:05:16.419> points<00:05:16.810> that<00:05:16.960> it

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
on here on the three points that it

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.900 
on here on the three points that it
should<00:05:17.380> and<00:05:17.590> it<00:05:17.979> doesn't<00:05:18.250> so<00:05:18.550> that<00:05:18.699> was<00:05:18.880> really

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
should and it doesn't so that was really

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.629 
should and it doesn't so that was really
sad<00:05:19.570> it<00:05:19.599> was<00:05:19.810> almost<00:05:20.020> like<00:05:20.490> after<00:05:21.490> they

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
sad it was almost like after they

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.610 
sad it was almost like after they
created<00:05:22.180> this<00:05:22.330> thing<00:05:22.570> they<00:05:22.750> thought<00:05:22.990> hey<00:05:23.560> you

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
created this thing they thought hey you

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.409 
created this thing they thought hey you
know<00:05:24.009> what<00:05:24.220> you<00:05:24.430> could<00:05:24.550> just<00:05:24.729> attach<00:05:24.849> this<00:05:25.210> on

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
know what you could just attach this on

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.510 
know what you could just attach this on
it<00:05:25.570> so<00:05:25.960> if<00:05:26.259> they<00:05:26.410> had<00:05:26.590> thought<00:05:26.979> of<00:05:27.250> it

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
it so if they had thought of it

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.060 
it so if they had thought of it
beforehand<00:05:28.360> and<00:05:28.599> actually<00:05:29.050> made<00:05:29.229> notches<00:05:29.919> and

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
beforehand and actually made notches and

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.860 
beforehand and actually made notches and
actually<00:05:30.699> measured<00:05:31.120> this<00:05:31.300> thing<00:05:31.539> it<00:05:31.780> would

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
actually measured this thing it would

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.279 
actually measured this thing it would
have<00:05:31.990> been<00:05:32.080> great<00:05:32.349> but<00:05:32.770> they<00:05:32.919> didn't<00:05:34.260> so<00:05:35.260> you

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
have been great but they didn't so you

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:37.710 
have been great but they didn't so you
could<00:05:35.710> basically<00:05:35.979> using<00:05:36.729> that<00:05:36.849> same<00:05:37.090> concept

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
could basically using that same concept

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.629 
could basically using that same concept
I<00:05:37.930> guess<00:05:38.440> you<00:05:38.620> could<00:05:38.650> you<00:05:39.070> could<00:05:39.190> do<00:05:39.340> the<00:05:39.430> same

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
I guess you could you could do the same

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.399 
I guess you could you could do the same
thing<00:05:39.849> over<00:05:40.000> here<00:05:40.150> you<00:05:40.570> know<00:05:40.690> who<00:05:40.840> cares<00:05:41.139> you

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
thing over here you know who cares you

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:44.040 
thing over here you know who cares you
know<00:05:41.440> because<00:05:41.949> all<00:05:42.280> it<00:05:42.729> does<00:05:42.760> is<00:05:43.180> it<00:05:43.210> just<00:05:43.599> it

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
know because all it does is it just it

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.020 
know because all it does is it just it
just<00:05:44.080> kind<00:05:44.380> of<00:05:44.409> squeeze<00:05:44.590> is<00:05:44.830> on<00:05:44.979> so<00:05:45.400> you<00:05:45.940> know

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
just kind of squeeze is on so you know

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.460 
just kind of squeeze is on so you know
what<00:05:46.150> it<00:05:46.300> works<00:05:46.479> on<00:05:46.659> this<00:05:46.780> thing<00:05:47.020> too<00:05:47.229> it'll

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
what it works on this thing too it'll

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.710 
what it works on this thing too it'll
work<00:05:47.710> on<00:05:47.889> anything<00:05:48.220> it'll<00:05:48.550> work<00:05:48.760> on<00:05:48.940> my<00:05:49.090> pen<00:05:49.389> do

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
work on anything it'll work on my pen do

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.330 
work on anything it'll work on my pen do
we<00:05:49.870> the<00:05:50.440> way<00:05:50.590> they're<00:05:50.800> doing<00:05:50.949> it<00:05:51.190> because

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
we the way they're doing it because

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.629 
we the way they're doing it because
whoops<00:05:52.090> got<00:05:52.900> kind<00:05:53.139> of<00:05:53.199> stuck<00:05:53.349> in<00:05:53.650> there<00:05:53.860> but

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 
whoops got kind of stuck in there but

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:57.960 
whoops got kind of stuck in there but
alright<00:05:55.229> anyway<00:05:56.229> the<00:05:57.010> main<00:05:57.190> feature<00:05:57.550> is<00:05:57.729> the

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
alright anyway the main feature is the

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.719 
alright anyway the main feature is the
tank<00:05:58.479> is<00:05:58.750> a<00:05:58.810> is<00:05:59.590> the<00:05:59.889> tank<00:06:00.159> like<00:06:00.340> I<00:06:00.370> said<00:06:00.639> the

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
tank is a is the tank like I said the

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:02.490 
tank is a is the tank like I said the
cannon<00:06:01.150> being<00:06:01.330> able<00:06:01.570> to<00:06:01.690> connect<00:06:02.050> is<00:06:02.169> kind<00:06:02.409> of

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
cannon being able to connect is kind of

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.170 
cannon being able to connect is kind of
cool<00:06:02.680> even<00:06:03.370> though<00:06:03.639> they<00:06:03.820> didn't<00:06:04.060> really

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
cool even though they didn't really

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.450 
cool even though they didn't really
measure<00:06:04.630> it<00:06:04.840> or<00:06:05.020> made<00:06:05.440> it<00:06:05.560> specifically<00:06:06.190> to

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
measure it or made it specifically to

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.860 
measure it or made it specifically to
where<00:06:06.580> it<00:06:06.669> attaches<00:06:06.909> better<00:06:07.419> they<00:06:07.630> should

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
where it attaches better they should

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.350 
where it attaches better they should
have<00:06:08.020> but<00:06:08.229> they<00:06:08.349> didn't<00:06:08.710> but<00:06:09.430> the<00:06:10.030> fact<00:06:10.270> that

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
have but they didn't but the fact that

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.230 
have but they didn't but the fact that
it<00:06:10.510> still<00:06:10.810> can<00:06:11.080> I<00:06:11.340> that<00:06:12.340> that<00:06:12.669> was<00:06:12.760> pretty<00:06:12.970> cool

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
it still can I that that was pretty cool

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.330 
it still can I that that was pretty cool
but<00:06:13.720> okay<00:06:13.990> so<00:06:14.020> here's<00:06:14.380> a<00:06:14.440> tank<00:06:14.770> the<00:06:14.949> tank<00:06:15.130> has

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
but okay so here's a tank the tank has

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.909 
but okay so here's a tank the tank has
some<00:06:15.550> wheels<00:06:15.789> on<00:06:15.970> the<00:06:16.090> bottom<00:06:16.260> the<00:06:17.260> treads<00:06:17.620> are

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 
some wheels on the bottom the treads are

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.240 
some wheels on the bottom the treads are
asked<00:06:18.610> with<00:06:18.729> most<00:06:19.030> toy<00:06:19.780> cart<00:06:20.130> tanks<00:06:21.130> the

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
asked with most toy cart tanks the

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.100 
asked with most toy cart tanks the
treads<00:06:21.520> are<00:06:21.669> just<00:06:21.880> for<00:06:22.090> show<00:06:22.120> lots<00:06:22.750> of<00:06:22.930> good

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
treads are just for show lots of good

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.939 
treads are just for show lots of good
detail<00:06:23.680> uh<00:06:24.360> right<00:06:25.360> here<00:06:25.599> these<00:06:25.810> are<00:06:26.110> for<00:06:26.229> small

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:26.949 
detail uh right here these are for small

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:28.860 
detail uh right here these are for small
wheels<00:06:27.220> on<00:06:27.430> the<00:06:27.550> inside<00:06:27.909> and<00:06:28.150> that's<00:06:28.599> what

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
wheels on the inside and that's what

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.940 
wheels on the inside and that's what
makes<00:06:29.020> it<00:06:29.229> roll<00:06:29.620> very<00:06:30.010> well<00:06:31.440> right<00:06:32.440> here<00:06:32.710> I

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:32.950 
makes it roll very well right here I

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.500 
makes it roll very well right here I
guess<00:06:33.340> this<00:06:33.490> part<00:06:33.729> right<00:06:33.760> here<00:06:33.849> is<00:06:34.029> a<00:06:34.060> rocket

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.510 
guess this part right here is a rocket

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.040 
guess this part right here is a rocket
launcher<00:06:34.870> and<00:06:35.020> then<00:06:35.260> you<00:06:35.349> have<00:06:35.469> the<00:06:35.590> main

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
launcher and then you have the main

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.960 
launcher and then you have the main
and<00:06:36.460> it<00:06:37.460> rotates<00:06:38.030> the<00:06:38.590> material<00:06:39.590> is<00:06:40.550> this

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
and it rotates the material is this

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.860 
and it rotates the material is this
thing<00:06:41.180> diecast<00:06:42.069> yes<00:06:43.069> this<00:06:43.789> this<00:06:44.419> whole<00:06:44.629> top

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
thing diecast yes this this whole top

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.320 
thing diecast yes this this whole top
part<00:06:45.169> feels<00:06:45.409> like<00:06:45.650> metal<00:06:46.129> and<00:06:46.340> this<00:06:47.150> is

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:47.330 
part feels like metal and this is

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.540 
part feels like metal and this is
plastered<00:06:47.840> this<00:06:47.960> entire<00:06:48.289> black<00:06:49.039> part<00:06:49.370> right

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
plastered this entire black part right

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.640 
plastered this entire black part right
here<00:06:49.580> Detroit<00:06:50.150> and<00:06:50.389> the<00:06:50.810> cannon<00:06:51.050> itself<00:06:51.259> is

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:51.650 
here Detroit and the cannon itself is

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.330 
here Detroit and the cannon itself is
all<00:06:51.800> plastic<00:06:52.039> and<00:06:52.629> I<00:06:53.629> assume<00:06:54.409> these<00:06:54.590> are<00:06:54.650> these

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.340 
all plastic and I assume these are these

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.330 
all plastic and I assume these are these
are<00:06:55.400> plastic<00:06:55.729> too<00:06:56.150> are<00:06:56.629> they<00:06:56.930> I<00:06:57.139> can't<00:06:58.129> even

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340 
are plastic too are they I can't even

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.159 
are plastic too are they I can't even
tell<00:06:58.580> but<00:06:58.819> this<00:06:58.970> this<00:06:59.300> part<00:06:59.659> does<00:06:59.900> feel

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:00.169 
tell but this this part does feel

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:03.670 
tell but this this part does feel
metallic<00:07:00.770> I'll<00:07:01.159> tell<00:07:01.430> you<00:07:01.550> that<00:07:01.729> so<00:07:02.680> anyway

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:19.940 
here is here is my boards macho machines

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.089 
here is here is my boards macho machines
tank<00:07:20.300> and<00:07:20.599> of<00:07:20.960> course<00:07:21.199> much<00:07:21.440> of<00:07:21.469> machines<00:07:21.889> is

00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:22.099 
tank and of course much of machines is

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:24.879 
tank and of course much of machines is
is<00:07:22.789> pretty<00:07:23.509> small<00:07:23.780> like<00:07:24.050> I<00:07:24.169> should<00:07:24.379> like<00:07:24.710> I

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:24.889 
is pretty small like I should like I

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:28.350 
is pretty small like I should like I
mentioned<00:07:25.430> before<00:07:25.639> so<00:07:26.240> you<00:07:26.990> know<00:07:27.020> tank<00:07:27.919> wise

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.360 
mentioned before so you know tank wise

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.080 
mentioned before so you know tank wise
it<00:07:29.360> does<00:07:29.629> seem<00:07:29.870> kind<00:07:30.080> of<00:07:30.229> small<00:07:30.500> and<00:07:31.090> Megatron

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:32.090 
it does seem kind of small and Megatron

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.119 
it does seem kind of small and Megatron
Megatron<00:07:32.120> my<00:07:32.750> other<00:07:32.900> tank<00:07:33.199> right<00:07:33.440> here<00:07:33.469> so

00:07:34.119 --> 00:07:34.129 
Megatron my other tank right here so

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:36.879 
Megatron my other tank right here so
that's<00:07:34.310> Megatron<00:07:34.940> Megatron<00:07:35.469> very<00:07:36.469> futuristic

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:36.889 
that's Megatron Megatron very futuristic

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:40.240 
that's Megatron Megatron very futuristic
looking<00:07:37.400> tank<00:07:38.620> looks<00:07:39.620> like<00:07:39.770> a<00:07:39.800> good<00:07:40.039> match

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:40.250 
looking tank looks like a good match

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.219 
looking tank looks like a good match
right<00:07:40.580> it<00:07:40.940> does<00:07:41.180> it<00:07:41.479> does<00:07:41.509> look<00:07:41.810> like<00:07:41.930> a<00:07:41.990> good

00:07:42.219 --> 00:07:42.229 
right it does it does look like a good

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:45.999 
right it does it does look like a good
match<00:07:42.440> here<00:07:42.770> I<00:07:44.139> don't<00:07:45.139> know<00:07:45.229> I<00:07:45.259> think<00:07:45.620> both

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:46.009 
match here I don't know I think both

00:07:46.009 --> 00:07:50.499 
match here I don't know I think both
tanks<00:07:46.219> are<00:07:46.430> very<00:07:46.580> cool<00:07:49.210> so<00:07:50.210> pretty<00:07:50.419> much

00:07:50.499 --> 00:07:50.509 
tanks are very cool so pretty much

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:55.120 
tanks are very cool so pretty much
that's<00:07:50.779> my<00:07:51.080> review<00:07:51.289> for<00:07:51.819> urban<00:07:52.819> assault
