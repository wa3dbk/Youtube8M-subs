00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.289
 brit air 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.800
 this case to follow 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.609
 the floor 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.580
 but simplify them as much as possible 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.100
 all done all does not we will appreciate 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.290
 this cd 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.560
 after you ask again from the road 202 to not call you that well 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.870
 and where it generated that you follow a single price of the imaginary 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.480
 a break back for a tour 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.040
 it gives you more time 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.700
 and both very nice holidays said 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.700
 for example the letter b 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.980
 layer 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:00.980
 standing 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.740
 steam 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.390
 the two men 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.320
 if you want me to come right now what does it mean 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.160
 why start doing 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.350
 at the beginning all of weight for several voices on the field and then at the same 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.430
 time 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.750
 because it's a way of integrating with the museum 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.210
 in fact he is naked 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.210
 with more weight 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
 after 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.710
 you will see what you say for fun as expected 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.570
 it's a nasty pleasure 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.140
 it is necessary 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.740
 m adapted this way 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.010
 since the start of the scale 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.480
 and in March at the head of this fight against this internship 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.550
 just now we will not even speak 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.930
 and tomorrow from 10 am to 11 am I ask the city times faster than 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.100
 this morning 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.110
 it was created the hazards the other countries the heaviest it is the case of 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.830
 marc hansen they sell more 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.680
 once again the slaughtered civilians 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.099
 they are able to go around the earth 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.469
 but are unable to make a single people in the world 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:14.359
 and there you are doing more than one thing in common
