you<00:00:22.069> know<00:00:22.159> these<00:00:22.369> are<00:00:22.550> just<00:00:22.609> four<00:00:23.119> little

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:23.329 
you know these are just four little

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:25.120 
you know these are just four little
pieces<00:00:23.599> of<00:00:23.810> wood<00:00:24.050> and<00:00:24.380> I've<00:00:24.560> drilled<00:00:24.829> some

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
pieces of wood and I've drilled some

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.689 
pieces of wood and I've drilled some
holes<00:00:25.159> in<00:00:25.669> there<00:00:26.679> so<00:00:27.679> that<00:00:27.710> I<00:00:27.919> can<00:00:28.130> mount<00:00:28.339> those

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
holes in there so that I can mount those

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:30.279 
holes in there so that I can mount those
to<00:00:28.970> the<00:00:29.089> amp<00:00:29.359> and<00:00:29.630> the<00:00:29.839> grille

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.310 
to the amp and the grille
I<00:00:30.819> go<00:00:31.819> ahead<00:00:31.939> and<00:00:32.090> mount<00:00:32.390> your<00:00:32.630> speaker's<00:00:33.140> in

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
I go ahead and mount your speaker's in

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.220 
I go ahead and mount your speaker's in
place<00:00:33.590> and<00:00:34.270> wire<00:00:35.270> those<00:00:35.660> in<00:00:37.630> I'm<00:00:38.630> not<00:00:38.690> going<00:00:39.080> to

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
place and wire those in I'm not going to

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.460 
place and wire those in I'm not going to
go<00:00:39.350> into<00:00:39.500> the<00:00:39.680> configuration<00:00:40.930> just<00:00:41.930> use<00:00:42.170> the

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
go into the configuration just use the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.020 
go into the configuration just use the
wire<00:00:42.830> that<00:00:43.070> we<00:00:43.190> did<00:00:43.400> in<00:00:43.520> the<00:00:43.640> testing

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
wire that we did in the testing

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.390 
wire that we did in the testing
procedures<00:00:44.570> and<00:00:44.870> wire<00:00:45.410> it<00:00:45.590> according<00:00:46.070> to<00:00:46.220> your

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
procedures and wire it according to your

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.390 
procedures and wire it according to your
particular<00:00:47.200> configuration<00:00:48.200> of<00:00:48.820> speakers<00:00:51.400> but

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
particular configuration of speakers but

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.490 
particular configuration of speakers but
just<00:00:52.579> make<00:00:52.760> sure<00:00:52.910> you've<00:00:53.060> got<00:00:53.090> it<00:00:53.500> all

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
just make sure you've got it all

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.190 
just make sure you've got it all
connected<00:00:55.100> properly<00:00:57.310> and<00:00:58.720> then<00:00:59.720> you<00:00:59.840> can<00:00:59.989> see

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
connected properly and then you can see

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.600 
connected properly and then you can see
I've<00:01:00.320> drilled<00:01:00.590> those<00:01:00.770> holes<00:01:01.100> out<00:01:01.340> a<00:01:01.370> little

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
I've drilled those holes out a little

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:09.489 
I've drilled those holes out a little
more<00:01:01.850> there<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:06.880> they're<00:01:07.880> going<00:01:08.060> to<00:01:08.179> mount<00:01:08.499> to

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:09.499 
more there and they're going to mount to

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:12.219 
more there and they're going to mount to
the<00:01:09.649> sides<00:01:09.920> of<00:01:10.249> the<00:01:10.549> amplifier<00:01:11.179> and<00:01:11.420> then<00:01:11.869> into

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
the sides of the amplifier and then into

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.809 
the sides of the amplifier and then into
the<00:01:12.319> grille<00:01:12.560> there<00:01:12.829> to<00:01:13.039> hold<00:01:13.189> it<00:01:13.340> all<00:01:13.520> in<00:01:13.700> place

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:15.819 

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:18.039 

so<00:01:16.819> you<00:01:16.880> can<00:01:17.030> see<00:01:17.210> I've<00:01:17.329> went<00:01:17.539> ahead<00:01:17.630> and

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
so you can see I've went ahead and

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.580 
so you can see I've went ahead and
position<00:01:18.380> them<00:01:19.039> with<00:01:19.729> enough<00:01:20.090> room<00:01:20.450> for<00:01:20.810> the

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
position them with enough room for the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.789 
position them with enough room for the
grille<00:01:21.799> to<00:01:22.039> sit<00:01:22.249> in<00:01:22.369> the<00:01:22.490> amplifier<00:01:23.710> and<00:01:24.710> I've

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
grille to sit in the amplifier and I've

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.499 
grille to sit in the amplifier and I've
also<00:01:24.979> mounted<00:01:25.490> my<00:01:25.639> reverb<00:01:26.270> tank<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:28.329> be<00:01:29.329> sure

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
also mounted my reverb tank and be sure

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:30.969 
also mounted my reverb tank and be sure
and<00:01:29.539> leave<00:01:29.810> yourself<00:01:29.990> a<00:01:30.289> little<00:01:30.439> room<00:01:30.709> there

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
and leave yourself a little room there

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.730 
and leave yourself a little room there
for<00:01:31.249> the<00:01:31.369> bottom<00:01:32.149> piece<00:01:32.600> kind<00:01:33.139> of<00:01:33.319> Center<00:01:33.649> it

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
for the bottom piece kind of Center it

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.699 
for the bottom piece kind of Center it
there<00:01:33.979> in<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.249> bottom<00:01:34.579> of<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.789> amplifier<00:01:35.329> and

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:35.709 
there in the bottom of the amplifier and

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:38.080 
there in the bottom of the amplifier and
then<00:01:36.709> we're<00:01:36.889> going<00:01:37.039> to<00:01:37.069> fold<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:37.609> grille<00:01:37.850> up

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
then we're going to fold the grille up

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.230 
then we're going to fold the grille up
onto<00:01:38.959> those<00:01:39.109> mounting<00:01:40.659> strips<00:01:41.659> and<00:01:42.880> then<00:01:43.880> it's

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
onto those mounting strips and then it's

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.910 
onto those mounting strips and then it's
just<00:01:44.420> a<00:01:44.509> matter<00:01:44.689> of<00:01:44.779> screwing<00:01:45.079> those<00:01:45.409> in<00:01:45.649> place

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
just a matter of screwing those in place

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.510 
just a matter of screwing those in place
and<00:01:46.279> then<00:01:46.969> plug<00:01:47.329> in<00:01:47.600> your<00:01:47.630> speakers<00:01:48.350> and<00:01:48.560> the

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
and then plug in your speakers and the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.929 
and then plug in your speakers and the
reverb<00:01:49.909> tank<00:01:50.950> and<00:01:51.950> notice<00:01:52.249> we've<00:01:52.429> got<00:01:52.459> two

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
reverb tank and notice we've got two

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.649 
reverb tank and notice we've got two
blocks<00:01:53.240> here<00:01:54.700> so<00:01:55.700> that<00:01:55.880> we<00:01:55.999> can<00:01:56.179> put<00:01:56.359> our<00:01:56.450> back

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
blocks here so that we can put our back

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.950 
blocks here so that we can put our back
pieces<00:01:56.929> on

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.680 

carrot<00:02:00.680> bottom<00:02:01.160> pieces<00:02:01.580> in<00:02:01.940> place<00:02:02.210> here<00:02:02.570> and

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
carrot bottom pieces in place here and

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.690 
carrot bottom pieces in place here and
then<00:02:03.290> the<00:02:03.410> top<00:02:03.620> one<00:02:03.650> make<00:02:04.310> sure<00:02:04.340> you've<00:02:04.670> got

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
then the top one make sure you've got

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.480 
then the top one make sure you've got
those<00:02:05.180> wires<00:02:05.570> cleared<00:02:06.320> there<00:02:07.040> needs<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.340> be<00:02:07.400> a

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
those wires cleared there needs to be a

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.310 
those wires cleared there needs to be a
little<00:02:07.670> clearance<00:02:08.180> between<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.630> chassis<00:02:09.170> and

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
little clearance between the chassis and

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.790 
little clearance between the chassis and
