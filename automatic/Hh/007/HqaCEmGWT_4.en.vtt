floor<00:04:07.709> another<00:04:08.709> escalator

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
floor another escalator

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.500 
floor another escalator
you<00:04:10.180> got<00:04:10.269> some<00:04:10.540> dishes<00:04:10.810> for<00:04:11.230> sale<00:04:12.090> so<00:04:13.090> this<00:04:13.299> is

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
you got some dishes for sale so this is

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.469 
you got some dishes for sale so this is
apparently<00:04:13.810> we're<00:04:14.200> like<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.829> kitchen<00:04:15.640> stuff

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
apparently we're like the kitchen stuff

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.960 
apparently we're like the kitchen stuff
is<00:04:16.780> no<00:04:17.709> you<00:04:17.979> can<00:04:18.130> put<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.310> ball<00:04:18.489> here<00:04:18.820> if<00:04:18.910> you

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
is no you can put the ball here if you

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.159 
is no you can put the ball here if you
want<00:04:19.150> but<00:04:19.209> I<00:04:19.329> think<00:04:19.359> that<00:04:19.600> goes<00:04:19.750> on<00:04:19.900> the<00:04:19.989> toy

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
want but I think that goes on the toy

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.670 
want but I think that goes on the toy
store<00:04:20.530> in<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:20.769> top<00:04:21.390> so<00:04:22.390> the<00:04:22.539> top<00:04:22.570> is<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:23.500> toy

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
store in the top so the top is the toy

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.350 
store in the top so the top is the toy
store<00:04:24.010> there's<00:04:24.430> the<00:04:24.580> blue<00:04:24.729> ball<00:04:24.970> we'll<00:04:25.210> put

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
store there's the blue ball we'll put

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.120 
store there's the blue ball we'll put
the<00:04:25.479> yellow<00:04:25.570> ball<00:04:25.870> in<00:04:26.020> there<00:04:26.169> with<00:04:26.349> it<00:04:26.560> get<00:04:27.010> the

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
the yellow ball in there with it get the

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.179 
the yellow ball in there with it get the
little<00:04:27.280> scooter

00:04:28.179 --> 00:04:28.189 
little scooter

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:31.119 
little scooter
you<00:04:28.879> got<00:04:29.030> a<00:04:29.060> little<00:04:29.300> treehouse<00:04:29.719> and<00:04:30.259> of<00:04:30.889> course

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:31.129 
you got a little treehouse and of course

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:34.119 
you got a little treehouse and of course
the<00:04:31.370> fancy<00:04:31.789> chandelier<00:04:32.710> which<00:04:33.710> is<00:04:33.889> probably

00:04:34.119 --> 00:04:34.129 
the fancy chandelier which is probably

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:38.260 
the fancy chandelier which is probably
the<00:04:34.250> key<00:04:34.550> piece<00:04:35.150> of<00:04:35.539> this<00:04:36.550> set<00:04:37.550> up<00:04:37.669> and<00:04:37.849> you<00:04:38.120> can

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
the key piece of this set up and you can

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.450 
the key piece of this set up and you can
see<00:04:38.419> the<00:04:38.539> chandelier<00:04:38.719> goes<00:04:39.169> all<00:04:39.349> the<00:04:39.379> way<00:04:39.620> down

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
see the chandelier goes all the way down

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.950 
see the chandelier goes all the way down
you<00:04:40.699> can<00:04:40.729> see<00:04:40.969> it<00:04:41.120> if<00:04:41.270> you<00:04:41.509> were<00:04:41.599> on<00:04:41.689> the<00:04:41.810> first

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
you can see it if you were on the first

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.890 
you can see it if you were on the first
floor<00:04:42.139> if<00:04:42.469> you<00:04:42.560> looked<00:04:42.770> up<00:04:42.949> but<00:04:43.599> no<00:04:44.599> tile

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
floor if you looked up but no tile

floors<00:04:46.030> these<00:04:47.030> modular<00:04:47.569> is<00:04:47.659> always<00:04:47.960> coming

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
floors these modular is always coming

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:49.959 
floors these modular is always coming
these<00:04:48.319> great<00:04:48.590> big<00:04:48.800> boxes<00:04:49.370> you<00:04:49.610> need<00:04:49.789> them

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:49.969 
these great big boxes you need them

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:52.330 
these great big boxes you need them
gives<00:04:50.900> you<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.139> dimensions<00:04:51.770> everything<00:04:52.250> you

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
gives you the dimensions everything you

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.040 
gives you the dimensions everything you
need<00:04:52.490> to<00:04:52.610> know<00:04:52.759> about<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:53.330> set<00:04:53.539> is<00:04:53.750> on<00:04:53.930> the

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
need to know about the set is on the

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.510 
need to know about the set is on the
modular<00:04:54.439> I<00:04:54.500> like<00:04:54.710> how<00:04:54.860> they<00:04:55.009> took<00:04:55.370> this

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
modular I like how they took this

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.980 
modular I like how they took this
picture<00:04:55.909> where<00:04:56.060> you<00:04:56.150> can<00:04:56.240> see<00:04:56.389> the<00:04:56.509> escalator

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
picture where you can see the escalator

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.980 
picture where you can see the escalator
I<00:04:57.729> probably<00:04:58.729> should<00:04:58.909> put<00:04:59.120> my<00:04:59.240> GoPro<00:04:59.629> in<00:04:59.780> there

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
I probably should put my GoPro in there

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.499 
I probably should put my GoPro in there
we'll<00:05:00.409> turn<00:05:00.560> it<00:05:00.710> around<00:05:00.969> and<00:05:01.969> that<00:05:02.029> shows<00:05:02.360> you

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509 
we'll turn it around and that shows you

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.619 
we'll turn it around and that shows you
again<00:05:02.750> some<00:05:03.740> of<00:05:03.830> the<00:05:03.889> key<00:05:04.039> features<00:05:04.279> and<00:05:04.789> which

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:05.629 
again some of the key features and which

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:07.570 
again some of the key features and which
is<00:05:05.779> better<00:05:06.020> job<00:05:06.319> than<00:05:06.500> I<00:05:06.590> could<00:05:06.770> do<00:05:06.889> and<00:05:07.340> it

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
is better job than I could do and it

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.879 
is better job than I could do and it
shows<00:05:07.819> you<00:05:07.969> with<00:05:08.180> other<00:05:08.900> discontinued

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
shows you with other discontinued

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:16.029 
shows you with other discontinued
modulars<00:05:13.270> and<00:05:14.270> you<00:05:14.389> do<00:05:14.569> get<00:05:14.750> the<00:05:15.289> instruction

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
modulars and you do get the instruction

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:20.080 
modulars and you do get the instruction
manual<00:05:16.400> which<00:05:17.120> is<00:05:17.150> in<00:05:17.509> three<00:05:17.810> get<00:05:18.620> three<00:05:19.090> steps

to<00:05:20.240> it<00:05:20.479> three<00:05:20.979> different<00:05:21.979> manuals<00:05:22.310> to<00:05:22.669> build

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
to it three different manuals to build

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:25.029 
to it three different manuals to build
the<00:05:22.969> one<00:05:23.120> model<00:05:23.529> so<00:05:24.529> that's<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:24.830> grand

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
the one model so that's the grand

the one model so that's the grand
Emporium<00:05:25.960> it's<00:05:26.960> a<00:05:26.990> really<00:05:27.259> good<00:05:27.699> modular<00:05:28.699> or

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:28.909 
Emporium it's a really good modular or

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:30.909 
Emporium it's a really good modular or
all<00:05:29.090> the<00:05:29.240> modulars<00:05:29.689> are<00:05:29.870> good<00:05:30.020> so<00:05:30.469> where<00:05:30.830> do

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
all the modulars are good so where do

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.899 
all the modulars are good so where do
you<00:05:31.009> rank<00:05:31.159> this<00:05:31.430> in<00:05:32.620> your<00:05:33.620> opinion<00:05:34.190> of<00:05:34.339> the

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:34.909 
you rank this in your opinion of the

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:37.480 
you rank this in your opinion of the
modulars<00:05:35.360> is<00:05:35.930> it<00:05:36.139> high<00:05:36.289> up<00:05:36.319> there's<00:05:36.770> at<00:05:37.099> one<00:05:37.370> of

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
modulars is it high up there's at one of

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.450 
modulars is it high up there's at one of
the<00:05:37.550> lower<00:05:37.699> ones<00:05:37.819> and<00:05:38.830> doesn't<00:05:39.830> have<00:05:39.979> tile

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
the lower ones and doesn't have tile

the lower ones and doesn't have tile
floor<00:05:40.990> that's<00:05:41.990> something<00:05:42.259> you<00:05:42.349> can<00:05:42.469> add

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
floor that's something you can add

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.550 
floor that's something you can add
yourself<00:05:43.099> so<00:05:43.490> that's<00:05:43.610> the<00:05:43.930> drawback<00:05:44.930> to<00:05:44.960> it<00:05:45.169> it

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
yourself so that's the drawback to it it

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.159 
yourself so that's the drawback to it it
has<00:05:45.770> more<00:05:45.800> interior<00:05:46.699> details<00:05:47.509> in<00:05:47.779> the<00:05:47.870> cafe

has more interior details in the cafe

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.540 
has more interior details in the cafe
corner<00:05:48.440> it<00:05:49.310> has<00:05:49.490> a<00:05:49.520> lot<00:05:49.759> of<00:05:49.879> building<00:05:50.360> to<00:05:50.389> it

some<00:05:52.550> of<00:05:52.639> the<00:05:52.729> newer<00:05:52.940> modulars<00:05:53.539> although<00:05:53.839> they

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
some of the newer modulars although they

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.129 
some of the newer modulars although they
have<00:05:54.110> more<00:05:54.259> details<00:05:54.740> there's<00:05:55.069> less<00:05:55.279> building

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:56.139 
have more details there's less building

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:58.749 
have more details there's less building
the<00:05:57.139> actual<00:05:57.289> size<00:05:57.860> of<00:05:58.039> the<00:05:58.129> building<00:05:58.460> and

the actual size of the building and

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:00.279 
the actual size of the building and
smaller<00:05:59.060> like<00:05:59.330> the<00:05:59.449> Parisian<00:05:59.629> restaurant
