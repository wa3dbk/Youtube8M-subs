00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
and you know I don't really consider it

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.370 
and you know I don't really consider it
so<00:00:23.279> much<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.580> swing<00:00:23.760> as<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.269> consider<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.900> SWAT

so much a swing as I consider it a SWAT
it's<00:00:25.680> kind<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.920> like<00:00:26.070> when<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.760> have<00:00:26.789> a

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
it's kind of like when you have a

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.200 
it's kind of like when you have a
flyswatter<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.380> hit<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.920> kill<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.880> fly

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
flyswatter and you hit and kill a fly

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.060 
flyswatter and you hit and kill a fly
you<00:00:30.869> know<00:00:30.960> when<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.170> make<00:00:31.320> contact<00:00:31.349> with<00:00:31.920> it

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
you know when you make contact with it

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.319 
you know when you make contact with it
it's<00:00:32.189> dead<00:00:32.460> right<00:00:32.669> it's<00:00:32.850> kind<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.059> similar

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
it's dead right it's kind of similar

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.209 
it's dead right it's kind of similar
with<00:00:33.390> Justin<00:00:33.809> Upton<00:00:33.960> when<00:00:34.410> he<00:00:34.530> makes<00:00:34.680> contact

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
with Justin Upton when he makes contact

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.639 
with Justin Upton when he makes contact
with<00:00:35.460> base<00:00:35.969> with<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.390> baseball<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:37.530> know

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
it's not coming back to the life it's

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
it's dead

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.900 
it's dead
so<00:00:40.469> I've<00:00:41.010> been<00:00:41.129> getting<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.370> lot<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.520> emails

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
so I've been getting a lot of emails

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.840 
so I've been getting a lot of emails
from<00:00:42.350> some<00:00:43.350> baseball<00:00:43.649> parents<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.520> their

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
from some baseball parents and and their

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.389 
from some baseball parents and and their
players<00:00:45.149> about<00:00:46.079> where<00:00:46.379> his<00:00:46.649> power<00:00:46.920> comes<00:00:47.250> from

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
players about where his power comes from

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.010 
players about where his power comes from
specifically<00:00:48.059> where<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.390> comes<00:00:48.570> from<00:00:48.660> and

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
specifically where it comes from and

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.869 
specifically where it comes from and
I've<00:00:49.559> been<00:00:49.710> looking<00:00:49.800> at<00:00:50.070> his<00:00:50.190> swing<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.700> I

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
I've been looking at his swing and I

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.369 
I've been looking at his swing and I
figured<00:00:51.539> out<00:00:51.660> there's<00:00:51.840> essentially<00:00:52.230> two

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
figured out there's essentially two

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.430 
figured out there's essentially two
things<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.219> he<00:00:53.370> does<00:00:53.629> really<00:00:54.629> well<00:00:54.960> that's

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
things that he does really well that's

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.410 
things that he does really well that's
kind<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.980> attributed<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.850> his<00:00:56.969> success<00:00:57.270> at

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
kind of attributed to his success at

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.910 
kind of attributed to his success at
least<00:00:57.480> from<00:00:57.660> what<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.870> can<00:00:57.960> tell<00:00:58.230> from<00:00:58.469> watching

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
least from what I can tell from watching

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.459 
least from what I can tell from watching
his<00:00:59.190> video<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.670> first<00:00:59.699> thing<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:01.260> fact

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
his video so the first thing is the fact

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.630 
his video so the first thing is the fact
that<00:01:01.590> he<00:01:01.859> has<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.719> perfect<00:01:03.799> stride<00:01:04.799> when<00:01:05.580> he

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
that he has a perfect stride when he

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.230 
that he has a perfect stride when he
hits<00:01:05.850> if<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.810> looked<00:01:07.020> at<00:01:07.140> his<00:01:07.670> his<00:01:08.670> overall

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
hits if you looked at his his overall

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.000 
hits if you looked at his his overall
approach<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.229> movements<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.680> his<00:01:10.770> pre

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
approach and the movements in his pre

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.719 
approach and the movements in his pre
swing<00:01:11.390> he<00:01:12.390> has<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.930> little<00:01:13.650> bit<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:14.040> leg<00:01:14.490> kick

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
swing he has a little bit of a leg kick

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.490 
swing he has a little bit of a leg kick
it<00:01:15.090> kind<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.360> goes<00:01:15.570> back<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.110> then<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.320> goes

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
it kind of goes back and then it goes

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.710 
it kind of goes back and then it goes
right<00:01:17.280> back<00:01:17.520> down<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.820> where<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.240> started<00:01:18.540> from

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
right back down to where it started from

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.450 
right back down to where it started from
he<00:01:18.900> doesn't<00:01:19.110> really<00:01:19.200> have<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.439> stride<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.310> much

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
he doesn't really have a stride so much

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.980 
he doesn't really have a stride so much
as<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> leg<00:01:21.119> lift<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.479> then<00:01:21.570> if<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.720> look<00:01:21.869> at<00:01:21.930> a

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
as a leg lift and then if you look at a

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.050 
as a leg lift and then if you look at a
separation<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.680> his<00:01:22.770> hands<00:01:23.189> he<00:01:23.670> doesn't<00:01:23.729> have

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
separation of his hands he doesn't have

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.820 
separation of his hands he doesn't have
as<00:01:24.240> much<00:01:24.420> separation<00:01:25.110> as<00:01:25.229> other<00:01:25.560> power

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
as much separation as other power

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.770 
as much separation as other power
hitters<00:01:26.189> but<00:01:26.340> what<00:01:26.520> you'll<00:01:26.640> notice<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:27.240> that

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
hitters but what you'll notice is that

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.679 
hitters but what you'll notice is that
when<00:01:28.140> he<00:01:28.290> does<00:01:28.560> initiate<00:01:29.549> his<00:01:29.729> swing<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.360> he

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
when he does initiate his swing and he

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.240 
when he does initiate his swing and he
strides<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.380> whatever<00:01:31.560> brings<00:01:31.920> his<00:01:32.040> foot

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
strides and whatever brings his foot

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.490 
strides and whatever brings his foot
back<00:01:32.400> down<00:01:32.430> his<00:01:33.210> hands<00:01:33.689> don't<00:01:33.960> go<00:01:34.170> with<00:01:34.380> his

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
back down his hands don't go with his

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.950 
back down his hands don't go with his
body<00:01:34.770> meaning<00:01:35.100> his<00:01:35.280> hands<00:01:35.490> don't<00:01:35.729> drift<00:01:36.030> as<00:01:36.750> he

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
body meaning his hands don't drift as he

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.120 
body meaning his hands don't drift as he
gets<00:01:37.140> his<00:01:37.200> hands<00:01:37.409> back<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.860> little<00:01:37.890> bit

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
gets his hands back just a little bit

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.069 
gets his hands back just a little bit
they<00:01:38.369> stay<00:01:38.640> where<00:01:38.850> they<00:01:38.970> are<00:01:39.180> until<00:01:39.659> his<00:01:39.869> hips

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
they stay where they are until his hips

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.330 
they stay where they are until his hips
pull<00:01:40.259> his<00:01:40.350> hands<00:01:40.590> through<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.890> zone<00:01:41.130> that's

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
pull his hands through the zone that's

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.859 
pull his hands through the zone that's
why<00:01:41.490> he's<00:01:41.670> been<00:01:41.820> able<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.090> generate<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.720> much

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
why he's been able to generate so much

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.460 
why he's been able to generate so much
pop<00:01:43.229> but<00:01:43.829> such<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> compact<00:01:44.759> swing<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:46.229> and

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
pop but such a compact swing and the and

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.289 
pop but such a compact swing and the and
essentially<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> second<00:01:47.790> thing<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:47.970> he

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
essentially the second thing that he

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.700 
essentially the second thing that he
kind<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.570> just<00:01:48.780> mastered<00:01:49.259> with<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.530> swing

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
kind of just mastered with this swing

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.230 
kind of just mastered with this swing
and<00:01:49.950> what's<00:01:50.369> amazing<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.000> he's<00:01:51.090> done

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
and what's amazing is that he's done

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.120 
and what's amazing is that he's done
this<00:01:51.360> at<00:01:51.540> such<00:01:51.720> an<00:01:51.810> early<00:01:51.960> age<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.649> think<00:01:52.829> he's

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
this at such an early age I think he's

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.010 
this at such an early age I think he's
definitely<00:01:53.340> one<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.880> premier<00:01:54.360> power

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
definitely one of the premier power

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.090 
definitely one of the premier power
hitters<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.530> game<00:01:55.680> right<00:01:55.829> now

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
hitters in the game right now

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.010 
hitters in the game right now
but<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.490> second<00:01:56.729> thing<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:56.880> he<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.899> he

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
but so the second thing that he that he

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.139 
but so the second thing that he that he
did<00:01:58.229> or<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.680> he's<00:01:58.770> doing<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.399> that<00:02:00.000> he's

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
did or that he's doing is that he's

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.639 
did or that he's doing is that he's
going<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.450> short<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.869> ball<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.259> he's<00:02:01.409> long

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
going to short to the ball and he's long

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.630 
going to short to the ball and he's long
through<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.100> mean<00:02:02.219> he's<00:02:02.369> getting

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
through it I mean he's getting

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.550 
through it I mean he's getting
incredible<00:02:03.210> extension<00:02:03.810> with<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:03.990> swing<00:02:04.320> and

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
incredible extension with the swing and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.469 
incredible extension with the swing and
what<00:02:04.740> you'll<00:02:04.860> notice<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.399> after<00:02:06.299> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
what you'll notice is that after the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.050 
what you'll notice is that after the
point<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.899> contact<00:02:07.380> after<00:02:07.590> he's<00:02:07.710> made<00:02:08.060> contact

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
point of contact after he's made contact

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.669 
point of contact after he's made contact
with<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.300> baseball<00:02:09.690> you'll<00:02:10.170> notice<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.560> his

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
with the baseball you'll notice that his

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.229 
with the baseball you'll notice that his
elbow<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.069> essentially<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.610> lockout<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.060> mean

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
elbow is essentially the lockout I mean

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:12.550 
elbow is essentially the lockout I mean
he's

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
he's

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.850 
he's
for<00:02:13.180> extension<00:02:14.180> after<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:15.020> point<00:02:15.200> of<00:02:15.380> contact

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
for extension after the point of contact

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.040 
for extension after the point of contact
and<00:02:15.980> this<00:02:16.069> is<00:02:16.220> what's<00:02:16.430> been<00:02:17.120> allowing<00:02:17.420> him<00:02:17.780> to

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
and this is what's been allowing him to

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.420 
and this is what's been allowing him to
stay<00:02:18.440> through<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.770> ball<00:02:18.950> for<00:02:19.130> as<00:02:19.220> long<00:02:19.370> as

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
stay through the ball for as long as

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.380 
stay through the ball for as long as
possible

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
possible

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.390 
possible
and<00:02:20.810> as<00:02:21.020> early<00:02:21.170> as<00:02:21.470> possible<00:02:21.500> that's<00:02:22.099> why<00:02:22.280> he's

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
and as early as possible that's why he's

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.040 
and as early as possible that's why he's
been<00:02:22.760> able<00:02:22.849> to<00:02:22.970> drive<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.569> baseball<00:02:23.900> with

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
been able to drive the baseball with

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.320 
been able to drive the baseball with
power<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.530> all<00:02:24.739> fields<00:02:25.010> from<00:02:25.250> rifle<00:02:25.819> to

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
power to all fields from rifle to

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.089 
power to all fields from rifle to
centerfield<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:27.170> left<00:02:27.410> field<00:02:27.590> it<00:02:27.860> doesn't

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
centerfield to left field it doesn't

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.370 
centerfield to left field it doesn't
matter<00:02:28.370> he<00:02:28.970> can<00:02:29.120> do<00:02:29.239> it<00:02:29.390> so<00:02:29.569> those<00:02:30.230> are

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
matter he can do it so those are

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.740 
matter he can do it so those are
