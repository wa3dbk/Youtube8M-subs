00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
on and eating up but before we put the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:23.919 
on and eating up but before we put the
batter<00:00:22.460> onto<00:00:22.849> the<00:00:23.089> waffle<00:00:23.449> maker<00:00:23.480> we<00:00:23.720> got<00:00:23.810> to

batter onto the waffle maker we got to

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:25.300 
batter onto the waffle maker we got to
make<00:00:23.990> it<00:00:24.050> better<00:00:24.289> so<00:00:24.589> what<00:00:25.039> you're<00:00:25.159> going<00:00:25.249> to

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
make it better so what you're going to

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.939 
make it better so what you're going to
do<00:00:25.519> is<00:00:25.789> basically<00:00:26.089> start<00:00:26.599> out<00:00:26.749> with<00:00:27.409> about<00:00:27.589> a

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
do is basically start out with about a

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:34.119 
do is basically start out with about a
egg<00:00:28.220> whites<00:00:31.960> and<00:00:32.960> that's<00:00:33.079> about<00:00:33.260> 8<00:00:33.590> egg<00:00:33.859> whites

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
egg whites and that's about 8 egg whites

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:36.549 
egg whites and that's about 8 egg whites
and<00:00:34.460> then<00:00:34.640> you're<00:00:34.850> going<00:00:34.969> to<00:00:35.059> add<00:00:35.210> one<00:00:36.050> cup<00:00:36.079> of

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
and then you're going to add one cup of

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.790 
and then you're going to add one cup of
oats<00:00:36.859> and<00:00:40.329> then<00:00:41.329> two<00:00:41.809> scoops<00:00:42.230> of<00:00:42.500> vanilla

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
oats and then two scoops of vanilla

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.970 
oats and then two scoops of vanilla
protein<00:00:43.160> powder<00:00:45.969> and<00:00:47.350> then<00:00:48.350> this<00:00:48.500> part<00:00:48.829> right

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
protein powder and then this part right

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.680 
protein powder and then this part right
here<00:00:49.039> is<00:00:49.340> optional<00:00:49.910> but<00:00:50.030> it's<00:00:50.210> something<00:00:50.539> that

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
here is optional but it's something that

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:51.939 
here is optional but it's something that
makes<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:51.019> batter<00:00:51.199> a<00:00:51.320> little<00:00:51.410> bit<00:00:51.679> thicker

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
makes the batter a little bit thicker

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.220 
makes the batter a little bit thicker
and<00:00:52.219> more<00:00:52.280> like<00:00:52.550> waffles<00:00:53.000> I'm<00:00:53.629> going<00:00:53.809> to<00:00:53.870> do<00:00:54.019> 2

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
and more like waffles I'm going to do 2

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.439 
and more like waffles I'm going to do 2
tablespoons<00:00:54.469> of<00:00:55.309> fat-free<00:00:55.609> cottage<00:00:56.149> cheese

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
tablespoons of fat-free cottage cheese

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.389 
tablespoons of fat-free cottage cheese
and<00:00:56.719> I<00:00:57.199> know<00:00:57.260> that<00:00:57.530> sounds<00:00:57.859> gross<00:00:58.070> but<00:00:58.100> you

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
and I know that sounds gross but you

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.790 
and I know that sounds gross but you
can't<00:00:58.609> even<00:00:58.760> taste<00:00:58.999> it<00:00:59.239> and<00:00:59.559> cottage<00:01:00.559> cheese

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
can't even taste it and cottage cheese

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.349 
can't even taste it and cottage cheese
is<00:01:01.010> actually<00:01:01.129> in<00:01:01.399> a<00:01:01.489> lot<00:01:01.609> of<00:01:01.730> smoothies<00:01:01.969> and

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
is actually in a lot of smoothies and

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:03.819 
is actually in a lot of smoothies and
stuff<00:01:02.480> but<00:01:02.839> you<00:01:02.960> just<00:01:03.109> don't<00:01:03.289> know<00:01:03.410> it

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
stuff but you just don't know it

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:10.600 
stuff but you just don't know it
so<00:01:04.280> two<00:01:04.579> tablespoons<00:01:04.759> of<00:01:05.360> this<00:01:09.400> and<00:01:10.400> then

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
so two tablespoons of this and then

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.710 
so two tablespoons of this and then
blend<00:01:10.820> that<00:01:10.850> up<00:01:10.970> for<00:01:11.360> about<00:01:11.479> a<00:01:11.540> minute<00:01:16.720> all

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
blend that up for about a minute all

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.090 
blend that up for about a minute all
right<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.140> batter<00:01:18.320> is<00:01:18.530> all<00:01:18.649> blended<00:01:18.860> up

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
right so the batter is all blended up

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.100 
right so the batter is all blended up

all<00:01:36.799> right<00:01:36.920> now<00:01:37.070> I<00:01:37.100> just<00:01:37.189> made<00:01:37.549> these<00:01:37.729> earlier

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
all right now I just made these earlier

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:39.399 
all right now I just made these earlier
and<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.479> thing<00:01:38.659> that<00:01:38.689> I<00:01:38.840> learned<00:01:39.079> is<00:01:39.200> you

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
and the thing that I learned is you

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.380 
and the thing that I learned is you
don't<00:01:39.560> want<00:01:39.680> to<00:01:39.740> pour<00:01:39.890> too<00:01:40.100> much<00:01:40.130> because<00:01:41.000> then

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
don't want to pour too much because then

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.420 
don't want to pour too much because then
the<00:01:41.659> batter<00:01:42.170> will<00:01:42.409> go<00:01:42.560> all<00:01:42.740> over<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:43.009> counter

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
the batter will go all over the counter

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.310 
the batter will go all over the counter
and<00:01:43.490> it<00:01:43.549> makes<00:01:43.729> a<00:01:43.850> mess<00:01:44.000> so<00:01:44.659> start<00:01:44.990> out<00:01:45.110> by

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
and it makes a mess so start out by

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.380 
and it makes a mess so start out by
pouring<00:01:45.710> just<00:01:45.950> a<00:01:46.100> small<00:01:46.430> amount<00:01:46.759> in<00:01:46.969> each

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
pouring just a small amount in each

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.779 
pouring just a small amount in each
waffle<00:01:47.860> whole<00:01:48.860> thing<00:01:49.189> you<00:01:49.280> don't<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.579> film

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
waffle whole thing you don't the film

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:56.529 
waffle whole thing you don't the film
all<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.030> way<00:01:50.240> up<00:01:54.549> and<00:01:55.549> I<00:01:56.060> say<00:01:56.240> you<00:01:56.329> probably

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
all the way up and I say you probably

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:05.120 
all the way up and I say you probably
should<00:01:56.840> just<00:01:56.869> fill<00:01:57.170> it<00:01:57.259> about<00:01:57.350> halfway

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.969 

all<00:02:06.130> right<00:02:06.250> so<00:02:06.430> I've<00:02:06.520> got<00:02:06.700> all<00:02:06.940> four<00:02:06.970> holes

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
all right so I've got all four holes

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.930 
all right so I've got all four holes
filled<00:02:08.979> I'm<00:02:09.190> going<00:02:09.340> to<00:02:09.400> close<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.729> lid<00:02:09.880> and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
filled I'm going to close the lid and

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.010 
filled I'm going to close the lid and
just<00:02:12.940> hope<00:02:13.120> that<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.450> doesn't<00:02:13.600> go<00:02:13.810> over<00:02:13.960> the

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
just hope that it doesn't go over the

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.780 
just hope that it doesn't go over the
edge<00:02:14.110> here<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.860> shouldn't<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.370> don't<00:02:15.520> think<00:02:15.730> I

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
edge here it shouldn't I don't think I

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.030 
edge here it shouldn't I don't think I
