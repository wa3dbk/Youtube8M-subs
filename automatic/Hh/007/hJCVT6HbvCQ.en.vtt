this<00:00:01.589> video<00:00:01.949> is<00:00:02.190> to<00:00:02.399> show<00:00:02.850> you<00:00:02.879> how<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.300> use<00:00:03.659> a

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
this video is to show you how to use a

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.670 
this video is to show you how to use a
number<00:00:04.049> line<00:00:04.230> model<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:05.190> divide<00:00:05.490> fractions

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 
number line model to divide fractions

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.140 
number line model to divide fractions
suppose<00:00:07.680> we<00:00:07.919> have<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.130> fraction<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:10.940> 3/4<00:00:11.940> and

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
suppose we have a fraction of 3/4 and

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.519 
suppose we have a fraction of 3/4 and
we'd<00:00:12.660> like<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:12.929> divide<00:00:13.410> that<00:00:13.730> by<00:00:14.730> 1/2<00:00:15.529> the

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
we'd like to divide that by 1/2 the

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.849 
we'd like to divide that by 1/2 the
first<00:00:16.800> step<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.789> draw<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.300> first<00:00:18.630> fraction

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.750 

on<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.970> number<00:00:23.970> line<00:00:24.529> the<00:00:25.529> second<00:00:25.949> step<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.340> to

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
on a number line the second step is to

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.939 
on a number line the second step is to
take<00:00:26.910> our<00:00:27.090> number<00:00:27.390> line<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.779> divided<00:00:28.650> by<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
take our number line and divided by the

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.650 
take our number line and divided by the
denominator<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.910> second<00:00:30.300> fraction<00:00:31.099> in

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
denominator of the second fraction in

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.330 
denominator of the second fraction in
this<00:00:33.660> case<00:00:33.930> we're<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.230> separating<00:00:35.160> each

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
this case we're just separating each

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.040 
this case we're just separating each
section<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:35.969> our<00:00:36.090> number<00:00:36.420> line<00:00:36.600> into<00:00:36.870> halves

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.200 

now<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.260> I've<00:00:43.350> completed<00:00:43.559> step<00:00:44.129> two<00:00:44.430> step

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
now that I've completed step two step

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.690 
now that I've completed step two step
three<00:00:45.600> involves<00:00:46.140> converting<00:00:46.920> both<00:00:47.129> fractions

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
three involves converting both fractions

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.959 
three involves converting both fractions
to<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.360> same<00:00:48.629> denominator<00:00:49.530> not<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:50.820> a

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
to the same denominator not just a

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.970 
to the same denominator not just a
common<00:00:51.480> denominator<00:00:51.629> but<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.620> common

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
common denominator but the common

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.860 
common denominator but the common
denominator<00:00:53.300> that<00:00:54.300> results<00:00:54.809> from

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
denominator that results from

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.959 
denominator that results from
multiplying<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.039> denominators<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.699> both

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
multiplying the denominators of both

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.119 
multiplying the denominators of both
fractions<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:58.260> case<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.739> need<00:00:59.100> a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
fractions in this case I need a

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.359 
fractions in this case I need a
denominator<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.879> 8<00:01:02.120> so<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.270> first<00:01:03.480> fraction

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
denominator of 8 so the first fraction

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.550 
denominator of 8 so the first fraction
becomes<00:01:05.369> 6<00:01:05.729> out<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:05.970> 8<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:07.170> second

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
becomes 6 out of 8 and the second

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.219 
becomes 6 out of 8 and the second
fraction<00:01:07.939> becomes<00:01:08.939> 4<00:01:09.330> out<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.659> 8<00:01:11.960> step<00:01:12.960> 4

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
fraction becomes 4 out of 8 step 4

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.530 
fraction becomes 4 out of 8 step 4
requires<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.250> make<00:01:14.280> arcs<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.150> see<00:01:15.360> how

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
requires that we make arcs to see how

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.830 
requires that we make arcs to see how
many<00:01:15.600> times<00:01:15.960> 1/2<00:01:16.560> can<00:01:16.920> fit<00:01:17.100> into<00:01:17.220> 3/4<00:01:17.970> we<00:01:18.659> do

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
many times 1/2 can fit into 3/4 we do

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.899 
many times 1/2 can fit into 3/4 we do
this<00:01:19.020> by<00:01:19.229> recognizing<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.040> numerator<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
this by recognizing the numerator of the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.210 
this by recognizing the numerator of the
second<00:01:21.270> fraction<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.799> number<00:01:23.189> of

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
second fraction is the number of

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.320 
second fraction is the number of
sections<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:24.150> need<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.570> each<00:01:24.720> arc<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:26.330> this

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
sections we need in each arc in this

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.030 
sections we need in each arc in this
case<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.900> need<00:01:28.110> 4<00:01:28.500> sections<00:01:29.130> for<00:01:29.400> each<00:01:29.579> arc

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
case we need 4 sections for each arc

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.069 
case we need 4 sections for each arc
that's<00:01:32.040> one<00:01:32.369> section<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.509> can<00:01:33.689> complete

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
that's one section that we can complete

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.010 
that's one section that we can complete
that<00:01:34.439> comprises<00:01:35.159> 1<00:01:35.640> 2<00:01:36.360> 3<00:01:37.020> 4<00:01:37.860> sections<00:01:38.689> now<00:01:39.689> if<00:01:39.930> I

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
that comprises 1 2 3 4 sections now if I

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.170 
that comprises 1 2 3 4 sections now if I
try<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.320> make<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> second<00:01:40.979> arc<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.729> can<00:01:41.939> see

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
try to make a second arc you can see

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.620 
try to make a second arc you can see
that<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:42.960> run<00:01:43.350> out<00:01:43.530> because<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.399> only<00:01:44.549> have<00:01:44.880> two

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
that I run out because I only have two

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.069 
that I run out because I only have two
sections<00:01:46.140> remaining<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:48.360> last<00:01:48.600> part<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.990> this

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
sense of the answer that we have we can

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.880 
sense of the answer that we have we can
see<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:55.110> only<00:01:55.439> one<00:01:55.770> full<00:01:56.640> arc<00:01:57.860> so<00:01:58.860> I

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
see that we have only one full arc so I

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.730 
see that we have only one full arc so I
write<00:01:59.280> down<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.000> have<00:02:00.329> one<00:02:00.659> whole<00:02:01.020> arc

see<00:02:04.439> how<00:02:04.680> much<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.070> left<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.670> can<00:02:06.210> see<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.570> I

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
see how much is left I can see that I

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.889 
see how much is left I can see that I
have<00:02:06.869> two<00:02:07.140> sections<00:02:07.439> left<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:09.119> know<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.869> I

quarters<00:02:27.750> is<00:02:27.960> equal<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.440> one<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.770> a<00:02:28.860> half<00:02:29.060> with

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
quarters is equal to one and a half with

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.030 
quarters is equal to one and a half with
a<00:02:30.090> number<00:02:30.450> line<00:02:30.630> model<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:31.440> do<00:02:31.620> not<00:02:31.800> actually

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
a number line model you do not actually

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.370 
a number line model you do not actually
have<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.490> reduce<00:02:32.940> your<00:02:33.000> fractions<00:02:33.780> because

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
have to reduce your fractions because

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.700 
have to reduce your fractions because
the<00:02:34.680> picture<00:02:35.070> shows<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.730> answer<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.660> one<00:02:37.410> and

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
the picture shows the answer of one and

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.830 
the picture shows the answer of one and
two<00:02:37.920> quarters<00:02:38.430> but<00:02:38.940> you<00:02:39.120> may<00:02:39.270> reduce<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.810> to

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
two quarters but you may reduce it to

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.220 
two quarters but you may reduce it to
one<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.260> half<00:02:40.470> if<00:02:40.740> you<00:02:41.010> wish
