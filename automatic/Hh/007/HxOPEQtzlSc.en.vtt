forging ahead and doing it right that

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.530 
forging ahead and doing it right that
was<00:02:50.070> a<00:02:50.100> very<00:02:50.310> dramatic<00:02:50.520> weight<00:02:51.060> with<00:02:51.240> Shelley

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
was a very dramatic weight with Shelley

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.320 
was a very dramatic weight with Shelley
I<00:02:51.720> think<00:02:51.990> with<00:02:52.140> Shelley<00:02:52.410> Winters<00:02:52.700> she<00:02:53.700> can

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
I think with Shelley Winters she can

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.320 
I think with Shelley Winters she can
overact<00:02:54.840> like<00:02:55.110> mad<00:02:55.440> in<00:02:56.370> this<00:02:56.580> performance<00:02:56.970> she

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
overact like mad in this performance she

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.370 
overact like mad in this performance she
doesn't<00:02:57.660> overact

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
doesn't overact

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.410 
doesn't overact
he<00:02:58.560> knows<00:02:58.709> upset<00:02:59.280> on<00:02:59.489> her<00:02:59.670> and<00:02:59.880> got<00:03:00.120> her<00:03:00.150> he's
