00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
I never got any good I never had the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.190 
I never got any good I never had the
discipline<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.360> the<00:00:18.420> patients<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.960> learn<00:00:19.080> to

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.200 
discipline of the patients to learn to

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.720 
discipline of the patients to learn to
get<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.380> be<00:00:19.470> good<00:00:19.590> at<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.890> but<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.369> always<00:00:20.490> liked

chess<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.360> I<00:00:21.630> think<00:00:22.939> it's<00:00:23.939> really<00:00:24.210> hard<00:00:24.390> to

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
chess and I think it's really hard to

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.060 
chess and I think it's really hard to
say<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.689> really<00:00:24.900> got<00:00:25.050> read<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.259> little<00:00:25.560> bit<00:00:25.830> about

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
it just started to meld with certain

when computers were were it was clear

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:57.860 
when computers were were it was clear
that<00:00:56.640> they<00:00:56.879> were<00:00:56.910> going<00:00:57.179> to<00:00:57.239> become<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.690> big

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
that they were going to become a big

is it gonna mean when we give our lives
over<00:01:13.800> to<00:01:13.890> computers<00:01:14.370> and<00:01:14.550> whatever<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.970> know

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060

over to computers and whatever you know
are<00:01:15.150> we<00:01:15.479> gonna<00:01:15.690> teach<00:01:16.110> them<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.440> be<00:01:16.530> like<00:01:16.650> us<00:01:16.800> or

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950

and<00:01:19.100> all<00:01:20.100> those<00:01:20.250> questions<00:01:20.670> seem<00:01:20.910> kind<00:01:21.150> of

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
and all those questions seem kind of

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.870 
and all those questions seem kind of
quaint<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.200> funny<00:01:22.710> now<00:01:23.010> that<00:01:23.340> were<00:01:23.520> we're

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
quaint and and funny now that were we're

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.290 
quaint and and funny now that were we're
so<00:01:24.030> deep<00:01:24.240> into<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.630> digital<00:01:24.780> age<00:01:25.080> but<00:01:26.270> but<00:01:27.270> I

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
so deep into the digital age but but I

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.400 
so deep into the digital age but but I
don't<00:01:27.510> think<00:01:27.630> there<00:01:27.810> are<00:01:27.840> any<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:28.020> don't<00:01:28.260> think

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
don't think there are any I don't think

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.380 
don't think there are any I don't think
I've<00:01:28.470> ever<00:01:28.620> been<00:01:28.710> answered<00:01:29.100> we<00:01:29.760> sat<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.000> an<00:01:30.210> old

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
I've ever been answered we sat on an old

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.840 
I've ever been answered we sat on an old
analog<00:01:31.230> video<00:01:31.560> tube<00:01:31.920> camera<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.430> was<00:01:32.550> from

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
analog video tube camera that was from

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.290 
analog video tube camera that was from
1969<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:34.320> particular<00:01:34.800> model<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:36.120> course

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
1969 this particular model and of course

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.640 
1969 this particular model and of course
you<00:01:36.450> find<00:01:36.660> out<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.840> thought<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.290> would<00:01:37.380> be<00:01:37.470> easy

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
you find out I thought it would be easy

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.930 
you find out I thought it would be easy
and<00:01:37.740> fun<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.010> thought<00:01:38.280> well<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.580> thing<00:01:38.730> still

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
and fun I thought well the thing still

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.850 
and fun I thought well the thing still
works<00:01:39.150> we'll<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.570> shoot<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.650> way<00:01:40.740> they

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
works we'll just shoot it the way they

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.770 
works we'll just shoot it the way they
shot<00:01:41.010> it<00:01:41.130> then<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:42.360> know<00:01:42.450> then<00:01:42.660> we'll

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
shot it then and you know then we'll

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.210 
shot it then and you know then we'll
just<00:01:42.960> transfer<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.530> digital<00:01:43.920> when<00:01:44.010> we're<00:01:44.130> done

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
just transfer to digital when we're done

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.710 
just transfer to digital when we're done
and<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:45.150> course<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.450> was<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> lot<00:01:45.660> more

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
and of course it was a lot more

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.880 
and of course it was a lot more
complicated<00:01:46.110> than<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.530> it's<00:01:46.710> it's

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
complicated than that it's it's

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.220 
complicated than that it's it's
surprisingly<00:01:47.580> difficult<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:48.270> get<00:01:48.750> your<00:01:48.930> your

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 
surprisingly difficult to get your your

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.380 
surprisingly difficult to get your your
mid<00:01:49.530> 20th<00:01:49.890> century<00:01:49.920> technology<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:51.030> up<00:01:51.240> and

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
mid 20th century technology to up and

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.200 
mid 20th century technology to up and
running<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.780> 21st<00:01:52.200> century<00:01:52.230> but<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.790> just

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
running in the 21st century but so just

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.790 
running in the 21st century but so just
many<00:01:54.390> tech<00:01:54.630> headaches<00:01:54.930> which<00:01:55.110> thank<00:01:55.500> goodness

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
many tech headaches which thank goodness

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.590 
many tech headaches which thank goodness
I<00:01:55.920> had<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.100> lot<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.340> smart<00:01:56.790> people<00:01:56.880> working<00:01:57.330> with

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
I had a lot of smart people working with

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.900 
I had a lot of smart people working with
me<00:01:57.720> who<00:01:58.130> spent<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.160> lot<00:01:59.280> more<00:01:59.310> time<00:01:59.460> figuring

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
me who spent a lot more time figuring

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.490 
me who spent a lot more time figuring
out<00:02:00.030> than<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.300> did<00:02:00.480> because<00:02:01.050> I've<00:02:01.200> been<00:02:01.350> making

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
out than I did because I've been making

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.460 
out than I did because I've been making
films<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.400> film<00:02:02.730> for<00:02:03.300> the<00:02:03.990> rest<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.350> my

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
films on film for the rest of my

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.800 
films on film for the rest of my
quote/unquote<00:02:04.950> career<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:06.360> people<00:02:06.630> always

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
quote/unquote career and people always

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.690 
quote/unquote career and people always
thought<00:02:07.650> that<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:08.009> know<00:02:08.129> they<00:02:08.220> said<00:02:08.369> well<00:02:08.580> why

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
thought that you know they said well why

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
thought that you know they said well why
didn't<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:08.940> shoot<00:02:09.060> on<00:02:09.209> film<00:02:09.360> why<00:02:09.569> do<00:02:09.629> you

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
didn't you shoot on film why do you

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.990 
didn't you shoot on film why do you
shoot<00:02:09.840> on<00:02:09.989> film<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.470> digital<00:02:10.769> age

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
shoot on film in the digital age

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.420 
shoot on film in the digital age
and<00:02:12.300> so<00:02:12.690> there<00:02:12.810> was<00:02:12.870> some<00:02:12.980> contrarian<00:02:13.980> part<00:02:14.310> of

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
and so there was some contrarian part of

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.160 
and so there was some contrarian part of
me<00:02:14.490> that<00:02:14.640> thought<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:15.630> want<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.840> see<00:02:15.930> video

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
me that thought you want to see video

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.630 
me that thought you want to see video
I'll<00:02:16.350> show<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.560> video<00:02:16.890> but<00:02:17.340> it's<00:02:17.460> going<00:02:17.580> to

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
I'll show you video but it's going to

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.750 
I'll show you video but it's going to
look<00:02:17.730> like<00:02:17.790> video<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.770> so<00:02:19.770> I<00:02:20.070> just<00:02:20.370> tried<00:02:20.670> to

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
look like video and so I just tried to

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.180 
look like video and so I just tried to
conceive<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.240> story<00:02:21.510> in<00:02:21.690> those<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.680> terms<00:02:22.950> of

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
conceive the story in those in terms of

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.530 
conceive the story in those in terms of
those<00:02:23.310> images<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.240> were<00:02:24.360> running

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
those images that that were running

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.120 
those images that that were running
through<00:02:24.780> my<00:02:24.900> head<00:02:25.850> on<00:02:26.850> this<00:02:27.060> camera<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:28.070> and<00:02:29.070> I

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
through my head on this camera and and I

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.320 
through my head on this camera and and I
loved<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.550> mean<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:30.180> certainly

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
loved it I mean you you certainly

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.580 
loved it I mean you you certainly
couldn't<00:02:30.660> make<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:30.930> movie<00:02:31.230> on<00:02:31.320> any<00:02:31.440> other

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
couldn't make this movie on any other

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.890 
couldn't make this movie on any other
camera<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.460> really<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.330> really<00:02:33.390> good<00:02:33.690> loved

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
camera and I really I really good loved

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.710 
camera and I really I really good loved
it<00:02:34.050> for<00:02:34.710> years<00:02:34.950> I've<00:02:35.160> been<00:02:35.600> thinking<00:02:36.600> I've

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
it for years I've been thinking I've

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.180 
it for years I've been thinking I've
really<00:02:36.900> got<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.110> figure<00:02:37.230> out<00:02:37.470> how<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.710> make<00:02:38.160> a

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
really got to figure out how to make a

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.860 
really got to figure out how to make a
steady<00:02:38.670> living<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.090> mean<00:02:39.270> I<00:02:39.390> think<00:02:39.450> like<00:02:39.690> most

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
steady living I mean I think like most

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.390 
steady living I mean I think like most
people<00:02:40.230> I've<00:02:40.350> certainly<00:02:40.800> I've<00:02:41.010> had<00:02:41.160> teaching

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
people I've certainly I've had teaching

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.650 
people I've certainly I've had teaching
gigs<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:43.760> I've<00:02:44.760> been<00:02:44.970> very<00:02:45.150> lucky<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.480> have<00:02:45.600> a

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
gigs and I've been very lucky to have a

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.180 
gigs and I've been very lucky to have a
couple<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:46.080> Hollywood<00:02:46.500> writing<00:02:46.770> gigs<00:02:46.980> it's

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
couple of Hollywood writing gigs it's

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.470 
couple of Hollywood writing gigs it's
not<00:02:47.340> something<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:47.700> figured<00:02:48.030> out<00:02:48.150> how<00:02:48.270> to<00:02:48.330> do

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
not something I figured out how to do

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.260 
not something I figured out how to do
super<00:02:49.470> sustainably<00:02:50.070> I<00:02:50.370> don't<00:02:50.790> know<00:02:50.850> when<00:02:51.240> or

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
super sustainably I don't know when or

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.270 
super sustainably I don't know when or
where<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.690> next<00:02:51.810> one<00:02:52.020> might<00:02:52.230> be<00:02:52.320> coming<00:02:52.680> but

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
where the next one might be coming but

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.280 
where the next one might be coming but
but<00:02:53.970> that's<00:02:54.060> certainly<00:02:54.480> that's<00:02:54.600> my<00:02:54.750> favorite

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
but that's certainly that's my favorite

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.320 
but that's certainly that's my favorite
way<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.470> pay<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.709> rent<00:02:55.890> because<00:02:56.100> you<00:02:56.459> get<00:02:56.640> paid

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
way to pay the rent because you get paid

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.820 
way to pay the rent because you get paid
the<00:02:57.390> most<00:02:57.780> for<00:02:58.170> doing<00:02:58.560> fun<00:02:58.800> work<00:03:00.350> but<00:03:01.350> I<00:03:01.590> don't

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830

behind it and a little more invested

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.080 
behind it and a little more invested
behind<00:03:22.320> it<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:22.709> we<00:03:22.920> had<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.220> great<00:03:23.580> time<00:03:23.910> with

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.390 
behind it so we had a great time with
them<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:25.170> worked<00:03:25.380> out<00:03:25.500> fantastically

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290

mean we knew we were making a very

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.080 
mean we knew we were making a very
strange<00:03:34.140> in<00:03:34.980> many<00:03:35.070> ways<00:03:35.190> wildly<00:03:35.730> uncommercial

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
movie and we knew we were not going to

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.930 
movie and we knew we were not going to
get<00:03:39.180> conventional<00:03:39.720> funding<00:03:40.019> for<00:03:40.200> it<00:03:40.350> so<00:03:40.940> very

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940
