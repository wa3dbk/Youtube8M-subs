00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.340
 if you have windows 8.1 on a computer 

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:11.860
 install add teacher now times as 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.990
 18.1 on a virtual computer with 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.000
 windows 8 point 1a as you have to 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.859
 after choosing the installation options 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.240
 have selected and the installation 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.350
 always want to perform one 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.240
 enter Serialnumber 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.070
 Of course there are also editions of 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.289
 windows 8.1 for example for the 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.909
 enterprise version or volume licenses 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.499
 where you have this serial number here 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:31.029
 do not have to specify at most 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:33.550
 But that is the case 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.410
 to work around this problem if you 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.090
 For example, several company computers 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.190
 but do not want to install each time 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.260
 want to give the edition 1 or the 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.880
 serial number you can in a file 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.830
 within the installation 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.230
 corresponding changes 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.700
 make and settings already fixed 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.800
 deposit so that you have the installation 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.160
 even without a serial number perform 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.690
 want 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.060
 pity this virtual 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.430
 I do not need him computer 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.680
 I have more on my computer 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.060
 already a bootable usb stick 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.700
 create that is one of the advantages 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.780
 if you have windows 8.1 from a usb-stick 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.829
 from install 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.049
 this now contains the 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:10.780
 installation files of windows 8.1 and 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:13.770
 in the directory sources you can now 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:19.270
 just create a new text file 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.100
 Pay attention to the term i-point cfg 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.650
 Make sure the file is with you 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.100
 not the change contains txt but 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.930
 really i-point cfg when joining this 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.390
 memory already a file is me 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.520
 have here already a file created 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.260
 find this by giving one 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.450
 you can change the content of this file by 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.330
 Double-click to use it 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.799
 just the editor and here you can see 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.530
 now the different possibilities 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.810
 you have to do the installation too 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.460
 simplify 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.130
 which version will be installed 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.350
 Determine them by doing this idea 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.210
 Either enter enterprise 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.220
 but it is also about one 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.110
 The price of the volume is from the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.320
 you have copied the file if you have 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.140
 to give a freeze - 8.1 professional 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.760
 installed when she will give a choir 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.280
 windows 8.1 in the smallest version 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.590
 Installed channel you can either 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.519
 on volume or retail that remains 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.220
 leave to them 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.700
 It is still important for volume licenses 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.000
 either a 1 or a 1 0 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.820
 save it now 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.270
 this file in the directory on your usb 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.820
 stick like me here you can windows 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.290
 8.1 in the one you want 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.210
 installation without the input of a 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.070
 install serial number of course 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.230
 you must after installation in 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.150
 windows 8.1 enter all serial number 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.220
 then they either do that over the 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.160
 properties of computer or by 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.440
 you enter it on the home page 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.180
 I open the home page and give that 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.170
 tool slx 1 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.390
 With this I can make a new one 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.590
 enter serial number in windows 8.1 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.780
 Here you can then the 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.640
 Enter the product key you want 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.970
 the activation of windows 8.1 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.130
 Of course, in simple terms 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.900
 So you can use windows 8.1 without the 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.760
 Entering a serial number during the 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.940
 install by installing a 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.440
 file epunkt cfg in the directory sources 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.040
 of the installation volume 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.080
 create 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.850
 enter this text here and then 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.550
 according to the columns edition 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.900
 channel or vl specify what they are 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.520
 and they want to install on 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.250
 The easiest way is when you are here 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.769
 vl So volume license a 1 register 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.660
 for channel also volume or retail 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.430
 they just have to try that out and 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.120
 at the edition the edition you 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.750
 So you want to install core pro or 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.750
 in the price
