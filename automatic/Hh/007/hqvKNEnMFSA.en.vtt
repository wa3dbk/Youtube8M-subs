00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
now the second one here is going to be

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.580 
now the second one here is going to be
called<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.460> amorous<00:01:21.119> Congress<00:01:21.659> if<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.259> had<00:01:22.409> to

wait a way to name it basically what
that<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.560> it's<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.369> guess<00:01:26.729> like<00:01:26.909> an<00:01:27.060> 1800s

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
that is is it's I guess like an 1800s

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.080 
that is is it's I guess like an 1800s
expression<00:01:28.380> for<00:01:28.590> sex<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:29.130> don't<00:01:29.369> know<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.939> was

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
expression for sex I don't know that was

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.999 
expression for sex I don't know that was
the<00:01:30.420> best<00:01:30.450> thing<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:31.079> could<00:01:31.350> come<00:01:31.560> with<00:01:31.590> I

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
the best thing that I could come with I

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.149 
the best thing that I could come with I
kind<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.460> wanted<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.759> keep<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.180> Jacobs<00:01:33.630> theme

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
kind of wanted to keep the Jacobs theme

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.179 
kind of wanted to keep the Jacobs theme
but<00:01:35.570> there<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.720> go<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.290> what<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:37.740> thing<00:01:37.979> is

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
but there you go so what this thing is

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.819 
but there you go so what this thing is
is<00:01:38.430> it's<00:01:38.610> essentially<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.180> mix<00:01:39.570> between<00:01:40.290> a

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
is it's essentially a mix between a

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.990 
is it's essentially a mix between a
Jacobs<00:01:41.780> bushwhack<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:43.049> believe<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:44.250> Sharia

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
Jacobs bushwhack I believe the Sharia

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.050 
Jacobs bushwhack I believe the Sharia
army<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.540> sniper<00:01:46.020> rifle<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.549> think<00:01:47.909> it's

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
army a sniper rifle and I think it's

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.690 
army a sniper rifle and I think it's
also<00:01:48.270> mixed<00:01:49.170> sort<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:49.950> with<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.189> heartbreaker

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
also mixed sort of with the heartbreaker

and<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:07.790> creamer<00:02:08.180> and<00:02:08.540> I<00:02:08.690> like<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:09.080> call<00:02:09.229> this

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
and the creamer and I like to call this

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.870 
and the creamer and I like to call this
one<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:09.710> ice<00:02:10.100> queen

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
this one actually turned out really

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.600 
this one actually turned out really
bizarre<00:02:13.730> I<00:02:14.510> wanted<00:02:15.200> this<00:02:15.350> to<00:02:15.590> have<00:02:15.800> full<00:02:16.310> ice

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
bizarre I wanted this to have full ice

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.060 
bizarre I wanted this to have full ice
projectiles<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.780> everything<00:02:18.230> but<00:02:18.680> what<00:02:18.890> this

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
projectiles and everything but what this

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.150 
projectiles and everything but what this
does<00:02:19.340> is<00:02:19.640> it<00:02:19.760> fires<00:02:20.150> an<00:02:20.480> initial<00:02:21.160> projectile

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
does is it fires an initial projectile

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.290 
does is it fires an initial projectile
that<00:02:22.910> is<00:02:23.330> an<00:02:23.600> ice<00:02:24.110> explosion<00:02:24.950> but<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.820> little

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
that is an ice explosion but the little

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.110 
that is an ice explosion but the little
baby<00:02:26.960> projectiles<00:02:27.740> that<00:02:28.130> are<00:02:28.280> typical<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:28.820> the

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
baby projectiles that are typical to the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.930 
baby projectiles that are typical to the
creamer<00:02:29.740> actually<00:02:30.740> are<00:02:30.890> explosive<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:31.850> you

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
creamer actually are explosive so you

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.570 
creamer actually are explosive so you
can<00:02:32.210> get<00:02:32.360> like<00:02:32.600> this<00:02:33.170> weird<00:02:33.650> dual<00:02:34.070> element

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
can get like this weird dual element

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.710 
can get like this weird dual element
thing<00:02:34.940> going<00:02:35.300> on

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
thing going on

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.600 
thing going on
depending<00:02:36.110> on<00:02:36.230> your<00:02:36.440> distance<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.160> you'll

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
depending on your distance and you'll

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.090 
depending on your distance and you'll
see<00:02:37.820> a<00:02:37.850> little<00:02:38.150> bit<00:02:38.420> of<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.690> here<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.290> that

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
see a little bit of that here and that

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.000 
see a little bit of that here and that
is<00:02:40.430> pretty<00:02:40.820> interesting<00:02:41.090> as<00:02:41.690> well<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:42.260> this

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
is pretty interesting as well and this

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.640 
is pretty interesting as well and this
was<00:02:43.250> actually<00:02:43.550> an<00:02:43.970> in<00:02:44.090> total<00:02:44.900> accident

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
was actually an in total accident

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.949 
was actually an in total accident
now<00:02:46.310> it's<00:02:46.610> I<00:02:46.880> don't<00:02:46.940> know<00:02:47.150> if<00:02:47.300> I<00:02:47.390> actually<00:02:47.540> said

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
now it's I don't know if I actually said

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.690 
now it's I don't know if I actually said
what<00:02:48.140> I<00:02:48.170> wanted<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.590> call<00:02:48.770> this<00:02:48.980> thing<00:02:49.190> I'd

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
what I wanted to call this thing I'd

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.120 
what I wanted to call this thing I'd
like<00:02:49.880> to<00:02:50.030> call<00:02:50.180> it<00:02:50.270> the<00:02:50.330> ice<00:02:50.540> queen<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.860> then

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
like to call it the ice queen and then

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.640 
like to call it the ice queen and then
of<00:02:52.280> course<00:02:52.520> if<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:52.790> had<00:02:52.970> red<00:02:53.209> text<00:02:53.690> it's

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
of course if it had red text it's

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.170 
of course if it had red text it's
probably<00:02:55.190> going<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.400> say<00:02:55.610> something<00:02:55.910> like

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
probably going to say something like

probably going to say something like
double<00:02:56.630> knockout<00:02:57.220> something<00:02:58.220> cool<00:02:58.400> like<00:02:58.430> that
