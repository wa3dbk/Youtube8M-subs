have local volunteers from a plugger

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.860 
have local volunteers from a plugger
areas<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.290> in<00:03:28.379> our<00:03:28.500> stations

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.840 

intensity<00:03:32.650> of<00:03:32.740> the<00:03:32.860> fire<00:03:33.100> was<00:03:33.310> partly<00:03:33.640> because

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
intensity of the fire was partly because

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.350 
intensity of the fire was partly because
of<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.330> age<00:03:34.780> in<00:03:34.990> which<00:03:35.550> my<00:03:36.550> recollection<00:03:37.270> of

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
of the age in which my recollection of

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.830 
of the age in which my recollection of
built<00:03:37.600> in<00:03:37.830> 1940

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
built in 1940

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.990 
built in 1940
so<00:03:40.410> obviously<00:03:40.950> you've<00:03:41.069> got<00:03:41.250> one<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.459> lot<00:03:41.700> of<00:03:41.819> old

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
so obviously you've got one a lot of old

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.850 
so obviously you've got one a lot of old
wood<00:03:42.360> a<00:03:42.390> lot<00:03:42.660> of<00:03:42.720> old<00:03:42.959> material<00:03:43.530> that<00:03:43.739> is

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
wood a lot of old material that is

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.130 
wood a lot of old material that is
essentially<00:03:44.700> a<00:03:44.730> tinderbox<00:03:45.090> that<00:03:45.599> the<00:03:45.959> main

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
essentially a tinderbox that the main

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.510 
essentially a tinderbox that the main
problem<00:03:46.530> in<00:03:46.620> battling<00:03:46.920> ablaze

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
problem in battling ablaze

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.120 
problem in battling ablaze
that's<00:03:48.000> correct<00:03:48.270> and<00:03:48.590> there's<00:03:49.590> been<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:49.920> lot<00:03:50.099> of

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
that's correct and there's been a lot of

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.690 
that's correct and there's been a lot of
remodeling<00:03:50.730> in<00:03:50.880> those<00:03:51.060> years

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
remodeling in those years

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.960 
remodeling in those years
there<00:03:52.030> are<00:03:52.180> some<00:03:52.420> false<00:03:52.629> even<00:03:53.080> spaces<00:03:53.560> which

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
there are some false even spaces which

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.250 
there are some false even spaces which
will<00:03:54.970> actually<00:03:55.180> hide<00:03:55.569> the<00:03:55.720> fire<00:03:55.900> until<00:03:56.050> it

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
will actually hide the fire until it

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.980 
will actually hide the fire until it
breaks<00:03:56.470> out

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990
