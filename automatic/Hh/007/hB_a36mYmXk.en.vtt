00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:12.039
 so hello to all and all his possessions 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:13.809
 in this sense you believe today we are 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:15.789
 found for the third episode of 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.199
 asus endurists so today everything 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.890
 we'll just see how to install 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:23.499
 a strap in the front his bike for that he 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.310
 will you need a strap so to little 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:31.480
 almost we will say the handlebars to 10 cm more 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.280
 long that the yellow spinnaker so here 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.559
 so just a strap goes 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:42.129
 have to make holes but I have one 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:45.989
 here one here here is it 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:51.000
 after you need two types of fork 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.000
 we really have it really 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:01:01.320
 so we will pass the strap like those 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.320
 behind youtube and we will do it 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.680
 return 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.580
 so when you will have that little bit boring 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.630
 that you can also put a little 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.580
 kick to prevent this from happening 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.270
 so here is not huge there is 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.300
 do not really need 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.850
 you also need screws all 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.850
 simply to hang the strap 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.370
 so I use davis with a head of 10 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.540
 and a nut of 10 also suddenly and I 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.640
 would like me to advise you to put 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.390
 washers to prevent your life 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.390
 happens through 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.909
 Ouch 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.420
 k 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.200
 so there is little advice also the past 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.700
 not at the beginning when I had disassemble that 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.160
 I wanted to go back I told myself I 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.570
 going to pass here that will prevent it 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.190
 walk too much but in fact you must not 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.259
 because when you go to shoot 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.640
 it's going to pull you on the cable so you 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.410
 do not do it is the same outside 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.030
 method that for just now 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.060
 the outside we pass to 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:25.060
 inside the tube after you have more 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:26.470
 than to catch it and pass the vice the 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.930
 two pucks and the chronicles all 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:34.660
 simply as I told you the screw 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:37.600
 with the puck you are passing in 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.280
 the first part did not really 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.240
 is obvious that we have to find the hole 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:47.620
 and the small the screw is taken 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.060
 quite easily in the fibers like 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.580
 you can see it but once 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.350
 it's good but after we go 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.350
 pass in the second small hole 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.800
 that one is easier 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.330
 so we will also put the puck so 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.160
 a washer on each side to the head 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.650
 and to the fangs to avoid so they 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:18.920
 pass through the hole and that your 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:23.000
 so seems to be still hanging out 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.819
 same visnic of 10 not need to 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.319
 a lot tight it's not really about 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.230
 to vibrations more than that so it's 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.890
 fabric and the fabric that encompasses the 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.220
 fork 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.530
 it is not it so depreciates the 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.640
 vibrations and anyway that's this challenge 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.019
 will not be alone 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.870
 must still tell me it's a little but 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:47.750
 no need for a greenhouse and it will do more 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:50.599
 qu'abîmé there seems here the assembled 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.430
 ee is so there you have enough room 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.390
 to place both hands and even a 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.310
 or two people who can pass 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.830
 their mast and here I can assure you that 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.160
 you have an excellent catch 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.930
 it's really top top I have a lot of 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.540
 buddies who so who helped me and 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.150
 rubbish was really good and even 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.620
 for you that can allow you to 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.840
 mount the codes easily precisely if 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.609
 your friends help you 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.380
 here it is here so I'm the scene that 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.549
 got out so she's orange on a 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.260
 cheerfulness so you're gonna find 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.459
 straps everywhere in the 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.060
 DIY stores I have same day 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:26.330
 in the supermarket here voila I want 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.080
 I hope you liked this little tutorial and 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.380
