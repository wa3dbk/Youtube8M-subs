00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:07.299
 for them good guys very good and 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.130
 we are in another video more than black ops 2 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.289
 this time is that when good because 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.599
 We have in Yucatan as you see with the 94 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.949
 of diamond the very nice ones of 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.770
 diamond soul I have to say one 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:19.390
 of those that I like and today I'm going to 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.590
 comment a few things about the 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.500
 road to gold is I want to say also 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.180
 Well, a few things that I've seen in 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.860
 some comments of the video that looks and 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.080
 many of the comments that you put me 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.970
 in the video of you decide what 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.250
 I told you that I had planned to do 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.339
 another steals your goal and the first thing that 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.809
 is that I already know that the one in the 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:39.249
 Remington had already done so much 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.050
 Many of you did it to me 

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:43.510
 I refer before summer last year 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.980
 I do not know what I know, I remember, I mean, 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.120
 agreement of them I know that I made protocol of 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.469
 the magazine was therefore exactly 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.420
 why I wanted to do it again 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.159
 because format that I liked a lot and 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.219
 that I think right now it would whistle 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:56.289
 because he was very moved besides 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.899
 we had low and a hundred part games 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.309
 only with the gun and I think it would be 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.409
 a very entertaining goal goal and that we 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.659
 It would be very cool for everyone to see but 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.970
 besides that as I said enough 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.530
 comments and I saw many of your 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.420
 proposals 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.100
 We recommend you to do in 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.020
 weapons and I have to say that thanks to 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.220
 We 're going to change our weapon and I'm not going 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.290
 to make the remington that many of 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.030
 you also looked good but yes 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.920
 than reading a few comments 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.450
 a few enough you who 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.020
 you were sure I had is the same 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.820
 idea and I'm going to do it from lac sg because 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.200
 good the house that is a weapon that is more 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.690
 difficult to use is a weapon that 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.340
 I still have not done anything with her 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.680
 and being more difficult to use then 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.479
 will give more as more more show no or is not 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.740
 is that it is a weapon that is very bad but 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.970
 yes that is a weapon that only then 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.660
 As you know, it has a shot and that if 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.800
 failures then the safest thing is that you die 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.729
 morala francop eta of always that the 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.130
 we have known 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.020
 here in the black ops 2 then I'm going to 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.460
 do it to your goal of the caixa that as 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.259
 is going to go up for the time of that I say it for 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.819
 the new ones that are in the channel that do not 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.590
 Follow me from the good year of the year 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.960
 last when when this last time 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.190
 so this works from the fact that 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.420
 I 'm going to keep uploading a video 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.729
 diary that will not steal your goal during 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.289
 At least one week two weeks 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.610
 I do not know exactly what it will cost me 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.289
 record it 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.580
 but while I 'm going to record the 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.230
 road to ball what does this mean that 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.450
 once it is finished it will be when 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.010
 I always do the same because I 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.080
 like to have everything tasted all right well 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.939
 your daily wine as you see it and what 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.099
 I have everything ready when you know 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:22.360
 when the road world starts because you 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.040
 will say the best because well I have some 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.150
 days today I have x chapters but not you 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.439
 I will say exactly the day that 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.909
 start because I've always liked 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:29.140
 do it in the same way those who are 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.700
 old in the channel, obviously already 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.409
 you know and it's when you see a 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.319
 video that would be a weird way by 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:36.760
 example the one of the hurdler yes that me 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.319
 agreement that is called we are already here 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.510
 I left the title, we're here 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.280
 ellipsis and a streak with 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.690
 the bass player with music so he was 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.069
 very cool and I like to do things like that 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.900
 to say like that the next day 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.760
 use immediately when you climb that 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.530
 video and say that the next day you go 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.329
 to have the goal of that weapon then it's 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.650
 something that I did not give myself for making myself 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.329
 everyone liked it very much and it's something I want 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.069
 keep doing it because it's like I do not know 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.590
 I could say with a tradition not in the 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.049
 channel and the truth is that it's cool 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.180
 it's really cool then Roberto because I know 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.190
 that is going to be finally kids so 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.709
 the truth I like it is also a weapon that 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.870
 which I have not used much are the 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.730
 that you know then that those who are here 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.579
 you've known for a long time that you've never 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.840
 been my weapon how to say the street that no 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.480
 it's a weapon that I've been using 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.710
 a lot because I do not know I've never finished 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.930
 a lot but today 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.540
 if we're going to do a little while goal, it's going to molar 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.280
 pretty green that's what happens and how 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.260
 how it ends not especially how it ends 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.910
 what games do we get in why we 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.210
 It's cool to everyone, it means this 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.800
 we are not going to have clear Gothic no no 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.910
 because irec turning the videos like 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.830
 now for example you have had these 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.330
 last three days of black ops 2 and before 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.800
 of that you have had August 6 so 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.240
 I'm going to turn the videos 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.400
 I'm going to go up everything that we like to 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.470
 everyone and we're going to be all happy and 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.090
 happy and then squeeze out with the 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.710
 they follow kids and you know how to give me 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.500
 like favorites put me the comments 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.240

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.650
 will be almost at the end so nothing 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.600
