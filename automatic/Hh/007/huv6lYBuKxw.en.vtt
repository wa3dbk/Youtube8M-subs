00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
got a row of signs what's below that

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.070 
got a row of signs what's below that
doesn't<00:01:18.810> matter<00:01:18.979> it's<00:01:19.979> up<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:21.119> in

doesn't matter it's up to you and in

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.749 
doesn't matter it's up to you and in

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
fact here the signs are preventing the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.780 
fact here the signs are preventing the
water<00:01:23.939> from<00:01:24.210> going<00:01:24.360> down<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.790> what's

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
water from going down and what's

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.660 
water from going down and what's
happening<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.810> monsters<00:01:28.320> drop<00:01:29.159> in<00:01:29.369> here

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
happening is the monsters drop in here

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.700 
happening is the monsters drop in here
and<00:01:29.850> are<00:01:30.240> floating<00:01:31.079> around<00:01:31.200> as<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.979> can<00:01:32.189> see

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
and are floating around as you can see

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.649 
and are floating around as you can see
basically<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.280> little<00:01:35.850> bit<00:01:36.030> lower<00:01:36.240> than<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
basically it a little bit lower than the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.969 
basically it a little bit lower than the
steps<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.369> by<00:01:38.369> chance<00:01:38.759> or<00:01:39.090> by<00:01:39.530> if<00:01:40.530> it's<00:01:40.770> too

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
steps and by chance or by if it's too

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.460 
steps and by chance or by if it's too
many<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.369> here<00:01:41.610> they're<00:01:41.850> get<00:01:42.030> pushed<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:44.060> get

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
many in here they're get pushed and get

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.950 
many in here they're get pushed and get
taken<00:01:46.470> away<00:01:46.560> with<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.979> water<00:01:47.189> streams

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
taken away with the water streams

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.690 
taken away with the water streams
sometimes<00:01:48.960> mobs<00:01:49.470> directly<00:01:50.070> drop<00:01:50.399> on<00:01:50.579> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
sometimes mobs directly drop on the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.210 
sometimes mobs directly drop on the
legend<00:01:51.149> just<00:01:51.450> get<00:01:51.630> sucked<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.140> sometimes<00:01:52.979> they

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
legend just get sucked in sometimes they

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.520 
legend just get sucked in sometimes they

mobs that I was satisfied so I

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.910 
mobs that I was satisfied so I
implemented<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:43.000> second<00:02:43.470> saying<00:02:44.470> it's<00:02:44.800> the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
implemented a second saying it's the

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.940 
implemented a second saying it's the
same<00:02:45.160> design<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:46.180> one<00:02:47.080> little<00:02:47.260> thing<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.770> it

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
same design and one little thing to it

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.670 
same design and one little thing to it
below<00:02:48.400> here<00:02:48.880> you<00:02:49.210> can<00:02:49.420> see<00:02:49.630> why<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:49.900> know<00:02:50.140> but

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
below here you can see why I know but

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.450 
below here you can see why I know but
there<00:02:50.920> is<00:02:51.160> definitely<00:02:51.960> one<00:02:52.960> block<00:02:53.260> latch<00:02:53.620> the

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
there is definitely one block latch the

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.270 
there is definitely one block latch the
monsters<00:02:54.850> will<00:02:55.060> have<00:02:55.890> easier<00:02:56.890> that<00:02:57.070> way<00:02:57.100> to

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
monsters will have easier that way to

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.190 
monsters will have easier that way to
plant<00:02:57.670> in<00:02:57.880> it<00:02:58.030> works<00:02:58.270> without<00:02:58.510> them<00:02:58.870> but<00:02:59.170> I

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200
