00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.229 

mmm<00:00:42.830> I<00:00:42.980> believe<00:00:43.370> he<00:00:43.489> is<00:00:43.610> very<00:00:43.820> precise<00:00:44.210> with

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
mmm I believe he is very precise with

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.810 
mmm I believe he is very precise with
his<00:00:44.480> passes<00:00:45.110> he<00:00:45.500> never<00:00:45.769> misses<00:00:46.010> them<00:00:46.309> he<00:00:46.610> never

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
his passes he never misses them he never

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.470 
his passes he never misses them he never
makes<00:00:47.000> errors<00:00:47.300> when<00:00:47.660> passing<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:48.230> ball

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.700 

without<00:00:53.480> a<00:00:53.690> doubt<00:00:54.019> he<00:00:54.260> has<00:00:54.350> been<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:54.620> most

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
without a doubt he has been the most

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.680 
without a doubt he has been the most
influential<00:00:55.280> player

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.750

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
I think someone touched him with the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.340 
I think someone touched him with the
magic<00:01:02.090> wand<00:01:02.120> so<00:01:02.780> that<00:01:02.899> he<00:01:02.960> can<00:01:03.109> score

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
magic wand so that he can score

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.380 
magic wand so that he can score
important<00:01:03.800> goals<00:01:04.040> like<00:01:04.580> the<00:01:04.699> one<00:01:04.879> at<00:01:04.909> Stanford

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390
