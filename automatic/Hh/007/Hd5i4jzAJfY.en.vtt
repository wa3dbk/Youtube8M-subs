00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:14.570
 hello then this is the video that does 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.029
 part of my lipstick series 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.770
 color categories this time we are 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.840
 in the pink category 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.310
 I must say that I thought I had more 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.900
 difficulty on burgundy burgundy wants 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.759
 I had more colors in there 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.970
 difficulty choosing my own 5 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.930
 favorite on shades of pink 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.510
 unbelievable but true I would never have it 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.600
 however we said we did it 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.350
 made a school a skimming and me them 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.290
 I show 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.930
 I am certainly starting from that one more 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.450
 economic and is of the essence 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.610
 how do you see the old packaging now 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.170
 this in disuse and among other things I don't know 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.699
 not even if there is still this 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.789
 coloring that is this is called here 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:02.510
 12 sparkling miracle that I believe is said 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:06.410
 so and this is this beautiful pink 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.690
 very bright pink and even glittery pink 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.280
 as you can see I used it a lot 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:15.289
 this one also votes him to use 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:19.880
 because why this usual lipstick 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:21.920
 corato seto zero sorry sorry yes 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.920
 particularly suited as a tone and 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.810
 as a type of color to mine 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.240
 undertone of skin I find that though 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.040
 I put almost nothing on my face and put it on 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.939
 a little bit of this lipstick is a bit of 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.229
 mascara 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:40.340
 just gives me an idea of ​​where to say 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:42.320
 i like it here i like it 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.360
 I don't know how to see it on my lips 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.009
 explain the color 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.170
 I'll show you this in between 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.119
 the other I must say that of this lipstick 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.390
 notwithstanding it is of these so 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.500
 cheap the color is there sorry i 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.110
 glitter sini are not felt 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.270
 on the lips so I like this thing 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.040
 a lot because they bother you and 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.840
 gene when the settlers are always heard 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.430
 on the lips that fat is not the 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.850
 maximum of life 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.740
 then another that surely is gone 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.660
 I 'm very sorry because this is me 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.790
 line really liked a lot and kiko 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.680
 and it is this to which it is crushed red 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.630
 It was very nice and also the design 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:24.690
 number 103 and this is what you see 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.989
 also this rather worn pink 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.760
 decidedly different is a lot more pink 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:35.850
 more tenuous and a lipstick really share 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.890
 very nice really a nice touch of pink 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:43.170
 without being exaggerated in any way 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.120
 as you will see next to this yes 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.720
 will see very little but I have to say that on 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:53.280
 his lips does it and he says it 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.530
 obviously this here and not just about 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.720
 those very resistant this one 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.299
 little more even when it fades away 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.860
 a little superficial effect a little 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.769
 glitter sini is a light color and is 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.049
 leave this one of those who are with it 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.370
 the lipstick scheeren itself for itself is a 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.410
 so much sticky then not 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.870
 it vanishes right away though 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.610
 in short, keep in mind that it is not found 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.239
 more unfortunately 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.340
 then another lipstick than at least not 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.630
 it was then repeated in the series of 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.000
 miss pupa this is not found 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:30.959
 of the pink in the pupa a 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.579
 this this series here and I don't know if 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.950
 you can read it because everything is beautiful 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:38.329
 mirrored however this and is a 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:43.079
 fantastic color was the number 02 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:45.069
 number 02 the one used this had come out 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:48.969
 with the spring collection 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.219
 and it was this bright pink beautiful 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:53.590
 this really has a long life 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:56.349
 because even when he wiped away the 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.560
 superficial part the color is seen 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.510
 always very much to a beautiful one 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.099
 consistency and very creamy and a share 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.810
 he also has this here and this 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:11.739
 magnificent this lipstick is one of mine 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.459
 absolute favorite just beautiful 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.419
 nice nice 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:18.039
 I do not know, however, if they have proposed it again in 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.989
 then collection of miss pupa they have 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.970
 precisely the same packaging that I am 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.759
 come out a little later just the jensen 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.099
 roses always poop another 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:29.800
 product that I like a lot and me 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:31.570
 I bought this in the outlet and I have 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.280
 discovered today also the 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.150
 great convenience of buying it in 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.289
 outlet takes on glossy lips in this case 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.250
 in addition to 0 2 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:43.840
 and it is this fantastic rose that between 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.479
 the other is what he brings in 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.419
 this time the use is very often 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:53.380
 these here made the color of the pencil 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:56.680
 where I put it, let's put the color here 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.360
 this one is a very natural pink but 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:04.270
 I find it really beautiful on the lips 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:07.229
 and this and these pencils are from 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.810
 lots of colors in the outlet 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.470
 I took them before Christmas began 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.970
 December 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:19.060
 and it seems to me that one costs 4 euros if any 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.639
 take two the second costs you one euro 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.780
 really a bullshit I discovered today 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:28.210
 that there are still in perfumery and 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.880
 they cost almost 10 euros 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.650
 I don't remember if precisely if 9 euros 89 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.780
 euros and 90 anyway such a thing 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.090
 almost 10 euros for which there is one 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.249
 hallucinating convenience the product is 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.979
 good colors there are a lot 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:44.909
 12 some I gave them to mine 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:47.199
 girlfriends I find myself really very well 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:49.149
 I'm really a lipstick all over the place 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.939
 all the sound but I have nothing to say 

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:54.819
 and they last long enough 

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:55.539
 comfortable I like moisturizers 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:58.299
 lot 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:01.329
 last is the most expensive product e 

00:05:58.299 --> 00:06:04.449
 got last is one of mine 

00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:06.039
 favorite items of yves saint laurent 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:09.999
 see the strange thing is that it does not have the 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:13.479
 color because some and roll cross lights 

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:14.979
 wanted in this case I do not know if 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:17.219
 I can show you why the writing 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:22.029
 they are really small behind these 

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:24.699
 this one at 103 some don't have 

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:26.829
 just the color I did remained there 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:31.539
 very badly when I saw the color 

00:06:26.829 --> 00:06:36.399
 here behind the loghetto and white is a 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:37.529
 beautiful rose with this very effect 

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:40.119
 particular 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:41.919
 these lipsticks have a finish that 

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:45.939
 I have never encountered anyone else 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:48.639
 type of lipstick look almost liquid 

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:50.349
 when you go to put it slip that 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:54.159
 it seems like oh, it looks like butter, but instead 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:56.019
 they are very precise they fix themselves not there 

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:58.139
 take away more I'm always there with you 

00:06:56.019 --> 00:07:01.119
 they have wonderful colors 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:03.939
 the color is this 

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:05.889
 I hope to be able to show you that 

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:09.639
 creaminess first of all because they are 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:12.639
 creamy like this I went 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:13.719
 a nail like I don't know if you notice is 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:16.269
 This 

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:20.049
 and these are all my five 

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:23.679
 favorite pink lipsticks 

00:07:20.049 --> 00:07:26.769
 that saying nothing was hard because 

00:07:23.679 --> 00:07:28.119
 therefore or as many 5 are five more 

00:07:26.769 --> 00:07:30.129
 five because I put them all 

00:07:28.119 --> 00:07:31.629
 which I looked good indeed 

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:34.589
 which I use the most as I always go 

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:36.999
 search but then I had five more 

00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:39.879
 this is how we see each other again 

00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:42.669
 color that I think will be a purple fuchsia 

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:45.389
 fuchsia is more or less a big kiss and a 

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:45.389
 next hello
