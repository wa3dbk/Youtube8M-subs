 however the commission caught allied with recommendations with a first 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.659
 idea 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:17.720
 cb 2 speak to me to be in the organization field of the city 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.550
 but it is to be closer to the patient and especially closer to the 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.419
 clinical presentation of the patient by giving new value to the clinic's 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:26.339
 patient 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:30.139
 in schizophrenic disorders as in mood disorders one 

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:34.980
 knows that violent acting out is the exception but it should 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.370
 to spot 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.469
 signs that are precursors and signs that are 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.960
 warning signs in precursor safety prediction criteria on 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.370
 knows very well that violence and lighthouses morizet and by taking alcohol 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.760
 by taking drugs we know very well that shenzhen schizophrenic the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.790
 cannabis consumption engulfs delirium and therefore and susceptible with 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.540
 to bring a passage to the act if in the context of delusion there are elements of 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.720
 persecution 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.830
 we know very well that their money is one of the factors that when someone 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.869
 under 40 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.350
 and he is more likely than ours to be violent 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.009
 we know very well that sex is an important factor in man and 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.829
 yet cowan who rapes them and more violent yet 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:24.380
 that that woman 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.460
 but beyond two of these factors a factor comes out very clearly this is 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.490
 the breakdown of care 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.640
 it's a very basic problem that we know in psychiatry 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.979
 is when the site estrie this percentage that it is announced to 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.479
 the age of 25 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.780
 who is going into an illness they will have to look after all their lives 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.970
 that this disease is called bipolar disorder so it's called a 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.320
 schizophrenia 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.010
 it's very long at war against justice 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.929
 this ad 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.200
 estimating that 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.200
 it's not acceptable to live with this threat throughout life 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.060
 we know these things 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.770
 in somatic diseases 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.579
 when someone gets along at the same time 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:08.920
 that he has leukemia 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.640
 and that it should be treated for at least fifteen years 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.360
 revolt invades him when someone gets to take 20 years 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.880
 at the insentient insentient aquila india he is at war 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.000
 against this idea that not be insulin dependent 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.910
 Throughout his life one can imagine how much more it is 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.380
 difficult and more traumatic for someone who at the age of 20 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.979
 learns that he has schizophrenia 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:40.059
 it must accept and what schizophrenia represents in a 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:44.419
 family or in society and accept the idea of ​​a lifetime treatment one sees 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:47.050
 although the problem the very basic tra 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.570
 it is to be able from that time 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.690
 to establish a strong alliance with the patient so that the patient 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.339
 in contact with the caregiver 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:59.499
 accept the idea of ​​illness 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:04.589
 accepts the sacrifices that sickness orders accept a regular take of 

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:07.829
 treatment agree to come to consult when he is not well 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:13.029
 a whole path that the caregiver and caregiver will do together
