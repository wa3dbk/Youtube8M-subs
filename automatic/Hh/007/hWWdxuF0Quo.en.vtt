00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.740 
burn in hell that to me is child abuse
and<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.259> just<00:02:10.500> think<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:11.220> okay<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.750> have

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
and I just think it's okay to have

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.240 
and I just think it's okay to have
religion<00:02:13.260> in<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.440> spiritual

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
religion in the spiritual

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.589 
religion in the spiritual
but<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.550> think<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.880> has<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.030> be<00:02:15.150> their<00:02:15.360> choice

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
but I think it has to be their choice

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.410 
but I think it has to be their choice
that's<00:02:15.990> all<00:02:16.140> I'm<00:02:16.260> saying<00:02:16.620> Wow<00:02:17.490> yeah<00:02:17.849> Wow
