00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:07.730
 hello system friends sum in this 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.559
 occasion we bring you this video in the 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.459
 which are we going to show how we can 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:16.760
 connect a projector this case one 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:20.060
 brand name to a computer with 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.620
 windows 8 in this case a laptop the 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:27.460
 which as we can see 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:30.310
 although it incorporates a port but the 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.529
 connector type vga connector 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.540
 this time we will not connect 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.660
 to see if we are not going to connect it 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.280
 usb 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.050
 so we can do this 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.260
 those who bought the equipment 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.430
 new ones run into the small dilemma of 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.930
 that these new equipment 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:53.750
 they have hdmi connector as we see it here 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.530
 but they lack the vga connector something that 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.840
 It is very common in current laptops 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.360
 why we are going to show you 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.510
 how to connect us for your load a 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.150
 projector through a usb cable well 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.159
 The first thing we need is a cable 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.890
 usb type b 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.470
 a type a 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.540
 so we have here is to say the typical 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.659
 cable that you know as the cable 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.800
 usb for the printers then we connect 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.110
 here in this milk that says eye type 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.870
 service index does not help us has to 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:35.450
 say type look good now we connect 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:40.549
 the Canon 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:43.840
 but the usb port is going to look like a 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:46.850
 unit I decided here in the was 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.980
 windows explorer let's give double 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.770
 click 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.560
 and welcome to the installation of 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.430
 epson usb display let's see the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.340
 next let's give it accept 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:05.969
 I'm going to start doing the installation 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.969
 this noticed a lot the truth is fast 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.860
 and let's see how ready it flies eye if 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.739
 they have problems and they have no image 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.080
 after this we only go here to 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.650
 what is the show button so that 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.680
 do the automatic search 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:32.370
 and connect us there is the usb display 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:35.459
 well as they see a very easy way very 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.689
 simple to connect a projector in this 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:42.739
 case an epson mark to a computer 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:45.480
 via usb everything works normally 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.520
 this is a solution for all 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.940
 those 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.640
 that although they have an hdmi connector in 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.900
 your computer would not want to spend on a 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.270
 adapter that often does not work 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.390
 Y 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.850
 can take advantage of this solution the cost 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.740
 of the cable really is economical and it's 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.680
 a cheap solution and how they see a 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.480
 very efficient solution, well, that's 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.920
