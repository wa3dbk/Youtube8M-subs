00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.140
 hello my love where you are 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.330
 maybe your wedding too 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.070
 plan or be invited on one 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:17.910
 wedding and now you face the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:20.160
 ask what I give away either 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:26.810
 my girlfriend marries so so the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.980
 brew or what could I as a give away 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.510
 give away 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.059
 I also asked myself this question 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.460
 and then I came 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.960
 the glorious idea like me 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.210
 maybe that's the one thing 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.910
 other things already seen there are 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:48.210
 namely and that is indexed beginning 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.620
 totally good what wild hearts have yes 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.440
 I already saw but maybe have 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.350
 you have not thought he is as 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.620
 to see a gift because I think that's it 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.859
 that 's exactly the right gift 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:05.489
 because it has so first of all is something 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:11.580
 completely different, yes it is not a thing 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:14.689
 you give away nothing else so no 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:19.409
 So there is a really nasty idea 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:22.710
 wedding gifts or nasty james and 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.799
 I thought that's really cool but 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.290
 First of all, maybe you know that 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.790
 principle not at all and then 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.220
 I'll explain something to you shortly 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.770
 that with this jewel kersten on itself 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.740
 we can see is the big one 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.030
 candle even smaller burns behind me 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.820
 just one from it are just scented candles 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.520
 There are many different ones 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.369
 fragrance directions and the joke is there 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.280
 that in wax 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.009
 a gem is so must 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.450
 Make candles and burn them down 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.570
 you can see the gem here 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.409
 that a little bag and there 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.979
 is jewelry in it 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.360
 I chose it because 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.110
 everyone has finger but not the date 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.160
 holes so there are earrings or rings 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.120
 I am now for rings 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.890
 decided and so you meet first 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.470
 Of course the choice which fragrance the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.460
 fragrance which size and then stop 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.800
 which piece of jewelry or the funny 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:30.080
 You do not know what's in there 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.440
 It can jewelry from 10 to 250 euros in it 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.100
 his 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.400
 so it's a bit like 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.650
 Surprise bag for girls for the 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.910
 adult woman 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.580
 that is just as special and me 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.040
 find that a cool idea just as 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.480
 I have different ones 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.989
 fragrances here once through 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.180
 geschnuppert 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.180
 you can open that yes and yes 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:00.770
 sniff and my favorite is so far 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.560
 definitely passion fruit but that's right 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.320
 so cool that smells like it is so 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.850
 I think Katies exotic anyway 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.620
 20 as well as I really delicious 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.530
 So passion fruit is definitely 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.130
 my favorite, I also have orange 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.310
 Ice cream report also really cool then 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.870
 what burns what burns the little one 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.459
 fresh watermelon also smells very much 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:31.250
 very good so after watermelon chewing gum 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.799
 and pina colada chocolate judge 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.560
 still different and coconut also very very 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:39.410
 yummy and strawberry which I think 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.910
 the strawberry does not smell so good 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.130
 I think the others are far away 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.390
 better and my favorites are on 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.760
 any case as and 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.739
 Passion fruit still smell for me 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.410

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.840

 I just lit it 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.650
 that means I have to spend a few hours 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:38.020
 wait and then tomorrow can show you 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.039

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.750
 that was definitely my give away 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.430
 and wedding gift tip let it 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.860
 Sink once because it's real 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.439
 it's just something else 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.389
 and for me that love the surprise 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:02.800
 In any case, really good and you have to 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.500
 not necessarily the huge ones 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.169
 can give away and also the smaller ones 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.379
 take sizes and then already on those 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:13.090
 already know theirs on the tables 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:14.680
 I have mine on those wedding celebration 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.389
 so table on every table 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.819
 candle and then maybe you can still 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.469
 make a game out of it somehow 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:22.419
 I do not know that at the table 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:24.099
 raffled among the women of the smugglers 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.949
 there is definitely there in each case 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:29.259
 lots of creative ways how to do that 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:30.279
 If you can bring candles to the man 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:31.389
 now a very big one 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:32.949
 maybe you can have a wedding celebration 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.339
 do not give each one a present 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:38.949
 but maybe every wedding table yes 

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:41.129
 the candle again and again 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:44.620
 is definitely a very cool idea 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:47.229
 I found it funny and that's why I share 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.339
 who share with you share with you 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.900
 every case the candles as I said 

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:52.479
 write in the comments 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.870
 After my father's week I will be the 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:58.060
 then trigger the winner personally and 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.250
 inform and then we'll see each other 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.139
 tomorrow again in the next video me 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.289
 wish you a sunny until then 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:04.289
 Day 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:20.170
 one day later it still needs to be known 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.880
 what hate in my candle 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:25.220
 So you see the half is under fire 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:29.080
 then I could fish the gate and 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:36.320
 Although I had this sweet Nordstetter 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:38.170
 were worth 25 euros and in 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:43.070
 Sterling silver 

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:46.580
 they are real it would have made me worse 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:49.790
 So I think they really are 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:52.880
 sweet and who were now in a small 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:56.320
 candle and in your heart so I went 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.670
 are giving away to you 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.060
 and are just a bit bigger because 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:05.930
 you have to diminish a bit longer 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:09.770
 So that was my present tip to you 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:12.230
 for you and yes write me in the 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:15.050
 comments which you saved and how 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:18.580
 her idea is like that 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.580
 wedding gift or gabriel
