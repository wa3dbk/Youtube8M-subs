00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
sign that let's tell you how bogus it is

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.060 
sign that let's tell you how bogus it is
but<00:01:49.600> it's<00:01:49.840> gotten<00:01:50.110> so<00:01:50.289> bad<00:01:50.320> that<00:01:50.530> I've<00:01:50.770> even

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
but it's gotten so bad that I've even

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.130 
but it's gotten so bad that I've even
seen<00:01:51.250> people<00:01:51.640> say<00:01:51.910> except<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:52.810> Floyd<00:01:53.050> to

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
seen people say except the Floyd to

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.779 
seen people say except the Floyd to
prove<00:01:53.320> that<00:01:53.380> it<00:01:53.500> doesn't<00:01:53.740> exist<00:01:53.979> when<00:01:54.490> Stephen

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
prove that it doesn't exist when Stephen

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.219 
prove that it doesn't exist when Stephen
each<00:01:54.880> other<00:01:55.360> said<00:01:55.630> that<00:01:55.780> rather<00:01:55.930> than<00:01:56.050> when

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
each other said that rather than when

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.510 
each other said that rather than when
Manic<00:01:56.470> you<00:01:56.530> just<00:01:56.680> say<00:01:56.770> here<00:01:56.979> it<00:01:57.039> is<00:01:57.130> I<00:01:57.280> say<00:01:57.490> I

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
Manic you just say here it is I say I

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.490 
Manic you just say here it is I say I
don't<00:01:57.880> make<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.149> difference<00:01:58.360> it<00:01:59.140> makes<00:01:59.350> no

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
don't make the difference it makes no

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.900 
don't make the difference it makes no
difference<00:01:59.530> because<00:02:00.160> at<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:00.399> end<00:02:00.460> of<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.700> day

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
difference because at the end of the day

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.120 
difference because at the end of the day
like<00:02:01.899> I<00:02:02.050> said<00:02:02.520> only<00:02:03.520> two<00:02:03.759> people<00:02:04.060> that<00:02:04.179> matter

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
like I said only two people that matter

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.310 
like I said only two people that matter
realistically<00:02:06.240> isn't<00:02:07.240> mandiant<00:02:07.600> fully<00:02:07.899> and

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
realistically isn't mandiant fully and

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.259 
realistically isn't mandiant fully and
so<00:02:08.679> anybody<00:02:08.950> could<00:02:09.250> put<00:02:09.489> whatever<00:02:09.759> they<00:02:10.060> want

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
so anybody could put whatever they want

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.570 
so anybody could put whatever they want
to<00:02:10.330> put<00:02:10.450> out<00:02:10.600> there<00:02:10.769> don't<00:02:11.769> matter<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:12.370> if<00:02:12.519> a

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
to put out there don't matter and if a

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.160 
to put out there don't matter and if a
contract<00:02:13.000> that<00:02:13.060> exists<00:02:13.600> wouldn't<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:13.900> be<00:02:13.989> easy

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
contract that exists wouldn't it be easy

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.870 
contract that exists wouldn't it be easy
just<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.470> fold<00:02:14.709> up<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:14.920> say<00:02:15.040> here<00:02:15.190> as<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:15.459> sign<00:02:15.670> it

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
just a fold up and say here as I sign it

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.430 
just a fold up and say here as I sign it
exactly<00:02:16.239> but<00:02:16.660> they<00:02:16.780> kind<00:02:17.019> of<00:02:17.080> seem<00:02:17.200> like<00:02:17.350> they

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
exactly but they kind of seem like they

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.460 
exactly but they kind of seem like they
walked<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:17.800> back<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:17.980> little<00:02:18.100> bit<00:02:19.230> saying<00:02:20.230> that

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
walked it back a little bit saying that

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.650 
walked it back a little bit saying that
that<00:02:20.799> he<00:02:21.459> had<00:02:21.579> necessary<00:02:21.730> signed<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.450> contract

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
that he had necessary signed a contract

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.289 
that he had necessary signed a contract
but<00:02:23.049> more<00:02:23.260> he<00:02:23.410> had<00:02:23.500> agreed<00:02:23.799> to<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.040> terms<00:02:24.299> yeah

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
but more he had agreed to the terms yeah

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.390 
but more he had agreed to the terms yeah
we<00:02:25.840> until<00:02:26.079> the<00:02:26.170> team<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.590> sign<00:02:26.799> the<00:02:26.950> contract

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
we until the team the sign the contract

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.699 
we until the team the sign the contract
is<00:02:27.489> two<00:02:27.700> totally<00:02:27.910> different<00:02:28.180> things<00:02:28.360> so<00:02:28.780> it's

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
is two totally different things so it's

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.199 
is two totally different things so it's
one<00:02:29.860> of<00:02:29.920> those<00:02:29.980> situations<00:02:30.160> in<00:02:30.640> which<00:02:30.670> like<00:02:31.090> I

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
one of those situations in which like I

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.509 
one of those situations in which like I
said<00:02:31.239> I<00:02:31.450> mean<00:02:31.660> I<00:02:31.840> think<00:02:32.079> that<00:02:32.500> if<00:02:33.100> Stephen

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
said I mean I think that if Stephen

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.420 
said I mean I think that if Stephen
Espinoza<00:02:33.670> never<00:02:34.239> came<00:02:34.510> out<00:02:34.720> he<00:02:35.650> said<00:02:35.980> anything

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
Espinoza never came out he said anything

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.880 
Espinoza never came out he said anything
I<00:02:36.840> mean<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:38.440> know<00:02:38.530> they<00:02:38.680> would<00:02:38.799> have

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
I mean you know they would have

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.160 
I mean you know they would have
continued<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.640> push<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.209> issue<00:02:40.299> like<00:02:40.630> they

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
continued to push the issue like they

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.780 
continued to push the issue like they
signed<00:02:41.470> this<00:02:41.709> they<00:02:41.890> did<00:02:42.070> this<00:02:42.250> they<00:02:42.310> did<00:02:42.579> that

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
signed this they did this they did that

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.280 
signed this they did this they did that
but<00:02:43.150> but<00:02:43.329> if<00:02:43.450> there<00:02:43.570> were<00:02:43.600> terms<00:02:43.959> that<00:02:44.200> were

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
but but if there were terms that were

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.620 
but but if there were terms that were
agreed<00:02:44.590> upon<00:02:44.769> why<00:02:45.340> wouldn't<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:46.299> if<00:02:46.390> they<00:02:46.480> get

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
agreed upon why wouldn't and if they get

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.850 
agreed upon why wouldn't and if they get
agree<00:02:46.810> upon<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.079> terms<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.530> then<00:02:47.650> what<00:02:47.799> would

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
agree upon the terms and then what would

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.030 
agree upon the terms and then what would
be<00:02:47.950> holding<00:02:48.220> it<00:02:48.280> back<00:02:48.400> at<00:02:48.579> this<00:02:48.670> point<00:02:48.880> I<00:02:50.040> mean

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
be holding it back at this point I mean

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.490 
be holding it back at this point I mean
like<00:02:51.459> I<00:02:51.579> said<00:02:51.610> I<00:02:52.030> mean<00:02:52.360> talk<00:02:53.049> to<00:02:53.170> Stephen
