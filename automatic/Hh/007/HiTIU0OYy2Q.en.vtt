the camera body and then tighten up the
three<00:02:05.690> locking<00:02:06.050> grub<00:02:06.410> screws<00:02:06.740> do<00:02:07.460> it<00:02:07.580> nice<00:02:07.760> and

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
three locking grub screws do it nice and

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.940 
three locking grub screws do it nice and
tightly<00:02:08.180> so<00:02:08.630> you<00:02:08.720> get<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:08.899> good<00:02:09.200> watertight

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
tightly so you get a good watertight

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.890 
tightly so you get a good watertight
seal<00:02:12.310> all<00:02:13.310> off<00:02:13.520> handle<00:02:13.850> dome<00:02:14.030> kits<00:02:14.330> come

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
seal all off handle dome kits come

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.990 
seal all off handle dome kits come
complete<00:02:15.380> with<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.860> key<00:02:16.070> which<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.430> need<00:02:16.640> to

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
complete with the key which you need to

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.100 
complete with the key which you need to
remove<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.660> refit<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.890> outer<00:02:19.070> covering<00:02:19.520> dome

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
remove and refit the outer covering dome

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.350 
remove and refit the outer covering dome
so<00:02:21.110> that's<00:02:21.260> a<00:02:21.350> vandal<00:02:21.650> dome<00:02:21.800> camera<00:02:22.360> installed
