00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.349 
thought make the tickets so much cuter
so<00:03:26.799> yeah<00:03:27.010> highly<00:03:27.340> recommend<00:03:27.760> stickers<00:03:28.150> and

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
so yeah highly recommend stickers and

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.240 
so yeah highly recommend stickers and
then<00:03:28.780> I<00:03:28.840> just<00:03:29.079> cut<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.349> edges<00:03:29.530> of<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:29.890> tickets

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
then I just cut the edges of the tickets

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.009 
then I just cut the edges of the tickets
and<00:03:30.430> make<00:03:30.519> it<00:03:30.670> look<00:03:30.849> more<00:03:31.150> like<00:03:31.359> a<00:03:31.390> ticket<00:03:31.840> and

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
and make it look more like a ticket and

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.240 
and make it look more like a ticket and
tada

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
tada

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:40.520 
tada

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
you don't want them to know I started by

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.080 
you don't want them to know I started by
adding<00:04:08.740> the<00:04:08.860> rocks<00:04:09.100> into<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.460> coke<00:04:09.700> bottle

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
adding the rocks into the coke bottle

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.340 
adding the rocks into the coke bottle
you<00:04:10.240> don't<00:04:10.450> want<00:04:10.600> to<00:04:10.660> fill<00:04:10.840> up<00:04:10.960> the<00:04:11.080> bottle

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
you don't want to fill up the bottle

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.050 
you don't want to fill up the bottle
just<00:04:11.590> a<00:04:11.680> quarter<00:04:12.040> of<00:04:12.160> it<00:04:12.280> is<00:04:12.400> good<00:04:12.610> enough<00:04:12.820> and

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
just a quarter of it is good enough and

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.030 
just a quarter of it is good enough and
then<00:04:13.480> roll<00:04:13.750> up<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:14.020> bucket<00:04:14.320> list<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:14.710> slip

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
then roll up the bucket list and slip

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.560 
then roll up the bucket list and slip
that<00:04:15.190> into<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.640> bottle<00:04:15.970> and<00:04:16.180> you<00:04:16.239> can<00:04:16.390> either

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
that into the bottle and you can either

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.150 
that into the bottle and you can either
leave<00:04:16.900> it<00:04:16.930> like<00:04:17.170> this<00:04:17.200> but<00:04:17.709> I<00:04:17.770> thought<00:04:18.040> it

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
leave it like this but I thought it

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.949 
leave it like this but I thought it
would<00:04:18.310> be<00:04:18.430> better<00:04:18.610> if<00:04:18.880> you<00:04:19.000> added<00:04:19.330> a<00:04:19.450> bag<00:04:19.690> to

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
would be better if you added a bag to

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.300 
would be better if you added a bag to
cover<00:04:20.110> the<00:04:20.350> bottle<00:04:20.650> so<00:04:20.799> it's<00:04:20.920> more<00:04:21.100> of<00:04:21.160> a

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
cover the bottle so it's more of a

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.760 
cover the bottle so it's more of a
surprise<00:04:21.670> then<00:04:22.240> I<00:04:22.270> added<00:04:22.540> a<00:04:22.750> ribbon<00:04:23.140> and<00:04:23.410> card

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
surprise then I added a ribbon and card

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.520 
surprise then I added a ribbon and card
label<00:04:24.160> and<00:04:24.430> that's<00:04:24.700> it<00:04:25.000> here<00:04:25.570> is<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:26.080> message

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
label and that's it here is the message

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.410 
label and that's it here is the message
in<00:04:26.830> a<00:04:26.890> bottle

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.960 

this<00:04:32.320> one<00:04:32.530> is<00:04:32.680> another<00:04:32.980> one<00:04:33.160> of<00:04:33.190> my<00:04:33.310> favorites
