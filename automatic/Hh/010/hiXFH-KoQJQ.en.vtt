00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 here neutrals welcome to university 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.040
 from the road to go here 12 and we are playing 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.620
 around here in prison break 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.240
 this is prison break so great vice 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.530
 number 400 uploaded so followed because 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.330
 I want to finish it sooner than later 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.289
 It always took a long time to finish the 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.119
 labels assigned to mute 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.570
 and good you see that it carries accessories in the 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.340
 weapon esque 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.050
 and if I wear it because it is much more 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.050
 easy to use the weapon well with accessories 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.430
 and the most secondary mind to be able 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.649
 make sales and now when it comes to 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.640
 cancel the refills because it can do it 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.480
 and what are you doing 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.030
 seriously 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.010
 and playing against a guiri team a clan 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.010
 of these that are formed in the elite 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.520
 and of camperos players they have enough 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.690
 how about the back of the trunk 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.149
 because it is that people are invisible in 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.309
 this game behind the trunk not only sees 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.309
 you do not see forgiveness 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.700
 There is a field 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.130
 and on camouflaged trunks 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.810
 I hope you take some meat out of me 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.810
 episode 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.950
 although it is impossible 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.229
 I'm out of here but let's go 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.110
 beautiful love mother 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.750
 if it's called over 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.750
 the balls 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.290
 is going to move the guiri 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.290
 campers 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.640
 but it's not worth it has gotten in there and 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.640
 disappears 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.420
 it has been entered and entered that I have 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.110
 seen then nothing is not there 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.110
 suddenly disappears 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.020
 because as is ghost 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.020
 very low arm 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.439
 the clear ones are ghosts 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.910
 what is call of duty cous 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.860
 of logical uncle 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.910
 OK 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.640
 the thing is 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.510
 if I started shooting you before because 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.510
 I die before 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.900
 because you failed to say good bullets it is not 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:56.319
 I do not miss bullets come on until later 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.659
 citrus fruits of 4 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.170
 I shit on the mother who bore them in the 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.170
 house is 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.870
 is it so 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.850
 so nothing with accessories will cost more 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.850
 get the challenge out I'll try more forgiveness 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.799
 everything is that I would do all day all 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.799
 the program with the city 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.480
 I killed myself at the beginning of the game 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.180
 and if there and it will continue like this all the 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.660
 starting you can I can assure you of 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.410

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.370
 all 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.370
 the match 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.190
 is already in the tree 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.890
 I can not use what you put in a 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.890
 side but not 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.680

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.350

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.910

 a worker from here already 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:43.630
 it is a companion is a companion 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.630
 It is your partner 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.370

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.680

 really and all put there 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.910
 or to shut up to concentrate seriously 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.630
 I see callus 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.270
 is that 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.160
 where are they 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.700
 happy 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.700
 or 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.710
 really 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.620
 true true uncle 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.360
 BernabÃ© has to that critics is 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.379
 a game look 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.379
 without hesitation 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.590
 and that does not come out of the trees uncle 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:52.759
 the trunks that are intraspasables 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:55.150
 because the wood can not be broken with 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.150
 bullets 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.400
 with bullets and they are bullets 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:12.430
 for it 150 we go with the other weapon 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.969
 challenge more is over it's over it's over 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:18.149
 it is impossible 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:20.610
 it's impossible seriously in this game is 

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:22.150
 impossible to see me as 40 in millions of 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.940
 episodes 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.750
 to record this really to record 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:32.240
 this 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:34.730
 16 116 and the last as normal 414 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.100
 you want me to see if that way that 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.440
 is what you are looking for because you do not have a 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:42.490
 logical sense is something of the game 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.490
 is that no no no no no 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.440
 what have i got 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.390
 nothing has where the big ones are 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:52.610
 challenges 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.610
 he gets 150 casualties with this weapon 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.370
 is 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.710
 there is a challenge that marks that because I do not 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.230
 Skip the challenge but nothing good then 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.640
 nothing we still do not know more high a 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.370
 challenge but I do not know why not 

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.750
 I have no suit or even 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.490
 like the video is our favorite if 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.700
 it is not in the next and it is close to 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.700
 God
