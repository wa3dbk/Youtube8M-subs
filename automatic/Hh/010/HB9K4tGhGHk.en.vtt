 fresh information about the features 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.350
 new display in this new by all 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.390
 expected device from apple speech 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.800
 will go about sapphire crystal 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.800
 iphone 6 display 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.280
 one of the famous american 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.710
 videobloger marcus brown whether succeeded 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.350
 get exactly this very significant 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.110
 spare from the new iphone 6 this 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.420
 full front 4 7-inch 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.470
 the front panel of the future iphone with 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.110
 sapphire coating 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.990
 having seen it we can already believe that 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.560
 iphone 6 will still be magnified 4 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.600
 7 inch display and this is 4 7 inch 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.360
 the model will have no glass 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.369
 burned a glass and sapphire crystal like 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.259
 just started leaking about 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.299
 of this question we were notified that 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.430
 only five and a half inch 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.979
 the version will have a display with sapphire 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.680
 coated but spreading sources 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.689
 similar rumors were wrong if 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.700
 compare eye burned and sapphire 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.159
 coverage then wins the matter 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.860
 second first argument sapphire 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.259
 amazing quality material 2 he 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.060
 really durable why is he 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.520
 quality but because he is very 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.390
 thin with a sheet of paper a hundred 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.890
 percent transparent and does not distort colors 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.770
 Sapphire glass is already used for 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.200
 protect the lens of the iphone 5 5s camera and 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.040
 built-in fingerprint sensor 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.009
 home button 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.050
 which is very remarkable protective film 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.210
 for the new iphone is not needed 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.050
 you can do with a simple napkin 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.810
 microfiber 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.530
 in this video he introduces knives on the glass 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.990
 keys 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.010
 strongly bends him like hands and when 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.410
 help sneaker 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:33.360
 and after all this coverage does not lose 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:34.530
 your appearance here even shows how strong he is 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.010
 trying to push 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.960
 However, the display is not scratched anyway 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.060
 the glass passed all tests perfectly 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.550
 scratched did not break and did not 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.010
 warped most amazing 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.740
 moment was the resistance of the glass to 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.770
 bending, she quietly withstands bending 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.930
 more than 90 degrees 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.770
 sapphire 4 7-inch model and sensor 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.500
 touch di di 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.920
 these are two things that give a terrific 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.080
 iphone 6 view if our waiting will be 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.760
 justified then the six will be the first 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.760
