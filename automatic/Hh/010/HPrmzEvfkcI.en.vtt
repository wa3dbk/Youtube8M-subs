time-released<00:03:49.680> or<00:03:49.919> something<00:03:50.220> so<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.430> might

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
time-released or something so that might

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.050 
time-released or something so that might
be<00:03:50.879> the<00:03:50.910> reason<00:03:51.060> but<00:03:51.930> she<00:03:52.230> ended<00:03:52.319> up<00:03:53.060> pushing

buck<00:03:57.060> on<00:03:57.209> it<00:03:57.239> anyway<00:03:57.659> so<00:03:58.319> I<00:03:58.769> might<00:03:59.190> be<00:03:59.909> worth

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
buck on it anyway so I might be worth

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.089

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
if we're trying to get to the 15 bucks

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.990 
if we're trying to get to the 15 bucks
and<00:04:05.659> then<00:04:06.659> I<00:04:06.959> did<00:04:07.319> the<00:04:07.349> I<00:04:08.190> got<00:04:08.430> a<00:04:08.459> bunch<00:04:08.669> of<00:04:08.790> tied

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
and then I did the I got a bunch of tied

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.099 
and then I did the I got a bunch of tied
the<00:04:09.209> other<00:04:09.329> day<00:04:09.540> so<00:04:09.599> I<00:04:09.720> thought<00:04:09.870> I'd<00:04:09.989> better

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109
