00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
the last three seasons definitely made

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.750 
the last three seasons definitely made
for<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.809> described<00:00:37.260> my<00:00:37.469> being<00:00:37.739> said<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.550> I

for the described my being said it I

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.580

to<00:00:48.800> this<00:00:49.190> game<00:00:49.430> something<00:00:49.940> that<00:00:50.060> people<00:00:50.420> can

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600
