00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
looked at a lot of these computer models

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.650 
looked at a lot of these computer models
we're<00:04:39.430> like<00:04:39.550> holy<00:04:39.669> cow<00:04:40.000> it's<00:04:40.210> blowing<00:04:40.570> this

hurricane<00:04:42.580> out<00:04:42.940> of<00:04:43.060> it<00:04:43.150> possibly<00:04:43.539> affecting

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
hurricane out of it possibly affecting

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.230 
hurricane out of it possibly affecting
Florida<00:04:44.440> and<00:04:44.680> you<00:04:45.070> know<00:04:45.190> that<00:04:45.789> the<00:04:45.910> good<00:04:46.090> news

is<00:04:46.419> that<00:04:46.630> kind<00:04:46.840> of<00:04:46.870> got<00:04:47.020> everybody<00:04:47.410> you<00:04:48.130> know

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
is that kind of got everybody you know

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.950 
is that kind of got everybody you know
jump-started<00:04:48.820> a<00:04:48.850> little<00:04:49.030> bit<00:04:49.150> but<00:04:49.570> don't<00:04:49.810> you

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
jump-started a little bit but don't you

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.420 
jump-started a little bit but don't you
think<00:04:50.139> the<00:04:50.260> caveat<00:04:50.710> in<00:04:50.800> this<00:04:50.889> whole<00:04:51.039> thing<00:04:51.250> is

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
think the caveat in this whole thing is

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.490 
think the caveat in this whole thing is
all<00:04:52.030> these<00:04:52.180> weird<00:04:52.449> tracks<00:04:52.750> or<00:04:53.110> because<00:04:53.380> the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
all these weird tracks or because the

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.909 
all these weird tracks or because the
center<00:04:53.830> was<00:04:54.010> really<00:04:54.250> never<00:04:54.520> visible<00:04:55.360> or

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
center was really never visible or

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.250 
center was really never visible or
succinct<00:04:56.919> until<00:04:57.160> today<00:04:57.840> well<00:04:58.840> that's<00:04:59.080> what<00:04:59.169> I

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
succinct until today well that's what I

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.540 
succinct until today well that's what I
was<00:04:59.380> saying<00:04:59.560> that<00:04:59.800> tropical<00:04:59.979> storm<00:05:00.190> the

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
was saying that tropical storm the

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.770 
was saying that tropical storm the
center<00:05:00.820> of<00:05:00.940> trouble<00:05:01.180> storm<00:05:01.360> Fay<00:05:01.510> has<00:05:01.630> been

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
center of trouble storm Fay has been

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.439 
center of trouble storm Fay has been
evasive<00:05:02.440> and<00:05:02.740> I<00:05:02.889> was<00:05:02.979> talking<00:05:03.160> to<00:05:03.580> Mike<00:05:04.240> Bettes

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
evasive and I was talking to Mike Bettes

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.719 
evasive and I was talking to Mike Bettes
about<00:05:04.660> this<00:05:04.840> last<00:05:05.110> week<00:05:05.440> we<00:05:06.220> get<00:05:06.430> a<00:05:06.460> chance<00:05:06.610> to

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
about this last week we get a chance to

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:07.890 
about this last week we get a chance to
talk<00:05:06.880> about<00:05:07.150> this<00:05:07.240> but<00:05:07.389> maybe<00:05:07.539> you<00:05:07.630> can<00:05:07.750> weigh

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
talk about this but maybe you can weigh

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.570 
talk about this but maybe you can weigh
in<00:05:07.930> on<00:05:08.110> and<00:05:08.320> now<00:05:08.410> we<00:05:08.949> were<00:05:09.070> looking<00:05:09.370> at<00:05:09.460> this

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
in on and now we were looking at this

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.100 
in on and now we were looking at this
thing<00:05:09.639> saying<00:05:09.970> why<00:05:10.300> aren't<00:05:10.599> they<00:05:10.690> making<00:05:10.870> this

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
thing saying why aren't they making this

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.629 
thing saying why aren't they making this
a<00:05:11.169> tropical<00:05:11.590> depression<00:05:11.680> of<00:05:12.130> course<00:05:12.160> it

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
a tropical depression of course it

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.129 
a tropical depression of course it
jumped<00:05:13.060> right<00:05:13.090> it's<00:05:13.360> a<00:05:13.419> tropical<00:05:13.780> storm<00:05:13.870> has

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
jumped right it's a tropical storm has

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.659 
jumped right it's a tropical storm has
skipped<00:05:14.470> that<00:05:14.560> tropical<00:05:14.800> depression<00:05:15.430> phase

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
skipped that tropical depression phase

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.100 
skipped that tropical depression phase
why<00:05:16.240> are<00:05:16.300> they<00:05:16.449> calling<00:05:16.660> it<00:05:16.780> why<00:05:16.930> are<00:05:16.990> they

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
why are they calling it why are they

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.810 
why are they calling it why are they
calling<00:05:17.349> it<00:05:17.560> and<00:05:17.860> one<00:05:17.949> of<00:05:18.039> the<00:05:18.099> main<00:05:18.310> reasons

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
calling it and one of the main reasons

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.580 
calling it and one of the main reasons
is<00:05:19.030> we<00:05:19.180> did<00:05:19.360> not<00:05:19.510> see<00:05:19.810> that<00:05:19.840> surface<00:05:20.440> low

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
is we did not see that surface low

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.159 
is we did not see that surface low
pressure<00:05:20.919> it<00:05:21.400> was<00:05:21.580> up<00:05:21.789> in<00:05:21.940> the<00:05:22.060> mid<00:05:22.300> levels<00:05:22.990> of

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
pressure it was up in the mid levels of

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.390 
pressure it was up in the mid levels of
the<00:05:23.260> atmosphere<00:05:23.650> and<00:05:23.710> you<00:05:23.830> need<00:05:24.099> a<00:05:24.130> surface

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
the atmosphere and you need a surface

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.680 
the atmosphere and you need a surface
low<00:05:24.729> in<00:05:24.910> order<00:05:25.060> to<00:05:25.180> call<00:05:25.360> this<00:05:25.449> thing<00:05:25.599> a

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
low in order to call this thing a

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.719 
low in order to call this thing a
tropical<00:05:26.020> storm<00:05:26.110> so<00:05:26.560> Jim<00:05:27.160> has<00:05:27.280> been<00:05:27.460> very

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
tropical storm so Jim has been very

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:29.430 
tropical storm so Jim has been very
evasive<00:05:28.060> very<00:05:28.449> hard<00:05:28.660> to<00:05:28.750> point<00:05:28.930> out<00:05:29.110> so<00:05:29.289> that

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
evasive very hard to point out so that

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.839 
evasive very hard to point out so that
of<00:05:29.560> course<00:05:29.590> has<00:05:29.889> made<00:05:30.039> the<00:05:30.160> models<00:05:30.550> have<00:05:30.820> a

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
of course has made the models have a

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.790 
of course has made the models have a
really<00:05:31.120> tart<00:05:31.479> tough<00:05:31.870> time<00:05:32.080> if<00:05:32.349> you<00:05:32.440> have<00:05:32.590> a

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
really tart tough time if you have a

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.589 
really tart tough time if you have a
good<00:05:33.220> system<00:05:33.400> with<00:05:33.639> a<00:05:33.699> lot<00:05:33.820> of<00:05:33.849> information<00:05:34.150> is

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
good system with a lot of information is

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:36.520 
good system with a lot of information is
a<00:05:34.630> lot<00:05:34.780> easier<00:05:34.810> to<00:05:35.080> forecast

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
a lot easier to forecast

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.470 
a lot easier to forecast
and<00:05:37.040> you've<00:05:37.190> got<00:05:37.340> a<00:05:37.370> wonder<00:05:37.700> step<00:05:37.910> where<00:05:38.150> we<00:05:38.300> go

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.480 
and you've got a wonder step where we go

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.390 
and you've got a wonder step where we go
from<00:05:38.660> here<00:05:39.170> does<00:05:39.530> it<00:05:39.680> go<00:05:39.800> off<00:05:39.980> the<00:05:40.160> coach

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
from here does it go off the coach

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.850 
from here does it go off the coach
intensify<00:05:41.240> does<00:05:41.690> it<00:05:41.810> just<00:05:41.990> get<00:05:42.140> sucked<00:05:42.410> in<00:05:42.620> and

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
intensify does it just get sucked in and

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.620 
intensify does it just get sucked in and
give<00:05:43.310> you<00:05:43.730> know<00:05:43.820> the<00:05:43.910> southern<00:05:44.060> Appalachians

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
give you know the southern Appalachians

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.090 
give you know the southern Appalachians
some<00:05:44.810> great<00:05:44.990> rain<00:05:45.200> do<00:05:45.560> you<00:05:45.620> think<00:05:45.800> we'll<00:05:45.920> still

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
some great rain do you think we'll still

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.170 
some great rain do you think we'll still
be<00:05:46.190> covering<00:05:46.520> this<00:05:46.580> by<00:05:46.730> the<00:05:46.790> end<00:05:46.940> of<00:05:46.970> the<00:05:47.060> week

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
be covering this by the end of the week

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.470 
be covering this by the end of the week
I<00:05:47.830> think<00:05:48.830> so<00:05:49.160> yes<00:05:49.400> unfortunately<00:05:49.640> if<00:05:50.150> you<00:05:50.450> look

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
I think so yes unfortunately if you look

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.540 
I think so yes unfortunately if you look
at<00:05:50.720> the<00:05:50.780> models<00:05:51.080> but<00:05:51.230> again<00:05:51.590> we're<00:05:52.190> just<00:05:52.220> now

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
at the models but again we're just now

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.120 
at the models but again we're just now
starting<00:05:52.580> to<00:05:52.970> see<00:05:53.120> that<00:05:53.420> I<00:05:53.660> Jim<00:05:54.080> on<00:05:54.680> the<00:05:54.830> radar

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
starting to see that I Jim on the radar

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.950 
starting to see that I Jim on the radar
picture<00:05:55.160> and<00:05:55.730> is<00:05:55.850> looking<00:05:56.300> pretty<00:05:56.510> distinct

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
picture and is looking pretty distinct

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.870 
picture and is looking pretty distinct
now<00:05:57.080> but<00:05:57.380> again<00:05:57.470> it's<00:05:58.220> how<00:05:58.370> to<00:05:58.400> such<00:05:58.640> a<00:05:58.730> hard

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
now but again it's how to such a hard

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.830 
now but again it's how to such a hard
time<00:05:59.000> to<00:05:59.150> the<00:05:59.210> beginning<00:05:59.270> and<00:05:59.630> moves<00:05:59.810> through

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
time to the beginning and moves through

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.780 
time to the beginning and moves through
Florida<00:06:00.260> how<00:06:00.410> does<00:06:00.560> land<00:06:00.800> affect<00:06:01.160> it<00:06:01.310> I<00:06:01.490> mean

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 
Florida how does land affect it I mean

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.220 
Florida how does land affect it I mean
that's<00:06:01.970> always<00:06:02.180> something<00:06:02.540> that<00:06:02.840> comes<00:06:03.050> into

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.230 
that's always something that comes into

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.350 
that's always something that comes into
play<00:06:03.320> how<00:06:03.680> the<00:06:03.740> land<00:06:04.070> affects<00:06:04.430> it<00:06:04.640> so<00:06:05.030> it's

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
play how the land affects it so it's

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.400 
play how the land affects it so it's
going<00:06:05.450> to<00:06:05.510> be<00:06:05.630> interesting<00:06:05.810> to<00:06:05.990> follow<00:06:06.140> that's

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
going to be interesting to follow that's

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.430 
going to be interesting to follow that's
for<00:06:06.560> the<00:06:06.620> week<00:06:07.480> yeah<00:06:08.480> that's<00:06:08.810> been<00:06:08.990> a<00:06:09.020> two-step

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.870 
for the week yeah that's been a two-step
every<00:06:09.620> time<00:06:09.770> it's<00:06:09.919> had<00:06:10.010> a<00:06:10.040> chance<00:06:10.100> it's<00:06:10.669> hit

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
every time it's had a chance it's hit

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.490 
every time it's had a chance it's hit
land<00:06:11.120> so<00:06:11.360> that's<00:06:11.750> been<00:06:11.930> the<00:06:11.960> saving<00:06:12.320> grace<00:06:12.470> for
