to leave the plane behind

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.120 
to leave the plane behind
let's<00:03:40.360> rip<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.840> engine<00:03:41.170> so<00:03:41.350> Orko<00:03:41.650> can't<00:03:41.920> use

it good idea but before we do let me try

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:58.170 
it good idea but before we do let me try
and<00:03:46.120> start<00:03:46.390> it<00:03:46.540> one<00:03:46.930> more<00:03:47.200> time<00:03:57.060> someone<00:03:58.060> is

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
no other entrance to the cave then we'll

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.360 
no other entrance to the cave then we'll

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
hillside into the cave it's too

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.740 
hillside into the cave it's too
dangerous

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
dangerous

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.780
