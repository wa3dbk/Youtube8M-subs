00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.920
 a doctor against a doctor 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.920
 what do you do something 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.870

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.870
 entire business 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.919

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.090
 commit suicide 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.090
 my mother 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.090

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:50.200
 and he stays here he wants to die 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:52.900
 in this couple, therefore see that no 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:56.710
 they pass minefield 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.860

 [Music] 

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:52.699
 and I think I have a trick to 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.699
 especially winning 

00:06:54.579 --> 00:06:59.249

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.909

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.139
 the web that has remained 

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:50.280
 a winner 

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.280
 but with a little bit of cheating 

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.810
 the winner 

00:07:54.340 --> 00:08:04.270
 and good I hope you liked the 

00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:06.520
 tournament although this has happened and if you 

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:10.919
