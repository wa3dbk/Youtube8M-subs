00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.029
 Thank you. 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:16.379
 Now, I'm going to learn how to set it up. 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:21.359
 It's the same organization as me . 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.730
 I'm in the middle of it. 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.939
 Without being exposed 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.990
 Fly is floating without purl one 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:34.040
 I think it's like a rubber nose. 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.040
 Now things are not 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.650
 The nose will appear alternately purl 1 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:49.790
 What also floats and other meongseok also known as millet ttaegi 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:55.129
 I'd also called beolchim floating floats so simyeon 2 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:01:00.260
 The pelvic tissue comes out of the collar or pocket and 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:04.890
 When I make a shape, I get a lot of questions. 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.940
 You will get dotom because the tissue appearance yijungjik 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.850
 so 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:15.630
 This realism is turning much so that organizers first coil 10 alternately 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:21.690
 Now spend a little more rubber floats 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:25.680
 Where turning back knitted purl This time I do have is what the plain 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:32.250
 Again, some plain, where the antenna is open times 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.510
 Because of this repetition, one nose rubber boots will give the same nose shape 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.480
 But 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:43.770
 Meongseok stitch is dwaeseo opened another nose a different shape, like a honeycomb. What do bunwiga 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:46.770
 It comes out like a stone called meongseok stitch me a bit more scoop 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.000
 Now I'll show thus 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:57.330
 4 Comet No Different Questions 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.620
 A zest that one meongseok door nose replace reach put two on then 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.330
 I can count 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:07.860
 After a blanketing, he climbed to the top and then purl 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:13.800
 The thing that I am doing now is 1 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:16.909
 I'm on the first floor. I'm changing the moon tomorrow. 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:22.549
 Thus synagogue 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:27.349
 I do not go there . 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:30.430
 The one that comes up first Nose meongseok parties thus 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.430
 I can change it. 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:51.510
 So I can change I'll wipe anglaise 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:58.580
 The place where I left in a bunch 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.580
 This way, I 'm putting a spoonful on a single spoon. 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:14.230
 Here meongseok like papermaking, such as are opened 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:19.720
 It does not end in a shawl, but it has a lot of virtual places on both sides. 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.769
 The organization called on both sides because the city drying written on the same principle as rubber floats 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.459
 give 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.459
 Here you see 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:33.990
 I'm going to hook up the front part. 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:33.990
 The back part of the organization comes out together.
