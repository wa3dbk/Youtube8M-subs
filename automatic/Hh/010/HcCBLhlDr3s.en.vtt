something comfortable for the mechanics

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.309 
something comfortable for the mechanics
as<00:02:09.720> well

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
as well

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.020 
as well
they're<00:02:10.709> quite<00:02:10.950> tired<00:02:11.310> from<00:02:11.520> working<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
they're quite tired from working the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.110 
they're quite tired from working the
whole<00:02:12.180> last<00:02:12.900> year<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.500> yeah<00:02:14.430> now<00:02:14.670> they<00:02:14.940> have

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
whole last year and yeah now they have

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.640 
whole last year and yeah now they have
good<00:02:15.330> temperature<00:02:15.870> not<00:02:16.110> poison

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
good temperature not poison

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.030 
good temperature not poison
outside<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.760> think<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:19.260> people<00:02:19.379> seems<00:02:19.890> to

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
outside and I think the people seems to

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.640 
outside and I think the people seems to
like<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.220> how<00:02:20.819> do<00:02:20.879> you<00:02:21.150> start<00:02:21.720> up<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:22.140> rally<00:02:22.410> team

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
like it how do you start up a rally team

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.990 
like it how do you start up a rally team
where<00:02:22.950> do<00:02:23.069> you<00:02:23.160> begin<00:02:23.280> where'd<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:23.730> get<00:02:23.879> your

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
where do you begin where'd you get your

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.550 
where do you begin where'd you get your
engineers<00:02:24.510> obviously<00:02:25.260> you've<00:02:25.349> got<00:02:25.379> your

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
engineers obviously you've got your

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.559 
engineers obviously you've got your
drivers<00:02:25.920> from<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.129> Panik<00:02:26.459> already<00:02:26.730> but<00:02:26.970> how

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
drivers from the Panik already but how

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.050 
drivers from the Panik already but how
do<00:02:27.629> you<00:02:27.750> draw<00:02:27.989> in<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.230> team<00:02:28.440> like<00:02:28.590> this

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
do you draw in a team like this

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.550 
do you draw in a team like this
well<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.270> know<00:02:30.390> when<00:02:30.599> we<00:02:30.750> stopped<00:02:31.020> last<00:02:31.290> year

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
well you know when we stopped last year

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.500 
well you know when we stopped last year
in<00:02:31.650> January<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:33.900> was<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:35.270> bit<00:02:36.270> difficult

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
in January it was a bit difficult

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.119 
in January it was a bit difficult
because<00:02:36.870> there<00:02:37.260> was<00:02:37.379> nothing<00:02:37.800> there<00:02:38.010> was

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
because there was nothing there was

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:38.600 
because there was nothing there was
nobody

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
nobody

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.020 
nobody
we<00:02:39.540> had<00:02:39.660> an<00:02:39.780> empty<00:02:40.110> building<00:02:40.580> so<00:02:41.580> of<00:02:41.849> course

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
we had an empty building so of course

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.520 
we had an empty building so of course
the<00:02:42.270> first<00:02:42.300> thing<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:43.129> well<00:02:44.129> to<00:02:44.400> do<00:02:45.270> to<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:46.319> try

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
the first thing is well to do to to try

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.309 
the first thing is well to do to to try
to<00:02:46.590> design<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.069> car<00:02:47.280> even<00:02:47.610> if<00:02:47.879> we<00:02:48.090> were<00:02:48.900> quite

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
to design the car even if we were quite

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.479 
to design the car even if we were quite
lucky<00:02:49.349> because<00:02:49.890> our<00:02:52.040> Korean<00:02:53.040> engineers

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
lucky because our Korean engineers

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.729 
lucky because our Korean engineers
already<00:02:54.090> starts<00:02:54.569> we're<00:02:54.810> already<00:02:55.140> started<00:02:55.650> to

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
already starts we're already started to

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.070 
already starts we're already started to
do<00:02:56.099> something<00:02:56.489> so<00:02:57.209> we<00:02:57.330> are<00:02:57.420> just<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.780> improve

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
do something so we are just to improve

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.960 
do something so we are just to improve
it<00:02:58.230> but<00:02:58.410> yes<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.920> first<00:02:59.129> thing<00:02:59.310> was<00:02:59.519> to<00:02:59.550> find

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
it but yes the first thing was to find

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.900 
it but yes the first thing was to find
engineers<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.410> most<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.739> them<00:03:01.920> yes<00:03:02.129> I<00:03:02.519> worked

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
engineers so most of them yes I worked

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.260 
engineers so most of them yes I worked
before<00:03:03.060> them<00:03:03.420> with<00:03:03.720> them

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
before them with them

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.770 
before them with them
so<00:03:04.720> it's<00:03:04.900> people<00:03:05.200> with<00:03:05.320> red<00:03:05.800> experience<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:07.510> MA

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
so it's people with red experience so MA

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.940 
so it's people with red experience so MA
is<00:03:08.260> a<00:03:08.290> Formula<00:03:08.920> One<00:03:08.950> experience<00:03:09.550> and<00:03:10.800> so<00:03:11.800> it's

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
is a Formula One experience and so it's

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.990 
is a Formula One experience and so it's
people<00:03:12.130> coming<00:03:12.550> from<00:03:12.700> really<00:03:13.000> different

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
people coming from really different

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.840 
people coming from really different
motorsport<00:03:16.000> category<00:03:16.450> you<00:03:16.570> know<00:03:16.690> but<00:03:17.700> what<00:03:18.700> in

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
motorsport category you know but what in

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.120 
motorsport category you know but what in
the<00:03:19.000> end<00:03:19.180> it's<00:03:19.480> what<00:03:20.350> is<00:03:20.500> important<00:03:20.980> is<00:03:21.100> to

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
the end it's what is important is to

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.340 
the end it's what is important is to
find<00:03:21.430> people<00:03:21.610> which<00:03:22.330> first<00:03:22.600> are<00:03:22.750> motivated

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
find people which first are motivated

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.620 
find people which first are motivated
and<00:03:23.470> are<00:03:23.620> able<00:03:23.740> to<00:03:23.950> work<00:03:24.370> all<00:03:24.730> together<00:03:24.880> so

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
and are able to work all together so

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.040 
and are able to work all together so
it's<00:03:25.840> not<00:03:26.050> so<00:03:26.290> easy<00:03:26.500> but<00:03:27.010> I<00:03:27.430> I<00:03:28.120> think<00:03:28.600> we<00:03:28.780> really

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
it's not so easy but I I think we really

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.290 
it's not so easy but I I think we really
managed<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.680> do<00:03:29.770> it

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
managed to do it

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.000 
managed to do it
so<00:03:31.300> high-end<00:03:31.510> is<00:03:31.840> starting<00:03:32.230> from<00:03:32.350> scratch<00:03:32.650> in

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
so high-end is starting from scratch in

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.100 
so high-end is starting from scratch in
2014<00:03:33.610> but<00:03:33.790> it<00:03:33.910> looks<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.330> me<00:03:34.450> like<00:03:34.480> they<00:03:34.930> have

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
2014 but it looks to me like they have

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.140 
2014 but it looks to me like they have
got<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.470> whole<00:03:35.680> thing<00:03:35.980> covered<00:03:36.430> what<00:03:36.910> do<00:03:37.030> you

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
got the whole thing covered what do you

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.970 
got the whole thing covered what do you
think<00:03:37.420> do<00:03:37.840> you<00:03:37.870> think<00:03:37.990> own<00:03:38.380> don't<00:03:38.650> compete

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
think do you think own don't compete

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.590 
think do you think own don't compete
