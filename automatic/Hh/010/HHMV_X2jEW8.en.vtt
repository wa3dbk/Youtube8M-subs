00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.180
 Meanwhile preheat put 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.180
 180 degree centigrade oven 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.750
 You can also do this step by hand 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.700
 we will take a mold and we will 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.410
 butter well and then what in flour 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.800
 moss so that our cake is not us 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.800
 go to paste 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.610
 we will add the mixture of the mold and the 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.100
 bake we have for an hour 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.100
 approximately 180 degrees centigrade 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.130
 while it is baking we can go 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.380
 preparing the frosting of the cake for 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.180
 this we are going to mix the cream cheese with 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.010
 the half cup of sugar and we're going to 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.360
 add also the half grated 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.360
 orange and its juice 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.890
 passed to now let's introduce a 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.900
 stick in the cake when it comes out 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.920
 dry will mean that the cake is already 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.349
 list 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.709
 we take it out of the oven and let it 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.709
 cool 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.330
 once the cake is cold 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.000
 unmold and we're going to cut it 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.500
 cross way I do not have 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.150
 cake cutter I have them 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.130
 engineer so I took some chopsticks from 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.960
 teeth I put them in the middle of the cake 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.910
 to have a reference and by far 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.340
 careful with a knife I was cutting 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.200
 little by little to separate it help yourself with 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.930
 a large spatula or can serve 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.430
 also the base of the same mold we are going to 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.830
 proceed now with the filling of the 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.630
 cake 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.600
 for this we are going to use half of the 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.930
 next we anoint it and put it on 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.930
 another stage 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.480
 now we just end up covering 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.520
 all the cake with the remaining frosting and 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.520
 let's decorate with some nuts 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.250
