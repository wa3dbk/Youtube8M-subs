00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:04.560
&gt;&gt; JON: Hi everyone, it’s Jon.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.049
&gt;&gt; RYAN: And Ryan.

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.000
&gt;&gt; JON: And it’s another week of What’s
Ryan Tryin’ and Bin is on hand because she

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.820
actually picked out this challenge.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.850
&gt;&gt; BIN: I did. I went onto Pinterest to find
some good challenges for Ryan. And this is

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.260
the Dice Challenge from Minute to Win It.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Okay. I am not familiar.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.000
&gt;&gt; BIN: Not familiar? So what happens, is
you take one of these craft sticks and you

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.060
put it in your mouth.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.740
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Okay.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.550
&gt;&gt; BIN: And then you try to balance dice on
the end of the craft stick.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.240
And we’re going to do it a little different.
We aren’t going to do a minute. We are going

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.410
to see how many dice you can pile up at the
end of your craft stick before they all fall

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.880
down.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.580
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Okay. Sounds easy enough.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.300
&gt;&gt; BIN: And you are going to go against Jon.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.830
&gt;&gt; RYAN: You’re going down, Jon.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.950
&gt;&gt; BIN: …and see who wins.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.190
&gt;&gt; JON: Now I have a question, Bin. Do all
of the dice have to be one on top the other

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.210
straight up in the air?

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.790
&gt;&gt; BIN: Yes.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.580
You can’t just build a pyramid. No.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.350
One right on top of each other on the end
of the craft stick.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.600
&gt;&gt; JON: Alright. Let’s do this. And I thought
it was going to be Smoothie this week. You

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.229
got off easy.

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.409
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Yeah, I am glad it’s not Smoothie.

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:09.229
&gt;&gt; BIN: You’re welcome.

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.869
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Seven more days then we’ll deal
with the smoothies.

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.470
These things don’t taste the best, by the
way.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.730
&gt;&gt; BIN: Well, they are painted.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.110
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Painted with lead paint?

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:55.280
[Drum Roll]

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.419
&gt;&gt; Did that count as four or five?

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:02.909
&gt;&gt; RYAN: I got four to stay.

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.450
&gt;&gt; So the number to beat is four. What if
it’s a tie?

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.200
&gt;&gt; BIN: Worry about that when you get there.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.800
&gt;&gt; I’m pretty nervous. That was pretty impressive
Ryan, by the way.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.890
&gt;&gt; RYAN: My mouth started drying up.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.590
&gt;&gt; BIN: You can’t hold the popsicle stick!

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:30.170
[Drum Roll]

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.840
&gt;&gt; ALL: Awwww.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.500
&gt;&gt; It is a tie!

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.660
&gt;&gt; BIN: You guys should do it at the same
time for a tie-breaker.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.350
&gt;&gt; JON: For a tie-breaker. Okay, this is exciting.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.900
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Okay, I’m going to need a few more.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.600
How many do you have?

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.300
Okay, I have five, too.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:02.900
&gt;&gt; JON: Okay, we keep going and whoever drops
them first is the loser.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:26.220
[Suspenseful Music]

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.300
Holy smokes! The winner of the Dice Challenge
on What’s Ryan Tryin’…

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.310
&gt;&gt; BIN: … is Ryan! (Crowd Cheering)

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.650
&gt;&gt; JON: It’s been awhile since you’ve
won one of these challenges.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:40.370
&gt;&gt; RYAN: I know!

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.080
This is a pretty fun little game.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.920
&gt;&gt; JON: Well, congratulations!

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.050
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Well, thank you!

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.739
&gt;&gt; JON: We’ve had three really fun weeks
on What’s Ryan Tryin’.

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.110
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Yup. We’ve had Fish and Chips.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.950
&gt;&gt; JON: We had the Dessert Goldfish.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.239
&gt;&gt; RYAN: And the Dice.

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.550
&gt;&gt; JON: And you know next week will be the
Smoothie Challenge.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.430
&gt;&gt; RYAN: You know what would be good. If we
used the Goldfish from last week for the Smoothies.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.980
&gt;&gt; JON: Wouldn’t that be kind of a dry Smoothie?

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.540
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Well, we can add milk.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.570
&gt;&gt; JON: You know, I was thinking Ryan. (Plastic
Crinkling Noises)

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.830
Uh, quiet on the set, please.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:15.990
&gt;&gt; BIN: Teagan is playing with a water bottle.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.650
&gt;&gt; JON: Maybe we should leave it up to the
kids in the audience. I was thinking it would

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.639
be fun if in the Smoothie Challenge we do
the old switcheroo from what we did in the

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:24.060
Pizza Challenge.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.840
If you haven’t seen that, go back and check
out that video.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.610
In that video, Jenna and Bin picked out the
ingredients. While in the Smoothie Challenge,

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.940
how about me and you go out and try to pick
out the ingredients?

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.610
&gt;&gt; RYAN: I like the way this is going.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.169
Yeah, Yeah. That’s a great idea.

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:39.729
&gt;&gt; JON: What do you think, Jenna?

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:40.250
&gt;&gt; JENNA: Nooooo!!!

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.900
&gt;&gt; JON: So leave a comment below if you think
we should go out and get the ingredients for

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.680
Bin and Jenna.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.560
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Yeah, let us know who should be eating
the smoothie. Ryan and Jon or Bin and Jenna.

00:04:58.539 --> 00:04:59.070
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Bye.
