00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
really effective to get Kim shrieks and

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.360 
really effective to get Kim shrieks and
that<00:00:41.440> so<00:00:42.010> yeah<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:44.230> this<00:00:44.710> is<00:00:44.920> what<00:00:45.070> you<00:00:45.130> want<00:00:45.310> to

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.830 
that so yeah so this is what you want to
do<00:00:45.550> I've<00:00:45.820> came<00:00:46.060> to<00:00:46.150> put<00:00:46.300> it<00:00:46.390> on<00:00:46.510> a<00:00:46.540> cane<00:00:46.810> a

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
do I've came to put it on a cane a

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.470 
do I've came to put it on a cane a
slow-motion<00:00:47.440> setting<00:00:48.100> so<00:00:48.760> it<00:00:49.060> may<00:00:49.210> look<00:00:49.240> like

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
slow-motion setting so it may look like

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.020 
slow-motion setting so it may look like
I'm<00:00:49.750> spending<00:00:50.079> a<00:00:50.290> far<00:00:50.500> last<00:00:50.920> bit<00:00:51.130> of<00:00:51.220> weight<00:00:51.400> 20

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
I'm spending a far last bit of weight 20

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.020 
I'm spending a far last bit of weight 20
sensitivity<00:00:52.750> and<00:00:53.340> yeah<00:00:54.340> that's<00:00:54.790> why<00:00:54.940> I'm

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
sensitivity and yeah that's why I'm

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.569 
sensitivity and yeah that's why I'm
imminence<00:00:55.510> will<00:00:55.750> not<00:00:56.020> and<00:00:56.290> moving<00:00:56.680> slow<00:00:56.980> so

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
imminence will not and moving slow so

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.580 
imminence will not and moving slow so
you<00:00:57.610> want<00:00:57.910> to<00:00:58.030> claim<00:00:58.270> on<00:00:58.540> top<00:00:58.750> of<00:00:58.960> that<00:00:59.079> direct

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
you want to claim on top of that direct
