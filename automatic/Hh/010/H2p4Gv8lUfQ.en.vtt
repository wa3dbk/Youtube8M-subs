00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.510
 hi everyone is the axis 360 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.090
 and we end up today for the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.220
 third episode rather and tricks so 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.720
 we will start with turgis so this 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.189
 is a glitch and turgis group 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.960
 it works when you do the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.300
 congo in the glasses just do it 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.920
 a hard coronation back and this two 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.450
 100 votes the opponent in a trunk 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.800
 dimension actually I do not know 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.850
 really this bug is not even you from 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.010
 exploit it live 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.390
 I think if you have the advantage 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.820
 of life you get to do that in 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.500
 full match it can be really nice 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.750
 so it's up to you if you find any 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.239
 things with the one that says me it's me 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.550
 will be happy to bring them 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.199
 see the dimension or just just him 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.510
 send out this weekend or to type it 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.129
 cause and loire that's what makes them come back 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.469
 so then we'll move on to another 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.539
 trick with deidara construction so 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.910
 this trick looks a lot like the one 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.440
 de roshi maru follows the provost of zouzou 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.510
 and their henchmen his tenant you can 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.590
 to do your at all I do not think that 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.630
 you can go to secret techniques 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.750
 sat or have to go meet you 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.550
 once again we snap up from aida we 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.220
 internal and zozo explosion and you 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.630
 can place your technique 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.900
 then we will spend our trick with 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.850
 hidan and the sakon wall this trick 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.890
 which consists of passing the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.049
 secret technique of kisa but through 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.310
 the wall of his chronicle at the co 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.570
 the opponent expect 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.570
 this moment it's really nice 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.200
 so this trick also works with the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.030
 bluetooth or baffles and so that's 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.500
 what are you going to see you call 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.810
 world that bumps and makes you spend 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.280
 pebbles below chicago this guy is not 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.720
 bad for such an opponent who gets there 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.040
 do not wait so con is not the trick 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.620
 you can have an advantage over him 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.630
 would even if there is no link this is 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.920
 always it goes and it's okay here I go 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.650
 then send back to a rhythm 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.900
 really known with payne on the tower 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.520
 watch it is pretty well known but I hold 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.030
 still put it in my combo 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.040
 tips 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.720
 simply block the opponent 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.090
 held wanted to make the generator 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.920
 it's as if he had the frenzy this 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.330
 that the peculiarity of his manners and 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.970
 Blocks the opponent without knocking 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.560
 I'll see you again here I am 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.880
 amounts to about three quarters of the 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.920
 lists that is really not bad at all 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.590
 so we'll go to the next 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.570
 last trick with league 1 so I 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.510
 do not know if you know yachting the 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.550
 private risoux affected when 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.340
 the opponent is down here you are 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.110
 go see the bowling projection 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.390
 great autumn and the universal and me this 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.459
 who still makes us feel good 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.140
 a small congo can then the 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.320
 customize them how can you I 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.570
 think to exploit it well enough 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.280
 so that was for then have touched the 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.920
 end of the episode towards tutorial and tips 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.959

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.670
