first thing with Flemish bond so now

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.480 
first thing with Flemish bond so now
let's<00:00:24.210> start<00:00:24.269> drive<00:00:24.689> on<00:00:26.750> so<00:00:28.160> coin<00:00:29.160> brick

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
let's start drive on so coin brick

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.850 
let's start drive on so coin brick
closure<00:00:30.439> and<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.590> stretcher<00:00:32.189> then<00:00:32.699> a<00:00:32.730> header<00:00:36.860> on

build first course dry bonded of Flemish
bond<00:01:09.390> corner<00:01:10.370> so<00:01:11.370> we're<00:01:11.580> now<00:01:11.760> putting<00:01:12.110> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
bond corner so we're now putting the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.550
