00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.649
 hello and welcome to our 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.540
 product videos today quite a bit 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.370
 especially stable support wheel which like 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.309
 newly added to the range 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.950
 the home simon and we have it 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:19.280
 two different versions on the one hand 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.550
 on the left side we have the support wheel 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.220
 with a crank up and down one 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.120
 welded support wheel flange that is 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.650
 the article number 482 110 and the 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.260
 right side we have the same 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.749
 supporting wheel here only with lateral crank 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.969
 and without mounting flange below 

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:40.879
 These support wheels are really great 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:43.010
 Stable I'll make a comparison 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.749
 an automatic support wheel like this 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.230
 conventional is next to it so that the 

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:49.489
 can see size comparison 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.679
 right here in the picture is now the 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.399
 standard automatic support wheel inserted 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:59.539
 has the article number 482 0 10 with us 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.129
 and that simon hard that 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.139
 stützrädern you can clearly see the 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.879
 difference we have here at the 

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:06.890
 standard automatic he is already one 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.170
 60s spindle was already quite stable 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.450
 but with the heavy loud support wheels 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.950
 we have a square exterior housing 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.930
 with 70 x 70 mm, the rubber is fully rubber advice 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.490
 down much much bigger and heavier the 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.689
 mounted and is naturally on 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.579
 steel rim also we have one below 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.869
 bolt robust durable plug 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:29.450
 lock and how it all 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.850
 I'll show you again 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.799
 fortification of the bath is here 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.079
 beautiful solid welded 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.530
 support wheel flange available for this 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.090
 has eight holes we know the 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.369
 normal standard fixing hole 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.920
 a supportive meat is something like that 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.259
 with stronger support wheels we have 1 4 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.679
 hole flange with a transverse bore of 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.829
 about 105 mm and one vertical 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.990
 distance of 50 mm and this model 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.880
 can also be found here on this support wheel 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.090
 plant again and through the eight 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.399
 we have holes here 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.380
 following possibility we still have the 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.479
 possibility the support once in the 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.000
 height by about two 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.310
 centimeters in the value factory either the 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.489
 bottom of many blog or take us for 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.680
 decide the top four blog 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:20.340
 we have completely retracted from 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.730
 earth bottom to about mid- flange one 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.540
 height of 22 centimeters and one 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:31.110
 Total height about 77 centimeters 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.750
 in the next step we will be the wheel 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.549
 Unlock down through the suburbs 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.310
 and completely extend 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.590
 The piece had a classic robust 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.680
 plug bolt lock around the town hall 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.190
 to fold away the back here 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.750
 fuse sprint title plugged in full too 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:54.720
 traffic off and can now use the wheel 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:03:02.160
 expand downwards after that yourself 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:04.260
 simply put the regulation back in place 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.920
 fuse plays again and 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.569
 so we have the wheel locked full 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.819
 then we have extended thanks to the 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.670
 generous googles of about 270 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:19.829
 millimeters reached a ground level 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:22.970
 from about 75 centimeters from the earth bottom to 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.920
 to the middle of the flesh 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.260
 the total height of the wheel is then 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.030
 extended 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.030
 everywhere is about 130 cm
