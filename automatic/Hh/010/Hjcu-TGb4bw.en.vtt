 atoms short 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.530
 and dynamic peak 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.579
 make static 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:14.769
 By the way drives and Pierre is very necessary for those

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.529
 he will be very 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.919
 is useful 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.849
 so as not to change it every time just 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:24.710
 dynamic peak after each 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.529
 turning off your ISP 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.669

 badly 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.670
 Now I will show how this can be solved 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.730
 mata only 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.280
 her minute 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.120
 maybe even less 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.430
 so we start 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.580
 but here I start let’s come in at the interrogation 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.370
 let's go to NATO website 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.370

 year m 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.210
 117 last as we see it such data 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.120
 I now removed that from me now 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.040
 percent 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.260
 simply 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.110
 dynamic open 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.560
 here for example disconnect from 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.870
 provider 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.090

 disable our provider 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.180
 we reach my computer 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.190
 network assassinations 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.320

 and how or components of our network 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:26.519
 we are interested in internet protocol 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:27.589
 the edges 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:31.029
 clicks n and drink pi 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:33.209
 those kipe and ally 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.479
 push 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:36.199
 need said point 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:39.479
 for the start analog bravely stand girls 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:42.489

 You see how to get a rally 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:54.069
 Taipei automatically 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.489
 this is called dynamic 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.909
 he automatically gives each time 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:00.980
 but we need to use 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.049
 the next peak is our we we choose 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.099
 your cage 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.099
 how do you even start us run 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:12.909
 letters such a team 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.930
 if on early index expert 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:16.969
 withdraw 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:19.109
 project and japan 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.539
 there will be just 

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:23.969
 this is where cats need to write 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:25.209
 priangarye 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.209
 even on the uterus on this our 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.109
 our concern 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.739
 our boarding school 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.879
 pike perch we write

 comp peak 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.409
 our plans 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:43.839
 here you are candles 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:46.839
 local network and there is no our network 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:49.619
 what we need to do 

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:52.619
 we connect back our providers 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.209
 and once again writes

 clown 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:02.680
 all here now 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.129
 but here I will 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.129
 and drank the adapter 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.340
 Here is our pipe and which reviewed 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.689
 which we want to make static 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:13.649
 who just did not change 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:15.419
 maybe it's the way to remove bye 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.489
 brag so mowing the largest treasure 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.570
 Taiping repair more like 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.570
 kataev make static 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.759
 take 

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:30.329
 using the following at copy address 

00:04:30.329 --> 00:04:32.979
 no phrase 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.939
 they cried city

 148 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:51.099
 at 117 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:52.240
 absurd 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.150
 here you need to write anything 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.309
 but you can say we all did our year 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:04:59.599
 positively 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.180
 use countries 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.289
 that's nonsense 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.289
 should the stick stand here should not points 

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:09.900
 we go in with the president 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.849
 here goes 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:14.389
 using three browsing 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.479
 if really allochka 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.719
 you can not find go to any destination 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.259
 we can say that Baskakov will not 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:22.960
 never 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.180
 until you type call thrill 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.180
 Well, it is necessary to frighten a tick 

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:31.059
 gum press 

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:32.250
 here to turn off 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.110
 even over critical 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.580
 our us park them 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.969
 and in Kiev 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:41.059
 now you need to turn it off and on 

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:43.889
 us from the provider 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.460
 we don’t need to close this 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.020
 we close 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.749
 turn on our 

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:52.330
 connect our provider 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.229
 key our project 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:57.430
 as industry says s turned off then 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.009
 turned on the hour the other was olimpik 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:03.009
 but now we go 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:06.539
 2 and one 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:08.949
 what anikees 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:09.839
 h 

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:12.300
 and the ashes remained the same 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.490

 in which dance yourself in the system 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.870
 on protocols like after this league 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.870
