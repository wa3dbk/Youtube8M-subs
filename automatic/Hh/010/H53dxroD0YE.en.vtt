00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.870
 see how you like a simple white iphone 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.330
 case 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.369
 This make that rocky missing for 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.990
 spring and that with just split and 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.610
 So night was a good reason for you 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.020
 to buy daily and 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.020
 You spotted life minute , among other things 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.039
 at steve die quiet and demi lovato 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.420
 before we get started we don't do it 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.210
 patience ready exposure is what do you have them 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.680
 if needed an iphone case just white 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.840
 plastic 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.530
 you still need some 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.920
 all-purpose glue and nail polish I use three 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.290
 species nail a pink 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.070
 balance liter and one blue one more 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.440
 times when shopping 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.610
 also send a hard case and paste because 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.989
 more and more of those brackets can 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.159
 back two phone or fake 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.479
 shame city is to lay down the 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:00.190
 pieces in the pattern I like you so well 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:03.629
 and we make the pattern it 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.629
 is inspired by the architect brake 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.830
 but now the marker with a drop 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.780
 glue and then place on the cover 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.100
 and press them very well 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.100
 completes the red in this way 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.070
 chinese impatient with so i can do that too 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.090
 just rub a shower with glue on it 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.090
 places where pattern comes 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.990
 and then you print this Stefan 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.550
 we also run pattern and 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.550
 See if that looks nice anyway 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.020
 if this is tight and the glue 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.580
 dry then start their white nail polish 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.350
 determine yourself which line which which color 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.730
 he is more careful the 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.380
 nail polish on the tip 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.910
 lubricates brush well on the edge of 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.390
 jar so there are no drops or it 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.390
 case lessons 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.149
 like all colors of nail polish 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.149
 let the nail polish dry well 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.370
 and ready your case for it myself 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.410
