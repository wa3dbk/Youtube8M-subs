00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:17.420
 hello everyone today we are on unpacking 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:22.410
 Another package from China site dx.com 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:25.260
 as we see, 47 days waited for her 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.010
 she got faster some days maybe 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.759
 30 maybe even less because somewhere 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.309
 20-25 days and and did not send from dx 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.440
 because probably there was no product 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.440
 stock and I waited a very long time 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.739
 but it's okay a package after all 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.579
 sent out and basically and even divided into 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.260
 three parts this is one of three parts here's to 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.109
 I got very quickly 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.659
 but let's open it and see what kind of product is there 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:01:02.059
 chick got to me and here here 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:07.170
 such is the Chinese flavor 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:11.880
 I ordered myself in a car 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:17.430
 such miniatures are some small so 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:22.670
 latch and it hangs where windproof 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:28.140
 crops without a stove blowing to u gizmo 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:31.710
 here inside probably smell that is not 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.640
 smell quadrice here inside here groping 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:46.590
 all the same yes just how it is scents and 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:52.549
 don't remember stopping like this faucet 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:57.070
 iterator decide what is here 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:02:07.420
 flavors and not the place bitten 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:08.229
 and when we have a full look weâ€™ll open 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.600
 was line 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:19.440
 I do not remember exactly here even see 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:23.110
 packing 2 flavoring 2.3 same and 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:33.270
 try to install it as there it is 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:39.540
 we must be established as we 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.540
 pictures are set so this is here 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:49.770
 we see there we install them 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.770
 so let's see 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.560
 about the second 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.560
 So 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.830
 one 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.540
 kendama 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.540
 this 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.890
 we insert 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.710
 costa 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.570
 like 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:30.550
 blown out so slightly wrong 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:32.550
 she left a little move so that 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:40.050
 here we see more in order 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:40.050
 It happens these flavors and it does not work 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.220
 but the smell is so nice so soft 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.780
 lungs 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.420
 Yes, as if the line like. 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.190
 but not transfer well, very smell is shorter 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:04:00.390
 pleasant didn't like it smell 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:03.300
 says so what can you like 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.150
 this cheap fragrances basically he 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:10.400
 made cheap here even on packaging 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:14.010
 it seems to be valuable indicated up to 4 dollars 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.280
 It turns out that's not in principle the smell 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.520
 liked if anyone liked the form 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.670
 the flavor itself you can 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.650
 acquire but as we see probably 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.070
 one-time because we have such 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.160
 descendant from the decision to go 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:35.580
 such a cool thing in the car 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.130
 Well, everything in the principle of unpacking is still more than 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.740
