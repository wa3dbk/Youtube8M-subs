00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.800
 hello how about friends here again the 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.950
 I greet your server Luis Gerardo del 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.300
 disney channel 488 and well I want to give you the 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.210
 welcome in this video in which 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.830
 we will be giving therefore a challenge that good 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.450
 I can not consider it as a challenge that 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.760
 it would be rather like a small effect to 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.880
 an image is quite simple enough 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.039
 basic this video is basically for 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.470
 teach everyone good what we have already 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.119
 seen and this will make them extremely easy 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.769
 and if you do not know how to do it with this 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.320
 video you will know how to do as you can see 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:33.770
 we will be doing what the image is 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:37.820
 from the beginning of the video that is this 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.310
 we see that it is a picture a little bit is not 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.410
 this is not going to look at what is the 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.270
 chava vale let's look at what is a 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.820
 blank color a blank image and 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.180
 black and has the skirt what they are 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.040
 those of the little yellow colors is 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.450
 what comes in the skirt ok this is what 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.710
 what are we going to do and can we also 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.720
 change the color the red or another voucher 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.570
 I repeat that it is not for 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:11.000
 put the waters the style is worth so 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:12.950
 let's start before continuing to be 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.570
 remember you were doing pattern 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.740
 new by express hosting 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.110
 remember to visit www.expreso.com.mx if 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.650
 you are interested in hiring a domain type 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.480
 it's worth it now let's continue we're going to 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.750
 direct to what is our photoshop 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.390
 and in forums and we have what is this 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.220
 image that you open to the green here 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.170
 let's work in this case with this 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.750
 let's make an effect let's put a 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.540
 arc and black and what is what is the 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.880
 We are going to put color in this doll ok 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.850
 this is an effect as I say quite 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.550
 pretty pretty useful and good I hope so 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.860
 and be your pleasure to start 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.790
 ok let's start let's double 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.009
 the layer and we're going to duplicate it again that 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.660
 be three times as you see here and in the 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.350
 background layer , we unchecked it 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.700
 we position in what is 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:09.500
 background cap copy ok let's go for this what 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.780
 let's saturate, let's go to the bottom 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.170
 copied let's go to picture adjustments of 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.440
 saturate and good once structured 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.400
 let's go to add what the effect is 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.090
 or a layer to be able 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.459
 cut and color this part to 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.980
 to be seen remember well that we should 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.720
 have a layer here so you can do 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.379
 this the bottom layer should be in 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.290
 colour 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:39.500
 now let's add what is one thing 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.299
 added here what is a mask of 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.939
 layer and in this mask and layer we're going to 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:47.299
 choose a brush a brush remember in 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:49.099
 a faded tone in the size for there 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.409
 can you measure it me in this case 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.629
 I'm going to measure it a little bit more 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:57.790
 great this we already know how to do is 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:03:01.870
 higher control or control nothing more 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.549
 be a bit bigger in hardness but what 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.030
 we do like this and we're going to start giving 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.030
 brush strokes 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.360
 remember that you must have the black of 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.460
 frontal color we continue 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.460
 and we are going to do this as we can see 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.959
 the little stuffed animal in this case is 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.720
 putting color is the effect that 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.960
 we want to achieve 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.080
 make the little stuffed animal look 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:34.350
 color that we do this a little bit 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.760
 smaller to be able to perfect it a 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.500
 a little better 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.409
 and so we can continue doing it with the 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.460
 what a hell and friends this is how you 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:45.860
 I repeat quite simple easy 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.170
 and good friends as you can see we are seen 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.880
 what is the little animal in this 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.190
 case your stuffed animal and this we can do 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.440
 with any object for example here what 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.920
 they did with what is the skirt in this 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.300
 case 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.430
 we put with this 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.680
 okay so it's pretty simple 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.990
 we manage what is a layer mask 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.290
 and we can continue doing it as well as with 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.270
 any image we can put a 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.430
 model and others that brought the lips 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.520
 they can only exist so it can be and 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.830
 to this little tutorial remember and if it is 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.540
 something basic something very simple but in 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.060
 truth gives a pretty good effect on 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.760
 reality in photographs as what is 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.190
 is this image and good, because this would be 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.200
