00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
mean which is not much of a surprise

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.170 
mean which is not much of a surprise
because<00:02:44.250> he<00:02:44.910> was<00:02:45.000> only<00:02:45.120> selling<00:02:45.569> 80<00:02:45.750> decks<00:02:46.079> and

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
because he was only selling 80 decks and

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.720 
because he was only selling 80 decks and
there<00:02:48.180> was<00:02:48.329> maybe<00:02:49.109> I<00:02:49.590> don't<00:02:50.160> know<00:02:50.280> I'm<00:02:50.670> just

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
there was maybe I don't know I'm just

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.520 
there was maybe I don't know I'm just
guessing<00:02:51.299> around<00:02:51.569> a<00:02:51.750> thousand<00:02:52.139> people<00:02:52.260> that

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
guessing around a thousand people that

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.610 
guessing around a thousand people that
wanted<00:02:52.799> one<00:02:53.010> so<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.420> feel<00:02:54.810> pretty<00:02:54.840> special<00:02:55.200> to

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
wanted one so I feel pretty special to

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.840 
wanted one so I feel pretty special to
actually<00:02:55.980> get<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.519> yellow<00:02:56.730> wood<00:02:58.370> so<00:02:59.450> yeah<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.750> I

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
actually get a yellow wood so yeah and I

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.240 
actually get a yellow wood so yeah and I
think<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:03.450> wafer<00:03:04.200> nacelles<00:03:04.709> decks<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.069> lot

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
think a wafer nacelles decks a lot

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.539 
think a wafer nacelles decks a lot
easier<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:06.139> he's<00:03:07.139> not<00:03:07.380> selling<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:08.010> slim<00:03:08.340> tape

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
easier is he's not selling the slim tape

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.509 
easier is he's not selling the slim tape
his<00:03:08.790> new<00:03:08.970> slim<00:03:09.299> tape<00:03:09.829> he's<00:03:10.829> not<00:03:11.010> selling<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.400> by

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
his new slim tape he's not selling it by

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.860 
his new slim tape he's not selling it by
itself<00:03:11.790> he's<00:03:12.030> only<00:03:12.180> selling<00:03:12.600> it<00:03:12.660> with<00:03:12.750> his

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
itself he's only selling it with his

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.629 
itself he's only selling it with his
decks<00:03:13.139> so<00:03:13.530> people<00:03:13.769> really<00:03:13.980> want<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.280> try<00:03:14.430> that

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
decks so people really want to try that

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:20.509 
decks so people really want to try that
out<00:03:14.700> so<00:03:15.450> they<00:03:15.569> buy<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.780> decks<00:03:17.150> but<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:19.519> yellow

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
out so they buy the decks but the yellow

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.360 
out so they buy the decks but the yellow
wood<00:03:20.790> slim<00:03:21.120> tapered<00:03:21.299> river<00:03:21.720> its<00:03:22.160> point<00:03:23.160> eighty

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
wood slim tapered river its point eighty

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.640 
wood slim tapered river its point eighty
millimeters<00:03:23.870> this<00:03:24.870> is<00:03:25.049> point<00:03:25.319> fifty

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
millimeters this is point fifty

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.349 
millimeters this is point fifty
millimeters<00:03:26.190> so<00:03:26.609> I<00:03:27.170> mean<00:03:28.170> I<00:03:28.849> guess<00:03:29.849> I'm<00:03:30.030> kind
