 frankly a big big big bravo to 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.350
 you seem to have found a little bit of 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.700
 destined in glitches just 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.620
 lock zombies by doing triangle 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.239
 that two triangles or triangle that you have 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.840
 tutorial will arrive soon because you are 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.280
 many to ask me do you 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.480
 so put exactly when I got 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.040
 put on the pole ie you 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.290
 did not stick to the posts I'm backing you 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.390
 a little way to see the hole there or 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.949
 will the zombie appear 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.510
 and as soon as you see you aim and that 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.220
 you are very quickly so you have 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.930
 take off a little envied you're going to land 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.150
 above this platform you are 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.680
 totally invincible useless you 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.809
 say a goal at the height you are 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.920
 no one can touch you 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.809
 the interest of this master lean on the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.280
 post so it's just right above 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.270
 poles there is a very big 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.860
 invisible barrier 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.960
 so when you put bend you 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.520
 can land here otherwise I do not you 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.450
 did not bend over it's impossible to 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.260
 to cross this barrier she is 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.820
 far too high 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.220
 so once have you said if so you 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.600
 can attract zombies and when 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.090
 you go up on this little platform 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.439
 the zombies will not move anymore so they 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.240
 do not move anymore and you can see 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.890
 that they do not move anymore so you can 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.060
 kill them very easily instead of that 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.960
 go around in circles and then use these 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.729
 ammunition unnecessarily 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.320
 I'll show you the zombies 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.329
 were attracted by month I show here 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.340

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.380
 curly so you can very holster 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.789

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.070

 ah but you're still here this is a little 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.820
 bonus that is really very very funny 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.649
 to do it just take the 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.060
 helping hand once you jump 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.920
 so at this place near the bars 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.599
 you must seek to lie down well 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.580
 as I am exactly as I am 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.739
 so my so be lying in front of them 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.500
 bars so you can 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.540
 pierce and be here totally to 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.980
 the zombie shelter then you 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.180
 unclassified down here marking you 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.709
 can not get up you step back a 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.420
 little you can get up when you 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.209
 are here you jump is short and well 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.489
 in that order otherwise it will not work 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.870
 then you resauter on the bars 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.580
 there you do not need you 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.130
 really lying down you can re 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.540
 just look forward to bedtime and 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.680
 back to the bars where you can 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.880
 so pierce them if I'm from 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.040
 look for a little family 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.170
 it can block but nothing too much 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.420
 annoying now here you have 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.160
 pierce the bars and you're from 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.510
 the other side of this magnificent lifeline 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.670
 so it's useless to tell you that you are 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.470
 always invincible a big bravo and a 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.069
 big thanks to the king as only hd of 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.360
 the rsp for finding this little 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.599
 secret room if we can say that like 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.190
 it 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.360
 so there you can not go on the 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.470
 sides when you see I was trying 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.840
 to try to go then you could 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.420
 go down here and continue the spot of 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.829

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.209
