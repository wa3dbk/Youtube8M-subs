g'day<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:04.740> welcome<00:00:04.950> back<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.370> build<00:00:05.640> some<00:00:05.910> and

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
g'day and welcome back to build some and

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.539 
g'day and welcome back to build some and
in<00:00:06.690> today's<00:00:07.080> video<00:00:07.440> what<00:00:07.980> I<00:00:08.040> want<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.309> show<00:00:08.490> you

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:08.549 
in today's video what I want to show you

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:13.280 
in today's video what I want to show you
is<00:00:08.820> how<00:00:09.090> we<00:00:09.120> calculate<00:00:09.769> the<00:00:10.769> drop<00:00:11.370> off<00:00:12.050> on<00:00:13.050> our

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
is how we calculate the drop off on our

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.429 
is how we calculate the drop off on our
roof<00:00:14.000> but<00:00:15.000> basically<00:00:15.360> what<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.599> drop<00:00:15.840> off<00:00:16.020> is

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:16.439 
roof but basically what the drop off is

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.140 
roof but basically what the drop off is
if<00:00:17.130> i<00:00:17.279> zoom<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:18.119> here<00:00:18.540> it<00:00:19.160> is<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.550> distance

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
if i zoom in here it is the distance

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.189 
if i zoom in here it is the distance
down<00:00:21.570> from<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.230> top<00:00:22.560> plate<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.420> where<00:00:24.420> it

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
down from the top plate to where it

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.480 
down from the top plate to where it
would<00:00:25.380> be<00:00:25.529> level<00:00:25.859> with<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.189> end<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.400> our

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
would be level with the end of our

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.840 
would be level with the end of our
afters<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:26.970> it's<00:00:27.390> this<00:00:27.570> distance<00:00:28.250> here<00:00:29.250> formed

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:29.850 
afters so it's this distance here formed

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.540 
afters so it's this distance here formed
by<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.029> yellow<00:00:30.390> triangle<00:00:31.070> so<00:00:32.070> from<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.340> top

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
by this yellow triangle so from the top

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.969 
by this yellow triangle so from the top
of<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.760> plate<00:00:33.019> down<00:00:34.019> to<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.379> point<00:00:34.710> that's

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:34.979 
of the plate down to a point that's

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:39.200 
of the plate down to a point that's
level<00:00:35.400> with<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.760> bottom<00:00:36.089> of<00:00:36.300> our<00:00:37.080> rafter<00:00:38.210> okay

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
level with the bottom of our rafter okay

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.450 
level with the bottom of our rafter okay
so<00:00:39.269> that's<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.989> drop<00:00:40.409> off<00:00:40.589> now<00:00:40.799> the<00:00:40.860> common

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
so that's the drop off now the common

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.570 
so that's the drop off now the common
uses<00:00:41.790> for<00:00:42.089> the<00:00:42.150> drop<00:00:42.390> off<00:00:42.680> one<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.339> give<00:00:44.489> us

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
uses for the drop off one is to give us

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.840 
uses for the drop off one is to give us
a<00:00:44.699> point<00:00:45.000> for<00:00:45.839> our<00:00:45.930> brick<00:00:46.199> layer<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:47.400> lay<00:00:47.610> their

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
a point for our brick layer to lay their

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.090 
a point for our brick layer to lay their
bricks<00:00:48.120> through<00:00:48.530> now<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.680> would<00:00:49.830> generally

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
bricks through now that would generally

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.210 
bricks through now that would generally
have<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.960> 1015<00:00:51.960> mil<00:00:52.350> lower<00:00:52.589> than<00:00:52.890> our<00:00:53.040> drop

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
have to be 1015 mil lower than our drop

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.250 
have to be 1015 mil lower than our drop
off<00:00:53.370> because<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:54.540> have<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.809> keep<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.110> distance

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
off because you have to keep a distance

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.570 
off because you have to keep a distance
or<00:00:55.799> AM<00:00:56.220> a<00:00:57.350> clearance<00:00:58.350> between<00:00:58.559> our<00:00:58.860> Eve<00:00:59.100> and

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
or AM a clearance between our Eve and

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.369 
or AM a clearance between our Eve and
the<00:00:59.790> upper<00:01:00.030> crook<00:01:00.239> if<00:01:00.479> you<00:01:00.780> had<00:01:00.900> level<00:01:01.199> leaves

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
the upper crook if you had level leaves

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.759 
the upper crook if you had level leaves
and<00:01:01.769> the<00:01:02.699> other<00:01:02.820> reason<00:01:03.540> that<00:01:03.570> we'd<00:01:03.839> use<00:01:04.440> it

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
and the other reason that we'd use it

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.160 
and the other reason that we'd use it
it's<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.339> could<00:01:05.489> locate<00:01:05.990> where<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
it's so that we could locate where the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.569 
it's so that we could locate where the
top<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.560> windows<00:01:07.920> would<00:01:08.100> have<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.399> finish

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
top of the windows would have to finish

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.990 
top of the windows would have to finish
if<00:01:08.969> you're<00:01:09.750> going<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.990> run<00:01:10.170> out<00:01:10.200> Eve<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:11.189> flush

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
if you're going to run out Eve in flush

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.510 
if you're going to run out Eve in flush
out<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.329> the<00:01:12.390> top<00:01:12.539> of<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.689> windows<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.520> you

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
out of the top of the windows so you

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.279 
out of the top of the windows so you
need<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.820> work<00:01:14.939> out<00:01:15.149> how<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.689> calculate<00:01:15.930> our

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
need to work out how to calculate our

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:20.240 
need to work out how to calculate our
drop<00:01:16.619> off<00:01:17.329> so<00:01:18.329> it's<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:19.109> reasonably<00:01:19.740> easy<00:01:19.950> we

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
drop off so it's a reasonably easy we

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.319 
drop off so it's a reasonably easy we
need<00:01:20.429> to<00:01:20.520> know<00:01:20.609> couple<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.969> things

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
need to know couple of things

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:26.029 
need to know couple of things
the<00:01:21.630> formula<00:01:22.079> is<00:01:22.399> 10<00:01:24.439> times<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.590> roof<00:01:25.829> pitch

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
the formula is 10 times the roof pitch

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.910 
the formula is 10 times the roof pitch
and<00:01:26.539> then<00:01:27.539> we<00:01:27.659> times<00:01:27.929> that<00:01:28.229> by<00:01:28.469> the<00:01:28.530> eaves

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
and then we times that by the eaves

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.730 
and then we times that by the eaves
width<00:01:30.350> okay<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.310> case<00:01:32.579> our<00:01:33.740> roof

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
width okay so in this case our roof

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.289 
width okay so in this case our roof
pitch<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.460> 30<00:01:35.969> degrees<00:01:36.359> the<00:01:36.960> angle<00:01:37.170> here<00:01:37.530> and

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
pitch is 30 degrees the angle here and

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.859 
pitch is 30 degrees the angle here and
our<00:01:39.299> eaves<00:01:39.689> width<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:41.359> 300<00:01:42.359> mil<00:01:42.539> from<00:01:42.719> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
our eaves width is 300 mil from the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.609 
our eaves width is 300 mil from the
brickwork<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:45.600> outside<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.229> rafter

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
brickwork to the outside of the rafter

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.279 
brickwork to the outside of the rafter
however<00:01:47.600> because<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.719> is<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.899> brick<00:01:49.109> veneer

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
however because this is a brick veneer

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.389 
however because this is a brick veneer
example<00:01:50.159> we<00:01:51.149> need<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.450> add<00:01:51.539> 110<00:01:52.499> mil<00:01:52.770> for<00:01:53.159> our

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
example we need to add 110 mil for our

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.739 
example we need to add 110 mil for our
brick<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.530> 40<00:01:55.530> mil<00:01:55.710> for<00:01:55.920> our<00:01:55.979> cavity<00:01:56.719> so<00:01:57.719> that

00:01:57.739 --> 00:01:57.749 
brick and 40 mil for our cavity so that

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:59.330 
brick and 40 mil for our cavity so that
will<00:01:57.960> give<00:01:58.079> us<00:01:58.109> a<00:01:58.289> total<00:01:58.499> of<00:01:58.679> four<00:01:58.950> hundred<00:01:58.979> and

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
will give us a total of four hundred and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.520 
will give us a total of four hundred and
fifty<00:01:59.639> mil<00:01:59.819> for<00:02:00.600> our<00:02:00.749> eaves<00:02:01.020> widths<00:02:02.600> okay

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.830 

so<00:02:08.530> there's<00:02:08.860> a<00:02:08.920> formula<00:02:09.519> there<00:02:10.349> 1030<00:02:11.370> times

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
so there's a formula there 1030 times

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.040 
so there's a formula there 1030 times
450<00:02:13.840> ml<00:02:14.019> and<00:02:14.260> as<00:02:14.980> I<00:02:15.010> said<00:02:15.310> before<00:02:15.430> 300<00:02:16.000> plus<00:02:16.510> 110

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
450 ml and as I said before 300 plus 110

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.059 
450 ml and as I said before 300 plus 110
plus<00:02:17.260> 40<00:02:17.680> gives<00:02:18.370> us<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.790> 450<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.830> answer

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
plus 40 gives us the 450 so the answer

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.430 
plus 40 gives us the 450 so the answer
to<00:02:21.190> that<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:22.410> 0.25<00:02:23.410> nine<00:02:23.650> eight<00:02:23.860> so<00:02:24.819> let's<00:02:25.060> say

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
to that is 0.25 nine eight so let's say

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.860 
to that is 0.25 nine eight so let's say
260<00:02:26.440> ml<00:02:26.650> is<00:02:26.890> our<00:02:27.700> drop<00:02:28.000> off<00:02:28.209> now<00:02:28.480> this<00:02:28.629> is<00:02:28.840> a

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
260 ml is our drop off now this is a

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.650 
260 ml is our drop off now this is a
trust<00:02:29.230> roof<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:30.280> we<00:02:30.819> don't<00:02:31.030> have<00:02:31.180> any<00:02:31.330> birds

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
trust roof and we don't have any birds

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.800 
trust roof and we don't have any birds
mouth<00:02:31.959> however<00:02:32.349> if<00:02:33.090> we<00:02:34.090> were<00:02:34.209> to<00:02:34.269> have<00:02:34.510> a

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
mouth however if we were to have a

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.819 
mouth however if we were to have a
bird's<00:02:35.319> mouth<00:02:36.239> then<00:02:37.239> you<00:02:37.930> can<00:02:38.110> see<00:02:38.470> that

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
bird's mouth then you can see that

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:43.259 
bird's mouth then you can see that
there's<00:02:39.130> a<00:02:39.370> distance<00:02:40.090> here<00:02:40.920> from<00:02:42.239> where<00:02:43.239> our

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
there's a distance here from where our

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.780 
there's a distance here from where our
triangle<00:02:43.870> finishes<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.709> top<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.190> top<00:02:45.400> of

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
triangle finishes to the top the top of

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.630 
triangle finishes to the top the top of
the<00:02:45.849> plate<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.299> we<00:02:46.510> need<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:47.430> accommodate<00:02:48.430> all

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
the plate and we need to accommodate all

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.940 
the plate and we need to accommodate all
we<00:02:48.970> need<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.269> add<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:49.900> distance<00:02:50.349> into<00:02:50.650> it<00:02:50.769> if

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
we need to add that distance into it if

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.460 
we need to add that distance into it if
we<00:02:51.099> have<00:02:51.310> I<00:02:51.610> traditionally<00:02:52.360> cut<00:02:52.930> roof<00:02:53.170> with<00:02:53.440> a

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
we have I traditionally cut roof with a

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.979 
we have I traditionally cut roof with a
bird's<00:02:53.739> mouth<00:02:54.299> so<00:02:55.299> the<00:02:55.450> first<00:02:55.660> step<00:02:55.870> is

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
bird's mouth so the first step is

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.619 
bird's mouth so the first step is
exactly<00:02:56.349> the<00:02:56.470> same<00:02:56.680> we've<00:02:57.280> worked<00:02:57.519> out<00:02:57.760> that

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
exactly the same we've worked out that

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.729 
exactly the same we've worked out that
it's<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:59.140> 160<00:03:00.129> ml<00:03:00.310> from<00:03:00.670> here<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:02.079> here<00:03:02.349> all<00:03:02.620> we

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
it's to 160 ml from here to here all we

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.220 
it's to 160 ml from here to here all we
have<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:03.010> do<00:03:03.129> is<00:03:03.280> add<00:03:03.489> that<00:03:04.390> remaining<00:03:04.840> bird's

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
have to do is add that remaining bird's

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.949 
have to do is add that remaining bird's
mouth<00:03:05.349> in<00:03:05.709> now<00:03:05.920> quite<00:03:06.700> easily<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.390> measure

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
mouth in now quite easily to measure

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.770 
mouth in now quite easily to measure
that<00:03:08.200> distance<00:03:08.349> or<00:03:09.099> it<00:03:09.970> could<00:03:10.180> be<00:03:10.299> given<00:03:10.450> to

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
that distance or it could be given to

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.280 
that distance or it could be given to
you<00:03:11.940> however<00:03:12.940> I<00:03:13.180> have<00:03:13.269> some<00:03:13.510> cruel<00:03:14.079> sadistic

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
you however I have some cruel sadistic

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.940 
you however I have some cruel sadistic
people<00:03:15.630> use<00:03:16.630> a<00:03:16.660> method<00:03:17.109> called<00:03:17.139> horizontal

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
people use a method called horizontal

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.220 
people use a method called horizontal
bearing<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:18.940> what<00:03:19.510> they<00:03:19.600> do<00:03:19.660> is<00:03:19.930> they<00:03:20.049> give

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
bearing and what they do is they give

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.729 
bearing and what they do is they give
you<00:03:20.350> this<00:03:20.470> distance<00:03:20.709> here<00:03:22.109> now<00:03:23.109> I<00:03:23.380> don't<00:03:23.500> know

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
you this distance here now I don't know

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.830 
you this distance here now I don't know
why<00:03:24.220> they<00:03:24.579> would<00:03:24.760> but<00:03:24.970> it<00:03:25.150> happens<00:03:25.480> in<00:03:25.630> some

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
why they would but it happens in some

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.539 
why they would but it happens in some
examples<00:03:26.170> so<00:03:26.590> I'm<00:03:26.680> going<00:03:26.859> to<00:03:26.950> show<00:03:27.130> it<00:03:27.190> to<00:03:27.400> you

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
examples so I'm going to show it to you

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.390 
examples so I'm going to show it to you
so<00:03:28.450> basically<00:03:28.720> all<00:03:29.230> that<00:03:29.650> is<00:03:29.859> if<00:03:30.099> you<00:03:30.220> have<00:03:30.370> a

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
so basically all that is if you have a

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.559 
so basically all that is if you have a
look<00:03:30.519> at<00:03:30.639> that<00:03:30.730> if<00:03:30.849> we<00:03:30.940> take<00:03:31.090> that<00:03:31.269> little

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
look at that if we take that little

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.900 
look at that if we take that little
triangle<00:03:31.840> there<00:03:32.260> that's<00:03:33.130> just<00:03:33.250> a<00:03:33.489> smaller

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
triangle there that's just a smaller

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.199 
triangle there that's just a smaller
version<00:03:34.239> of<00:03:34.720> this<00:03:35.410> triangle<00:03:35.799> here<00:03:36.190> so<00:03:36.459> the

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
version of this triangle here so the

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.740 
version of this triangle here so the
same<00:03:37.450> formula<00:03:38.079> applies<00:03:38.650> so<00:03:39.190> if<00:03:39.340> we<00:03:39.459> go<00:03:39.609> down<00:03:39.750> 10

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
same formula applies so if we go down 10

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.990 
same formula applies so if we go down 10
30<00:03:41.290> times<00:03:42.660> 24<00:03:43.660> mil<00:03:44.430> now<00:03:45.430> she<00:03:45.489> gives<00:03:45.790> us

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
30 times 24 mil now she gives us

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.479 
30 times 24 mil now she gives us
thirteen<00:03:46.930> point<00:03:47.109> eight<00:03:47.169> six<00:03:47.470> so<00:03:47.680> let's<00:03:47.829> say<00:03:48.010> 14

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
thirteen point eight six so let's say 14

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.680 
thirteen point eight six so let's say 14
mil<00:03:49.230> 40<00:03:50.230> ml<00:03:50.500> height<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:51.669> door<00:03:51.849> distance<00:03:52.299> here

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
mil 40 ml height the door distance here

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.610 
mil 40 ml height the door distance here
14<00:03:53.380> mil<00:03:53.590> so<00:03:54.579> all<00:03:54.730> we<00:03:54.819> have<00:03:54.910> to<00:03:54.940> add<00:03:55.120> is<00:03:55.419> so<00:03:56.230> all

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
14 mil so all we have to add is so all

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.710 
14 mil so all we have to add is so all
we<00:03:56.799> have<00:03:56.919> to<00:03:57.040> do<00:03:57.220> is<00:03:57.459> add<00:03:57.959> 260<00:03:58.959> mil<00:03:59.139> and<00:03:59.489> 14<00:04:00.720> that

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
we have to do is add 260 mil and 14 that

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.650 
we have to do is add 260 mil and 14 that
gives<00:04:01.959> us<00:04:03.329> 274<00:04:04.329> mil<00:04:04.569> as<00:04:04.980> our<00:04:05.980> drop-off<00:04:06.730> in<00:04:07.060> this

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
gives us 274 mil as our drop-off in this

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.180 
gives us 274 mil as our drop-off in this
example<00:04:09.510> so<00:04:10.510> there<00:04:10.690> you<00:04:10.780> go<00:04:10.900> there's<00:04:11.169> how<00:04:12.130> we

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
example so there you go there's how we

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.819 
example so there you go there's how we
work<00:04:12.519> out<00:04:12.669> the<00:04:12.790> drop-off<00:04:13.170> for<00:04:14.170> both<00:04:14.349> the<00:04:14.560> truss

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
work out the drop-off for both the truss

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.849 
work out the drop-off for both the truss
and<00:04:15.219> a<00:04:16.090> eventually<00:04:16.870> cut<00:04:17.109> roof<00:04:17.349> with<00:04:17.590> a<00:04:17.620> bird's

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
and a eventually cut roof with a bird's

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.979 
and a eventually cut roof with a bird's
mouth
