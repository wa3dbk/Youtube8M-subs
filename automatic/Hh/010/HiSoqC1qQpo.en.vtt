in preparation for roasting I'm going to

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.889 
in preparation for roasting I'm going to
season<00:00:02.490> the<00:00:02.760> meat<00:00:02.909> with<00:00:03.120> a<00:00:03.149> little<00:00:03.240> salt<00:00:03.689> and

there<00:00:09.059> are<00:00:09.150> various<00:00:09.450> schools<00:00:09.719> of<00:00:09.929> thought<00:00:10.139> on

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
there are various schools of thought on

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.140 
there are various schools of thought on
when<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.620> salt<00:00:10.889> should<00:00:11.160> be<00:00:11.280> added<00:00:11.580> I've

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
when the salt should be added I've

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.030 
when the salt should be added I've
always<00:00:12.480> been<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.900> mind<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:13.860> should

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
always been of the mind that it should

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.700 
always been of the mind that it should
be<00:00:14.130> done<00:00:14.280> just<00:00:14.580> prior<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.969> cooking<00:00:15.500> not<00:00:16.500> too

be done just prior to cooking not too
early<00:00:17.039> as<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.310> does<00:00:17.660> draw<00:00:18.660> out<00:00:18.840> some<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.199> the

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
early as it does draw out some of the

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.080 
early as it does draw out some of the
blood<00:00:19.529> which<00:00:19.920> of<00:00:20.130> course<00:00:20.160> with<00:00:20.520> venison<00:00:20.939> is

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
blood which of course with venison is

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.720 
blood which of course with venison is
essential<00:00:21.680> to<00:00:22.680> keep<00:00:22.859> in<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.130> meat<00:00:23.310> because<00:00:23.699> it

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
essential to keep in the meat because it

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.490 
essential to keep in the meat because it
is<00:00:23.939> its<00:00:24.119> life's<00:00:24.359> blood<00:00:24.660> because<00:00:25.019> it's<00:00:25.170> so<00:00:25.320> low

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
is its life's blood because it's so low

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.179 
is its life's blood because it's so low
in<00:00:25.680> fat

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
in fat

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.339 
in fat
once<00:00:26.430> we've<00:00:26.609> seasoned<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.180> we're<00:00:28.050> just<00:00:28.199> going

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
once we've seasoned it we're just going

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.320 
once we've seasoned it we're just going
to<00:00:28.410> moisten<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.859> with<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.039> little<00:00:29.310> oil<00:00:29.519> very

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
to moisten it with a little oil very

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.930 
to moisten it with a little oil very
important<00:00:30.750> with<00:00:30.900> venison<00:00:31.740> because<00:00:32.130> there<00:00:32.820> is

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
important with venison because there is

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.280 
important with venison because there is
no<00:00:33.149> intramuscular<00:00:33.809> fat<00:00:35.570> the<00:00:36.570> meat<00:00:36.780> needs

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
no intramuscular fat the meat needs

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.229 
no intramuscular fat the meat needs
something<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.739> keep<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.129> moist<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:38.969> need<00:00:39.210> a

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
something to keep it moist so you need a

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.290 
something to keep it moist so you need a
little<00:00:39.420> bit<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.719> oil<00:00:39.899> just<00:00:40.739> on<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.040> outside<00:00:41.430> to

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
little bit of oil just on the outside to

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.270 
little bit of oil just on the outside to
keep<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.110> moist<00:00:43.260> while<00:00:43.680> you're<00:00:43.860> cooking<00:00:44.010> it

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
keep it moist while you're cooking it

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.770 
keep it moist while you're cooking it
because<00:00:44.489> there<00:00:44.610> will<00:00:44.670> no<00:00:44.820> there's<00:00:45.149> no<00:00:45.300> fat<00:00:45.600> to

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
because there will no there's no fat to

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.340 
because there will no there's no fat to
render<00:00:46.140> out<00:00:46.289> when<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.190> been<00:00:47.430> seared<00:00:48.140> so<00:00:49.140> just

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
render out when it's been seared so just

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.459 
render out when it's been seared so just
make<00:00:49.500> sure<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:49.829> well<00:00:50.039> coated<00:00:51.050> and<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.199> cook<00:00:52.350> a

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
make sure it's well coated and it cook a

them and pop that on a tray with a rack
on<00:02:01.440> it<00:02:01.470> so<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.890> meat<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.100> not<00:02:02.370> actually
