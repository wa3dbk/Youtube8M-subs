00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 and black sling and then we're good 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.160
 once again in a news of 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.660
 minecraft they said and good file 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.370
 we are talking at 0.11 and good 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.099
 first of all because my barn looks in 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.780
 the top-top-top-top says 0.11 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.120
 the grandfather one is already going out and I 'm not 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.010
 more no guys that they put it not 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.119
 he wants to be out there they have 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.680
 simply this version because 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.910
 presence is working on this 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.470
 have or do not have the exterior and above 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.189
 it means that I'm going to come out one 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.900
 he wants to go that he is not going to leave 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.070
 simply because that is the action 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.390
 because they are working on this version 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.619
 and then it may or may not come 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.890
 sign no crisis that is already coming out 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.750
 but good and to remove doubts if not 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.370
 we need it like that tomorrow we have to go past 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.500
 and that blablabla because it says there already 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.930
 that I do not know hand in this image we're going to 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.840
 get to start this thing that called me the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.539
 attention are blocks of rest that is not 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.070
 they have because tomÃ¡s opposed after that already 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.480
 I had added it but they added it 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.219
 they have use or they are simply 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.329
 decorative and all that roll now I know 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.649
 that many people know not to use for 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.180
 what is decorative is better to start 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.410
 to work in a network are in the mechanisms 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.300
 and all that we already have mechanisms and you 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.739
 development so good let me tell you 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.780
 they always add things first and then 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.370
 they add the operation or first 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.890
 they go from the simple to then go to the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.480
 complicated just remember the version 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.940
 0.5 like this and look now 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.380
 until 0.10 to see many 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.850
 differences that have advanced everything that 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.900
 have advanced minecraft edition only in 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.760
 your phone so be patient 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.290
 because many people a patient who 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.330
 they simply tell him that this and that 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.010
 the other as if it were easy is true 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.240
 this chaos but good is a job 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.100
 of them they know what season 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.909
 they all have their way of working like this 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.100
 that just need to wait 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.890
 we also see that they are checking the 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.799
 frames for saying raised to 58 to 60 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.799
 frames per second forgiveness at 60 58 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.259
 what is it I think what they are going to add a 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.909
 of the things in adding is this a 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.590
 frame meter per second 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.149
 so it will shrink how much it fragments in your 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.130
 phone as much as possible if we would have 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.439
 half you go to half of I'm in 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.850
 high-end so I'll go a little more 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.640
 quick of what I want to give to 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.170
 understand us 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.060
 I do not think there's the same 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.890
 speed in terms of devices more 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.500
 that nothing for him 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.390
 the characteristics of each and the 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.650
 great variety between each other 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.780
 memories are with very few 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.660
 characteristics are very few 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.820
 have 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.060
 very little strength to run this kind of 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.459
 games 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.080
 they are low-end because and in the range 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.660
 high obviously have many more things 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.330
 and they are more powerful in terms of this type 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.220
 of things so I think they vary and 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.640
 good guys for another other news out 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.319
 of this is to say it is only for the 0.11 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.730
 so we just need to wait for the will to 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.090
 when who knows one month two months three 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.560
 months a year for 2028 2045 who 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.660
 you know not so I just need to wait I do not know 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.480
 Do not eat your nails and they will eat it 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.220
 bojan and fart and other news remember 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.010
 Today is Friday Friday to recommend 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.750
 channels so as much as possible the most 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.030
 is likely that so far this day 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.560
 after watching this video on twitter to 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.180
 any time I put me videos 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.680
 here whether they want to recommend you 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.260
 yourselves or recommend to some 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.849
 friend can you put me the video that is most 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.709
 that they think that more funny is that 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.569
 I'm taking from people who have 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.970
 less than three thousand subscribers I think 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.830
 is the best and well then if you have three 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.090
 thousand subscribers or less or there are people 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.019
 they have three thousand subscribers week 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.099
 and you think that your content is 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.540
 too good to not have you 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.239
 so you have so many little trying 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.680
 few subscribers, sorry, they can 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.660
 recommend it and then there we will check 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.500
 see everything so they do not like anything 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.600
 the news see you in the next 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.829
 video and well you know the 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.780
 recommendations go up until night 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.340
 all day I'll be Chicano out there 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.790
 in this video do not put anything because everything 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.190
 I'm going to watch your videos or anything 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.400
 news and see you until next time 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.400
 bye
