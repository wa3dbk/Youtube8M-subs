Selective screening process okay
I'll<00:00:20.160> lop<00:00:20.460> down<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:21.439> really<00:00:22.439> don't<00:00:22.619> want<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.830> do

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
I'll lop down I really don't want to do

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.080 
I'll lop down I really don't want to do
the<00:00:23.010> scanner<00:00:23.279> can<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.550> just<00:00:23.730> get<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.880> body

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
the scanner can I just get a body

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:34.850 
the scanner can I just get a body
pat-down<00:00:25.849> just<00:00:26.849> walk<00:00:27.000> through<00:00:27.210> it

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.050 

wow<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.940> really<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.540> unpleasant<00:00:37.940> please<00:00:38.940> the

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.060 
wow this really is unpleasant please the

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.400 
wow this really is unpleasant please the
back<00:00:39.240> of<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.420> hence<00:00:39.630> less<00:00:39.780> sensitive<00:00:40.200> area

sir

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
sir

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.340 
sir
it<00:00:41.310> takes<00:00:41.550> longer<00:00:41.970> than<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.180> body<00:00:42.420> scan<00:00:42.870> but<00:00:43.260> our

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
it takes longer than a body scan but our

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.020 
it takes longer than a body scan but our
scans<00:00:43.710> really<00:00:44.100> safe<00:00:46.130> the<00:00:47.130> emissions<00:00:47.940> from

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
scans really safe the emissions from

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.510 
scans really safe the emissions from
that<00:00:48.180> technology<00:00:48.900> is<00:00:49.080> less<00:00:49.650> than<00:00:49.860> most<00:00:50.070> than

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
that technology is less than most than

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.460 
that technology is less than most than
anyone<00:00:50.970> would<00:00:51.120> get<00:00:51.330> from<00:00:51.540> just<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.840> basic<00:00:52.230> cell

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
anyone would get from just a basic cell

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.010 
anyone would get from just a basic cell
phone<00:00:52.710> conversation<00:00:53.030> would<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.239> technology

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
phone conversation would this technology

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.960 
phone conversation would this technology
have<00:00:55.230> caught<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.710> underwear<00:00:56.100> bomber<00:00:56.130> this

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
have caught the underwear bomber this

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.580 
have caught the underwear bomber this
technology<00:00:57.510> would<00:00:57.600> make<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.900> a<00:00:57.930> lot<00:00:58.110> easier<00:00:58.320> to

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
technology would make it a lot easier to

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:11.020 
technology would make it a lot easier to
find<00:00:58.950> what<00:00:59.100> he<00:00:59.129> was<00:00:59.340> hiding

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
TSA refused to show me the scans I

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.710 
TSA refused to show me the scans I
really<00:01:27.640> wanted<00:01:27.880> to<00:01:27.940> know<00:01:28.150> what<00:01:28.450> they<00:01:28.540> look

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
really wanted to know what they look

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.660 
really wanted to know what they look
like<00:01:28.780> you<00:01:29.530> can<00:01:29.680> see<00:01:29.860> the<00:01:30.010> body<00:01:30.220> of<00:01:30.430> a<00:01:30.520> person

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
like you can see the body of a person

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.580 
like you can see the body of a person
you<00:01:31.000> can<00:01:31.150> see<00:01:31.330> any<00:01:31.510> anomaly<00:01:32.020> on<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.230> person

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
you can see any anomaly on the person

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.920 
you can see any anomaly on the person
for<00:01:33.190> privacy<00:01:33.580> we've<00:01:33.910> blurred<00:01:34.270> out<00:01:34.510> the<00:01:34.720> face

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
for privacy we've blurred out the face

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.440 
for privacy we've blurred out the face
so<00:01:35.500> we<00:01:35.530> can't<00:01:35.860> even<00:01:36.040> tell<00:01:36.250> can't<00:01:37.000> associate

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
so we can't even tell can't associate

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.080 
so we can't even tell can't associate
the<00:01:37.630> person<00:01:37.990> with<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.650> image<00:01:38.950> early<00:01:39.550> TSA

the person with the image early TSA

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.880 
the person with the image early TSA
posted<00:01:40.540> an<00:01:40.630> image<00:01:40.750> of<00:01:40.990> a<00:01:41.050> woman<00:01:41.230> on<00:01:41.500> their<00:01:41.620> blog

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
posted an image of a woman on their blog

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.490 
posted an image of a woman on their blog
that<00:01:42.250> raised<00:01:42.520> grave<00:01:43.090> concerns<00:01:43.750> that<00:01:44.410> was

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
that raised grave concerns that was

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.160 
that raised grave concerns that was
taken<00:01:44.830> about<00:01:45.070> seven<00:01:45.700> years<00:01:45.850> ago<00:01:46.090> on<00:01:46.660> a<00:01:46.720> media

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
taken about seven years ago on a media

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.320 
taken about seven years ago on a media
tour<00:01:47.380> of<00:01:47.620> our<00:01:47.770> laboratory<00:01:48.370> in<00:01:48.520> New<00:01:48.550> Jersey<00:01:48.730> we

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
tour of our laboratory in New Jersey we

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.090 
tour of our laboratory in New Jersey we
recognized<00:01:49.960> that<00:01:50.170> picture<00:01:50.410> was<00:01:50.560> too<00:01:50.710> graphic

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
recognized that picture was too graphic

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.980 
recognized that picture was too graphic
so<00:01:51.550> we<00:01:51.700> essentially<00:01:52.060> did<00:01:52.330> is<00:01:52.450> we<00:01:52.600> dumbed<00:01:52.900> down

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
so we essentially did is we dumbed down

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.870 
so we essentially did is we dumbed down
the<00:01:53.320> image<00:01:53.620> so<00:01:54.070> now<00:01:54.220> it's<00:01:54.430> a<00:01:54.550> gingerbread

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
the image so now it's a gingerbread

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.330 
the image so now it's a gingerbread
shape<00:01:55.450> person<00:01:56.050> and<00:01:56.410> we<00:01:56.500> can<00:01:56.650> basically<00:01:56.830> see

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
shape person and we can basically see

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.730 
shape person and we can basically see
any<00:01:57.880> anomaly<00:01:58.479> on<00:01:58.600> a<00:01:58.630> person's<00:01:59.020> body<00:01:59.110> they<00:01:59.710> have

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
any anomaly on a person's body they have

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.710 
any anomaly on a person's body they have
something<00:02:00.070> hidden<00:02:00.310> on<00:02:00.550> their<00:02:00.700> leg<00:02:00.880> or<00:02:01.150> between

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
are reviewed in a separate room away

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.449
