absolutely have to organize your folders

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.200 
absolutely have to organize your folders
your<00:02:44.070> computer<00:02:44.460> can<00:02:44.610> keep<00:02:44.760> track<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.030> the

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
your computer can keep track of the

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.940 
your computer can keep track of the
files<00:02:45.420> wherever<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:45.900> place<00:02:46.110> them<00:02:46.380> but<00:02:46.830> the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
files wherever you place them but the

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.860 
files wherever you place them but the
question<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.340> whether<00:02:47.490> you<00:02:47.730> can<00:02:47.970> it's<00:02:48.780> not

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
question is whether you can it's not

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.240 
question is whether you can it's not
hard<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.200> do<00:02:49.320> when<00:02:49.500> they're<00:02:49.620> only<00:02:49.740> three<00:02:50.040> files

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
hard to do when they're only three files

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.530 
hard to do when they're only three files
to<00:02:50.430> organize<00:02:50.850> but<00:02:51.120> how<00:02:51.330> about<00:02:51.450> 300<00:02:52.140> or<00:02:52.490> 3,000

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
to organize but how about 300 or 3,000

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.880 
to organize but how about 300 or 3,000
really<00:02:54.540> I'd<00:02:54.690> say<00:02:54.720> organizing<00:02:55.380> your<00:02:55.440> files<00:02:55.620> is

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
really I'd say organizing your files is

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.470 
really I'd say organizing your files is
an<00:02:56.010> essential<00:02:56.490> skill<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:56.910> habit<00:02:57.240> to<00:02:57.330> get<00:02:57.420> into

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
an essential skill and habit to get into

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.690 
an essential skill and habit to get into
now<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.500> also<00:02:58.710> want<00:02:58.770> to<00:02:58.890> discuss<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.400> different
