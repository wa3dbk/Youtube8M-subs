 waterproof bags with three jack 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.820
 and a half as you can see we have 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.310
 color black transparent or blue 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.619
 inside we also have a comfortable band 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.900
 by arm that can be inserted here 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.640
 below that you can put it on your arm and 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.189
 meanwhile go for a run ed 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.110
 also listen to music 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.269
 moreover these clever wheels are 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.190
 obviously waterproof you can insert them 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:42.750
 in the water without any problem then you 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.120
 I will show the insertion and you can 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.920
 listen to how I used to say music 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.070
 obviously to listen to music in 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.340
 water you will need earphones 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.469
 suitable 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.110
 I know they sell it anyway, I think not 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.960
 there are problems finding them ok now vi 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.690
 let's see how it fits here is there 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.420
 our three and a half jack go to 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.979
 in this case insert it in ours 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.860
 nexus recommend it in here 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.750
 let's go down and get the cable like 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.420
 see here we have closures to say the least 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.509
 we are not going to open it this way 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.099
 we insert it ditto we do the same from 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.099
 this part you do 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.259
 here it is, let's go now to close 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.270
 we close on this side there is the verse 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.520
 as you see our terminal is 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.979
 inserted perfectly we have here of 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.220
 face the terminal now what we do 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.460
 we go to get and insert the 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.260
 our three and a half jack in here 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.860
 sorry because here anyway how can you 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.440
 see the touch answers we can 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.360
 quietly listen to music as 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.680
 you can go ahead we can affirm it 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.600
 we can do it again in this 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.940
 moment is going to the heart as low 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.280
 you don't hear I make sure anyway the 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.479
 volume at this time is in headphones 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:15.340
 as you can see they still have a fair amount 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:17.830
 let's say discreet feedback so you can 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.140
 also use it then obviously if not 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:24.730
 use the cable remains more adherent or 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.950
 if you move the se sides network a 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.320
 pochettino to say tight becomes a 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.690
 little bit more we say and adherent to 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.790
 phone and touch improves test well 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.410
 this is not the case I have to say serves for 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.930
 listen to the music succeeded 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.030
 quietly changing the song 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.030
 without any problem like 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.250
 you can see why I have to have their say 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.019
 let's say work do it now let's go to 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.760
 see the insertion in the water 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.930
 for the confirmation that they are true 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.910
 and really waterproof 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.730
 here we are, we can also leave 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.310
 inserted the gap above mica stuff there 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.989
 we must ensure that they are well closed 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.930
 in which you live there is the written pop cloche 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:06.939
 it's ok let's take ours 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:10.480
 but in there and we go to include it as 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:14.829
 you see absolutely no water comes in it 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.689
 we can leave inserted a little and indeed 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.239
 look has taken even the touch is 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:21.310
 strangely in theory it should not be seen 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.299
 that there is water anyway as you see the 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.219
 terminal continues to function 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.469
 quietly without any problem 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:28.750
 no water enters no water from the jack 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:31.540
 therefore he entered nowhere with 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.670
 you can use these waterproof bags 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.359
 quietly listening to the sea 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.280
 music 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:39.370
 I repeat if you have earphones that 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.689
 they are however suitable for water are 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.120
 waterproof you can also use it 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:44.980
 quietly in the water with this 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.629
 concluded greeting from loris alias batista70 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.629
