assumed in here to the 100% view we can

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.220 
assumed in here to the 100% view we can

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
see that the individual dabs of paint

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.520 
see that the individual dabs of paint
are<00:02:25.650> following<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.190> direction<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:27.530> the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
brushstroke now with the various

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.320 
brushstroke now with the various
settings<00:02:31.800> here<00:02:32.070> we<00:02:32.250> could<00:02:32.400> also<00:02:32.550> adjust<00:02:32.820> that

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
settings here we could also adjust that

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.630 
settings here we could also adjust that
currently<00:02:33.960> I<00:02:34.050> have<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.320> dab<00:02:34.530> length<00:02:34.800> set<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.370> 6

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
currently I have a dab length set to 6

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.910 
currently I have a dab length set to 6
if<00:02:36.360> for<00:02:36.630> an<00:02:36.720> extreme<00:02:37.080> case<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.530> set<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:37.890> to

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
if for an extreme case I set it to

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.310 
if for an extreme case I set it to
something<00:02:38.610> quite<00:02:38.820> a<00:02:38.910> bit<00:02:39.090> higher<00:02:39.270> we<00:02:40.140> could

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
something quite a bit higher we could

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.130 
something quite a bit higher we could
see<00:02:40.500> now<00:02:40.680> we<00:02:41.340> can<00:02:41.460> get<00:02:41.580> some<00:02:41.850> wild<00:02:42.140> wild

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
see now we can get some wild wild

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.470 
see now we can get some wild wild
effects<00:02:44.510> as<00:02:45.510> well<00:02:46.500> as<00:02:46.760> our<00:02:47.760> standard<00:02:48.150> effects

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480

effects as well as our standard effects
that<00:02:48.810> we<00:02:48.960> may<00:02:49.140> want<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.440> get<00:02:50.060> so<00:02:51.060> I'm<00:02:51.150> going<00:02:51.270> to

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
that we may want to get so I'm going to

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.420 
that we may want to get so I'm going to
clear<00:02:53.520> that<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:54.000> go<00:02:54.420> back<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:55.430> more

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
clear that and go back to more

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.970 
clear that and go back to more
reasonable<00:02:56.970> dab<00:02:57.570> length<00:02:57.870> for<00:02:58.110> this<00:02:58.290> image

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
reasonable dab length for this image

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.280 
reasonable dab length for this image
also<00:02:59.850> keep<00:03:00.120> in<00:03:00.240> mind<00:03:00.270> when<00:03:00.720> you're<00:03:00.840> working<00:03:00.870> on

also keep in mind when you're working on
cloners<00:03:02.130> if<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:02.459> press<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.880> T<00:03:03.120> key<00:03:03.410> on<00:03:04.410> the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
so I'm going to zoom back in just use

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.270 
so I'm going to zoom back in just use
the<00:03:41.220> toggle<00:03:42.030> here<00:03:42.239> for<00:03:42.769> one<00:03:43.769> to<00:03:43.890> one<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:47.190> you

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
the toggle here for one to one and you

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.690 
the toggle here for one to one and you
can<00:03:47.400> see<00:03:47.550> that's<00:03:47.730> pretty<00:03:48.330> much<00:03:49.459> what<00:03:50.459> you<00:03:50.580> need

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
can see that's pretty much what you need

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.810 
can see that's pretty much what you need
to<00:03:50.820> know<00:03:50.970> to<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:52.230> use<00:03:52.410> this<00:03:52.590> cloner<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.670> can

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
to know to to use this cloner you can

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.070 
to know to to use this cloner you can
then<00:03:54.120> go<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.510> complete<00:03:55.280> this<00:03:56.280> image<00:03:57.080> also

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
then go and complete this image also

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.290 
then go and complete this image also
it's<00:03:58.380> one<00:03:59.130> of<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.280> handy<00:03:59.610> things<00:03:59.790> to<00:03:59.940> do<00:04:00.090> with

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
it's one of the handy things to do with

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.810 
it's one of the handy things to do with
with<00:04:00.660> cloners<00:04:01.080> is<00:04:01.350> when<00:04:02.130> you're<00:04:02.250> done<00:04:02.400> is<00:04:02.670> you

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
with cloners is when you're done is you

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.640 
with cloners is when you're done is you
could<00:04:02.970> also<00:04:03.120> use<00:04:03.390> filters<00:04:03.840> on<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.200> resulting

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
could also use filters on the resulting

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.240 
could also use filters on the resulting
image<00:04:04.890> in<00:04:05.070> this<00:04:05.190> case<00:04:05.430> I'm<00:04:06.060> gonna<00:04:06.180> go<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.450> photo

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
image in this case I'm gonna go to photo

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.539 
image in this case I'm gonna go to photo
photo<00:04:08.250> detailer<00:04:09.440> let's<00:04:10.440> think<00:04:11.280> I'm<00:04:11.400> gonna

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
photo detailer let's think I'm gonna

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.270 
photo detailer let's think I'm gonna
want<00:04:11.820> to<00:04:11.880> increase<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.390> edge<00:04:12.510> detail<00:04:12.989> up

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
want to increase the edge detail up

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.780 
want to increase the edge detail up
maybe<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.580> saturation<00:04:15.239> down<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:16.790> increase

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
maybe the saturation down and increase

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.349 
maybe the saturation down and increase
the<00:04:17.970> contrast<00:04:18.830> in<00:04:19.830> a<00:04:19.950> preview<00:04:20.370> so<00:04:21.060> you<00:04:21.150> can<00:04:21.239> see

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
the contrast in a preview so you can see

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.860 
the contrast in a preview so you can see
now<00:04:21.570> we<00:04:22.560> took<00:04:22.710> our<00:04:22.890> basic<00:04:23.220> clone<00:04:23.400> around<00:04:23.870> we

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
now we took our basic clone around we

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.100 
now we took our basic clone around we
enhanced<00:04:25.410> the

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
enhanced the

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.920 
enhanced the
the<00:04:26.349> dams<00:04:26.620> quite<00:04:26.919> a<00:04:26.949> bit<00:04:27.159> with<00:04:27.819> probably<00:04:28.720> to<00:04:28.840> an

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
the dams quite a bit with probably to an

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.860 
the dams quite a bit with probably to an
extreme<00:04:29.319> but<00:04:30.039> you<00:04:30.069> get<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.490> idea<00:04:30.550> of<00:04:31.060> some<00:04:31.780> of

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
extreme but you get the idea of some of

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.350 
extreme but you get the idea of some of
the<00:04:31.960> things<00:04:32.139> you<00:04:32.319> can<00:04:32.439> do<00:04:32.970> I'm<00:04:33.970> gonna<00:04:34.060> clear

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
the things you can do I'm gonna clear
