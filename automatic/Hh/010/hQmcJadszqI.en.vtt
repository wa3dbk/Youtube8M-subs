00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.580
 the ak 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.580
 becomes 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.870
 his 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.670
 Here above, the water is seeping away 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.800
 through the ceramic filter through as very 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.930
 fine pores so no bacteria 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.239
 no dust particles no rust through 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.189
 that comes as bacteria-free water 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.929
 then go into the carbon filter of the coal 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.260
 error wood all toxins out so 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:36.879
 like heavy metals medication or anti 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.309
 baby pills or what you can do today in the water 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.470
 Residues can probably find the 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.290
 Carbon filter out everything except the 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.050
 dissolved minerals the coal is in 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.719
 edit granulate without water pressure 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.250
 means the coal instead of just poured 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.140
 not maintained because normal kohleblocks 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.059
 consist of 30 percent adhesive 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.559
 we wanted to do without that means that is 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.379
 We have no glue whatsoever 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.210
 coal and it was so secure you like that 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.129
 Slowly through that the coal is not around 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.839
 is selected and thereby the error 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.399
 properties completely has the 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.100
 next layer through a hard 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.020
 history that is there to nitrate that 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.770
 only mineral of which he too much 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.160
 have water 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.780
 then to reduce the wire 50 above 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.179
 continue through the bio ceramics 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.970
 These wise balls give me traces of 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:23.709
 magnesium as someone's water off 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.539
 are also branded effective 

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:26.410
 Microorganisms separate the water 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.349
 revive something 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.060
 then the next shift goes where the 

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:33.220
 black corners are and whose 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.380
 different rock types in it 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.450
 zeolite stone zeolite is also important 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.190
 for the structure of the water can also 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.860
 has traces of g2 for close-ups too 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.319
 a very very fine pore size and 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.720
 These magnets are outside 10 6 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.550
 piece the zeolite stones down here 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.739
 lie and also the last two 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.720
 materials together and also in matt 

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:54.190
 in harnisch still a magnet that belongs 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.009
 all together that is called the 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.440
 technology means translated in german 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.599
 as much as to live back between 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.709
 Japan as well as here feng shui but 

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:04.330
 it will probably be a two 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:05.349
 It will take decades for it to be in Germany 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.810
 is completely known 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:09.819
 but all these materials together 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.280
 act on the water enter 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.230
 energy field which is back on the 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.120
 frequency brought by the body cell 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.560
 We will just try the quality 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.790
 to imitate mountain streams again 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.560
 seventh yet mountains steel it has 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.209
 another electric charge than that 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.710
 zeolite stones are also important for 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.630
 the water structuring 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.360
 because water always adapts to the 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.070
 electrical charges of life and 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.620
 materials where isr flows over and 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.990
 praise s2 by printing device or 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.150
 that loses all the information then 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.280
 here comes out of the tap you can do it 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.280
 tap and drink
