of<00:00:22.939> grass<00:00:23.240> pieces<00:00:23.810> and<00:00:24.110> clearly<00:00:24.680> that<00:00:24.919> is<00:00:25.160> not

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
of grass pieces and clearly that is not

gonna<00:00:25.460> cover<00:00:25.669> this<00:00:26.000> or<00:00:26.390> that<00:00:26.660> so<00:00:27.559> I'm<00:00:27.829> probably

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
gonna cover this or that so I'm probably

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.220 
gonna cover this or that so I'm probably
gonna<00:00:28.250> have<00:00:28.399> to<00:00:28.489> ask<00:00:28.550> my<00:00:28.970> friend<00:00:29.599> Sean<00:00:29.899> if<00:00:30.110> I

because obviously I'm gonna take all
this<00:00:43.969> down<00:00:44.179> I'm<00:00:44.510> glad<00:00:44.780> I<00:00:44.809> did<00:00:45.199> do<00:00:45.350> this<00:00:45.469> so<00:00:45.679> that

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
this down I'm glad I did do this so that

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.239 
this down I'm glad I did do this so that
I<00:00:46.039> know<00:00:46.129> how<00:00:47.089> much<00:00:47.179> I<00:00:47.329> have<00:00:47.480> foot<00:00:47.780> um<00:00:47.899> yes<00:00:48.530> so<00:00:48.559> we

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:49.249 
I know how much I have foot um yes so we

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:50.950 
I know how much I have foot um yes so we
going<00:00:49.399> true<00:00:49.670> what<00:00:49.820> I've<00:00:49.909> done<00:00:50.120> I'm<00:00:50.329> added<00:00:50.749> in

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
going true what I've done I'm added in

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.430 
going true what I've done I'm added in
AAT<00:00:51.409> because<00:00:52.359> obviously<00:00:53.359> the<00:00:53.629> grass<00:00:53.870> problems

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
AAT because obviously the grass problems

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.899 
AAT because obviously the grass problems
and<00:00:54.620> I<00:00:54.679> think<00:00:54.710> it<00:00:54.980> does<00:00:55.159> look<00:00:55.190> pretty<00:00:55.399> good<00:00:55.789> it

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:55.909 
and I think it does look pretty good it

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:58.149 
and I think it does look pretty good it
helps<00:00:56.059> it<00:00:56.749> helps<00:00:56.929> this<00:00:57.379> side<00:00:57.649> of<00:00:57.829> the<00:00:57.949> mont

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
helps it helps this side of the mont

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.549 
helps it helps this side of the mont
could<00:00:58.339> be<00:00:58.460> filled<00:00:58.789> because<00:00:59.420> otherwise<00:01:00.230> that

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
could be filled because otherwise that

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:01.779 
could be filled because otherwise that
would<00:01:00.739> be<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:01.010> only<00:01:01.129> thing<00:01:01.339> on<00:01:01.429> this<00:01:01.550> side<00:01:01.729> of

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
would be the only thing on this side of

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:02.950 
would be the only thing on this side of
the<00:01:01.940> mark<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:02.300> that<00:01:02.390> would<00:01:02.479> be<00:01:02.569> like<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:02.839> only

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
the mark and that would be like the only

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.140 
the mark and that would be like the only
ship<00:01:03.260> they<00:01:03.440> had<00:01:03.559> so<00:01:04.339> I<00:01:04.370> think<00:01:04.670> that<00:01:04.879> looks

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
ship they had so I think that looks

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.830 
ship they had so I think that looks
really<00:01:05.360> good

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
really good

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.110 
really good
and<00:01:06.140> I<00:01:06.200> think<00:01:06.409> we're<00:01:06.500> go<00:01:06.560> ahead<00:01:06.860> and<00:01:07.010> bring<00:01:07.940> in

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
and I think we're go ahead and bring in

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.860 
and I think we're go ahead and bring in
we're<00:01:08.540> gonna<00:01:08.659> use<00:01:08.840> this<00:01:09.110> I<00:01:10.570> don't<00:01:11.570> know<00:01:11.690> if<00:01:11.780> I'm

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
we're gonna use this I don't know if I'm

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.319 
we're gonna use this I don't know if I'm
gonna<00:01:11.960> use<00:01:12.140> it<00:01:12.320> like<00:01:13.040> here<00:01:13.490> or<00:01:13.909> on<00:01:14.090> this<00:01:14.270> side

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.329 
gonna use it like here or on this side

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:17.020 
gonna use it like here or on this side
but<00:01:14.960> it'll<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:15.560> speeder<00:01:15.829> will<00:01:16.070> be<00:01:16.219> there<00:01:16.430> you

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
but it'll the speeder will be there you

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.490 
but it'll the speeder will be there you
know<00:01:17.119> what<00:01:17.329> pretty<00:01:17.659> cool<00:01:18.020> to<00:01:18.140> probably<00:01:18.380> go

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
know what pretty cool to probably go

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.740 
know what pretty cool to probably go
next<00:01:18.740> 80<00:01:19.280> or<00:01:19.399> something<00:01:19.579> but<00:01:19.969> it'll<00:01:20.450> look<00:01:20.540> cool

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
next 80 or something but it'll look cool

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.219 
next 80 or something but it'll look cool
nonetheless<00:01:20.930> and<00:01:21.590> then<00:01:22.579> I<00:01:23.090> wish<00:01:23.840> I<00:01:23.960> had<00:01:24.079> my

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
nonetheless and then I wish I had my

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.139 
nonetheless and then I wish I had my
brown<00:01:24.530> one<00:01:24.829> that<00:01:25.100> will<00:01:25.219> probably<00:01:25.610> going<00:01:26.090> to

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
brown one that will probably going to

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.510 
brown one that will probably going to
use<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.420> grey<00:01:26.630> one<00:01:26.810> if<00:01:26.930> I<00:01:27.020> use<00:01:27.200> one<00:01:27.229> at<00:01:27.560> all<00:01:27.740> but

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
use the grey one if I use one at all but

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.609 
use the grey one if I use one at all but
I<00:01:28.610> will<00:01:28.759> be<00:01:28.880> using<00:01:29.110> possibly<00:01:30.110> a<00:01:30.170> sweated<00:01:30.500> rug

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
I will be using possibly a sweated rug

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.660 
I will be using possibly a sweated rug
but<00:01:30.770> it<00:01:30.860> looks<00:01:31.009> kind<00:01:31.189> of<00:01:31.310> big<00:01:32.439> so<00:01:33.439> I<00:01:33.469> might<00:01:34.250> not

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
but it looks kind of big so I might not

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.380 
but it looks kind of big so I might not
use<00:01:34.939> that<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:35.600> we'll<00:01:35.899> see<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:37.820> other<00:01:37.850> thing<00:01:38.149> I

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
use that so we'll see the other thing I

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.550 
use that so we'll see the other thing I
want<00:01:38.570> to<00:01:38.630> show<00:01:38.840> you<00:01:39.409> is

want to show you is
a<00:01:41.759> laboring<00:01:42.759> type<00:01:43.030> of<00:01:43.180> stuff<00:01:43.360> that<00:01:43.570> I've<00:01:43.659> done

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
a laboring type of stuff that I've done

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.410 
a laboring type of stuff that I've done
I've<00:01:44.049> added<00:01:44.439> like<00:01:44.770> I<00:01:44.890> found<00:01:45.130> these<00:01:45.310> and<00:01:45.729> they

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
it's a little bit difficult in camera

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.590 
it's a little bit difficult in camera

because I understand that just gray and

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.449 
because I understand that just gray and
green<00:02:11.319> that<00:02:11.560> they<00:02:11.650> don't<00:02:11.830> look<00:02:11.920> good<00:02:12.099> so<00:02:12.400> I

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
green that they don't look good so I

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.539 
green that they don't look good so I

this<00:02:16.860> advancing<00:02:17.860> towards<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.400> little<00:02:18.700> like<00:02:19.209> the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
this advancing towards a little like the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.960 
this advancing towards a little like the
hills<00:02:20.049> go<00:02:20.260> like<00:02:20.470> this<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:21.040> highest<00:02:21.280> point<00:02:21.790> I

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
hills go like this the highest point I

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.150 
hills go like this the highest point I
think<00:02:22.030> is<00:02:22.360> three<00:02:22.660> high<00:02:22.840> they<00:02:23.739> don't<00:02:23.920> go<00:02:24.040> over

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160
