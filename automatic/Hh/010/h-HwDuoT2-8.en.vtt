00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.820 
herstyler I got about three or four
years<00:00:18.570> ago<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:19.020> would<00:00:19.140> kind<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.470> straighten<00:00:19.740> my

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
years ago it would kind of straighten my

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.560 
years ago it would kind of straighten my
hair<00:00:20.039> but<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.310> would<00:00:20.400> leave<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.699> like<00:00:20.880> poufy

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
hair but it would leave it like poufy

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.939 
hair but it would leave it like poufy
and<00:00:22.039> that<00:00:23.039> was<00:00:23.189> just<00:00:23.430> sad<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.990> only<00:00:25.289> has<00:00:25.500> an

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
and that was just sad and it only has an

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.950 
and that was just sad and it only has an
on<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.279> off<00:00:26.369> switch<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.090> can't<00:00:27.390> like<00:00:27.660> set

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
on and off switch and you can't like set

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.320 
on and off switch and you can't like set
the<00:00:28.080> temperature<00:00:28.400> it<00:00:29.400> just<00:00:29.640> never<00:00:29.760> got<00:00:30.000> very

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330

the temperature it just never got very
hot<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.500> was<00:00:31.650> like<00:00:31.769> two<00:00:31.800> hundred<00:00:32.070> dollars

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579

i<00:00:32.730> think<00:00:32.940> my<00:00:33.090> mom<00:00:33.270> said<00:00:33.570> because<00:00:34.260> she<00:00:34.469> was<00:00:34.559> one

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
i think my mom said because she was one

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.709 
i think my mom said because she was one
who<00:00:34.800> got<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.100> for<00:00:35.250> me<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.910> also<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.540> is

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
who got it for me so and also this is

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.069 
who got it for me so and also this is
super<00:00:36.989> heavy<00:00:37.489> compared<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.480> cruise<00:00:39.750> crown

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
super heavy compared to the cruise crown

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.950 
super heavy compared to the cruise crown
this<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.410> like<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.950> lightness<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.579> like<00:00:41.960> you

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
this is like so lightness is like you

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.930 
this is like so lightness is like you
guys<00:00:43.079> could<00:00:43.320> like<00:00:43.680> hold<00:00:43.950> them<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.460> can<00:00:44.670> see

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
code so i will have the code right here

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.639 
code so i will have the code right here
and<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.789> below<00:00:57.120> bar<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.600> with<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.350> code

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
you want to put it on a higher setting

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.530 
you want to put it on a higher setting
if<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.159> more<00:01:29.340> thin<00:01:29.670> hair<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.270> want<00:01:30.420> to

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
put it on the lower so the temperature

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.649 
put it on the lower so the temperature
goes<00:01:32.880> from<00:01:33.530> 240<00:01:34.530> degrees<00:01:34.860> all<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.220> way<00:01:35.400> up<00:01:35.520> to

goes from 240 degrees all the way up to

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.649 
goes from 240 degrees all the way up to
430<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.020> i<00:01:37.920> usually<00:01:38.430> put<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.880> for<00:01:39.299> my<00:01:39.420> hair

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
430 and i usually put it in for my hair

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.140 
430 and i usually put it in for my hair
I<00:01:39.689> usually<00:01:40.020> put<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.380> between<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.979> 340<00:01:41.820> and

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
I usually put it in between like 340 and

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.660 
I usually put it in between like 340 and
380<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.200> could<00:01:43.409> probably<00:01:43.470> put<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.250> lower

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
380 I could probably put it on a lower

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.550 
380 I could probably put it on a lower
setting<00:01:45.000> but<00:01:45.390> that's<00:01:45.899> just<00:01:46.110> what<00:01:46.320> i<00:01:46.350> use

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
setting but that's just what i use

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.310 
setting but that's just what i use
usually<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.329> then<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.720> on<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.170> off<00:01:49.259> switch

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
usually and then the on and off switch

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.069 
usually and then the on and off switch
is<00:01:49.680> right<00:01:49.710> here<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.360> just<00:01:51.360> switch<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.840> on
