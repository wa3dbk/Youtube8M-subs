I<00:00:52.720> thought<00:00:53.720> it<00:00:53.840> was<00:00:53.900> solid<00:00:54.320> I<00:00:54.590> thought<00:00:54.800> under

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
I thought it was solid I thought under

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.470

football team defensively field position

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.480 
football team defensively field position
the<00:00:59.000> first<00:00:59.210> half<00:00:59.420> was<00:00:59.630> tough<00:00:59.870> you<00:01:00.740> know<00:01:00.860> it<00:01:01.100> had

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.490 
the first half was tough you know it had

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.040 
the first half was tough you know it had
the<00:01:01.610> wind<00:01:01.820> especially<00:01:02.210> in<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:02.570> first<00:01:02.780> quarter

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
the wind especially in the first quarter

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.510 
the wind especially in the first quarter
we<00:01:03.290> were<00:01:03.380> backed<00:01:03.620> up<00:01:03.770> a<00:01:03.920> lot<00:01:04.100> I<00:01:04.280> mean<00:01:04.430> he's

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:04.520 
we were backed up a lot I mean he's

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.530

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.650 

well<00:01:27.920> I<00:01:28.130> know<00:01:28.790> I<00:01:28.820> thought<00:01:29.240> we<00:01:29.360> would<00:01:29.510> play

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
well I know I thought we would play

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.890 
well I know I thought we would play
better<00:01:30.050> than<00:01:30.140> we<00:01:30.410> would<00:01:30.620> did<00:01:31.390> in<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.510> last<00:01:32.630> two

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
better than we would did in the last two

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.940 
better than we would did in the last two
ballgames<00:01:33.580> but<00:01:34.580> again<00:01:35.480> we've<00:01:36.380> got<00:01:36.590> to<00:01:36.740> come<00:01:36.920> up

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
ballgames but again we've got to come up

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.570 
ballgames but again we've got to come up
with<00:01:37.100> some<00:01:37.400> ways<00:01:38.150> to<00:01:38.180> stop<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.750> run<00:01:39.080> game

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
with some ways to stop the run game

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.650 
with some ways to stop the run game
better<00:01:40.580> than<00:01:40.760> we're<00:01:40.910> doing<00:01:40.940> at<00:01:41.240> this<00:01:41.360> point

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
better than we're doing at this point

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.060 
better than we're doing at this point
and<00:01:41.810> that's<00:01:42.050> been<00:01:42.260> disappointing<00:01:42.860> because<00:01:42.950> I

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
and that's been disappointing because I

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.780 
and that's been disappointing because I
did<00:01:43.310> they<00:01:43.460> think<00:01:43.520> we<00:01:43.910> would<00:01:45.250> play<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.280> Front's

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
did they think we would play the Front's

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.670 
did they think we would play the Front's
better<00:01:47.000> but<00:01:47.270> when<00:01:47.510> tackled<00:01:48.020> well<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:48.440> when

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
better but when tackled well and when

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.660 
better but when tackled well and when
we've<00:01:48.830> gotten<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.160> ball<00:01:49.280> on<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.520> perimeter

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
we've gotten the ball on the perimeter

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.390 
we've gotten the ball on the perimeter
in<00:01:50.000> some<00:01:50.180> spots<00:01:50.560> so<00:01:51.560> again<00:01:51.860> it's<00:01:52.130> just<00:01:52.250> a

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
in some spots so again it's just a

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:00.050 
in some spots so again it's just a
collective<00:01:52.940> effort<00:01:53.090> just<00:01:53.420> not<00:01:53.660> one<00:01:53.900> area

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.389

blocks<00:02:37.890> up<00:02:38.129> front<00:02:38.430> not<00:02:39.030> necessarily<00:02:39.450> on<00:02:39.689> all

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
blocks up front not necessarily on all

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.869 
blocks up front not necessarily on all
in<00:02:40.079> one<00:02:40.290> play<00:02:40.530> but<00:02:40.799> just<00:02:40.950> not<00:02:41.099> playing<00:02:41.549> it<00:02:41.700> well

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
in one play but just not playing it well

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.460 
in one play but just not playing it well
enough<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.390> then<00:02:42.510> we<00:02:42.599> get<00:02:42.720> wore<00:02:42.959> down<00:02:43.170> as<00:02:43.349> the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
enough and then we get wore down as the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.830 
enough and then we get wore down as the
game<00:02:43.650> goes<00:02:43.860> along<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:44.400> it's<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.150> combination<00:02:45.360> of

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
game goes along so it's a combination of

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.750 
game goes along so it's a combination of
things<00:02:46.079> and<00:02:46.379> we<00:02:46.739> just<00:02:46.950> got<00:02:47.069> to<00:02:47.159> do<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.280> much

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
things and we just got to do a much

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.550 
things and we just got to do a much
better<00:02:47.790> job<00:02:48.120> especially<00:02:48.599> early<00:02:48.959> in<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.379> game

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
better job especially early in the game

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.780 
better job especially early in the game
of<00:02:49.590> playing<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.129> parks<00:02:50.790> up<00:02:50.939> front
