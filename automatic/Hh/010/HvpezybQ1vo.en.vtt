the<00:01:24.310> main<00:01:24.460> advantage<00:01:24.610> with<00:01:25.450> these<00:01:25.600> lenses<00:01:26.100> is

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
the main advantage with these lenses is

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.840 
the main advantage with these lenses is
that<00:01:27.790> we<00:01:28.659> have<00:01:28.900> a<00:01:29.140> much<00:01:29.860> better<00:01:30.280> build<00:01:30.759> quality

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
that we have a much better build quality

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.590 
that we have a much better build quality
a<00:01:31.890> superior<00:01:32.890> optical<00:01:33.400> performance<00:01:33.540> not<00:01:34.540> only

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
a superior optical performance not only

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.969 
a superior optical performance not only
showing<00:01:35.170> that<00:01:35.619> the<00:01:36.240> lenses<00:01:37.240> are<00:01:37.979> incredibly

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
showing that the lenses are incredibly

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.880 
showing that the lenses are incredibly
sharp<00:01:39.220> all<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:40.330> way<00:01:40.390> across<00:01:40.509> the<00:01:40.810> frame<00:01:41.020> but

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
sharp all the way across the frame but

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.460 
sharp all the way across the frame but
also<00:01:42.070> in<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.580> out-of-focus<00:01:43.180> areas<00:01:43.600> what<00:01:44.350> we

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
also in the out-of-focus areas what we

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.609 
also in the out-of-focus areas what we
tend<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:44.799> find<00:01:45.070> is<00:01:45.400> that<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:46.600> as<00:01:46.750> focus<00:01:47.259> areas

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
tend to find is that the as focus areas

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.980 
tend to find is that the as focus areas
remain<00:01:47.829> nice<00:01:48.189> and<00:01:48.250> smooth<00:01:48.970> it<00:01:49.329> gives<00:01:49.810> us<00:01:49.930> very

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
remain nice and smooth it gives us very

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.030 
remain nice and smooth it gives us very
natural<00:01:50.710> bucker<00:01:51.189> and<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:53.079> often<00:01:53.619> gives<00:01:53.799> us<00:01:53.920> a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
natural bucker and and often gives us a

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.700 
natural bucker and and often gives us a
far<00:01:54.250> less<00:01:54.460> noisy<00:01:54.850> appearance<00:01:55.600> because<00:01:55.840> the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
far less noisy appearance because the

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.280 
far less noisy appearance because the

each other in the out-of-focus areas
most<00:02:01.960> people<00:02:02.409> say<00:02:02.680> that<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.189> Zeiss<00:02:03.640> coatings

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
most people say that the Zeiss coatings

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.039 
most people say that the Zeiss coatings
give<00:02:04.630> them<00:02:04.899> very<00:02:05.439> three-dimensional<00:02:05.860> effect

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
give them very three-dimensional effect

construction with these lenses we

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.399 
construction with these lenses we
effectively<00:02:30.890> sacrifice<00:02:31.790> auto<00:02:32.180> focus<00:02:32.810> for<00:02:33.379> a

very nice butter like manual focus feel

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.690 
very nice butter like manual focus feel
this<00:02:37.940> gives<00:02:38.239> us<00:02:38.390> very<00:02:38.420> wide<00:02:38.930> rotation<00:02:39.769> of<00:02:39.980> the

this gives us very wide rotation of the
