button and move my cursor timeline to 6

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.720 
button and move my cursor timeline to 6
second<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:01.190> increase<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:03.480> offset<00:04:03.750> by<00:04:04.730> 100

second and increase the offset by 100

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:15.990 
second and increase the offset by 100
percent<00:04:08.270> so<00:04:09.270> let<00:04:09.930> me<00:04:10.140> try<00:04:10.410> this

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.230 

so<00:04:17.000> this<00:04:17.209> is<00:04:17.359> our<00:04:18.010> first<00:04:19.010> project<00:04:19.370> and<00:04:20.739> this<00:04:21.739> is

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
so this is our first project and this is

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.860 
so this is our first project and this is
beautifully<00:04:23.240> animated<00:04:23.810> by<00:04:24.820> capacity<00:04:26.230> option

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
beautifully animated by capacity option

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.200 
beautifully animated by capacity option
