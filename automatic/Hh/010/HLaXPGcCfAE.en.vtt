was<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.360> really<00:01:45.720> lovely<00:01:46.079> conclusion<00:01:46.799> i<00:01:46.979> think

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
was a really lovely conclusion i think

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.660 
was a really lovely conclusion i think
it<00:01:47.759> was<00:01:48.140> slower<00:01:49.140> than<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.619> other<00:01:49.740> two<00:01:49.860> i<00:01:50.070> think

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
it was slower than the other two i think

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.190 
it was slower than the other two i think
and<00:01:50.880> i<00:01:50.909> know<00:01:50.970> that's<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.390> huge<00:01:51.570> criticism<00:01:52.079> of

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
and i know that's a huge criticism of

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.539 
and i know that's a huge criticism of
the<00:01:52.229> first<00:01:52.500> two<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:52.979> they're<00:01:53.130> too<00:01:53.310> slow

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
the first two is that they're too slow

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.410 
the first two is that they're too slow
and<00:01:53.579> then<00:01:53.759> people<00:01:54.000> don't<00:01:54.149> like<00:01:54.270> them<00:01:54.390> very

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
and then people don't like them very

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.870 
and then people don't like them very
much<00:01:54.630> but<00:01:55.020> i<00:01:55.170> really<00:01:55.500> like<00:01:55.710> them<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.189> i<00:01:56.610> think

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
much but i really like them and i think

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.940 
much but i really like them and i think
this<00:01:57.030> was<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> wonderful<00:01:58.229> conclusion<00:01:58.710> I'll

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
this was a wonderful conclusion I'll

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.069 
this was a wonderful conclusion I'll
bait<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> bit<00:01:59.820> slow<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.450> definitely<00:02:00.659> think<00:02:00.990> that

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
bait a bit slow I definitely think that

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.749 
bait a bit slow I definitely think that
it<00:02:01.259> need<00:02:01.380> more<00:02:01.409> Gabriel<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.100> feel<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.610> love

it need more Gabriel I feel so in love

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.399 
it need more Gabriel I feel so in love

with the character over the last book

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.859 
with the character over the last book
especially<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:05.159> know<00:02:05.490> upset<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.060> he<00:02:06.240> barely

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
that they do have a connection and that

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.000

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
Vaughn to allow him to test on him

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.229 
Vaughn to allow him to test on him
because<00:02:26.530> von<00:02:26.950> always<00:02:27.400> wanted<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.819> send<00:02:27.999> Rhine

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
because von always wanted to send Rhine

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.030 
because von always wanted to send Rhine
she<00:02:28.930> found<00:02:29.290> out<00:02:29.409> that<00:02:29.469> she<00:02:29.620> had<00:02:29.739> a<00:02:29.829> twin

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
she found out that she had a twin

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.059 
she found out that she had a twin
brother<00:02:30.069> etc<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.900> he<00:02:32.349> seems<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.709> really<00:02:32.739> like

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
brother etc and he seems to really like

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.530 
brother etc and he seems to really like
Vaughn<00:02:33.370> but<00:02:33.639> that<00:02:33.790> one<00:02:33.879> something<00:02:34.150> happens<00:02:34.420> to

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
Vaughn but that one something happens to

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.750 
Vaughn but that one something happens to
Vaughn<00:02:34.739> it's<00:02:35.739> just<00:02:35.980> kind<00:02:36.129> of<00:02:36.159> left<00:02:36.400> that<00:02:36.609> way

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
Vaughn it's just kind of left that way

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.920 
Vaughn it's just kind of left that way
and<00:02:36.909> I<00:02:36.969> think<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.209> would<00:02:37.359> have<00:02:37.450> enjoyed<00:02:37.599> more

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
and I think I would have enjoyed more

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.170 
and I think I would have enjoyed more
background<00:02:38.409> on<00:02:38.799> that<00:02:39.099> also<00:02:39.669> would<00:02:39.819> have<00:02:39.879> liked

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
background on that also would have liked

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.729 
background on that also would have liked
more<00:02:40.359> on<00:02:40.510> her<00:02:40.629> parents<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:41.319> find<00:02:41.560> out

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
more on her parents you find out

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.259 
more on her parents you find out
something<00:02:42.310> pretty<00:02:42.489> big<00:02:42.760> about<00:02:42.999> her<00:02:43.120> parents

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
something pretty big about her parents

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.099 
something pretty big about her parents
and<00:02:44.069> it<00:02:45.069> left<00:02:45.489> me<00:02:45.639> feeling<00:02:45.849> really<00:02:46.239> with<00:02:47.079> a

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
and it left me feeling really with a

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:48.449 
and it left me feeling really with a
really<00:02:47.349> bad<00:02:47.500> taste<00:02:47.739> in<00:02:47.829> my<00:02:47.950> mouth<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.250> I<00:02:48.310> like

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
really bad taste in my mouth and I like

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.679 
really bad taste in my mouth and I like
to<00:02:48.579> know<00:02:48.639> more<00:02:48.819> about<00:02:48.879> that<00:02:49.150> so<00:02:49.359> those<00:02:49.510> are<00:02:49.599> my

about the series is that it's really not

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.179

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.929 
that but it never felt like a love story
I<00:03:11.379> think<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:11.709> lot<00:03:11.739> of<00:03:11.889> why<00:03:12.129> I<00:03:12.159> can<00:03:12.549> fall<00:03:12.730> into

I think a lot of why I can fall into

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:14.929 
I think a lot of why I can fall into
that<00:03:13.060> trap<00:03:13.120> of<00:03:13.510> just<00:03:13.689> end<00:03:13.840> up<00:03:13.959> feeling<00:03:14.199> like

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:14.939
