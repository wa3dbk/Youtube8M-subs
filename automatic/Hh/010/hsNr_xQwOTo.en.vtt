00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.420
 there is the highly anticipated barbie xanax this is 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.830
 a hall of barbie xanax tastes 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.929
 first thing I bought then 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.500
 these what these cases would be 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:17.010
 they would be chip cookies 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.279
 I don't know the taste of red beans here 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.990
 there are marked just so to give 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.090
 a clear idea of what is there 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.640
 here are red bean flavored biscuits 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.949
 no there are pencils where they were 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.679
 stacks and if anyone knew what 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.730
 it means all this stuff for me goes 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.600
 the Hon 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.640
 even the orion site did not expire 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.950
 I will not die at least because they have expired 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.700
 according to us , this is practically there 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.950
 a whale as you can see and believe 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.079
 that they are fries has the taste of 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.600
 seaweed because there are wings that 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.879
 draw where here also draw 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.520
 so I assume it's palatine taste 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.579
 anga bought simply for the sent 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.390
 and for packaging with whales a 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.119
 ugly thing designed of this 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.700
 which I think is a turtle a 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.340
 lifesaver a very swag starfish 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.439
 and i think it will be a seaweed soap not 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.509
 it says there is written only cookies e 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.580
 then there is not true in a Chinese thing that 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.890
 I cannot understand this either 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.250
 of the fantastic brand orion that a 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:28.530
 these packaging can talk about a 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:31.439
 bit so look ok if I see it on 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.079
 shape of this cookie other food 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.180
 bought the few a little they would do I hate 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.850
 what are the Italians' names like? 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.829
 end of the year a mikado heck this is it 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.540
 it is strawberry, there was also vanilla 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.759
 and white chocolate had no more 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.579
 pay for the idea that they are sticks 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.399
 very cool that on the sites the super fan of 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.649

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.780
 one euro and twenty there is also a guy type 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.840
 a little plump that runs almost like that 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.240
 I hate that we do this super zoom at 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.070

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.990
 ran we arrived at the new version 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.509

 one guilty than me 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.670

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.980
 Chinese chao but what the hell of taste and 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.610

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.870
