human cry for inflation but we can have
dried<00:04:48.430> powder<00:04:48.790> we<00:04:49.180> have<00:04:49.330> it<00:04:49.420> over<00:04:49.630> typically

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
dried powder we have it over typically

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.000 
dried powder we have it over typically
and<00:04:50.470> we<00:04:51.310> can<00:04:51.460> have<00:04:51.550> various<00:04:52.440> food<00:04:53.440> products

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
and we can have various food products

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.210 
and we can have various food products
which<00:04:54.370> are<00:04:55.290> substitute<00:04:56.290> to<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:56.650> fresh

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
which are substitute to the fresh

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.430 
which are substitute to the fresh
produce<00:04:57.630> because<00:04:58.630> the<00:04:58.780> technology<00:04:58.990> is<00:04:59.290> so

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
produce because the technology is so

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.400 
produce because the technology is so
advanced<00:04:59.830> and<00:05:00.720> they<00:05:01.720> can<00:05:01.900> be<00:05:01.930> available

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
advanced and they can be available

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.980 
advanced and they can be available
throughout<00:05:02.680> the<00:05:02.890> year<00:05:03.100> at<00:05:03.310> the<00:05:03.340> best<00:05:03.640> prices

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
throughout the year at the best prices

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.600 
throughout the year at the best prices
so<00:05:04.990> I<00:05:05.020> think<00:05:05.140> that<00:05:05.440> we<00:05:05.680> can<00:05:05.860> the<00:05:06.370> food

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
so I think that we can the food

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.760 
so I think that we can the food
processing<00:05:07.060> this<00:05:07.390> is<00:05:07.570> very<00:05:07.930> very<00:05:08.020> important

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
processing this is very very important

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.300 
processing this is very very important
with<00:05:09.490> the<00:05:09.610> government<00:05:10.090> should<00:05:10.330> recognize

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
with the government should recognize

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.430 
with the government should recognize
because<00:05:12.310> we<00:05:12.550> do<00:05:12.700> the<00:05:12.850> best<00:05:13.060> service<00:05:13.570> for<00:05:13.810> the

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
because we do the best service for the

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.620 
because we do the best service for the
government<00:05:14.980> for<00:05:15.280> the<00:05:15.460> inflation<00:05:16.000> or<00:05:16.450> the

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
government for the inflation or the

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.590 
government for the inflation or the
employment<00:05:17.260> and<00:05:18.060> surely<00:05:19.060> for<00:05:19.240> the<00:05:19.330> export

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
employment and surely for the export

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.750 
employment and surely for the export
also<00:05:20.050> i<00:05:20.290> would<00:05:20.770> say<00:05:20.919> the<00:05:21.040> government<00:05:21.220> should
