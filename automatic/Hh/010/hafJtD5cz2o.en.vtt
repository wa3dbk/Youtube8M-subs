here now first off they're using toshiba
19<00:01:13.029> nanometer<00:01:13.119> um<00:01:13.630> a<00:01:13.810> NAND<00:01:14.109> flash<00:01:14.200> the

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
19 nanometer um a NAND flash the

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.870 
19 nanometer um a NAND flash the
controller<00:01:15.520> is<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.759> Marvel<00:01:16.090> 88<00:01:16.630> ss9<00:01:17.880> 187

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
interesting because this is I think the

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.529 
interesting because this is I think the
first<00:01:23.920> one<00:01:24.099> that<00:01:24.609> we've<00:01:24.759> tested<00:01:24.969> that<00:01:25.209> has

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
first one that we've tested that has

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:26.910 
first one that we've tested that has
this<00:01:25.689> Marvel<00:01:26.079> controller<00:01:26.439> because<00:01:26.619> you<00:01:26.799> know

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
this Marvel controller because you know

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.769 
this Marvel controller because you know
most<00:01:27.039> things<00:01:27.189> are<00:01:27.429> sandforce<00:01:27.939> or<00:01:28.270> you<00:01:28.689> know

00:01:28.769 --> 00:01:28.779 
most things are sandforce or you know

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:29.940 
most things are sandforce or you know
where<00:01:28.899> the<00:01:28.990> other<00:01:29.020> Samsung's<00:01:29.619> got<00:01:29.770> its<00:01:29.889> own

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
where the other Samsung's got its own

where the other Samsung's got its own
controller<00:01:30.369> now<00:01:30.549> and<00:01:30.849> we've<00:01:31.179> done<00:01:31.419> a<00:01:31.479> lot<00:01:31.749> of

00:01:31.769 --> 00:01:31.779 
controller now and we've done a lot of

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:33.809 
controller now and we've done a lot of
sand<00:01:32.079> for<00:01:32.289> stuff<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:32.799> this<00:01:33.490> one<00:01:33.639> differ

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
few ways this controller of its status

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.559 
few ways this controller of its status
3.1<00:01:37.840> got<00:01:38.200> on<00:01:38.289> ship<00:01:38.529> raid<00:01:38.740> of<00:01:38.919> course<00:01:39.539> ddr3<00:01:40.539> and

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
3.1 got on ship raid of course ddr3 and

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:43.589 
3.1 got on ship raid of course ddr3 and
it<00:01:41.289> can<00:01:41.469> have<00:01:41.770> up<00:01:41.950> to<00:01:41.979> one<00:01:42.459> gigabyte<00:01:42.909> of<00:01:43.119> ddr3

00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:43.599 
it can have up to one gigabyte of ddr3

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:46.379 
it can have up to one gigabyte of ddr3
but<00:01:43.899> this<00:01:44.020> one<00:01:44.139> has<00:01:44.259> 512<00:01:44.919> megabytes<00:01:45.310> if<00:01:46.239> you

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:46.389 
but this one has 512 megabytes if you

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:49.949 
but this one has 512 megabytes if you
get<00:01:46.539> like<00:01:46.689> the<00:01:46.840> 512<00:01:47.560> gigabyte<00:01:48.429> version<00:01:48.959> 768

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:49.959 
get like the 512 gigabyte version 768

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:52.370 
get like the 512 gigabyte version 768
megabytes<00:01:50.380> how<00:01:51.249> about<00:01:51.429> that<00:01:51.639> right<00:01:51.939> on<00:01:52.060> board

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
megabytes how about that right on board

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.729 
megabytes how about that right on board
and<00:01:53.399> they<00:01:54.399> advertise<00:01:54.819> around<00:01:55.749> 500<00:01:56.349> megabytes

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:56.739 
and they advertise around 500 megabytes

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:58.620 
and they advertise around 500 megabytes

random<00:02:03.009> read/write<00:02:03.429> speeds<00:02:03.700> it's<00:02:04.359> also<00:02:04.479> what

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
random read/write speeds it's also what

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.269 
random read/write speeds it's also what
they<00:02:04.809> say<00:02:05.020> so<00:02:05.799> we're<00:02:05.919> going<00:02:06.009> to<00:02:06.099> put<00:02:06.159> this

00:02:06.269 --> 00:02:06.279 
they say so we're going to put this

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:07.529 
they say so we're going to put this
thing<00:02:06.459> through<00:02:06.579> the<00:02:06.700> tests<00:02:07.029> and<00:02:07.179> see<00:02:07.359> if<00:02:07.450> it

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
thing through the tests and see if it

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.250 
thing through the tests and see if it
really<00:02:07.630> does<00:02:07.920> 500<00:02:08.920> or<00:02:09.459> not<00:02:09.700> and<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:11.019> one<00:02:11.140> thing

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
really does 500 or not and the one thing

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.780 
really does 500 or not and the one thing
that<00:02:11.500> I<00:02:11.650> find<00:02:11.860> really<00:02:11.980> impressive<00:02:12.549> I<00:02:12.640> mean

the right up to 441 and 442 will rounded
up<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.880> reed<00:02:37.210> was<00:02:37.650> 521<00:02:38.650> so<00:02:39.370> it's<00:02:39.520> not<00:02:39.610> the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
up and the reed was 521 so it's not the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.670 
up and the reed was 521 so it's not the
fastest<00:02:40.270> drive<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.570> we've<00:02:40.660> ever<00:02:40.810> tested<00:02:41.350> but

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
fastest drive that we've ever tested but

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.620 
fastest drive that we've ever tested but
it's<00:02:41.830> it's<00:02:42.340> up<00:02:42.550> there<00:02:42.730> its<00:02:43.150> nearing<00:02:43.390> the

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
it's it's up there its nearing the

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.810 
it's it's up there its nearing the
theoretical<00:02:44.140> limit<00:02:44.410> of<00:02:44.560> SATA<00:02:44.770> 3<00:02:45.070> yeah<00:02:45.640> we've

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
theoretical limit of SATA 3 yeah we've

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.250 
theoretical limit of SATA 3 yeah we've
tested<00:02:46.000> some<00:02:46.330> that<00:02:46.510> had<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.720> right<00:02:46.959> there

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
tested some that had the right there

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.170 
tested some that had the right there
were<00:02:47.350> you<00:02:47.740> know<00:02:47.770> above<00:02:48.130> 500<00:02:48.370> as<00:02:48.730> well<00:02:48.910> so<00:02:49.060> it's

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
were you know above 500 as well so it's

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.240 
were you know above 500 as well so it's
not<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:49.360> fastest<00:02:50.020> but<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.709> reed<00:02:50.890> is<00:02:51.070> very

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
not the fastest but the reed is very

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.199 
not the fastest but the reed is very
fast<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:53.260> I<00:02:53.290> ops<00:02:53.590> again<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.640> randoms<00:02:55.090> are

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
fast and the I ops again the randoms are

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.820 
fast and the I ops again the randoms are
going<00:02:55.330> to<00:02:55.390> be<00:02:55.480> really<00:02:55.720> nice<00:02:55.900> on<00:02:56.080> this<00:02:56.290> overall

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
going to be really nice on this overall

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.130 
going to be really nice on this overall
it<00:02:57.010> actually<00:02:57.280> held<00:02:57.430> up<00:02:57.520> pretty<00:02:57.670> well<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.900> most

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
it actually held up pretty well the most

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.930 
it actually held up pretty well the most
strenuous<00:02:59.620> thing<00:02:59.860> we<00:03:00.130> did<00:03:00.280> with<00:03:00.400> it<00:03:00.459> was<00:03:00.670> fill

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
strenuous thing we did with it was fill

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.670 
strenuous thing we did with it was fill
it<00:03:01.090> with<00:03:01.209> a<00:03:01.239> whole<00:03:01.360> bunch<00:03:01.540> of<00:03:01.630> data<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.110> then

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
it with a whole bunch of data and then

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.160 
it with a whole bunch of data and then
see<00:03:03.010> how<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.190> right<00:03:03.400> performance<00:03:03.880> was<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:04.450> it

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
see how the right performance was and it

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.440 
see how the right performance was and it
really<00:03:05.739> we<00:03:06.459> thought<00:03:06.850> it<00:03:06.910> was<00:03:07.030> a<00:03:07.060> problem<00:03:07.270> with

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
really we thought it was a problem with

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.750 
really we thought it was a problem with
the<00:03:07.570> testing<00:03:08.040> or<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.070> problem<00:03:09.280> with<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.520> drive

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
the testing or a problem with the drive

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.680 
the testing or a problem with the drive
or<00:03:09.940> something<00:03:10.209> because<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:10.540> right

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
or something because the right

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.000 
or something because the right
performance<00:03:11.050> wasn't<00:03:11.260> very<00:03:11.470> good<00:03:11.560> but<00:03:11.709> then<00:03:11.920> we

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
performance wasn't very good but then we

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.590 
performance wasn't very good but then we
discovered<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.550> trim<00:03:12.850> had<00:03:13.120> somehow<00:03:13.330> gotten

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
discovered the trim had somehow gotten

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.449 
discovered the trim had somehow gotten
turned<00:03:13.930> off<00:03:14.170> so<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:14.770> one<00:03:14.920> doesn't<00:03:15.190> have<00:03:15.250> its

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
know it requires trim you have to have

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.880 
know it requires trim you have to have
trim<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:20.019> if<00:03:20.110> you<00:03:20.200> don't<00:03:20.350> know<00:03:20.410> what<00:03:20.500> trim<00:03:20.709> is

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
trim and if you don't know what trim is

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.259 
trim and if you don't know what trim is
do<00:03:21.250> we<00:03:21.340> do<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.459> video<00:03:21.640> showing<00:03:21.910> people<00:03:22.150> how<00:03:22.239> to

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
do we do a video showing people how to

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.490 
do we do a video showing people how to
turn<00:03:22.450> tremont<00:03:22.780> I<00:03:22.840> think<00:03:23.019> we<00:03:23.110> did<00:03:23.230> it's<00:03:23.350> one<00:03:23.440> of

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
turn tremont I think we did it's one of

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.380 
turn tremont I think we did it's one of
the<00:03:23.590> macs<00:03:23.709> hacks<00:03:23.980> videos<00:03:24.280> we<00:03:24.489> doing<00:03:24.820> so<00:03:25.299> i'll

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
the macs hacks videos we doing so i'll

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.430 
the macs hacks videos we doing so i'll
put<00:03:25.510> a<00:03:25.540> link<00:03:25.570> to<00:03:25.750> that<00:03:25.810> on<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:26.080> screen<00:03:26.200> it's<00:03:26.380> an

put a link to that on the screen it's an

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.410 
put a link to that on the screen it's an
old<00:03:26.560> mac<00:03:26.709> sax<00:03:26.980> video<00:03:27.100> but<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:27.489> talks<00:03:27.610> about<00:03:27.760> how

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
old mac sax video but it talks about how

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.759 
old mac sax video but it talks about how
to<00:03:28.480> enable<00:03:28.690> trim<00:03:29.049> on<00:03:29.200> your<00:03:29.320> system<00:03:29.530> you<00:03:29.650> can

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
to enable trim on your system you can

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.770 
to enable trim on your system you can
you<00:03:30.130> know<00:03:30.220> enable<00:03:30.549> that<00:03:30.640> and<00:03:30.700> then<00:03:30.940> get<00:03:31.090> more

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
you know enable that and then get more

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.449 
you know enable that and then get more
speed<00:03:32.140> out<00:03:32.200> of<00:03:32.410> your<00:03:32.590> drive<00:03:32.860> but<00:03:33.130> this<00:03:33.280> one

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
speed out of your drive but this one

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:34.770 
speed out of your drive but this one
does<00:03:33.640> not<00:03:33.790> do<00:03:34.150> some<00:03:34.330> of<00:03:34.420> that<00:03:34.450> stuff<00:03:34.660> but

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
does not do some of that stuff but

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.880 
does not do some of that stuff but
that's<00:03:34.870> this<00:03:35.110> is<00:03:35.170> something<00:03:35.290> more<00:03:35.680> like<00:03:35.769> you

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
that's this is something more like you

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.770 
that's this is something more like you
would<00:03:36.010> see<00:03:36.130> in<00:03:36.160> an<00:03:36.549> enterprise<00:03:37.000> level<00:03:37.420> drive

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
would see in an enterprise level drive

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.690 
would see in an enterprise level drive
when<00:03:38.140> evening<00:03:38.440> you<00:03:38.530> see<00:03:38.709> unlike<00:03:38.799> a<00:03:38.980> we

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
when evening you see unlike a we

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.330 
when evening you see unlike a we
literally<00:03:40.000> enabled<00:03:40.570> trim<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.170> about<00:03:42.100> an<00:03:42.190> hour

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
literally enabled trim and about an hour

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.979 
literally enabled trim and about an hour
and<00:03:42.580> then<00:03:42.610> we<00:03:42.760> left<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.090> computer<00:03:43.360> alone<00:03:43.780> for

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
and then we left the computer alone for

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.090 
and then we left the computer alone for
about<00:03:44.049> an<00:03:44.200> hour<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:44.620> when<00:03:44.799> we<00:03:44.890> came<00:03:45.040> back

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
about an hour and when we came back

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.100 
about an hour and when we came back
after<00:03:45.580> an<00:03:45.670> hour<00:03:45.820> the<00:03:46.450> right<00:03:46.690> speed<00:03:46.989> was

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
after an hour the right speed was

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.410 
after an hour the right speed was
already<00:03:47.380> back<00:03:47.500> to<00:03:47.650> normal<00:03:47.980> without<00:03:48.910> having

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
already back to normal without having

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.940 
already back to normal without having
run<00:03:49.570> the<00:03:49.690> trim<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.140> right<00:03:50.290> speed<00:03:50.590> was<00:03:50.739> only

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
run the trim the right speed was only

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.680 
run the trim the right speed was only
about<00:03:51.160> 50<00:03:51.549> megabytes<00:03:51.940> per<00:03:52.150> second<00:03:52.450> because<00:03:52.540> it

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
about 50 megabytes per second because it

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.380 
about 50 megabytes per second because it
was<00:03:52.780> having<00:03:53.049> the<00:03:53.110> clear<00:03:53.410> space<00:03:53.799> as<00:03:54.209> we<00:03:55.209> were

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
was having the clear space as we were

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.509 
was having the clear space as we were
riding<00:03:55.600> which<00:03:55.930> was<00:03:56.110> you<00:03:56.230> know<00:03:56.260> glacial<00:03:57.010> but

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
riding which was you know glacial but

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:58.920 
riding which was you know glacial but
once<00:03:57.670> we<00:03:57.790> got<00:03:57.880> the<00:03:57.970> trim<00:03:58.180> issue<00:03:58.390> worked<00:03:58.690> out<00:03:58.810> it

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
once we got the trim issue worked out it

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.710 
once we got the trim issue worked out it
was<00:03:59.019> fine<00:03:59.230> some<00:03:59.769> drives<00:04:00.040> do<00:04:00.610> crazy<00:04:00.970> stuff<00:04:01.480> on

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
was fine some drives do crazy stuff on

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.420 
was fine some drives do crazy stuff on
their<00:04:01.900> controller<00:04:02.350> to<00:04:02.769> try<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:02.980> do<00:04:03.100> garbage

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
their controller to try to do garbage

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.949 
their controller to try to do garbage
collection<00:04:03.790> in<00:04:03.880> the<00:04:03.940> background<00:04:04.299> but<00:04:04.390> I<00:04:04.510> think

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
collection in the background but I think

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.300 
collection in the background but I think
it's<00:04:05.080> actually<00:04:05.230> a<00:04:05.440> feature<00:04:05.709> of<00:04:05.950> this<00:04:06.040> drive

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
it's actually a feature of this drive

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.000 
it's actually a feature of this drive
that<00:04:06.640> it's<00:04:06.880> honoring<00:04:07.600> the<00:04:07.750> trim<00:04:08.110> setting<00:04:08.890> in

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
that it's honoring the trim setting in

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.039 
that it's honoring the trim setting in
the<00:04:09.070> operating<00:04:09.489> system<00:04:09.820> it<00:04:10.330> depending<00:04:10.900> on<00:04:10.989> the

drive is one of the features that they

drive is one of the features that they
tap<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.540> it's<00:04:31.720> one<00:04:31.870> of<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.020> core<00:04:32.260> features<00:04:32.710> of

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
the Marvel controller so we're going to

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.840 
the Marvel controller so we're going to
be<00:04:35.710> using<00:04:35.740> this<00:04:36.040> thing<00:04:36.100> and<00:04:36.370> a<00:04:36.640> few<00:04:36.760> different

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
be using this thing and a few different

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.030

and<00:05:10.750> slim<00:05:10.990> Oh<00:05:11.200> another<00:05:11.770> thing<00:05:11.890> is<00:05:12.220> that<00:05:12.250> this

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
and slim Oh another thing is that this

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.520 
and slim Oh another thing is that this
thing's<00:05:12.760> got<00:05:12.820> certified<00:05:13.500> aes-256<00:05:14.500> encryption

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
thing's got certified aes-256 encryption

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.220 
thing's got certified aes-256 encryption
I<00:05:15.430> need<00:05:16.090> to<00:05:16.150> put<00:05:16.300> that<00:05:16.330> through<00:05:16.660> the<00:05:16.780> paces<00:05:16.930> and

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
I need to put that through the paces and

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.110 
I need to put that through the paces and
we<00:05:17.320> have<00:05:17.470> not<00:05:17.590> done<00:05:17.800> that<00:05:17.860> because<00:05:18.610> the

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
we have not done that because the

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.440 
we have not done that because the
sandforce<00:05:19.630> controller<00:05:20.460> had<00:05:21.460> some<00:05:21.730> problems

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
sandforce controller had some problems

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.120 
sandforce controller had some problems
with<00:05:22.630> AES<00:05:23.230> it's<00:05:23.530> aes-256<00:05:24.220> encryption<00:05:25.110> and

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
with AES it's aes-256 encryption and

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.040 
with AES it's aes-256 encryption and
hardware<00:05:27.130> version<00:05:27.310> not<00:05:27.610> too<00:05:27.760> long<00:05:27.940> ago<00:05:28.000> and<00:05:28.480> so

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
hardware version not too long ago and so

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.560 
hardware version not too long ago and so
that<00:05:29.200> we<00:05:29.260> sort<00:05:29.470> of<00:05:29.560> tripped<00:05:29.740> over<00:05:29.890> those<00:05:30.190> bugs

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
that we sort of tripped over those bugs

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.720 
that we sort of tripped over those bugs
but<00:05:31.570> this<00:05:32.140> thing<00:05:32.320> supposedly<00:05:32.830> is<00:05:33.010> aes-256

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 
but this thing supposedly is aes-256

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.150 
but this thing supposedly is aes-256
certified<00:05:34.450> which<00:05:34.840> is<00:05:35.020> very<00:05:35.410> high<00:05:35.620> security

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
certified which is very high security

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.530 
certified which is very high security
and<00:05:36.340> so<00:05:36.550> we<00:05:36.640> need<00:05:36.760> to<00:05:36.850> test<00:05:37.030> that<00:05:37.210> make<00:05:37.419> sure

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
and so we need to test that make sure

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.880 
and so we need to test that make sure

with<00:05:55.300> a<00:05:55.330> five-year<00:05:55.690> warranty<00:05:55.900> I<00:05:56.350> mean<00:05:57.130> if<00:05:57.250> the

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
with a five-year warranty I mean if the

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:58.830 
with a five-year warranty I mean if the
drives<00:05:57.669> were<00:05:57.850> dying<00:05:58.060> in<00:05:58.210> four<00:05:58.450> years<00:05:58.600> they

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
drives were dying in four years they

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.710 
drives were dying in four years they
would<00:05:58.990> be<00:05:59.380> out<00:05:59.500> a<00:05:59.530> lot<00:05:59.770> of<00:05:59.890> money<00:05:59.919> so<00:06:00.370> I<00:06:00.720> would

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
would be out a lot of money so I would

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.570 
would be out a lot of money so I would
expect<00:06:01.810> it<00:06:02.050> to<00:06:02.140> last<00:06:02.260> at<00:06:02.530> least<00:06:02.590> five<00:06:03.190> years<00:06:03.220> if

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
expect it to last at least five years if

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.010 
expect it to last at least five years if
not<00:06:03.610> more<00:06:03.940> probably<00:06:04.450> more<00:06:04.540> on<00:06:04.630> that<00:06:04.690> depending

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
not more probably more on that depending

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.110 
not more probably more on that depending
on<00:06:05.140> you<00:06:05.530> know<00:06:05.560> how<00:06:06.160> you<00:06:06.520> use<00:06:06.850> it<00:06:06.880> if<00:06:07.030> you're

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
on you know how you use it if you're

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.830 
on you know how you use it if you're
rewriting<00:06:07.419> it<00:06:07.660> every<00:06:07.840> day<00:06:07.870> entirely<00:06:09.419> maybe<00:06:10.419> I

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
rewriting it every day entirely maybe I

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.090 
rewriting it every day entirely maybe I
wasn't<00:06:11.200> pretty<00:06:11.380> impressed<00:06:11.770> with<00:06:11.950> how

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
wasn't pretty impressed with how

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.220 
wasn't pretty impressed with how
consists<00:06:12.610> of<00:06:12.730> the<00:06:12.880> performance<00:06:13.480> was<00:06:13.600> after<00:06:14.110> we

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.230 
consists of the performance was after we

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.890 
consists of the performance was after we
abused<00:06:14.620> it<00:06:14.740> because<00:06:15.010> usually<00:06:15.610> with<00:06:15.910> SSDs<00:06:16.419> you

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
abused it because usually with SSDs you

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.300 
abused it because usually with SSDs you
know<00:06:17.020> you<00:06:17.080> get<00:06:17.290> it<00:06:17.350> out<00:06:17.440> of<00:06:17.500> the<00:06:17.620> box<00:06:17.800> and<00:06:18.040> it's

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
know you get it out of the box and it's

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.650 
know you get it out of the box and it's
a<00:06:18.370> fresh<00:06:18.640> and<00:06:18.790> it's<00:06:18.880> really<00:06:19.150> fast<00:06:19.390> and<00:06:19.600> then

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 
a fresh and it's really fast and then

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.940 
a fresh and it's really fast and then
after<00:06:19.960> you<00:06:20.080> use<00:06:20.320> it<00:06:20.350> a<00:06:20.470> little<00:06:20.590> bit<00:06:20.770> it's<00:06:20.919> still

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:20.950 
after you use it a little bit it's still

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.560 
after you use it a little bit it's still
fast<00:06:21.250> but<00:06:21.520> it's<00:06:21.640> not<00:06:21.730> quite<00:06:21.970> as<00:06:22.150> fast<00:06:22.419> but

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
fast but it's not quite as fast but

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.390 
fast but it's not quite as fast but

things being happy abuser this thing was

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.220 
things being happy abuser this thing was
consistent<00:06:24.940> well<00:06:25.240> I<00:06:25.270> read<00:06:25.510> that<00:06:25.660> the<00:06:25.840> Marvel

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:26.230 
consistent well I read that the Marvel

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.110 
consistent well I read that the Marvel
controllers<00:06:26.770> that<00:06:26.800> this<00:06:27.040> thing<00:06:27.190> uses<00:06:27.520> doesn't

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 
controllers that this thing uses doesn't

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.700 
controllers that this thing uses doesn't
actually<00:06:28.240> use<00:06:28.510> compression<00:06:28.990> and<00:06:29.320> the<00:06:29.530> same

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
actually use compression and the same

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.290 
actually use compression and the same
force<00:06:29.950> one<00:06:30.160> uses<00:06:30.520> compression<00:06:31.030> and<00:06:31.180> so

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
force one uses compression and so

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.880 
force one uses compression and so
sometimes<00:06:31.570> on<00:06:31.960> some<00:06:32.140> more<00:06:32.290> clothes<00:06:32.530> the<00:06:32.710> same

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:32.890 
sometimes on some more clothes the same

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.680 
sometimes on some more clothes the same
force<00:06:33.130> is<00:06:33.310> faster<00:06:33.730> and<00:06:33.820> solar<00:06:34.120> this<00:06:34.450> one<00:06:34.600> is

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690 
force is faster and solar this one is

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.960 
force is faster and solar this one is
