00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:32.860 
and processor that's a good question i

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.220 
and processor that's a good question i
think<00:06:32.950> it's<00:06:33.220> a<00:06:33.370> dual<00:06:33.820> dual<00:06:34.180> cores<00:06:34.420> or<00:06:34.870> and

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.230 
think it's a dual dual cores or and

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.950 
think it's a dual dual cores or and
it'll<00:06:35.410> be<00:06:35.470> on<00:06:35.590> the<00:06:35.620> spec<00:06:35.890> sheet<00:06:36.810> brilliant<00:06:37.810> all

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
it'll be on the spec sheet brilliant all

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.390 
it'll be on the spec sheet brilliant all
looks<00:06:38.170> good<00:06:38.260> and<00:06:38.590> i<00:06:38.680> actually<00:06:39.010> like<00:06:39.160> to<00:06:39.280> design

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
looks good and i actually like to design

looks good and i actually like to design
it<00:06:39.790> feels<00:06:40.030> nice<00:06:40.240> like<00:06:40.870> when<00:06:41.110> I<00:06:41.140> held<00:06:41.410> it

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530 
it feels nice like when I held it

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.400 
it feels nice like when I held it
earlier<00:06:41.830> right<00:06:42.250> um<00:06:42.660> yeah<00:06:43.660> and<00:06:43.870> if<00:06:43.930> you<00:06:44.050> you
