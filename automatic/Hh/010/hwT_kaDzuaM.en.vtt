00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:15.879
 It made me sexy, it made me 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:19.440
 I had it 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.440
 I got sexy 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.439
 I already did this more or less like that girls 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.290
 It does not need much blur because it's 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.500
 a fantasy carnival makeup and 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.680
 I will occupy this white mix of all the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.800
 eyelid 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.100
 and we are going to put a lot on top and 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.100
 down below 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.260
 and we are going to blur everything perfectly 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.890
 and since I have blurred well I will 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:55.559
 use this blue color 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.559
 and in the part of in this area 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.280
 and we will fill in the times they are 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.340
 needed so I grabbed a blue tone 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.020
 as I have this color so I'm going to 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:17.159
 be occupying a planet brazil 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.409
 and I'm going to occupy that green tone here 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.799
 at the top and we're going to 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.799
 Apply 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:30.900
 well blurred, not so much because 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.900
 Well, as I already told you 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.910
 with a brush and brush I will 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.320
 grab the same blue tone and I'll 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.690
 distribute in this part below 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.490
 very carefully 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.490
 and let's make a line 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.260
 likewise we will make a line towards 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.320
 inward very carefully 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.660
 so that we stay the same in this 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.490
 part of here as well and part of 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.490
 up we'll make another one down 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.650
 we will take this yellow tone and what 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.650
 we will apply in the part above 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.200
 and then we will go down 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.090
 sugar 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.090
 to the blue tone that I already have 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.360
 if you feel that it disappears we go back to 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.900
 do the blue and we give another one 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.900
 pass 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.670
 and that is the finished here 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:54.989
 with a white pencil or liquid we are going to 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.989
 make a line in this part here 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.780
 and we'll do a line pretty much like that in 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.440
 the top part we will go through again 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.440
 that the blue 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.640
 so you do not miss the tone 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.040
 and we will take it up 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:30.260
 more or less like that we passed him another 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.330
 little color that is like that yellow what 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.850
 We extend downwards so that we 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.970
 I'm going to take this and one of nix in 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.360
 blue electric tone and I'll go through 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.360
 here inside 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.780
 and let's delineate in black here 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:57.480
 we make small eyes for the 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.550
 excess makeup but good I'll 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.550
 delineate in black 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.600
 more or less that is the result in the 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.180
 part of the forehead 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:11.239
 I'm going to make a way to 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.390
 like a little flower that looks more or 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:17.650
 less so I did with this and one of nix 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:22.180
 of electric blue and men 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:25.690
 with this other blue that is cobalt 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:29.830
 and I'll be putting him around 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:33.220
 Shade green to give you a tone 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:36.250
 more so different and I'm going to use this one 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.139
 here more or less is like that and I'm going to 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.830
 be applying this iter color green 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:47.069
 inside all this but I'm going to put 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.610
 glue good girls and so it stayed like 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:52.060
 they will see 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:56.379
 I put the enable on top not much and 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:05:00.099
 good here and did what others lack the 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:03.430
 lashes we will try to pronounce 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:08.639
 well our face because as it is a 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:12.819
 Fantasy makeup does not matter how 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:14.650
 how you highlight this area but if you have 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:16.419
 to be very very strong so that she 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.160
 to make it look like it's a 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:21.440
 Makeup is used a lot at night 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.590
 and good I'm going to continue in this part of 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.630
 here I will put glitter pebbles and 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.830
 then I will show you how it is and 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.230
 you ate style 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.290
 hello girls here I hit a pebble and 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:37.220
 in this part I also put I'm going to do 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:39.610
 These long fantasy eyelashes 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.610
 feathers 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.200
