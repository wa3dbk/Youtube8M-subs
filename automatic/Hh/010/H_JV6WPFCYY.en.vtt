was apparently an earthquake in northern
Illinois<00:02:49.120> I<00:02:50.190> think<00:02:52.140> near<00:02:53.140> or<00:02:53.380> in<00:02:53.410> elgin<00:02:54.250> which

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
Illinois I think near or in elgin which

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.250 
Illinois I think near or in elgin which
is<00:02:55.269> located<00:02:55.870> somewhat<00:02:56.709> near<00:02:56.920> chicago<00:02:57.989> but<00:02:58.989> not

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
is located somewhat near chicago but not

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.620 
is located somewhat near chicago but not
really<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:01.690> i<00:03:02.730> know<00:03:03.730> i<00:03:03.910> already<00:03:04.300> had<00:03:04.420> some

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
really and i know i already had some

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.970 
really and i know i already had some
messages<00:03:05.019> from<00:03:05.170> that<00:03:05.350> this<00:03:05.560> is<00:03:05.650> gonna<00:03:05.830> blow<00:03:07.980> so

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
messages from that this is gonna blow so

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.380 
messages from that this is gonna blow so
let's<00:03:09.459> talk<00:03:09.550> about<00:03:09.610> that<00:03:09.880> for<00:03:09.940> a<00:03:10.120> little<00:03:10.209> bit

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
let's talk about that for a little bit

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.390 
let's talk about that for a little bit
um<00:03:11.250> is<00:03:12.250> right<00:03:12.550> the<00:03:12.640> boss<00:03:12.790> already<00:03:14.130> but<00:03:15.130> i<00:03:15.160> think

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
um is right the boss already but i think

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.520 
um is right the boss already but i think
was<00:03:15.519> like<00:03:15.610> a<00:03:15.670> 3.8<00:03:16.269> earthquake<00:03:16.300> and<00:03:17.290> it's

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
was like a 3.8 earthquake and it's

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.610 
was like a 3.8 earthquake and it's
really<00:03:18.220> weird<00:03:18.480> there<00:03:19.480> is<00:03:19.570> a<00:03:19.630> major<00:03:19.930> fault<00:03:20.410> line

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
really weird there is a major fault line

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.970 
really weird there is a major fault line
in<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.830> Midwest<00:03:21.250> but<00:03:21.550> it's<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.940> the

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
in the Midwest but it's to the

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.610 
in the Midwest but it's to the
south-south<00:03:23.980> Illinois<00:03:24.489> maybe<00:03:25.470> one<00:03:26.470> of<00:03:26.500> the

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
south-south Illinois maybe one of the

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.199 
south-south Illinois maybe one of the
states<00:03:26.890> south<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.459> that<00:03:27.670> I<00:03:27.700> don't<00:03:28.120> know

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
states south to that I don't know

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.820 
states south to that I don't know
exactly<00:03:28.630> where<00:03:28.810> it's<00:03:28.959> at<00:03:29.140> but<00:03:29.470> there<00:03:29.680> is<00:03:29.709> a

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
exactly where it's at but there is a

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.060 
exactly where it's at but there is a
major<00:03:30.040> faultline<00:03:31.019> but<00:03:32.019> to<00:03:32.709> have<00:03:32.890> an

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
major faultline but to have an

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.880 
major faultline but to have an
earthquake<00:03:33.519> originates<00:03:34.299> nor<00:03:35.290> in<00:03:35.440> northern

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
earthquake originates nor in northern

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
really weird to have an earthquake in

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.610 
really weird to have an earthquake in
this<00:03:55.099> part<00:03:55.310> of<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.430> country<00:03:55.870> we<00:03:56.870> I<00:03:57.140> mean<00:03:57.290> we've

sure this is going to get people talking
you<00:04:06.620> know<00:04:06.709> both<00:04:07.599> non-experts<00:04:08.599> and<00:04:08.780> experts

you know both non-experts and experts

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.649 
you know both non-experts and experts
alike<00:04:09.170> that<00:04:10.150> probably<00:04:11.150> what<00:04:11.269> happened<00:04:11.599> in

alike that probably what happened in

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.360 
alike that probably what happened in
Haiti<00:04:11.900> could<00:04:12.290> be<00:04:12.409> a<00:04:12.440> direct<00:04:12.799> result<00:04:12.980> of<00:04:13.250> this

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
Haiti could be a direct result of this

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.420 
Haiti could be a direct result of this
or<00:04:13.940> a<00:04:13.970> direct<00:04:14.360> cause<00:04:14.629> or<00:04:15.049> in<00:04:15.319> correlation<00:04:15.950> if

you<00:04:16.639> will<00:04:16.850> of<00:04:17.380> this<00:04:18.380> little<00:04:18.739> minor<00:04:19.100> earthquake

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
you will of this little minor earthquake

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.240 
you will of this little minor earthquake
I<00:04:20.139> don't<00:04:21.139> remember<00:04:21.289> what<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.769> haiti

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
I don't remember what the haiti

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.850 
I don't remember what the haiti
earthquake<00:04:22.340> was<00:04:22.820> maybe<00:04:23.060> it<00:04:23.210> was<00:04:23.300> six<00:04:24.139> points

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
earthquake was maybe it was six points

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.710 
earthquake was maybe it was six points
something<00:04:25.280> seven-point<00:04:26.180> something<00:04:26.510> I<00:04:26.570> want

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
something seven-point something I want

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.460 
something seven-point something I want
to<00:04:26.780> say<00:04:27.940> but<00:04:28.940> I<00:04:29.000> mean<00:04:29.180> this<00:04:29.300> could<00:04:29.510> be<00:04:29.660> a<00:04:29.690> direct

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
to say but I mean this could be a direct

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.129 
to say but I mean this could be a direct
indirect<00:04:31.430> relation<00:04:31.910> to<00:04:32.090> that<00:04:32.120> and<00:04:32.780> there's<00:04:33.080> no

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
indirect relation to that and there's no

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.659 
indirect relation to that and there's no
ruling<00:04:33.650> that<00:04:33.800> out<00:04:33.860> or<00:04:34.160> it<00:04:34.250> could<00:04:34.400> just<00:04:34.430> be<00:04:34.610> a

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
ruling that out or it could just be a

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.600 
ruling that out or it could just be a
massive<00:04:35.090> coincidence<00:04:35.240> but<00:04:35.930> I<00:04:36.400> mean<00:04:37.400> you<00:04:37.490> would

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
massive coincidence but I mean you would

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.439 
massive coincidence but I mean you would
think<00:04:37.639> that<00:04:38.030> if<00:04:39.430> the<00:04:40.430> earth<00:04:40.580> would<00:04:40.880> shift<00:04:41.210> in

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
think that if the earth would shift in

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.310 
think that if the earth would shift in
such<00:04:41.870> a<00:04:42.310> dramatic<00:04:43.310> way<00:04:43.910> in<00:04:44.210> some<00:04:44.900> part<00:04:45.139> it

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
such a dramatic way in some part it

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.520 
such a dramatic way in some part it
might<00:04:45.560> shift<00:04:45.830> in<00:04:46.660> response<00:04:47.660> and<00:04:48.020> another<00:04:48.289> part

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
might shift in response and another part

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.690 
might shift in response and another part
which<00:04:48.889> this<00:04:49.160> could<00:04:49.550> be<00:04:49.669> it<00:04:49.820> but<00:04:51.580> for<00:04:52.580> people

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
which this could be it but for people

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.290 
which this could be it but for people
who<00:04:53.000> are<00:04:53.120> not<00:04:53.479> knowledgeable<00:04:54.260> on<00:04:55.300> earthquakes

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
who are not knowledgeable on earthquakes

there was pretty horrible I'm not going

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.950 
there was pretty horrible I'm not going
to<00:05:12.560> be<00:05:12.620> like<00:05:12.740> oh<00:05:12.919> it<00:05:13.880> was<00:05:14.000> nothing<00:05:14.330> it's<00:05:14.750> pretty

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
miserable what happened there but for

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.120 
miserable what happened there but for
something<00:05:18.260> like<00:05:18.440> that<00:05:18.500> to<00:05:18.710> happen<00:05:18.919> in<00:05:19.070> the

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
something like that to happen in the

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.370 
something like that to happen in the
United<00:05:19.430> States<00:05:19.490> while<00:05:20.060> not<00:05:20.360> impossible<00:05:21.199> is

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
United States while not impossible is

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.589 
United States while not impossible is
rather<00:05:24.380> unlikely<00:05:24.979> especially<00:05:25.310> in<00:05:25.910> my<00:05:26.120> part<00:05:26.419> of

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
rather unlikely especially in my part of

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:30.760 
rather unlikely especially in my part of
the<00:05:26.660> country<00:05:27.699> California<00:05:28.699> maybe<00:05:28.940> but<00:05:29.770> the

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
the country California maybe but the

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.379 
the country California maybe but the
ground<00:05:31.160> is<00:05:31.310> a<00:05:31.370> lot<00:05:31.550> more<00:05:31.699> structurally<00:05:32.210> sound

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
ground is a lot more structurally sound

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:34.279 
ground is a lot more structurally sound
in<00:05:32.599> the<00:05:32.660> buildings<00:05:33.139> are<00:05:33.440> usually<00:05:33.889> run

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
in the buildings are usually run

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.029 
in the buildings are usually run
so<00:05:35.009> nothing<00:05:35.639> really<00:05:35.669> happened<00:05:36.479> if<00:05:37.050> anyone<00:05:37.469> was

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
so nothing really happened if anyone was

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:38.869 
so nothing really happened if anyone was
like<00:05:38.159> oh<00:05:38.249> my<00:05:38.369> god<00:05:38.520> there<00:05:38.639> was<00:05:38.669> an<00:05:38.789> earthquake

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:38.879 
like oh my god there was an earthquake

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:41.299 
like oh my god there was an earthquake
and<00:05:39.419> the<00:05:39.479> United<00:05:40.229> States<00:05:40.409> maybe<00:05:40.770> SS<00:05:41.129> really

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:41.309 
and the United States maybe SS really

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:43.070 
and the United States maybe SS really
think<00:05:41.520> he's<00:05:41.639> dead<00:05:41.969> no<00:05:42.210> I<00:05:42.479> don't<00:05:42.990> think

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
think he's dead no I don't think

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.469 
think he's dead no I don't think
anything<00:05:43.740> happened<00:05:43.919> other<00:05:44.219> than<00:05:44.309> some<00:05:45.240> stuff

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
anything happened other than some stuff

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.899 
anything happened other than some stuff

here I mean there is there's no damage
as<00:06:17.759> as<00:06:18.389> far<00:06:18.689> as<00:06:18.839> I<00:06:18.930> know<00:06:18.990> there's<00:06:19.259> no<00:06:19.349> damage<00:06:19.619> is

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
as as far as I know there's no damage is

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:22.129 
as as far as I know there's no damage is
nothing<00:06:20.399> some<00:06:20.759> stuff<00:06:21.180> shook<00:06:21.569> and<00:06:21.779> that<00:06:22.020> was

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 
nothing some stuff shook and that was

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:25.040 
nothing some stuff shook and that was
about<00:06:22.259> it<00:06:22.819> but<00:06:23.819> it's<00:06:24.029> becoming<00:06:24.539> a<00:06:24.689> little<00:06:24.869> bit

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
about it but it's becoming a little bit

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.399 
about it but it's becoming a little bit
more<00:06:25.229> odd<00:06:25.409> as<00:06:26.209> time<00:06:27.209> goes<00:06:27.419> on<00:06:27.629> that<00:06:28.020> we<00:06:28.319> are

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:28.409 
more odd as time goes on that we are

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:29.449 
more odd as time goes on that we are
getting<00:06:28.529> earthquakes<00:06:29.069> here<00:06:29.219> especially

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:29.459 
getting earthquakes here especially

00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:32.600 
getting earthquakes here especially
since<00:06:30.119> the<00:06:30.300> haiti<00:06:30.509> earthquake<00:06:30.599> is<00:06:31.309> is<00:06:32.309> so

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
since the haiti earthquake is is so

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.510 
since the haiti earthquake is is so
close<00:06:33.089> to<00:06:33.119> the<00:06:33.719> one<00:06:33.869> we<00:06:33.899> got<00:06:34.199> except<00:06:35.099> ours<00:06:35.309> was

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
close to the one we got except ours was

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.659 
close to the one we got except ours was
pretty<00:06:36.240> much<00:06:36.330> maybe<00:06:37.110> half<00:06:37.499> of<00:06:37.889> what<00:06:38.219> haiti<00:06:38.430> got

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
pretty much maybe half of what haiti got

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.350 
pretty much maybe half of what haiti got
and<00:06:38.969> they<00:06:39.899> had<00:06:40.080> you<00:06:40.469> know<00:06:40.669> tremors<00:06:41.669> after<00:06:42.209> that

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
and they had you know tremors after that

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.779 
and they had you know tremors after that
and<00:06:42.629> there<00:06:42.779> was<00:06:42.899> just<00:06:43.469> bad<00:06:43.769> times<00:06:44.099> over<00:06:44.639> there

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:44.789 
and there was just bad times over there

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:46.429 
and there was just bad times over there
altogether<00:06:45.360> I<00:06:45.539> probably<00:06:45.870> needed<00:06:46.139> one<00:06:46.319> of

00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:46.439 
altogether I probably needed one of

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:51.439 
altogether I probably needed one of
those<00:06:46.529> didn't<00:06:46.830> I<00:06:47.629> nope<00:06:49.639> so<00:06:50.639> nothing<00:06:51.059> heaven

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:51.449 
those didn't I nope so nothing heaven

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:54.110 
those didn't I nope so nothing heaven
I'm<00:06:51.629> fine<00:06:51.959> I<00:06:52.349> doubt<00:06:52.830> anything<00:06:53.159> would<00:06:53.759> happen

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
I'm fine I doubt anything would happen

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.759 
I'm fine I doubt anything would happen
any<00:06:54.449> time<00:06:54.539> soon<00:06:54.749> that's<00:06:55.349> not<00:06:55.469> to<00:06:55.589> say<00:06:55.740> it's

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:55.769 
any time soon that's not to say it's

00:06:55.769 --> 00:06:58.969 
any time soon that's not to say it's
impossible<00:06:57.289> I'm<00:06:58.289> not<00:06:58.439> going<00:06:58.589> to<00:06:58.649> be<00:06:58.740> like<00:06:58.830> yeah

00:06:58.969 --> 00:06:58.979 
impossible I'm not going to be like yeah

impossible I'm not going to be like yeah
it's<00:06:59.159> impossible<00:06:59.729> for<00:07:00.059> to<00:07:00.180> happen<00:07:00.269> to<00:07:00.539> me

00:07:00.679 --> 00:07:00.689 
it's impossible for to happen to me
