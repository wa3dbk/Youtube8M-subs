00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
our duo ranked Q again it is getting

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.050 
our duo ranked Q again it is getting
closer<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.710> end<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:08.070> season<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.640> season

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
closer to the end of season to season

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.820 
closer to the end of season to season
two<00:03:09.330> is<00:03:09.480> probably<00:03:09.960> the<00:03:10.380> end<00:03:10.500> of<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:10.710> is

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
two is probably the end of that is

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.010 
two is probably the end of that is
probably<00:03:11.220> about<00:03:11.370> two<00:03:11.760> months<00:03:11.970> away<00:03:12.300> so<00:03:12.330> we're

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
probably about two months away so we're

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.570 
probably about two months away so we're
going<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.200> be<00:03:13.290> looking<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.620> do<00:03:13.830> oq<00:03:14.190> some<00:03:14.370> ranked

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
going to be looking to do oq some ranked

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.280 
going to be looking to do oq some ranked
games<00:03:14.850> will<00:03:15.060> probably<00:03:15.480> be<00:03:15.630> i'll<00:03:15.930> be<00:03:15.960> streaming

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
games will probably be i'll be streaming

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.530 
games will probably be i'll be streaming
that<00:03:16.560> any<00:03:16.770> time<00:03:16.950> that<00:03:17.130> we're<00:03:17.220> playing

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
that any time that we're playing

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.150 
that any time that we're playing
probably<00:03:18.540> most<00:03:18.720> likely<00:03:18.870> on<00:03:19.160> thursdays

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
probably most likely on thursdays

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.250 
probably most likely on thursdays
fridays<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.820> saturdays<00:03:21.270> but<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:21.810> mean<00:03:22.020> it<00:03:22.140> just

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
fridays and saturdays but I mean it just

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.170 
fridays and saturdays but I mean it just
depends<00:03:22.710> on<00:03:22.800> our<00:03:22.890> personal<00:03:23.370> schedule<00:03:23.760> so<00:03:23.940> once

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
depends on our personal schedule so once

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.730
