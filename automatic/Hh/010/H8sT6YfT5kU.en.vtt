 gordes today gathers with 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.680
 globule allies of white blood cells the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.739
 Red cells 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.940
 call them as you sink ok what 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.590
 convinced me 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.200
 this is how things are with the little globules 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.270
 quiet good listen so that's fine 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.450
 me you will have noticed that my 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.899
 beautiful voice be virile so slightly 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.760
 six months I decode the guys today 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.610
 I propose you a double gameplay 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.020
 express series so one in less lethal 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.620
 the first one you have on the screen 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.570
 and the second in lethal or semi lethal 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.430
 in any case with the warbird are you 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.369
 have noticed them small topics to tackle 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.930
 precisely concerning the quality of 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.400
 gameplay on adventures do I know 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.570
 that standards they changed globox 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.369
 noticed wayne made fingers 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.369
 standards on this double z 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.830
 when you do admit 50 60 kg in 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.909
 domination 6 v6 is what you after 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.920
 you did what you did a very good 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.420
 war or not to an excellent game m 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.130
 exact but that's what I was going to say 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.780
 only that they are in less lethal 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.040
 or with whom we are going to say strict scores 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.400
 because you noticed that ss 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.500
 he was not very murderous the sea 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.400
 black to the sea which he sees the announced of 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.619
 the semi shit actually is from the series 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.590
 dallas to be a little explains ya 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.240
 it's like a chocobo inside it 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.159
 is good and the outside is poop 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.240
 in orange finally friends 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.430
 you will have noticed that the guys in front 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.320
 it was not lights and frankly 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.630
 I assume 200-300 the guys in front 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.009
 it was beginners so I'm not 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.299
 telling me that I am a pgm 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.560
 and hydrates everyone knows that at 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:11.440
 breakfast baggage cake at the 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:16.209
 chronicles come back and started 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:21.080
 65 thousand subscribers he took the melon to 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:25.700

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.980
 short and you guys just to blame yeah the 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.900
 delay the point that makes you laugh a 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.510
 time and if I laugh after I can more 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.489
 just show up to tell you the 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.230
 you guys are what about those at ew 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.110
 also doubt the copying offer you 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.110
 a double gameplay with a series of 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.650
 express every time you think that g 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.360
 he is very free free either in the 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.280
 movements a little like you the course 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.810
 you can go everywhere and that's what 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.600
 you think and there I speak to you 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.040
 subscribers that there is necessarily no 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.370
 travel to have to make 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.890
 series 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.110
 it's a question I'm asking you 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.160
 will have the answer in a video that 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.350
 will come soon 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.239
 precisely precisely a tutorial 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.680
 on displacements because actually 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.970
 to buy donald is now 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.160
 so impatient it just rings for 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.070
 deflect frankly oh you can also 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.079
 carried out strategic shift on 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.390
 advance to do that it's some 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.890
 thing that suits the book the design and 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.209
 the gameplay it makes sure that we can 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.760
 jump very high etc 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.910
 there are trips made and 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.340
 sledgehammer games is strongly inspired 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.540
 very proud that on the quality of 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.769
 maps what do you think about 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.930
 what I'm saying here is what you're 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.400
 agree that they will tell 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.329
 it was partly agree with me 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.000
 that is, there are brands that are 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:51.760
 not necessarily like that of triarc I 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:51.760
 have but completely nothing that I say 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:56.660
 exactly like that it's global 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.799
 the days because you see in this 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.239
 video I always do this 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:03.739
 remark of you are too kind and always 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.470
 you order well as a good little 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:12.230
 well-behaved child then you want 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:13.740
 reality makes a big game more or not 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.840
 short friends 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.700
 I'm going to be in very big series 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.170
 Are you going to see that after a while I 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.459
 think she herself is announcing herself 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.470
 is only valid that I tell you 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.630
 the same hoof in which I had made 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.220
 a dna it was in first rhyme 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.340
 to postpone multi show hold at the 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.230
 cellar 5 1 I had made 55 of race too 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.820
 I say no nonsense if you have not seen 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.770
 she appears on the screen frankly goes 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.390
 take a quick look over a good 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.340
 nice little gameplay with a subject 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.600
 relatively well chosen there you will see 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.970
 you relax mood unfortunately 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.470
 I was 24 at the soul I still had that 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.210
 a few little brothers and I wanted 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.950
 absolutely they are nervous there 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.110
 whether it be it's madeleine madeleine to 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.240
 him because here it is the asm is this 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.710
 well the huge seeds pretty easy one 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.240
 is on the terrace and you will see 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.250
 that this time I play with the good 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.760
 wagon with the thing bazille what good bah 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.500
 drones and warbird end brief you'll see 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.630
 that it's an end of game in hp and 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.860
 I love his ends too globox guimps 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.900

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.400
 me it's all the time in the end 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.000
 that you're going to do a series of talent is 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.830
 in the oven and recently I love it and that 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.720
 sometimes it's a series of phew and very 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.620
 often games 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.270
 that's also something that needed 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.590
 absolutely that I tell you and I 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.660
 want to have his opinion also on his

 global 1 is it vegetables in 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.770
 which ones you are really very good 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.630
 do not enter a dna of vicious and 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.850
 stuff like that and vegetables in which 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.860
 you're going to make more trips 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.020
 his game intelligence and where you go there 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.690
 christmas succeed - it puts at least the 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.950
 dna coexist and that's exactly that 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.800
 mean that there are some gameplay guys 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.650
 that ben I did that they are really 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.240

 no syria of you will see several 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.410
 series of 10 or series of 15 or 18 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.770
 is that I often do in these waters 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.950
 the 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.090

 she will be but we will say that she will 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.090
 to be successful do you see and is it something 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.490
 something that I really wanted 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.890
