Jerusalem artichokes and the picture I'm
showing<00:00:14.969> you<00:00:15.269> here<00:00:15.540> right<00:00:15.780> now<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.259> a

showing you here right now is a
Jerusalem<00:00:16.740> artichoke<00:00:17.419> flower<00:00:18.419> and<00:00:19.520> it<00:00:20.520> looks

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:20.700 
Jerusalem artichoke flower and it looks

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.519 
Jerusalem artichoke flower and it looks
very<00:00:20.849> similar<00:00:21.419> as<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.660> can<00:00:21.810> see<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.169> daisy

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
very similar as you can see to a daisy

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.740 
very similar as you can see to a daisy
which<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.519> not<00:00:23.699> surprising<00:00:23.939> because

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
which is not surprising because

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.019 
which is not surprising because
Jerusalem<00:00:25.410> artichokes<00:00:26.189> are<00:00:26.429> in<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.820> same

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
Jerusalem artichokes are in the same

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.669 
Jerusalem artichokes are in the same
plant<00:00:27.359> family<00:00:27.779> as<00:00:28.070> daisies<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.279> sunflowers

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
plant family as daisies and sunflowers

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.170 
plant family as daisies and sunflowers
so<00:00:31.679> that's<00:00:31.859> what<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.099> flower<00:00:32.339> looks<00:00:32.460> like<00:00:32.910> and

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
so that's what the flower looks like and

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.390 
so that's what the flower looks like and
then<00:00:33.690> over<00:00:33.960> here<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.199> have<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> picture<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:35.190> what

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400 
then over here I have a picture of what

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.220 
then over here I have a picture of what
this<00:00:35.550> particular<00:00:35.790> plant<00:00:36.390> looked<00:00:36.629> like<00:00:36.900> last

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
this particular plant looked like last

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.259 
this particular plant looked like last

it is now January I have to say this

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.880 
it is now January I have to say this
plant<00:00:41.909> has<00:00:42.120> changed<00:00:42.600> quite<00:00:42.839> a<00:00:42.960> bit<00:00:43.110> since<00:00:43.620> then

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
plant has changed quite a bit since then

plant has changed quite a bit since then
as<00:00:44.449> you<00:00:45.449> can<00:00:45.629> see<00:00:45.839> I<00:00:45.869> have<00:00:46.199> it<00:00:46.229> growing<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.430> a

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:47.549 
as you can see I have it growing in a

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:50.240 
as you can see I have it growing in a
planter<00:00:48.000> here<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:48.629> my<00:00:49.170> deck<00:00:49.440> I've<00:00:49.710> actually

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
planter here on my deck I've actually

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.009 
planter here on my deck I've actually
moved<00:00:50.699> the<00:00:50.879> planter<00:00:51.390> because<00:00:51.690> we're<00:00:51.869> actually

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
moved the planter because we're actually

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.369 
moved the planter because we're actually
working<00:00:52.500> on<00:00:52.739> our<00:00:53.729> deck<00:00:54.089> right<00:00:54.360> now<00:00:54.600> we're

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
working on our deck right now we're

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.820 
working on our deck right now we're
replacing<00:00:55.650> it<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.030> have<00:00:57.299> the<00:00:57.540> plant<00:00:58.409> in<00:00:58.650> a

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
replacing it so I have the plant in a

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.160 
replacing it so I have the plant in a
different<00:00:59.159> part<00:00:59.339> of<00:00:59.519> the<00:00:59.580> yard<00:00:59.939> as<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:01.019> can

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
different part of the yard as you can

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.039 
different part of the yard as you can
see<00:01:01.350> right<00:01:01.500> here<00:01:01.799> the<00:01:02.159> plant<00:01:02.549> is<00:01:02.879> pretty<00:01:03.780> tall

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
see right here the plant is pretty tall

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.050 
see right here the plant is pretty tall
this<00:01:04.739> one<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.040> particular<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.610> probably<00:01:05.909> about

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
this one in particular is probably about

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.440 
this one in particular is probably about
oh<00:01:06.530> no<00:01:07.530> 8<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.860> 10<00:01:08.040> feet<00:01:08.250> tall<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.820> it's<00:01:09.270> got<00:01:09.420> a

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
oh no 8 to 10 feet tall and it's got a

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.620 
oh no 8 to 10 feet tall and it's got a
growth<00:01:09.630> habit<00:01:09.990> very<00:01:10.200> similar<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:11.630> sunflowers

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
growth habit very similar to sunflowers

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.740 
growth habit very similar to sunflowers
not<00:01:12.869> surprising<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:14.000> in<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.149> planter<00:01:15.570> we

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
not surprising and in this planter we

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.090 
not surprising and in this planter we
have<00:01:15.869> several<00:01:16.229> different<00:01:16.409> Jerusalem

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
have several different Jerusalem

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.179 
have several different Jerusalem
artichoke<00:01:17.579> plants<00:01:18.259> growing<00:01:19.259> together<00:01:19.829> here

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
artichoke plants growing together here

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.399 
artichoke plants growing together here
so<00:01:20.909> let's<00:01:21.090> go<00:01:21.240> outside<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.600> take<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.929> look<00:01:22.200> at

so let's go outside and take a look at
what<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.429> plant<00:01:23.759> looks<00:01:23.999> like<00:01:24.179> right<00:01:24.390> now

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420

is a planter that has numerous Jerusalem
artichoke<00:01:31.439> plants<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.369> as<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.579> can<00:01:32.759> see

artichoke plants in it as you can see

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:38.029 
artichoke plants in it as you can see
here<00:01:33.630> it's<00:01:34.409> now<00:01:34.679> January<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:37.039> these

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039

Jerusalem<00:01:38.880> artichoke<00:01:39.329> plants<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:40.200> now

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
Jerusalem artichoke plants have now

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.590 
Jerusalem artichoke plants have now
dried<00:01:40.829> out<00:01:41.100> they've<00:01:41.490> actually<00:01:41.729> been<00:01:42.149> dry<00:01:42.359> like

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
dried out they've actually been dry like

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.380 
dried out they've actually been dry like
this<00:01:42.780> for<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> couple<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.499> months<00:01:43.679> now<00:01:44.359> when<00:01:45.359> I

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
this for a couple of months now when I

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.179 
this for a couple of months now when I
planted<00:01:46.170> these<00:01:47.039> Jerusalem<00:01:47.729> artichokes<00:01:48.329> last

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
planted these Jerusalem artichokes last

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.879 
planted these Jerusalem artichokes last
spring<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.520> put<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:51.119> about<00:01:51.359> six<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.810> them<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.289> as

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:52.889 
spring I put in about six of them and as

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:56.300 
spring I put in about six of them and as
you<00:01:53.159> can<00:01:53.310> see<00:01:53.369> they<00:01:53.909> have<00:01:54.210> grown<00:01:55.310> rather

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
you can see they have grown rather

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.399 
you can see they have grown rather
prolifically<00:01:57.179> here<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:58.109> not

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
prolifically here and this is not

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.599 
prolifically here and this is not
unusual<00:01:58.710> for<00:01:59.810> Jerusalem<00:02:00.810> artichokes<00:02:01.609> one

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
unusual for Jerusalem artichokes one

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:04.370 
unusual for Jerusalem artichokes one
thing<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.969> like<00:02:03.179> to<00:02:03.209> do<00:02:03.479> with<00:02:03.630> them<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.990> plant

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
thing I like to do with them is plant

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.429 
thing I like to do with them is plant
them<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.520> planter<00:02:06.359> because<00:02:06.749> they<00:02:06.899> do<00:02:06.959> have<00:02:07.409> a

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
them in a planter because they do have a

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.860 
them in a planter because they do have a
tendency<00:02:07.880> to<00:02:09.080> take<00:02:10.080> over<00:02:11.180> one<00:02:12.180> time<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.480> planted

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
tendency to take over one time I planted

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.380 
tendency to take over one time I planted
them<00:02:12.959> in<00:02:13.020> my<00:02:13.230> raised<00:02:13.470> beds<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.069> they<00:02:14.580> started

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
them in my raised beds and they started

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.850 
them in my raised beds and they started
crowding<00:02:15.750> out<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.080> other<00:02:16.380> plants<00:02:16.770> around

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
crowding out the other plants around

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.990 
crowding out the other plants around
them<00:02:17.750> so<00:02:18.750> it's<00:02:19.020> good<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.350> note<00:02:19.530> that

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
them so it's good to note that

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.350 
them so it's good to note that
they<00:02:20.810> certainly<00:02:21.140> do<00:02:21.560> yield<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.280> large<00:02:22.880> number

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
they certainly do yield a large number

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.550 
they certainly do yield a large number
of<00:02:25.000> Jerusalem<00:02:26.000> artichoke<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:26.810> let's<00:02:27.050> take<00:02:27.380> a

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
of Jerusalem artichoke so let's take a

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.520 
of Jerusalem artichoke so let's take a
look<00:02:27.830> at<00:02:27.980> how<00:02:28.190> many<00:02:28.250> are<00:02:29.200> underneath<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.350> soil

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
look at how many are underneath the soil

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.370 
look at how many are underneath the soil
here<00:02:30.950> I<00:02:31.210> just<00:02:32.210> pulled<00:02:32.630> up<00:02:32.780> one<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.140> stems

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
here I just pulled up one of the stems

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.680 
here I just pulled up one of the stems
and<00:02:33.590> look<00:02:33.740> what<00:02:33.950> I<00:02:33.980> found<00:02:34.070> a<00:02:34.670> bunch<00:02:35.540> of

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
and look what I found a bunch of

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.660 
and look what I found a bunch of
Jerusalem<00:02:36.290> artichokes<00:02:36.830> let's<00:02:37.220> see<00:02:37.430> how<00:02:37.610> many

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
Jerusalem artichokes let's see how many

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.080 
Jerusalem artichokes let's see how many
do<00:02:37.940> we<00:02:37.970> have<00:02:38.209> here<00:02:38.510> one<00:02:39.170> two<00:02:39.560> three<00:02:40.040> four<00:02:40.430> five

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
six seven excellent let's take a look at

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.360 
six seven excellent let's take a look at
the<00:02:43.820> other<00:02:43.940> stems<00:02:44.440> pulled<00:02:45.440> up<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.770> couple<00:02:46.130> other

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
the other stems pulled up a couple other

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.340 
the other stems pulled up a couple other
stems<00:02:46.820> growing<00:02:47.300> together<00:02:47.480> here<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.110> look<00:02:48.230> at

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
stems growing together here and look at

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.770 
stems growing together here and look at
this<00:02:48.560> there's<00:02:49.520> a<00:02:49.610> bunch<00:02:49.910> of<00:02:50.060> them<00:02:50.209> on<00:02:50.360> this<00:02:50.540> one

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
this there's a bunch of them on this one

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.050 
this there's a bunch of them on this one
Wow<00:02:51.590> here's<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:51.950> really<00:02:52.280> big<00:02:52.459> one<00:02:52.640> right<00:02:52.820> here<00:02:53.209> I

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
pulled up all of the stems and these are

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.260 
pulled up all of the stems and these are
the<00:02:58.040> Jerusalem<00:02:58.610> artichokes<00:02:59.150> that<00:02:59.650> I<00:03:00.650> found

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.670 
the Jerusalem artichokes that I found
now<00:03:02.270> when<00:03:02.540> I<00:03:02.570> pulled<00:03:02.870> up<00:03:02.989> some<00:03:03.230> of<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.410> stems

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
now when I pulled up some of the stems

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.530 
now when I pulled up some of the stems
they<00:03:03.950> broke<00:03:04.220> off<00:03:04.459> and<00:03:04.910> so<00:03:05.239> I<00:03:05.270> know<00:03:05.420> that

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.449 
they broke off and so I know that
there's<00:03:05.870> more<00:03:06.170> Jerusalem<00:03:06.770> artichokes<00:03:07.250> in<00:03:07.400> the

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
there's more Jerusalem artichokes in the

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.660 
there's more Jerusalem artichokes in the
planner<00:03:07.730> so<00:03:08.570> I'm<00:03:08.660> going<00:03:08.810> to<00:03:08.870> go<00:03:09.340> back<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.370> the
