00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:12.309
 Then I will try to continue 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:15.690
 Last time battleships hit each other, so it was a battle in space 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:18.610
 Well I won normally but 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:26.440
 Then I will go 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:27.310
 Same as the previous video, whether the enemy ship hits the occupied planet on the other side or does it hit a battleship here 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.170
 Until 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.170
 I will wait while moving close 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.610
 It doesn't quite come 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:56.540
 I finally hit this wash is a volcanic star 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.540
 Mustafar 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.449
 Loading 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:12.329
 Please wait for a while 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:12.329
 This star is where Anakin and Obiwan fought in the Paix Pisoï½°etc. 3 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.050
 It will be a while until it starts 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.240
 I 'm sorry I can't talk 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:47.439
 Finally started 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:51.750
 First because it requires First he points Doroi by choosing the command post that he appears 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.750
 I will go with the super battle droid 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.350
 Command cheat here 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.450
 Tea 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.860
 I did it suddenly- once more 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.860
 I will die if I use a cheat 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.040
 I made a command mistake 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.670
 Finally get back 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.670
 Well then we will go over again 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.850
 Here again command cheat 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:38.970
 The reason for using a cheat is 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:42.800
 I think because there are many people who do not use a cheat because it dies immediately 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.800
 You can easily win by using 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:50.100
 Then why do you go to rob the command pot 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:54.230
 It was suddenly attacked me 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.230
 Let's go ahead and go ahead 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.560
 I like Paris music 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.580
 I wonder if there are any more enemies 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.580
 Take away 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:18.180
 Everyone likes 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.180
 It's like saying you have a seat please 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:32.090
 Election complete 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.090
 I will go next 7 points or so 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.280
 If you look at the map on the upper right, you can check your own and enemy command posts 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:50.620
 There are lots of arrivals 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.620
 Let's defeat and capture immediately 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:07.989
 It was over immediately because we were able to occupy Oshinodake 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.989
 Use barely one in Doroi 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.610
 After all he likes moving fast in Droi 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.060
 It's also full here 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.060
 I will defeat the shield 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:34.180
 It seems like someone threw a grenade 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.180
 Don't ask 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:43.120
 I was able to occupy 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.120
 I have already started counting to win 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:56.140
 If you do it with Mustafar, it will end very early 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:56.140
 It seems that even if it is still target , it is overwhelmed by this strength and can not be occupied 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.759
 cutter 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:08.069
 I don't feel like I've won 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:49.490
 If you keep saving without saving data, you have to do another war. 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.490
 It is this reward, but it is quite expensive 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:58.080
 The previous Seibu was a level or normal 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.080
 This is the real Seibu 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:08.080
 So this time it was a battle at Mustafar 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:14.740
 Next is a battle to fight on other planets 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:20.400
 Please comment if you want to do it because there are saved data of the imperial rebels 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.400
 Thank you for watching I will do my best next time
