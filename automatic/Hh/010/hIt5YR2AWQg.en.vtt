00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.520
 area 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.320
 soft so one of the last cars 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.610
 outside the whole stand 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.390
 yeah well be careful enough that he 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.560
 so derailed where is young how much 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.750
 which derailed the energy 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.790
 the last recital are unions 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.020
 where the level crossing if you like heaven 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.059
 come 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.610
 there is something to see there there are nice 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.989
 what pieces of roughly finished and if you 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.780
 so tell me along the rail then you can 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.350
 you nice to see that he is the 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.790
 sleepers 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.570
 hit so you see a nice one 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.520
 trail of students who just fled 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.890
 then he is quite me to my door 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.869
 ago yes yes but well there is 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.700
 of course a session behind 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.159
 and before she stops taina with that 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.719
 weight that you experience nature 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.700
 the question is of course also of appreciation 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:25.109
 machinery has worked out that they were 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.639
 the rails jammed 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:30.659
 I was with two other colleagues in the 

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:32.069
 canteen behind me and we saw one 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.619
 good trainer came to watch 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:37.079
 and thinking began to fire foncke and 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.789
 can take another wheel off and we saw one 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.319
 steal that flew around 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.700
 popping at our windows against it 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:43.020
 first had two days away here so we 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.039
 are just in other part of there 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.270
 escaped 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.789
 so it's about where to go outside 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.439
 The secret to look at with damage was then 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.310
 share another linus with wheels 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.349
 when the yeast in it fell again 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.909
 clearly yes and then we looked 

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:56.539
 to what we saw behind us all that 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.740
 stones and its track and track 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.630
 there we saw that the auxiliary thread was low and 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.039
 several more parts and end 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.439
 further on we saw that it was rules in between 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.419
 to standstill is born about one 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.979
 capric and happen you know 

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:09.810
 scare again with a faster than 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.739
 you think and it was really a terrible thing 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.360
 scare 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.790
 yes it went so fast this really your time 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.830
 to respond but I do it now 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.090
 trust hour long shot a day no 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.920
 it goes on all day long 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.140
 you mean what they do but you look now 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.459
 again letter not so on but if then 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.530
 something like that happens and 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.700
 so william schrikker for a moment 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.010
 stroke or 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.060
 yes yes i have to go back to work and 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.780
 then they will happen again but 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.780
 it's a weird day 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.160
