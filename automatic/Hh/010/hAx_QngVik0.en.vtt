00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.779
 video made specifically for public 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.920
 Leopard news is the biggest and best 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.920
 barcelona public 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:19.109
 no girl is a believer no 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.150
 change their views as it is 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.130
 did last night fans 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.220
 football club barcelona 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.439
 at first they were full of confidence that 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.970
 on the computer, but we will beat the Thomas field 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.150
 will answer the cup final 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.640
 everyone remembers and then after the match oh everyone 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.430
 maybe for Real Madrid but I will say 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.800
 you neymar is not with that pedro which 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.090
 go to england rides and do not scold him 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.100
 on the fight for the golden ball and not 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.680
 ends here right on that particular 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.050
 match but off and grace barcelona not 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.600
 recouped her struck right now in 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.660
 the internet has hundreds of restless souls 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.140
 Barcelona fans, well it was not so 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.230
 with this team in this match rubrics result 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.230
 match 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.800
 but firstly for this match barcelona 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.350
 again came out of their form 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.240
 many expected to see a lighter one 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.909
 more moving barcelona especially since 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.250
 the leader rested and in the past silence is not 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.830
 played but at least center field but 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.490
 no but no barcelona come out and she 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.400
 absolutely slowly she gave way to movement 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.740
 Athletics is not of itself that's familiar 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.420
 familiar samples if the match passed 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.000
 athletic ran across barcelona 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.740
 then in this match I'm barcelona but so 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.680
 let's say not run 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.140
 and the movement under this is not allowed to be played 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.110
 bots in this ethics such in repost 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.940
 so that this defense is over saturated with boron 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.700
 athletics open it was of course 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.050
 predictably by the Basque team 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.840
 but barcelona 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.690
 in the absence of proper form not 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.000
 could move so that this defense 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.890
 open the gears and the like but 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.519
 I was surprised that 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.680
 the transfer of Barcelona many deserved 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:15.310
 the coolest footballers who could all 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.400
 inaccurate it's weird it's weird looking 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:22.120
 on andresa iniesta when his 6 in a row 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.100
 the gears were inaccurate this is true and 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.670
 penetrating the transfer of this some 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:31.329
 casts of innings but he constantly 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.430
 was wrong he was constantly wrong except 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:36.510
 that is absolutely incomprehensible to me but 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.010
 why barcelona most of their attacks 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.560
 played with horse casting 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.049
 this this what is that asked for no this 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.110
 didn't ask about us cheated she did not 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.880
 playing it is strange but apart from its 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.430
 inaccuracies besides the fact that barcelona 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.829
 was slow and bad and moved by 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.430
 the field played incomprehensible canopies 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:03:00.370
 Barcelona did not create trouble 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.340
 moments that would allow her 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.410
 count on some kind of successful outcome 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.590
 there were few moments do you think 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.900
 how many of these moment 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:13.840
 was in the first half here's how you 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:16.840
 think 33 moment one goal is yes 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.920
 inside the moment barcelona is not always 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.599
 great realizes all his moment 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.459
 just not possible that amount 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.799
 the moment they usually create well 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.540
 for example a match of cheese and gamma cup 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.090
 pen well, it is clear that a friend but 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.599
 no less they create moments so much 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.549
 which of them but realize 45 is it well it 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.670
 some minimum ten trenney moments 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.049
 first half and in the second you'll 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.019
 laugh three more 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:45.560
 only six moments I have hands fingers 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:48.590
 only there are only six moments of athletic 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.980
 created a 4 floor scored one fantastic 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.959
 now about the personalities they were important they 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.989
 were in this match what is the most interesting 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.510
 leo messi let's take a look at it so 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:02.239
 called hitman this is a moving map 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.480
 briefly show the dream of his activity 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:08.090
 I have not seen such a community when 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.190
 especially since it is about the place he is in 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.160
 this match really did not move about 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.600
 transmission were on the meter 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.789
 nearby partner no more 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.400
 created moments didn't break at all with 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:22.970
 the ball was very rarely understandable that 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.720
 a place not fit he scored a goal but was up 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.060
 disgusting 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:30.349
 disgusting because this is again 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.910
 activity card funny petra man 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:33.860
 which should already play itself 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.670
 damn club you clearly showed 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.220
 why 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.410
 neymar is not he and what's the difference 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.540
 the gap between these footballers and what 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.850
 he did not win never in principle 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.220
 competition in this match was active when 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.280
 that he did not spend the season so that 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.350
 tired and yes to get in shape later no he 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.860
 looked active but he didn't create anything 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.990
 was stupid on the battlefield if i 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.880
 said his series 6 inaccurate transmissions she 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.010
 amazes at all anyone it is not a congress 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.670
 and this is not some sort of ragim I like 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:07.400
 although I have nothing against but the level 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:09.470
 different in general defense was not necessary 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.190
 in this match to touch the players we are not 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:15.950
 let 's rocket him 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.350
 on arrival in a la carte well in short 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:22.240
 all the leaders of barcelona poline form and 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:25.280
 held a generally unsuccessful match that is 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.250
 there was no place to take in this match 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.680
 a good result you actually such 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.570
 and we did not turn out friends 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.610
 we see generally a unique moment when 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.580
 with the best club in the world 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.210
 do whatever they want a team like 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.090
 athletics 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:44.690
 no offense but with a ceiling i suggest 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.580
 write off this expression 2 matches and 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:50.960
 lost cup at the beginning of the season 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:53.390
 barcelona later came out of rest leaders 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.030
 were on the America's Cup and will get this 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:59.120
 the team is absolutely accurate and see who 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.310
 in general will be able to keep it in the future 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.050

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.300
