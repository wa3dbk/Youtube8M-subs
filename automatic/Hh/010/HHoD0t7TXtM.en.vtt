you<00:00:23.699> might<00:00:23.850> find<00:00:24.000> out<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.779> they've<00:00:24.930> done

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
you might find out that they've done

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.070 
you might find out that they've done
general<00:00:25.529> junctions<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.599> they<00:00:27.599> feel<00:00:27.779> okay

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
general junctions and they feel okay

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.330 
general junctions and they feel okay
with<00:00:28.109> everything<00:00:28.500> but<00:00:28.650> you've<00:00:28.830> not<00:00:29.039> seen<00:00:29.220> them

with everything but you've not seen them
drive<00:00:29.550> yet<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:29.970> don't<00:00:30.150> really<00:00:30.330> know<00:00:30.570> how

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
drive yet so you don't really know how

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.179 
drive yet so you don't really know how
they're<00:00:31.349> gonna<00:00:31.439> do<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:31.890> whether<00:00:31.980> it's

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
they're gonna do it and whether it's

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.090 
they're gonna do it and whether it's
gonna<00:00:32.279> be<00:00:32.369> good<00:00:33.000> bad<00:00:33.149> or<00:00:33.180> indifferent<00:00:33.620> so<00:00:34.620> to

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
gonna be good bad or indifferent so to

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.880 
gonna be good bad or indifferent so to
keep<00:00:35.219> control<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.090> not<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.690> be<00:00:37.500> too

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
keep control of that and not to be too

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.250 
keep control of that and not to be too
retrospective<00:00:38.579> but<00:00:39.090> be<00:00:39.300> proactive<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.020> in

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
retrospective but be proactive and in

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.470 
retrospective but be proactive and in
front<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.829> pupil<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.700> would<00:00:41.820> need<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.239> use

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
front of the pupil you would need to use

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.750 
front of the pupil you would need to use
a<00:00:42.989> prompter<00:00:43.530> technique<00:00:43.920> more<00:00:44.399> than<00:00:44.550> anything

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
a prompter technique more than anything

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.240 
a prompter technique more than anything
on<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.539> way<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.930> site<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.980> could

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
on the way to the site so that you could

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.590 
on the way to the site so that you could
then<00:00:47.280> find<00:00:47.700> out<00:00:47.910> what<00:00:48.030> they<00:00:48.149> were<00:00:48.239> thinking<00:00:48.390> of

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
then find out what they were thinking of

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.299 
then find out what they were thinking of
doing<00:00:48.809> if<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.289> was<00:00:49.379> correct<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.980> could<00:00:50.129> just

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
doing if it was correct you could just

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.310 
doing if it was correct you could just
praise<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.730> if<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.360> not<00:00:51.750> correct<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.140> can

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
praise it if it's not correct you can

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.920 
praise it if it's not correct you can
guide<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.890> help<00:00:53.399> them<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.579> get<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.789> right

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
guide it and help them to get it right

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.139 
guide it and help them to get it right
you<00:00:55.199> also<00:00:55.489> can't<00:00:56.489> assume<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.789> they<00:00:57.030> will

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
you also can't assume that they will

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.010 
you also can't assume that they will
have<00:00:57.239> dealt<00:00:57.420> with<00:00:57.510> everything<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.930> they're

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
have dealt with everything that they're

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.599 
have dealt with everything that they're
going<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.170> come<00:00:58.260> across<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> way<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.550> you

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
going to come across on the way so you

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.830 
going to come across on the way so you
might<00:00:59.850> have<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.030> ask<00:01:00.210> if<00:01:00.449> they<00:01:00.510> can<00:01:00.600> because

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
might have to ask if they can because

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.939 
might have to ask if they can because
roundabouts<00:01:01.289> have<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.680> dealt<00:01:01.829> with

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
roundabouts have you dealt with

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.590 
roundabouts have you dealt with
roundabouts<00:01:02.370> before<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.969> if<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.420> haven't

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
roundabouts before and if you haven't

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.570 
roundabouts before and if you haven't
then<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.500> would<00:01:04.619> guide<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:05.129> they<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.430> you

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
then you would guide it if they have you

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.910 
then you would guide it if they have you
could<00:01:05.700> prompt<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.930> I'm<00:01:07.530> gonna<00:01:07.650> give<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.890> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
could prompt it so I'm gonna give you a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.880 
could prompt it so I'm gonna give you a
little<00:01:08.010> bit<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.610> demonstration<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:09.619> what<00:01:10.619> I

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
little bit of a demonstration of what I

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.820 
little bit of a demonstration of what I
would<00:01:11.220> do<00:01:11.549> if<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.390> was<00:01:12.630> taking<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.320> pupil<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.710> the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
would do if I was taking a pupil to the

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.679 
would do if I was taking a pupil to the
site<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.189> maneuver<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.119> I'll<00:01:15.180> imagine<00:01:15.360> that

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
site of a maneuver so I'll imagine that

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.420 
site of a maneuver so I'll imagine that
we've<00:01:15.900> done<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.259> copper<00:01:16.680> drill<00:01:17.009> everything's

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
we've done the copper drill everything's

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.920 
we've done the copper drill everything's
okay<00:01:17.700> with<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.450> we're<00:01:18.600> going<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.750> set

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
okay with that and we're going to set

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.749 
okay with that and we're going to set
off<00:01:19.140> but<00:01:19.650> I'm<00:01:19.740> not<00:01:19.830> going<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.009> assume<00:01:20.250> anything

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
off but I'm not going to assume anything

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.070 
off but I'm not going to assume anything
and<00:01:21.000> then<00:01:21.150> we're<00:01:21.240> prompting<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.689> pupil

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
and then we're prompting the pupil

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:32.570 
and then we're prompting the pupil
throughout<00:01:22.740> hope<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.790> helps

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.670 

okay<00:01:33.580> so<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.790> cockpit<00:01:34.090> drill<00:01:34.180> is<00:01:34.360> done<00:01:37.680> and

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
okay so the cockpit drill is done and

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.080 
okay so the cockpit drill is done and
we'll<00:01:38.830> imagine<00:01:39.130> that<00:01:39.250> you've<00:01:39.340> asked<00:01:39.610> about

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
we'll imagine that you've asked about

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.370 
we'll imagine that you've asked about
what<00:01:40.330> they<00:01:40.450> can<00:01:40.600> see<00:01:40.780> in<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:40.960> mirrors<00:01:41.229> and

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
what they can see in the mirrors and

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.719 
what they can see in the mirrors and
everything<00:01:41.650> sounds<00:01:41.799> okay<00:01:42.220> with<00:01:42.369> that

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
everything sounds okay with that

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.219 
everything sounds okay with that
but<00:01:43.150> the<00:01:43.210> next<00:01:43.390> thing<00:01:43.479> they're<00:01:43.690> gonna<00:01:43.780> do<00:01:43.960> is

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
but the next thing they're gonna do is

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.430 
but the next thing they're gonna do is
start<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.590> engine<00:01:44.950> so<00:01:45.580> before<00:01:46.570> they<00:01:47.110> start

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
start the engine so before they start

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.020 
start the engine so before they start
the<00:01:47.530> engine<00:01:47.830> there<00:01:48.340> could<00:01:48.490> be<00:01:48.520> all<00:01:48.670> kinds<00:01:48.700> of

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
the engine there could be all kinds of

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.030 
the engine there could be all kinds of
faults<00:01:49.240> that<00:01:49.360> they<00:01:49.540> give<00:01:49.690> you<00:01:49.810> I<00:01:50.380> would<00:01:50.710> ask

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
faults that they give you I would ask

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.649 
faults that they give you I would ask
what<00:01:51.369> two<00:01:51.759> checks<00:01:52.000> are<00:01:52.119> you<00:01:52.180> gonna<00:01:52.270> make<00:01:52.479> or

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
what two checks are you gonna make or

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.389 
what two checks are you gonna make or
what<00:01:52.780> precautions<00:01:53.290> you're<00:01:53.409> gonna<00:01:53.530> check<00:01:53.799> take

what precautions you're gonna check take

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:55.560 
what precautions you're gonna check take
before<00:01:54.729> you<00:01:54.790> start<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:55.149> engine

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
before you start the engine

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.060 
before you start the engine
so<00:01:56.229> I<00:01:56.259> will<00:01:56.409> check<00:01:56.560> hey<00:01:56.740> what<00:01:56.860> are<00:01:56.890> you<00:01:56.979> gonna

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
check before you start the engine oh

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.010 
check before you start the engine oh
yeah<00:01:58.600> hundreds<00:01:59.200> on<00:01:59.350> into<00:01:59.649> new<00:02:00.780> now<00:02:01.780> they<00:02:01.899> can

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
yeah hundreds on into new now they can

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.139 
yeah hundreds on into new now they can
give<00:02:02.140> you<00:02:02.200> as<00:02:02.289> long<00:02:02.440> answers<00:02:02.830> that<00:02:03.070> they<00:02:03.970> can

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
give you as long answers that they can

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.389 
give you as long answers that they can
say<00:02:04.360> neutral<00:02:05.020> handbrake<00:02:05.470> which<00:02:05.979> is<00:02:06.220> the

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
say neutral handbrake which is the

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.070 
say neutral handbrake which is the
correct<00:02:06.670> to<00:02:06.940> things<00:02:07.210> button<00:02:07.539> on<00:02:07.720> the<00:02:07.810> order

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
correct to things button on the order

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.960 
correct to things button on the order
you<00:02:08.800> would<00:02:08.890> then<00:02:08.979> have<00:02:09.130> to<00:02:09.160> identify<00:02:09.700> that<00:02:09.850> as

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
you would then have to identify that as

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.380 
you would then have to identify that as
a<00:02:10.060> fault<00:02:10.269> and<00:02:10.830> talk<00:02:11.830> about<00:02:12.070> that<00:02:12.280> see<00:02:13.209> if<00:02:13.269> they

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
a fault and talk about that see if they

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.030 
a fault and talk about that see if they
understood<00:02:13.780> why<00:02:14.050> it<00:02:14.080> was<00:02:14.440> wrong<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.680> do<00:02:14.920> it

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
understood why it was wrong to do it

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.380 
understood why it was wrong to do it
that<00:02:15.130> way<00:02:15.250> around<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.670> consequences<00:02:16.239> of

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
that way around and the consequences of

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.590 
that way around and the consequences of
doing<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:17.940> throughout<00:02:18.940> this<00:02:19.180> I'm<00:02:19.420> going<00:02:19.540> to

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
doing that throughout this I'm going to

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.420 
doing that throughout this I'm going to
try<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:19.900> give<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.350> correct<00:02:20.680> answers<00:02:21.100> just<00:02:21.310> to

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
try and give the correct answers just to

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.890 
try and give the correct answers just to
make<00:02:21.550> a<00:02:21.700> little<00:02:21.850> bit<00:02:22.000> easier<00:02:22.030> for<00:02:22.510> myself<00:02:22.600> at

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
make a little bit easier for myself at

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.600 
make a little bit easier for myself at
the<00:02:22.959> moment<00:02:23.050> and<00:02:23.440> not<00:02:23.830> bother<00:02:24.160> complicate

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
the moment and not bother complicate

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.970 
the moment and not bother complicate
things<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.269> what<00:02:25.420> you'll<00:02:25.540> find<00:02:25.569> is<00:02:25.989> that<00:02:26.050> on

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
things and what you'll find is that on

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.620 
things and what you'll find is that on
the<00:02:27.190> drive<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.610> site<00:02:27.819> if<00:02:28.030> you<00:02:28.180> are<00:02:28.300> giving

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
the drive to the site if you are giving

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.840 
the drive to the site if you are giving
good<00:02:28.660> positive<00:02:29.140> proactive<00:02:29.590> instruction<00:02:30.220> that

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
good positive proactive instruction that

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.400 
good positive proactive instruction that
most<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.660> time<00:02:31.870> you're<00:02:31.989> gonna<00:02:32.110> get<00:02:32.260> good

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
most of the time you're gonna get good

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.380 
most of the time you're gonna get good
answers<00:02:32.590> back<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.310> they're<00:02:33.970> not<00:02:34.120> gonna<00:02:34.239> mess

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
answers back and they're not gonna mess

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.150 
answers back and they're not gonna mess
around<00:02:34.420> a<00:02:34.989> lot<00:02:35.380> because<00:02:35.500> there<00:02:35.829> isn't<00:02:35.920> enough

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
around a lot because there isn't enough

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.100 
around a lot because there isn't enough
time<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:37.060> do<00:02:37.180> that<00:02:37.329> on<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.570> way<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.900> site

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
time to do that on the way to the site

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.620 
time to do that on the way to the site
and<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:39.100> subject<00:02:39.489> really<00:02:39.760> is<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.209> maneuver

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
and the subject really is the maneuver

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.690 
and the subject really is the maneuver
although<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.620> drive<00:02:41.799> to<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.040> site<00:02:42.220> is<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.430> part

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
although the drive to the site is a part

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.890 
although the drive to the site is a part
of<00:02:42.820> that<00:02:43.000> lesson

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
of that lesson

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.539 
of that lesson
okay<00:02:44.530> so<00:02:44.590> we'll<00:02:44.830> carry<00:02:45.010> on<00:02:45.129> from<00:02:45.220> where<00:02:45.430> we

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
okay so we'll carry on from where we

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.520 
okay so we'll carry on from where we
were<00:02:45.970> just<00:02:46.269> were<00:02:46.450> there<00:02:46.810> start<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.260> engine

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
were just were there start the engine

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.140 
were just were there start the engine
we're<00:02:47.739> gonna<00:02:47.830> move<00:02:48.010> off<00:02:48.159> so<00:02:48.310> I'd<00:02:48.370> say<00:02:48.610> okay

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
we're gonna move off so I'd say okay

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.850 
we're gonna move off so I'd say okay
what<00:02:49.330> then<00:02:49.780> routine<00:02:50.379> you're<00:02:50.530> gonna<00:02:50.620> use<00:02:50.830> to

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
what then routine you're gonna use to

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.619 
what then routine you're gonna use to
move<00:02:51.129> off<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:51.670> hopefully<00:02:52.150> they'll<00:02:52.450> say

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
move off and hopefully they'll say

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.630 
move off and hopefully they'll say
prepare<00:02:52.959> upset<00:02:53.230> move

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
prepare upset move

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.309 
prepare upset move
I'm<00:02:55.030> not<00:02:55.180> gradient<00:02:55.599> I'll<00:02:55.750> be<00:02:55.870> on<00:02:55.959> well<00:02:56.170> it's<00:02:56.290> a

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
I'm not gradient I'll be on well it's a

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.170 
I'm not gradient I'll be on well it's a
little<00:02:56.560> bit<00:02:56.650> okay<00:02:56.950> right<00:02:57.459> okay<00:02:57.760> so<00:02:57.819> what<00:02:58.030> do<00:02:58.120> we

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
little bit okay right okay so what do we

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.800 
little bit okay right okay so what do we
need<00:02:58.269> stage<00:02:58.510> prepare<00:02:58.810> for<00:02:58.959> that<00:03:00.720> where<00:03:01.720> you

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
need stage prepare for that where you

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.339 
need stage prepare for that where you
can<00:03:01.900> look<00:03:02.019> before<00:03:02.170> myself<00:03:02.590> all<00:03:03.459> around<00:03:04.349> does

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
can look before myself all around does

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:19.400 
can look before myself all around does
it<00:03:05.470> say<00:03:05.620> do<00:03:05.829> we<00:03:05.920> need<00:03:06.069> a<00:03:06.099> signal<00:03:06.480> yeah

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.790 

so<00:03:19.830> it's<00:03:20.460> not<00:03:20.580> you<00:03:20.670> take<00:03:21.590> what<00:03:22.590> are<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:22.710> gonna

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
so it's not you take what are you gonna

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.550 
so it's not you take what are you gonna
say

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
say

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:40.980 
say
position<00:03:31.090> is<00:03:32.090> it<00:03:32.209> clear<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.540> go

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.600 

so<00:03:41.350> just<00:03:41.530> shaver<00:03:41.710> and<00:03:41.860> he's<00:03:42.130> off<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.280> gas<00:03:42.460> a

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
so just shaver and he's off the gas a

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:50.360 
so just shaver and he's off the gas a
little<00:03:42.640> bit<00:03:42.820> because<00:03:43.000> there's<00:03:43.210> a<00:03:43.270> car<00:03:43.480> coming

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:04:06.350 

myself<00:03:51.030> asses<00:03:51.510> down<00:03:51.660> this<00:03:51.810> road<00:03:52.080> so<00:03:53.090> yeah

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:17.469 

and<00:04:06.900> abroad<00:04:07.170> very<00:04:07.710> tiny<00:04:08.040> left

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:24.820 

Rhodes

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:39.840 

about<00:04:25.789> now

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.340 

you<00:04:40.850> see<00:04:41.000> any<00:04:41.150> guts<00:04:41.330> coming<00:04:41.660> up<00:04:42.730> not<00:04:43.730> really

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
you see any guts coming up not really

00:04:44.350 --> 00:05:09.290 
you see any guts coming up not really
okay<00:04:46.270> after<00:04:47.270> they<00:04:47.510> screen<00:04:48.190> yeah<00:04:58.930> is<00:04:59.930> it<00:05:00.110> clear

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:26.340 

just<00:05:10.259> maintain<00:05:10.620> that<00:05:13.069> species

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:34.740 

and<00:05:26.770> again

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:59.360 

yo<00:05:35.750> guys

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.320 

I<00:05:59.430> just

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:11.850 

really

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:28.070 

Oh

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.270 

I'm<00:06:28.470> sorry

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:07:18.660 

not

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:18.670 

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.910 

so<00:07:19.670> hopefully<00:07:20.300> that<00:07:21.260> give<00:07:21.380> you<00:07:21.440> an<00:07:21.530> idea<00:07:21.650> of

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:21.920 
so hopefully that give you an idea of

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.670 
so hopefully that give you an idea of
what<00:07:22.160> you<00:07:22.250> might<00:07:22.280> do<00:07:23.170> not<00:07:24.170> perfect<00:07:24.560> by<00:07:24.650> any

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:24.680 
what you might do not perfect by any

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.890 
what you might do not perfect by any
means<00:07:24.890> but<00:07:25.160> just<00:07:25.550> an<00:07:25.910> idea<00:07:26.210> of<00:07:26.390> how<00:07:26.540> you<00:07:26.600> can

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:26.900 
means but just an idea of how you can

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.500 
means but just an idea of how you can
use<00:07:27.230> prompted<00:07:28.010> instruction<00:07:28.490> to<00:07:29.150> find<00:07:29.390> out

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:29.510 
use prompted instruction to find out

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:30.400 
use prompted instruction to find out
what<00:07:29.660> the<00:07:29.750> people<00:07:29.870> is<00:07:30.020> going<00:07:30.110> to<00:07:30.230> do<00:07:30.290> before

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:30.410 
what the people is going to do before

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.230 
what the people is going to do before
they<00:07:30.620> do<00:07:30.800> it<00:07:30.830> assuming<00:07:31.730> that<00:07:31.880> they<00:07:32.000> will<00:07:32.090> have

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 
they do it assuming that they will have

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.750 
they do it assuming that they will have
done<00:07:32.420> various<00:07:33.200> things<00:07:33.290> before<00:07:33.770> my<00:07:34.220> junctions

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:34.760 
done various things before my junctions

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.280 
done various things before my junctions
so<00:07:35.000> they'll<00:07:35.450> know<00:07:35.570> the<00:07:35.690> routines<00:07:36.020> for<00:07:36.200> that

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:36.290 
so they'll know the routines for that

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.510 
so they'll know the routines for that
and<00:07:36.410> you'll<00:07:36.500> establish<00:07:36.620> that<00:07:37.010> before<00:07:37.280> you<00:07:37.340> set

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520 
and you'll establish that before you set

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.310 
and you'll establish that before you set
off<00:07:37.550> and<00:07:38.450> anything<00:07:38.780> that<00:07:38.810> you're<00:07:39.020> not<00:07:39.140> too

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:39.320 
off and anything that you're not too

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.780 
off and anything that you're not too
sure<00:07:39.530> that<00:07:39.800> they've<00:07:40.250> dealt<00:07:40.400> with<00:07:40.520> before<00:07:40.610> you

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:40.790 
sure that they've dealt with before you

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.370 
sure that they've dealt with before you
can<00:07:40.970> just<00:07:41.150> ask<00:07:41.300> have<00:07:41.600> you<00:07:41.630> know<00:07:41.810> around<00:07:42.050> abouts

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:42.380 
can just ask have you know around abouts

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.140 
can just ask have you know around abouts
I<00:07:42.710> meet<00:07:43.010> up<00:07:43.070> with<00:07:43.130> traffic<00:07:43.490> lights<00:07:43.670> and

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:44.150 
I meet up with traffic lights and

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.730 
I meet up with traffic lights and
they'll<00:07:44.360> say<00:07:44.510> yes<00:07:44.690> or<00:07:44.870> no<00:07:44.990> you<00:07:45.440> can<00:07:45.590> then

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:45.740 
they'll say yes or no you can then

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.620 
they'll say yes or no you can then
decide<00:07:45.860> what<00:07:46.640> level<00:07:46.760> of<00:07:46.880> instruction<00:07:47.120> to<00:07:47.450> use

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:47.630 
decide what level of instruction to use

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.020 
decide what level of instruction to use
I'll<00:07:48.260> make<00:07:48.410> a<00:07:48.440> few<00:07:48.620> more<00:07:48.770> videos<00:07:48.890> like<00:07:49.250> this<00:07:49.460> on

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:50.030 
I'll make a few more videos like this on

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.280 
I'll make a few more videos like this on
this<00:07:50.210> technique<00:07:50.540> so<00:07:50.600> that<00:07:50.750> you<00:07:50.900> get<00:07:51.020> a<00:07:51.050> clearer

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:51.290 
this technique so that you get a clearer

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:52.780 
this technique so that you get a clearer
picture<00:07:51.470> of<00:07:51.650> it<00:07:51.860> but<00:07:52.040> I<00:07:52.070> hope<00:07:52.310> that's<00:07:52.520> helped

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:52.790 
picture of it but I hope that's helped

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.810 
picture of it but I hope that's helped
see<00:07:53.450> you<00:07:53.510> next<00:07:53.690> time
