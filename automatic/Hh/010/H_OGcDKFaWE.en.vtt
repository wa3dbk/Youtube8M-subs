00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.689
 we keep in touch at this time with the presence of the cardinal who is attentive 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.630
 to the teachers I register this morning 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.700
 in the metro of santiago scarlett 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.700
 hello how are they doing a day without doing live what is happening here 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.730
 in the subway station the Prince of Wales is at the corner of 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.209
 precisely the street of the same name with tobalaba 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.519
 and you have a few minutes left after 9 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.189
 serious incidents were recorded and because they were stopped two trains 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.310
 on the platform of this prince of wales station 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.770
 and when that is happening and the trains are practically full 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.410
 at the time of entry to work of many people 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.090
 it was you another train hit and unfortunately one of the machines that 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.820
 were installed on the platform the impact was quite violent indeed 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.590
 did not count one of the passengers 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.569
 that four people were injured is an incident 

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:48.660
 that had never happened by a hundred in the subway 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.360
 unofficial information indicate that being and that could be because this 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.700
 machine that entered the antenna at high speed and had not activated the pilot 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.929
 thankfully automatic the driver 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.879
 of this train reached to brake there was quite a lot of smoke inside this 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.010
 Metro station 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.220
 nonetheless reactions of panic percent of the people who did not understand what 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.530
 what was happening we have the testimony 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.760
 was the person who was behind or transfer them immediate issue 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.909
 said life newly climbed lion killings 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.800
 repeat all 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.220
 the prince of wales yes 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.800
 he along with a lot of other people talk there was not a single problem 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.890
 thirty people I calculate that even more than 100 people in it 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.340
 in it the whole train 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.110
 p 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.150
 the vote was quite violent 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.150
 a hit by reach 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.149
 may be hiding the testimony of the person left 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.060
 on the trains I told him there were four injured ones one these people from 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.140
 Eto'o heart problems and you suffer even vomiting 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.670
 two men two women to the injured can take you to a center they do 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.380
 resistance but incentive to the then in which the shock occurs the same 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.740
 line by reach or save the monkeys a head-on collision but 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.929
 this a convoy that reaches another 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.829
 and I understand that the second of both is a convoy that was empty but 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.269
 apparently from the subway station not 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.189
 up to now unofficial information which did not indicate the 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:15.640
 passengers and that it's about the three who were detained 1 entered from behind 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:17.040
 apparently without having 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.930
 activated the autopilot system and that was the one that collided 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.350
 violently the one who was arrested on the platform 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.360
 it would be treated as far as we understand the first clash between two 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.310
 subway trains 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.489
 in two stories 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.040
 is highly did not know how to respond produced that they do not want any 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.980
 accident of this kind in all history 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.170
 well, it's quite curious you imagine art that there has to be a 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.170
 coordination system that apparently 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.970
 At the time this occurs, he reiterated a few minutes after the 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:47.250
 nine in the morning the trains were practically full at least 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:47.890
 that were 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.260
 on the platform some metro executive who has come forward remember that 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.080
 coincidentally this morning you were very close to there 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.960
 p talking with the metro president to renew it says that this 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.640
 procedure for cyclists 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.900
 I wanted to occupy the metropolitan railroad service but m this 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.259
 occurs shortly after nine o'clock in the morning 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:10.469
 is highly positive news makes a promise the president of the 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.429
 directory and by the way that we have now tried to make contact with some 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:15.760
 subway authority do not say that so far will not see 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.430
 official version until ordering things and at that moment in 12 they are going to 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.709
 communicate with the press to say what happened, traveled to the 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.339
 station is illegal the service is suspended 

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:28.569
 By the way, the closed stations will be provided with their rock. The problem is the 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:29.689
 metro line 4 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:33.010
 July a lot of grace until I have faith montoro culture more background 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.509
 good morning
