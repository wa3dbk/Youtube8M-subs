00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.770
 it's the story of a young man who 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.299
 works in the forest and at morning of 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.020
 snow they discover a crane on the 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.299
 side of the road 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.240
 it heals it's bird of birds leaves 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.090
 and late at night a young woman 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.130
 comes knocking on his door and this woman 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.540
 who comes knocking on his door asks him 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.380
 even if he would accept to take it for 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:33.340
 wife he will do it and the cost can 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.440
 live like this here are going to be happy 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.050
 together 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.170
 the couple is quite poor enough needy 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.430
 so she proposes to weave for him 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.559
 she tells us our fans we have 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.019
 woven installs me a loom 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.390
 but especially when I weave 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:50.969
 never look at me three times she goes 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.579
 weave and the fabrics she weaves 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.159
 so reassures more and more beautiful he in 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.199
 will get more and more money and the 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.280
 last time she will be there 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.469
 can not help but go look 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.969
 what is happening behind the wall 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.739
 so she had asked him not 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.310
 do it it seems like it's a 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.380
 old Chinese legend who is who 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.470
 have gone to Japan a few steps and 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.270
 it's part of counting accounts 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.100
 Zen is an extremely fable 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.000
 popular in Japan that really does 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.009
 laugh and cry big and small 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.119
 the project finally is of its seven 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.830
 attempts to succeed in making a 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.970
 because it's still the principle 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.869
 the unit in the circle and the lezennes 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.970
 across multiple disciplines 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.190
 actually that is to say that I this 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.250
 fable age and I want it to be 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.590
 carried by both by the actor by 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.700
 the actors have to find out who is doing 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.619
 the puppet design is here 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.560
 a bello and the musical design of 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.989
 the video work that will be small 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.569
 animated film that is getting 

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:56.789
 imagine it with reveries marzat a 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.250
 dimension also choreographic poetic 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.800
 space and bodies we will do with 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.440
 amelie not late here it's a project 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.729
 plural they actually performers 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.260
 musicians on stage so music 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.440
 which will be played 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.620
 we had recorded music and 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.680
 then also in the dimension of 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.750
 songs of dreamy singing and songs 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.480
 since there will be a dozen or so 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.950
 songs here regarding the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.010
 costume one is at the place of the 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.550
 simplicity of pure milk and at the same time 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.180
 we are on research the contrast 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.480
 because all the spaces 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.510
 scenographic will be white actually my 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.340
 case so at the level of ddd costumes 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.630
 maybe we'll bring some color and 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.270
 I think we will work at 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.640
 costumes on sure probably some 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.920
 dyes are probably things 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.210
 can be painted 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.220
 so we will try through 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.540
 costumes to give something 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.290
 the order of the account that is to say maybe 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.250
 paint 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.110
 here is the bird woman actually is 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.060
 a project quite young public but 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.980
 it's a project also public because 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.620
 that the strength of zen accounts is 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.330
 really it's enlightenment so we need 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.950
 to be awake at any age I believe 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.720
 it is the way of the rightness the 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.060
 lezennes so I think this 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.060
 search for accuracy and for all
