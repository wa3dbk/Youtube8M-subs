00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.929
 we are at the doors of the clinic loving 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.029

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.990
 best guarantees 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.719
 we have been here for seven years 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.510
 established although my career 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.730
 professional for 20 years now but 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.079
 here in particular we were seven and good 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.140
 we can find medical treatments 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:47.829
 aesthetic medical facials of course 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.470

 as a corporal you can find it 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.699
 I suppose in that sense very 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.620
 important what you comment on the last 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.780
 technology because that offers security and 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.949
 customer confidence is not 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.320
 exact we always want 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.810
 offer to our patients 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.110
 the best and for that evidently 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.670
 we have the latest equipment 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.300
 so much to treat at a facial level and to 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.289
 he commented as corporal because the last 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.850
 all which are the main 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.780
 treatments that claim you the 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.030
 clients so far 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.880
 there is everything we want good 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.409
 we try a lot of facial but also 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.000
 we have a lot of body because also in 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.740
 this summer time that comes that 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.540
 we want to be great and they 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.790
 They want to be great because we try 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.399
 the issue of cellulite much flab 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.409
 with or without surgery in the technologies 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.180
 new ones that have gone out without going through a 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.210
 operating room in which we eliminate both the 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.649
 flaccidity like cellulite without subjecting it 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.840
 to a postoperative that that's very 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.729
 important and then at the facial level 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.190
 obviously we all take care of ourselves 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.619
 very much men women every day 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.200
 we have more men fortunately and 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.720
 good at facial level do everything 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.250
 more claim is maybe rejuvenation 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.560
 in terms of wrinkle removal 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.899
 stain removal a little bit 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.460
 replacement of volumes all within 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.700
 what is naturalness with medicine 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.709
 aesthetics I think the most beautiful thing is 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.800
 to see you better without knowing that you have 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.800
 fact 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.799
 the treatments are all 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.599
 custom you can not set a 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.360
 treatment protocol for everyone 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.409
 that 's a mistake then we what 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.959
 first we make a valuation 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:30.150
 medical that's the first thing the first day 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.790
 a medical evaluation we see what they are 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.579
 your goals we set the objectives 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.470
 real and from there we propose a 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.510
 absolutely personalized protocol 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.379
 for that or that patient we have 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.760
 treatment 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:45.299
 obviously there is no treatment 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.579
 eternal but good we have treatments 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.650
 annual we have treatments in which 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.989
 good patients also likes 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.389
 track not expose something 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.920
 for a lifetime but something that everyone 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:59.120
 the years we are going to adapt to the 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.120
 face of a face for example 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.220
 so
