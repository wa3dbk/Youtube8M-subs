You wake up in the morning at camp, and generally
I am the first one out of my swag, and I usually

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:18.090
go over there and I rattle on Simon’s swag
and all I get for him is urghhhh. It’s like

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.050
the mummy from return of the tomb or something.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.170
Anyways so I thought what I would do is knock
him up a bunch of pancakes see if I couldn’t

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.830
get him out of bed with that.
Apparently he’s sleeping in his fancy roof

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.269
top tent here. So if he’s not waking up
by all the noise I’m making! He might wake

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:40.329
up with the smell of some yummy pancakes.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.520
Alright, let’s get this happening. So first
of all to make pancakes from scratch you need

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.479
the ingredients, flour is the first one and
I’m going to stick a bit of milk in there.

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:57.070
So some cream, I am going to make them a bit
flasher. Get a couple of eggs out of the fridge.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.449
I got 2 eggs here, will crack 2 eggs in. Right
a little bit of imitation vanilla essence.

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.280
You can use the real stuff if you want, if
you are feeling rich. But I use the cheap

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.680
stuff. I got a bit of yoghurt here, so I might
slap that in and then I am going to stick

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.280
some sugar in.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:22.940
So we give that a bit of a whip up, alright.
That’s looking really good. Now pans looking

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.789
good too, so I reckon it’s time to get some
mixture in here so, I got this big hefty spoon

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.539
here and I am just going to dollop it in,
and this will give me a good measure, so I

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.509
just go 2 spoons. Oh he should be able to
smell them now. Oi get out of bed you big

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.630
monkey. Get out of bed, you want some pancakes?

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.550
What is going on out here, you are making
a hell of a racket.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.440
Pancakes mate.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.130
Something smells good.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.790
Look at that.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.671
That’s worth getting out of bed for.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.499
Yeah, I’m nearly finished, so go and grab
a seat.

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:02.929
What time did you get up?

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.589
Oh you know, not that early, what time did
you get up that is the question?

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:09.591
Too early.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.620
So we are going to get some mixed berries,
and we are going to drizzle them over the

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:22.409
top, icing sugar here we go. Simon, you ready
for a feed mate.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.262
Stop talking about it, mate, hand it over
here.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.999
Here we go, knife and fork.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.100
I could get used to this, this is what I am
talking about.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:43.780
Give that sucker a whirl buddy. Good? Well
there you go, that simple, good tucker, great

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.329
place, and good mates.
