00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
this is the box so it looks like the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.459 
this is the box so it looks like the
normal<00:00:41.190> box<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:42.059> would<00:00:42.180> think<00:00:42.360> but<00:00:43.260> when<00:00:43.440> I

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
normal box you would think but when I

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.940 
normal box you would think but when I
saw<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.800> tube<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.820> how<00:00:44.969> big<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.390> so

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
looks like this it's kind of hard to

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.819 
looks like this it's kind of hard to
read<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.730> but<00:00:53.730> there<00:00:53.940> we<00:00:54.030> go<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.620> is

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
like this and this is also this is an

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.430 
like this and this is also this is an
extreme<00:02:56.670> black<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.090> got<00:02:57.270> by<00:02:57.390> extreme<00:02:57.690> black<00:02:57.930> so

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
extreme black I got by extreme black so

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.640 
extreme black I got by extreme black so
I'm<00:02:58.770> going<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.010> compare<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.489> colors<00:02:59.820> to<00:03:00.650> so

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
I'm going to compare the colors to so

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.070 
I'm going to compare the colors to so
and<00:03:02.209> if<00:03:03.209> you<00:03:03.299> can't<00:03:03.540> see<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.720> big<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:04.019> a

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
and if you can't see a big of a

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.390 
and if you can't see a big of a
difference<00:03:04.200> that's<00:03:04.650> because<00:03:04.980> there's<00:03:05.220> not

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
difference that's because there's not

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.860 
difference that's because there's not
that<00:03:05.459> big<00:03:05.640> of<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.910> difference<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.420> tell<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:06.720> the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
that big of a difference to tell you the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.670 
that big of a difference to tell you the
truth<00:03:07.080> um<00:03:07.290> I<00:03:08.330> think<00:03:09.330> they<00:03:09.510> are<00:03:09.870> very<00:03:09.900> similar

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
truth um I think they are very similar

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.400 
truth um I think they are very similar
in<00:03:10.950> color<00:03:12.110> so

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.590 

there's<00:03:16.040> kind<00:03:16.340> of<00:03:16.400> a<00:03:16.520> bigger<00:03:16.730> glob<00:03:17.060> Kurt<00:03:17.360> so

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
there's kind of a bigger glob Kurt so

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.180 
there's kind of a bigger glob Kurt so
this<00:03:17.930> is<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.460> high<00:03:19.460> impact<00:03:20.180> on<00:03:21.190> original

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
this is the high impact on original

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.610 
this is the high impact on original
lists<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.580> high<00:03:22.700> impact<00:03:23.120> extreme<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:24.290> doesn't

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
lists the high impact extreme it doesn't

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.750 
lists the high impact extreme it doesn't
matter<00:03:24.740> which<00:03:24.950> lighting<00:03:25.310> I<00:03:25.370> do<00:03:25.430> it<00:03:25.640> with

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
matter which lighting I do it with

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.210 
matter which lighting I do it with
because<00:03:25.940> it's<00:03:26.240> pretty<00:03:26.570> much<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:27.230> same<00:03:27.470> when<00:03:28.190> i

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
because it's pretty much the same when i

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.950 
because it's pretty much the same when i
swatched<00:03:28.550> it<00:03:28.760> in<00:03:28.910> stores<00:03:29.240> it<00:03:29.570> just<00:03:29.810> seemed

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
swatched it in stores it just seemed

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.510 
swatched it in stores it just seemed
like<00:03:30.140> this<00:03:30.290> formulation<00:03:30.830> might<00:03:31.100> be<00:03:31.220> a<00:03:31.250> little

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
like this formulation might be a little

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.970 
like this formulation might be a little
thicker<00:03:32.290> not<00:03:33.290> really<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:33.620> big<00:03:33.830> difference

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
thicker not really a big difference

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.400 
thicker not really a big difference
though<00:03:34.340> with<00:03:34.550> shades<00:03:34.850> it's<00:03:35.120> very<00:03:35.540> very

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
though with shades it's very very

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.010 
though with shades it's very very
unnoticeable<00:03:37.130> so<00:03:37.730> yeah<00:03:38.300> so<00:03:38.570> now<00:03:38.690> I'm<00:03:38.780> gonna

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
unnoticeable so yeah so now I'm gonna

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.820 
unnoticeable so yeah so now I'm gonna
jump<00:03:39.200> into<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:39.530> fun<00:03:39.710> part<00:03:39.950> is<00:03:40.160> comparing<00:03:41.060> them

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
so if wheeze sorry if we zoom in a

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.969 
so if wheeze sorry if we zoom in a
little<00:04:36.430> bit<00:04:36.580> more<00:04:36.970> you<00:04:37.960> can<00:04:37.990> see<00:04:38.169> those<00:04:38.830> are

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
little bit more you can see those are

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
volumize if you go to this one seems a

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.529 
volumize if you go to this one seems a
little<00:04:43.240> bit<00:04:43.479> more<00:04:43.509> natural<00:04:43.930> um<00:04:45.330> yeah<00:04:46.330> there

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
little bit more natural um yeah there

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:50.219 
little bit more natural um yeah there
might<00:04:46.690> be<00:04:46.720> some<00:04:47.020> eyeliners<00:04:47.560> much<00:04:47.889> but<00:04:48.900> that<00:04:49.900> so

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
might be some eyeliners much but that so

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.800 
might be some eyeliners much but that so
let's<00:04:50.440> zoom<00:04:51.009> out<00:04:51.159> and<00:04:51.490> see<00:04:51.550> if<00:04:51.729> you<00:04:51.819> can<00:04:52.000> tell<00:04:52.750> a

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
let's zoom out and see if you can tell a

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.930 
let's zoom out and see if you can tell a
difference<00:04:52.900> but<00:04:53.590> I<00:04:53.800> can<00:04:53.949> really<00:04:54.250> tell<00:04:54.909> that

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
difference but I can really tell that

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.760 
difference but I can really tell that
this<00:04:55.360> one<00:04:55.599> has<00:04:55.900> a<00:04:55.930> little<00:04:56.169> bit<00:04:56.379> more<00:04:56.530> length

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
this one has a little bit more length

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.180 
this one has a little bit more length
definitely<00:04:57.550> more<00:04:57.940> volume<00:04:58.509> and<00:04:58.690> darkness<00:04:59.229> I

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
definitely more volume and darkness I

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.999 
definitely more volume and darkness I
feel<00:05:01.090> like<00:05:01.360> this<00:05:01.599> one<00:05:01.840> is<00:05:01.960> more<00:05:02.199> of<00:05:02.229> a<00:05:02.470> everyday

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:03.009 
feel like this one is more of a everyday

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.700 
feel like this one is more of a everyday
use<00:05:03.610> I<00:05:03.849> should<00:05:04.090> sorry<00:05:04.840> I<00:05:05.080> should<00:05:05.409> zoom<00:05:05.560> out

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
use I should sorry I should zoom out

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.360 
use I should sorry I should zoom out
more<00:05:06.150> so<00:05:07.229> and<00:05:08.229> also<00:05:08.470> there<00:05:08.800> is<00:05:08.889> a<00:05:08.919> price

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
more so and also there is a price

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.930 
more so and also there is a price
difference<00:05:09.610> um<00:05:10.090> it<00:05:10.720> also<00:05:10.900> might<00:05:11.710> almost<00:05:12.550> stop

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
difference um it also might almost stop

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.300 
difference um it also might almost stop

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
this is worth it though I don't know I

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.309 
this is worth it though I don't know I
might<00:05:39.250> be<00:05:39.280> crazy<00:05:39.580> but<00:05:40.020> definitely<00:05:41.020> for<00:05:41.199> those

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:41.319 
might be crazy but definitely for those

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:43.320 
might be crazy but definitely for those
nights<00:05:41.620> out<00:05:41.860> this<00:05:42.400> will<00:05:42.610> definitely<00:05:42.759> work<00:05:43.029> and

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
nights out this will definitely work and

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.999 
nights out this will definitely work and
this<00:05:43.719> was<00:05:43.900> only<00:05:44.020> with<00:05:44.259> a<00:05:44.289> few<00:05:44.529> swipes<00:05:44.740> you

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:45.009 
this was only with a few swipes you

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:46.890 
this was only with a few swipes you
could<00:05:45.130> definitely<00:05:45.250> see<00:05:45.639> the<00:05:45.789> difference<00:05:45.900> more

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
could definitely see the difference more

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.629 
could definitely see the difference more
volume<00:05:47.289> more<00:05:47.469> length<00:05:47.770> with<00:05:48.279> this<00:05:48.430> one

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 
volume more length with this one

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.430 
volume more length with this one
especially<00:05:49.150> if<00:05:49.479> we<00:05:49.599> get<00:05:49.750> the<00:05:49.870> extreme<00:05:50.229> black

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
especially if we get the extreme black

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.800 
especially if we get the extreme black
it<00:05:50.680> definitely<00:05:51.009> sticks<00:05:51.310> out<00:05:51.520> a<00:05:51.729> lot<00:05:52.000> more<00:05:52.210> so

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
it definitely sticks out a lot more so

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.279 
it definitely sticks out a lot more so
yeah<00:05:53.430> that<00:05:54.430> is<00:05:54.460> my<00:05:54.639> comparison<00:05:55.240> kind<00:05:55.900> of<00:05:56.020> slash

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
yeah that is my comparison kind of slash

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.709 
yeah that is my comparison kind of slash
