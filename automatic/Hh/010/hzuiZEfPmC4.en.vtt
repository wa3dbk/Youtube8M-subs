bit done yep
the<00:03:56.010> interesting<00:03:56.220> thing<00:03:56.970> about<00:03:57.000> this<00:03:57.480> game<00:03:57.569> is

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
the interesting thing about this game is

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.520 
the interesting thing about this game is
that<00:03:58.079> um<00:03:58.620> I'm<00:03:59.250> pretty<00:04:00.030> sure<00:04:00.450> it's<00:04:00.780> a<00:04:00.930> direct

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
that um I'm pretty sure it's a direct

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.589 
that um I'm pretty sure it's a direct
sequel<00:04:01.890> we<00:04:02.760> don't<00:04:02.879> need<00:04:02.940> to<00:04:03.060> watch<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.299> replay

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
sequel we don't need to watch the replay

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.750 
sequel we don't need to watch the replay
I'm<00:04:04.140> pretty<00:04:04.379> sure<00:04:04.500> it's<00:04:04.650> a<00:04:04.709> direct<00:04:05.099> sequel<00:04:05.459> to

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
I'm pretty sure it's a direct sequel to

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.380 
I'm pretty sure it's a direct sequel to
the<00:04:06.239> movie<00:04:06.859> Monsters<00:04:07.859> Inc<00:04:08.010> because<00:04:08.370> at<00:04:08.730> the

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
the movie Monsters Inc because at the

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.259 
the movie Monsters Inc because at the
end<00:04:09.420> of<00:04:09.629> the<00:04:09.750> movie<00:04:10.019> Monsters<00:04:10.410> Inc<00:04:11.269> they

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
end of the movie Monsters Inc they

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.080 
end of the movie Monsters Inc they
change<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.169> factory<00:04:13.590> into<00:04:13.889> getting<00:04:14.519> screams

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
change the factory into getting screams

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.310 
change the factory into getting screams
into<00:04:15.540> getting<00:04:15.780> laughter<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.910> here<00:04:17.910> they're

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
into getting laughter and here they're

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.719 
into getting laughter and here they're
getting<00:04:19.320> children's<00:04:19.889> laughter<00:04:20.130> to<00:04:20.519> make

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
getting children's laughter to make

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.930 
getting children's laughter to make
energy<00:04:21.299> out<00:04:21.750> of<00:04:21.930> and<00:04:22.160> I<00:04:23.160> guess<00:04:23.610> that's<00:04:23.820> the

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
energy out of and I guess that's the

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.060 
energy out of and I guess that's the
concept<00:04:24.419> of<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.630> game<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:25.169> throw<00:04:25.440> balls<00:04:25.680> at

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
concept of the game you throw balls at

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.839 
concept of the game you throw balls at
other<00:04:26.400> monsters<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:27.680> you<00:04:28.680> get<00:04:28.889> laughs<00:04:29.340> out<00:04:29.789> of

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
other monsters and you get laughs out of

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:31.670 
other monsters and you get laughs out of
them<00:04:30.150> I<00:04:30.300> guess<00:04:30.539> that's<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:30.900> concept<00:04:31.349> I'm<00:04:31.530> not

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
them I guess that's the concept I'm not

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.339 
them I guess that's the concept I'm not
too<00:04:31.800> sure<00:04:32.720> something<00:04:33.720> else<00:04:33.780> interesting<00:04:34.229> to

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
too sure something else interesting to

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:37.490 
too sure something else interesting to
note<00:04:34.770> about<00:04:35.039> this<00:04:35.430> is<00:04:35.699> that<00:04:36.690> this<00:04:37.020> is<00:04:37.199> I<00:04:37.410> think

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
note about this is that this is I think

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.629 
note about this is that this is I think
the<00:04:37.979> only<00:04:38.010> Monsters<00:04:38.550> Inc<00:04:38.669> game<00:04:40.130> where<00:04:41.130> the

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
the only Monsters Inc game where the

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.159 
the only Monsters Inc game where the

sure this is the only one this is any

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:53.930 
sure this is the only one this is any

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
happen I don't know what I'm supposed to

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:08.689 
happen I don't know what I'm supposed to
do<00:05:07.889> here<00:05:08.039> I<00:05:08.070> think<00:05:08.130> I'm<00:05:08.310> supposed<00:05:08.430> to<00:05:08.580> like

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
do here I think I'm supposed to like

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:12.200 
do here I think I'm supposed to like
block<00:05:09.060> or<00:05:09.270> something<00:05:10.580> are<00:05:11.580> you<00:05:11.729> blocked<00:05:12.060> by

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
block or something are you blocked by

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.810 
block or something are you blocked by
doing<00:05:12.720> that<00:05:12.990> or<00:05:13.260> you<00:05:13.650> can<00:05:13.800> block<00:05:14.039> by<00:05:14.250> doing

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
doing that or you can block by doing

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.100 
doing that or you can block by doing
that<00:05:15.289> there's<00:05:16.289> two<00:05:16.469> forms<00:05:16.710> of<00:05:16.830> blocking<00:05:17.360> the

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
that there's two forms of blocking the

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.610 
that there's two forms of blocking the
to<00:05:19.230> block<00:05:19.500> the<00:05:19.740> blue<00:05:20.310> ones<00:05:20.970> I<00:05:21.300> guess<00:05:21.720> you<00:05:22.080> I

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
to block the blue ones I guess you I

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.140 
to block the blue ones I guess you I
wasn't<00:05:23.010> Padian<00:05:23.310> watch<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.580> cutscene<00:05:23.940> so<00:05:24.120> I

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
wasn't Padian watch the cutscene so I

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.550 
wasn't Padian watch the cutscene so I
don't<00:05:24.360> know<00:05:24.800> how<00:05:26.870> you<00:05:27.870> can't<00:05:28.080> just<00:05:28.260> run<00:05:28.440> away

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
don't know how you can't just run away

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.050 
don't know how you can't just run away
from<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:28.980> balls<00:05:29.430> that's<00:05:29.640> probably<00:05:29.880> what<00:05:30.000> I

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
from the balls that's probably what I

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.300 
from the balls that's probably what I
would<00:05:30.090> suggest<00:05:30.420> doing<00:05:30.690> so<00:05:31.620> just<00:05:31.830> run<00:05:32.100> through

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
would suggest doing so just run through

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.440 
would suggest doing so just run through
these<00:05:32.520> things<00:05:32.700> basically<00:05:33.030> you<00:05:33.150> just<00:05:33.180> have<00:05:33.330> to

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
these things basically you just have to

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.320 
these things basically you just have to
run<00:05:33.660> the<00:05:33.840> timer<00:05:34.230> down<00:05:34.500> there<00:05:34.800> and<00:05:35.220> you<00:05:36.180> never

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
run the timer down there and you never

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.320 
run the timer down there and you never
really<00:05:36.900> use<00:05:37.350> the<00:05:37.530> blocking<00:05:38.010> anyway<00:05:38.400> in<00:05:38.640> proper

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
really use the blocking anyway in proper

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.050 
really use the blocking anyway in proper
gameplay<00:05:39.950> so<00:05:40.950> I<00:05:40.980> don't<00:05:41.190> see<00:05:41.280> what<00:05:41.460> the<00:05:41.580> point

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
gameplay so I don't see what the point

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.610 
gameplay so I don't see what the point
of<00:05:42.270> doing<00:05:42.510> it<00:05:42.720> here<00:05:42.990> is<00:05:43.110> this<00:05:43.230> is<00:05:43.380> just<00:05:43.470> a

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
of doing it here is this is just a

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.360 
of doing it here is this is just a
simulation<00:05:44.190> room<00:05:44.550> so<00:05:44.900> don't<00:05:45.950> really<00:05:46.950> need<00:05:47.220> to

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
simulation room so don't really need to

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.220 
simulation room so don't really need to
do<00:05:47.610> much<00:05:47.820> here<00:05:48.120> just<00:05:48.150> basically<00:05:48.960> gives<00:05:49.140> you<00:05:49.200> a

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
do much here just basically gives you a

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.430 
do much here just basically gives you a
little<00:05:49.530> taster<00:05:49.980> of<00:05:50.010> the<00:05:50.130> gameplay<00:05:50.880> and<00:05:51.350> in<00:05:52.350> the

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
little taster of the gameplay and in the

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.170 
little taster of the gameplay and in the
next<00:05:52.650> part<00:05:52.860> we'll<00:05:52.920> get<00:05:53.130> onto<00:05:53.250> reals<00:05:53.670> kind<00:05:54.090> of

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
next part we'll get onto reals kind of

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.960 
next part we'll get onto reals kind of
stuff<00:05:54.480> but<00:05:54.750> for<00:05:55.050> now<00:05:55.170> we're<00:05:55.440> just<00:05:55.470> going<00:05:55.740> to<00:05:55.770> be

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
stuff but for now we're just going to be

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.550 
stuff but for now we're just going to be
doing<00:05:56.970> this<00:05:57.120> we've<00:05:57.330> got<00:05:57.480> 13<00:05:57.870> seconds<00:05:58.260> left<00:05:58.320> to

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
doing this we've got 13 seconds left to

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.950 
doing this we've got 13 seconds left to
run<00:05:58.680> the<00:05:58.770> clock<00:05:58.920> down<00:05:58.980> ah<00:05:59.430> this<00:06:00.270> game<00:06:00.450> is<00:06:00.660> made

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
run the clock down ah this game is made

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.090 
run the clock down ah this game is made
for<00:06:01.230> the<00:06:01.350> Gamecube<00:06:02.180> it's<00:06:03.180> weird<00:06:03.960> that<00:06:04.320> this<00:06:04.950> is

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
for the Gamecube it's weird that this is

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.960 
for the Gamecube it's weird that this is
the<00:06:05.190> only<00:06:05.280> console<00:06:05.760> it<00:06:05.940> is<00:06:06.560> featured<00:06:07.560> on<00:06:07.970> I'm

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
the only console it is featured on I'm

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.070 
the only console it is featured on I'm
pretty<00:06:09.210> sure<00:06:09.300> it's<00:06:09.450> not<00:06:09.540> on<00:06:09.600> any<00:06:09.840> other

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
pretty sure it's not on any other

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.130 
pretty sure it's not on any other
console<00:06:10.470> um<00:06:10.940> that<00:06:11.940> I<00:06:11.970> can't<00:06:12.480> find<00:06:12.810> on<00:06:13.050> any

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
console um that I can't find on any

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.080 
console um that I can't find on any
other<00:06:13.200> console<00:06:13.740> at<00:06:13.950> least<00:06:14.160> it<00:06:14.730> might<00:06:14.850> be<00:06:15.000> on

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
other console at least it might be on

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.290 
other console at least it might be on
ps2<00:06:15.540> I'm<00:06:15.750> not<00:06:15.870> too<00:06:15.990> sure<00:06:16.190> speechless<00:06:17.220> gosh<00:06:17.820> I'm

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300

ps2 I'm not too sure speechless gosh I'm
speechless<00:06:18.810> and<00:06:19.560> then<00:06:20.190> at<00:06:20.400> the<00:06:20.610> end<00:06:20.640> it<00:06:21.300> shows

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
speechless and then at the end it shows

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.240 
speechless and then at the end it shows
you<00:06:21.690> a<00:06:21.720> little<00:06:21.900> little<00:06:22.380> thing<00:06:22.800> of<00:06:22.890> him<00:06:23.010> dancing

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
you a little little thing of him dancing

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.070 
you a little little thing of him dancing
and<00:06:23.580> that<00:06:23.670> shows<00:06:23.850> your<00:06:24.030> replay<00:06:24.510> don't<00:06:24.840> need<00:06:24.990> to

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
and that shows your replay don't need to

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.600 
and that shows your replay don't need to
watch<00:06:25.230> that<00:06:25.440> because<00:06:25.560> it's<00:06:25.860> an<00:06:25.950> actual<00:06:26.190> replay

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
watch that because it's an actual replay

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.640 
watch that because it's an actual replay
of<00:06:26.760> everything<00:06:27.090> we've<00:06:27.210> just<00:06:27.420> done<00:06:27.630> so<00:06:28.410> I<00:06:28.470> don't

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
of everything we've just done so I don't

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.500 
of everything we've just done so I don't
really<00:06:28.980> need<00:06:29.130> to<00:06:29.250> watch<00:06:29.400> that

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
really need to watch that

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.720 
really need to watch that
checking<00:06:31.170> memory<00:06:31.470> card<00:06:31.680> and<00:06:31.920> it<00:06:31.980> saves<00:06:32.280> after

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:32.730 
checking memory card and it saves after

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.090 
checking memory card and it saves after
everything<00:06:33.300> I<00:06:33.420> can<00:06:33.780> disable<00:06:34.170> the<00:06:34.560> autosave

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.100 
everything I can disable the autosave

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:40.330 
everything I can disable the autosave
feature<00:06:35.460> but<00:06:36.150> ah<00:06:37.370> I<00:06:38.370> probably<00:06:39.360> will<00:06:39.570> actually

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340 
feature but ah I probably will actually

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.550 
feature but ah I probably will actually
so<00:06:41.340> um<00:06:41.910> basically<00:06:42.450> the<00:06:42.960> way<00:06:43.050> this<00:06:43.290> game<00:06:43.530> goes

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
so um basically the way this game goes

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.910 
so um basically the way this game goes
is<00:06:44.010> as<00:06:44.220> levels<00:06:44.670> and<00:06:44.910> then<00:06:45.000> there's<00:06:45.180> five

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:45.920 
is as levels and then there's five

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.550 
is as levels and then there's five
things<00:06:46.920> to<00:06:47.130> do<00:06:47.280> in<00:06:47.430> each<00:06:47.550> level<00:06:48.320> we've<00:06:49.320> done

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560
