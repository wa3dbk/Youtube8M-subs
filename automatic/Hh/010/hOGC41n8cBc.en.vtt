for<00:00:09.430> you<00:00:10.830> these<00:00:11.830> little<00:00:12.100> circuit<00:00:12.400> boards

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.610 
for you these little circuit boards

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.790 
for you these little circuit boards
whatever<00:00:12.850> they<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:14.230> your<00:00:14.380> something<00:00:14.620> negative

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:14.800 
whatever they is your something negative

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.359 
whatever they is your something negative
magnetic<00:00:15.220> or<00:00:15.820> held<00:00:16.119> a<00:00:16.180> little<00:00:16.299> clip<00:00:16.510> here<00:00:16.539> and

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
magnetic or held a little clip here and

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.800 
magnetic or held a little clip here and
these<00:00:18.369> four<00:00:18.609> points<00:00:18.850> I've<00:00:19.119> soldered<00:00:19.300> on<00:00:19.630> both

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
these four points I've soldered on both

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.989 
these four points I've soldered on both
sides<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:21.220> the<00:00:21.249> other<00:00:21.490> side<00:00:21.669> too<00:00:21.820> you'll

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:21.999 
sides so the other side too you'll

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.210 
sides so the other side too you'll
notice<00:00:22.240> this<00:00:22.330> clip<00:00:22.539> down<00:00:22.689> in<00:00:22.869> and<00:00:23.560> this<00:00:24.039> one

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
notice this clip down in and this one

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.989 
notice this clip down in and this one
comes<00:00:24.400> down<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:25.660> here<00:00:26.050> so<00:00:26.259> strips<00:00:26.529> down<00:00:26.999> like

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:27.999 
comes down in here so strips down like

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:31.979 
comes down in here so strips down like
that<00:00:28.300> and<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:31.150> just<00:00:31.210> have<00:00:31.359> to<00:00:31.509> be<00:00:31.599> careful<00:00:31.749> and

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:31.989 
that and you just have to be careful and

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:37.170 
that and you just have to be careful and
just<00:00:34.170> what<00:00:35.170> you're<00:00:35.320> doing<00:00:35.590> here<00:00:36.059> I'm<00:00:37.059> gonna

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
just what you're doing here I'm gonna

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.369 
just what you're doing here I'm gonna
string<00:00:37.420> nothing<00:00:37.690> so<00:00:37.840> I'm<00:00:37.899> just<00:00:38.050> putting<00:00:38.199> on

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
string nothing so I'm just putting on

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.459 
string nothing so I'm just putting on

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
to touch any of the mental circuitry

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.180 
to touch any of the mental circuitry
here<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.940> once<00:01:00.940> it's<00:01:01.149> plugged<00:01:01.300> in<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.920> remind

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
here so once it's plugged in to remind

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.970 
here so once it's plugged in to remind
us<00:01:03.370> plate<00:01:04.030> back<00:01:04.210> here<00:01:04.480> we're<00:01:05.470> looking<00:01:05.740> at<00:01:05.800> here

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
us plate back here we're looking at here

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.649 
us plate back here we're looking at here
this<00:01:06.160> is<00:01:06.220> all<00:01:06.490> wired<00:01:06.820> so<00:01:07.060> be<00:01:07.210> careful<00:01:07.510> not<00:01:07.540> to

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
this is all wired so be careful not to

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.600 
this is all wired so be careful not to
touch<00:01:07.780> anything<00:01:08.020> if<00:01:08.770> you<00:01:08.950> were<00:01:09.009> doing<00:01:09.430> this

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
touch anything if you were doing this

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.210 
touch anything if you were doing this
repair<00:01:10.000> okay<00:01:10.869> both<00:01:11.140> sides<00:01:11.470> are<00:01:11.650> soldered<00:01:11.979> and

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
repair okay both sides are soldered and

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.700 
repair okay both sides are soldered and
solid<00:01:12.700> I'm<00:01:13.420> not<00:01:13.630> going<00:01:13.810> to<00:01:13.960> push<00:01:14.439> down<00:01:14.650> the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
solid I'm not going to push down the

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.069 
solid I'm not going to push down the
plunger<00:01:15.040> here<00:01:15.420> whenever<00:01:16.420> you<00:01:16.630> fall<00:01:16.750> it<00:01:16.900> the

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079 
plunger here whenever you fall it the

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:19.350 
plunger here whenever you fall it the
lever<00:01:17.320> and<00:01:17.560> see<00:01:17.979> if<00:01:18.670> this<00:01:18.790> is<00:01:18.939> some<00:01:19.090> kind<00:01:19.240> of<00:01:19.270> a

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
lever and see if this is some kind of a

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.480 
lever and see if this is some kind of a
magnetic<00:01:19.600> machine<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.920> then<00:01:21.130> contact

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
magnetic machine and then contact

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.230 
magnetic machine and then contact
hopefully<00:01:21.850> it'll<00:01:21.939> look<00:01:23.700> get<00:01:24.700> stained<00:01:25.030> down

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
hopefully it'll look get stained down

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.139 
hopefully it'll look get stained down
and<00:01:25.570> as<00:01:26.380> you<00:01:26.560> can<00:01:26.680> see<00:01:26.950> on<00:01:27.220> me<00:01:27.490> very<00:01:27.729> gentle

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
and as you can see on me very gentle

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.840 
and as you can see on me very gentle
here<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:29.439> tensile<00:01:29.860> like<00:01:29.979> this<00:01:30.130> lit<00:01:30.310> up<00:01:30.399> so<00:01:30.670> and

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
here the tensile like this lit up so and

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.889 
here the tensile like this lit up so and
yeah<00:01:33.850> I<00:01:33.880> feel<00:01:34.060> some<00:01:34.240> heat<00:01:34.270> come<00:01:34.479> on<00:01:34.540> here<00:01:34.719> so

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
yeah I feel some heat come on here so

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.490 
yeah I feel some heat come on here so
it's<00:01:35.020> working<00:01:35.200> let's<00:01:36.189> try<00:01:36.399> the<00:01:36.460> other<00:01:36.549> one<00:01:37.500> and

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
it's working let's try the other one and

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.050 
it's working let's try the other one and
put<00:01:38.680> still<00:01:38.920> carefully<00:01:39.280> not<00:01:39.430> touch<00:01:39.640> on<00:01:39.820> unit

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
put still carefully not touch on unit

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.020 
put still carefully not touch on unit
electronics<00:01:40.570> here<00:01:41.130> bottom<00:01:42.130> lay<00:01:42.280> down<00:01:42.460> and<00:01:42.759> go

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
electronics here bottom lay down and go

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.139 
electronics here bottom lay down and go
to<00:01:43.090> them<00:01:43.240> a<00:01:43.299> lit<00:01:43.450> up<00:01:43.540> as<00:01:44.140> you<00:01:44.380> can<00:01:44.500> see

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
to them a lit up as you can see

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.249 
to them a lit up as you can see
okay<00:01:46.149> I'm<00:01:46.270> gonna<00:01:46.390> unplug<00:01:46.659> this<00:01:46.899> now<00:01:47.049> so

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
okay I'm gonna unplug this now so

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.010 
okay I'm gonna unplug this now so
that'll<00:01:47.439> cancel<00:01:47.680> automatically

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
that'll cancel automatically

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.410 
that'll cancel automatically
oh<00:01:51.869> okay<00:01:52.869> that's<00:01:53.229> a<00:01:53.820> probably<00:01:54.820> a<00:01:54.909> problem<00:01:55.149> that

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
oh okay that's a probably a problem that

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.139 
oh okay that's a probably a problem that
you<00:01:55.600> may<00:01:55.780> have<00:01:56.049> and<00:01:56.380> now<00:01:56.770> you<00:01:56.829> know<00:01:57.100> how<00:01:57.970> it<00:01:58.119> can

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
you may have and now you know how it can

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.859 
you may have and now you know how it can
be<00:01:58.420> fixed<00:01:58.830> of<00:01:59.830> course<00:01:59.950> you<00:02:00.220> have<00:02:00.369> to<00:02:00.460> take<00:02:00.490> off

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
be fixed of course you have to take off

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.810 
be fixed of course you have to take off
