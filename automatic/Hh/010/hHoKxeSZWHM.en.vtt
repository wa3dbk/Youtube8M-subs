 Call me from adolfo's office if you

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.800

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.550

 Of course, cutting the ball is a request for 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.379
 Justice 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.710

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:53.949

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.750
 creek 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.120
 It also pretends surely that if I 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.839
 I dedicate to this and I think I'm going to have it 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.640
 almost last on my list look I do not 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:11.320
 obviously I'm not a technician 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.869
 obviously I know that I run against 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:19.090
 Thoroughbred horse I know a horse 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:21.789
 Creole dress as you saw but what 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.850
 only one that asked me to return the horse 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.770
 perspired that is going to be the strongest 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.759
 yours and you go through the neighborhoods are in 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.960
 contraction if I'm a stray dog 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.460
 I'm going to go out to dry, which is the place 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.460
 where I feel most comfortable 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.060
 to the idol market brass and lists the 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.030
 painful goal of bastia asaja already in the 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.539
 second time minute 6 strong shot of 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.539
 adrián bastía 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.690
 Oh 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.330
 de rafaela pulled and zaha take off fast 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.560
 from the arch adrián bastía symbolist 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.710
 with the archer and said everything asaja 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.140
 castilla this comes from before I do not know 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.710
 let's say the lips 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.710
 no no no no 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.730
 not only when winning 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.600
 in football it happens the same as I have 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.600
 great care 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.630
 yes no picard and keeps itching friends 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:34.530
 about alicardi I already said to me I did not 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:38.520
 It seems that the extra-soccer thing is a 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.940
 impediment if they ask me if that 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.790
 type of exposure is to my liking or not 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.110
 obviously not to my liking but not 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.110
 I do not rule it out at all 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.370
 can not miss my inter the order of 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.370
 live rock 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.310
 provoke 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.000
 the wrath 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.000
 place 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.810
 tell me who praises you that endorsed lowell 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.790
 justicialista drinking from mauri indicated 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.110
 the band in the justicialismo but without 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.849
 However, his bench did not support the 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.810
 nationalization of the arts jp and 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:29.030
 pepperoni argentinas prepaid law 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.260
 assisted fertilization because 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.090
 exactly we are not we are not of 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.500
 agreement with the bad implementations 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.209
 what they have done in each case is a 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.950
 absolute contradiction between defending the 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.470
 justicialistas flag and these votes is 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.440
 we have social justice the equity of 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:47.519
 equal opportunity does not pass through 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:50.329
 Abuses and confiscation is a slogan 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.329
 this the justicialismo 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.500
 because a reunion of the 90 was with 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:02.040
 macri nearby did not see it 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.750
 for health care do not like it 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.940
 more than an old friend I was happy 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.310
 much the support that Reutemann is 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.250
 giving cordial macri which he liked 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.120
 that but because I think macri has the 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.519
 best team 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.510
 It has also shown very good capacity 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.320
 of management 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.510
 I see how macri's advantage is that the 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.030
 team that you have is a team of people 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.880
 very capable to remove the withholdings of 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.190
 Mauricio to be president in writing 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.020
 in writing and how will you finance the 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.770
 universal assignment for example without 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.770
 those income 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.740
 administering well does not mean adjustment 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.449
 of your administration to reduce spending 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.520
 well what we have to do is 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.139
 lower costs lower costs and 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.240
 wages at a cost plus and wages 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.740
 they are a cost more registering well not 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.000
 means adjustment is administration 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.000
 reduce the expense while being well
