00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.929
 hello everybody, I'm a doctor, alexandre lima 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.960
 I'm a doctor, I'm in love with 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.299
 dermatology and I am dedicated to 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.180
 beauty and the harmony of your skin 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.520
 I'm going to talk to you today about the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.890
 botulinum toxin and how it 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.230
 not be applied in the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.359
 our old she will call the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:33.000
 specific receptors by preventing the 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.640
 transmission from the neuron to the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.190
 some blame you run with it that 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.190
 muscle will not move by getting 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.020
 so more relaxed and how it is done so 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.180
 the procedure of application of botox 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.570
 The first step will be to go through a 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.960
 medical evaluation where he is a 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.850
 he will do an evaluation 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.170
 your skin from your 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.300
 need 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.820
 after this evaluation the doctor will 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.229
 make the application itself is 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.010
 injection of the substance into the 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.170
 your skin 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.000
 some patients may feel a 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.310
 uncomfortable a little pain 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.189
 and in these cases we have resources like 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.350
 already in this top disk or ice application 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.180
 to decrease this sensitivity 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.210
 many report that it is a similar pain 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.530
 to take in salt so over varies 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.530
 person to person 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.229
 after applying the effect starts with 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.119
 about two to five days 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.670
 Now I want to talk to you both. 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.070
 main directions of the botox 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.229
 are for the treatment of 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.409
 wrinkles, especially in the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.110
 tests in the region between the eyebrows is 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.290
 in the region around the eyes to the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.659
 treatment of me and the crow's feet 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:57.000
 but we also have other techniques to 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.560
 treatment of hypertrophy of a certain 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.170
 bruxism 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.320
 we have techniques for applying to 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.810
 gingival smile is to have a 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.649
 My name is nefertiti and it's to help. 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.160
 to redefine the contour of the mandible 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.580
 we have 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.220
 also the indication for migraine and 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.980
 also for hyperhidrosis that is sweat 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.180
 and is an excellent technique for 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.710
 this indication 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.170
 now I'm going to leave to answer 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.160
 some frequent doubts in our 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.380
 clinic 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.100
 the first question is how long the 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.810
 botox 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.510
 I already said this a little before but I 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.670
 I would like to repeat here botox it lasts 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.370
 around three to four months in your 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.010
 full effect when the 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.680
 to lose some of its effectiveness and to 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.950
 six months we no longer have the effect of it 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.080
 then the indication of a 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.780
 new application for those people who 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.810
 want to keep it always done 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.990
 This leads us to the second doubt that is 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.360
 when the effect passes the face gets worse 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.770
 than before the answer is not the 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.850
 face does not get worse 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:09.060
 He looks the same was before or even better. 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.040
 hit what happens is simply a 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.670
 restoration of that contraction 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.010
 muscular 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.340
 its use remains the same as the third 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.650
 doubt is whether there is any risk in 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.530
 botox application if I'm going to stay with 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.040
 an all taste paralyzed I'm going to stay 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.680
 crooked is a very pertinent doubt that 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.570
 It is important if there are risks it is a 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.959
 medical procedure which must be 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.390
 performed by a trained physician it will 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.850
 make a detailed assessment of the choice 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.800
 of points it is very important all this 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.170
 process is important is not simply 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.910
 come and apply the fourth doubt says 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.940
 respect the contraindications of botox 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.010
 few are it is contraindicated in the 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.340
 pregnant women is contraindicated in people 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.080
 who are allergic to the product is clear and 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.810
 is contraindicated in situations where 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.270
 there is an infection on the site to be applied 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.250
 the fifth doubt is who can apply 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.489
 botox from what age I can 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.820
 apply botox to anyone principle 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:11.520
 You can use it if you indicated it today. 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.790
 for example there are people who have already 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.910
 have more young people applying from 20 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.489
 and 25 years and 30 years 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.739
 prevention to a slightly older age 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.950
 matured for the treatment of 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:28.340
 expression and prefer ozzy any age 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.590
 We also have adolescents applying 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.020
 bronze case and a great indication 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.730
