00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.730 

the<00:00:02.850> best<00:00:03.090> thing<00:00:03.449> about<00:00:03.659> distance<00:00:04.620> learning

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
the best thing about distance learning

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.660 
the best thing about distance learning
for<00:00:05.310> me<00:00:05.490> was<00:00:06.210> that<00:00:06.720> it<00:00:07.020> was<00:00:07.109> very<00:00:07.170> flexible<00:00:07.670> so

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
for me was that it was very flexible so

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.089 
for me was that it was very flexible so
I<00:00:08.940> can<00:00:09.269> kind<00:00:09.510> of<00:00:09.570> make<00:00:09.780> it<00:00:09.809> my<00:00:10.139> own<00:00:10.170> enabled<00:00:11.010> me

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
I can kind of make it my own enabled me

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.330 
I can kind of make it my own enabled me
to<00:00:11.130> navigate<00:00:11.880> through<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.690> find<00:00:13.290> my<00:00:13.980> path

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
to navigate through and find my path

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.490 
to navigate through and find my path
it's<00:00:14.849> given<00:00:15.480> me<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.660> chance<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:16.260> challenge

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
it's given me a chance to challenge

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.830 
it's given me a chance to challenge
myself<00:00:16.890> because<00:00:17.699> normally<00:00:18.270> when<00:00:18.420> you're<00:00:18.630> sort

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
of working in the field you get very

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.630 
of working in the field you get very
focused<00:00:21.600> on<00:00:21.779> small<00:00:22.199> details<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:23.039> what<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
focused on small details and what the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.939 
focused on small details and what the
University<00:00:24.240> course<00:00:24.480> that<00:00:24.689> has<00:00:24.840> been<00:00:24.949> enabling

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
University course that has been enabling

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.620 
University course that has been enabling
is<00:00:26.250> really<00:00:26.699> helping<00:00:27.000> me<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.210> see<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.449> big

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
is really helping me to see the big

is really helping me to see the big
picture<00:00:27.660> it's<00:00:28.470> just<00:00:28.529> giving<00:00:28.920> me<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.359> massive

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
picture it's just giving me a massive

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.500 
picture it's just giving me a massive
boost<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.840> confidence<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.610> my<00:00:32.969> ability

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
boost of confidence in in in my ability

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.090 
boost of confidence in in in my ability
because<00:00:33.660> always<00:00:34.079> thought<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.739> had<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.010> be

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
because always thought you had to be

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.770 
because always thought you had to be
really<00:00:35.340> really<00:00:35.550> clever<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.000> do<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> master's

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
really really clever to do a master's

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.479 
really really clever to do a master's
degree<00:00:36.809> but<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.320> don't<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.950> just<00:00:38.129> have<00:00:38.340> to

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
degree but you don't you just have to

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.240 
degree but you don't you just have to
work<00:00:38.820> hard<00:00:41.780> right<00:00:42.780> at<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.960> very<00:00:42.989> beginning<00:00:43.590> it

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
work hard right at the very beginning it

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.549 
work hard right at the very beginning it
was<00:00:44.520> mad<00:00:44.760> panic<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.360> hadn't<00:00:45.750> studied<00:00:45.930> for<00:00:46.200> ten

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
was mad panic I hadn't studied for ten

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.760 
was mad panic I hadn't studied for ten
years<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:47.160> received<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:48.510> module<00:00:48.899> material<00:00:49.500> and

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
years I received the module material and

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.549 
years I received the module material and
a<00:00:50.489> textbook<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.180> thick<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.840> thought<00:00:52.079> what

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
a textbook this thick and I thought what

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.189 
a textbook this thick and I thought what
have<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.949> got<00:00:53.219> myself<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.449> work<00:00:54.690> that

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
have I got myself in for the work that

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.290 
have I got myself in for the work that
you<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.739> do<00:00:55.949> for<00:00:56.579> each<00:00:56.699> module

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
you have to do for each module

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.689 
you have to do for each module
I<00:00:57.480> think<00:00:57.809> averaged<00:00:58.199> out<00:00:58.410> at<00:00:58.590> about<00:00:58.680> 12<00:00:59.309> hours<00:00:59.520> a

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
I think averaged out at about 12 hours a

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.760 
I think averaged out at about 12 hours a
week<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.420> modules<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.930> were<00:01:01.379> said<00:01:01.620> at<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
week the modules that were said at the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.979 
week the modules that were said at the
beginning<00:01:01.949> was<00:01:02.789> set<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.149> quarterly<00:01:03.480> chunks

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
beginning was set in quarterly chunks

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.990 
beginning was set in quarterly chunks
and<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.229> was<00:01:04.379> good<00:01:04.710> for<00:01:04.890> me<00:01:05.040> because<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.790> could

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
and that was good for me because I could

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.420 
and that was good for me because I could
quite<00:01:06.420> easily<00:01:06.450> plan<00:01:07.140> how<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.680> was<00:01:07.950> going<00:01:08.159> to

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
quite easily plan how I was going to

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.280 
quite easily plan how I was going to
tackle<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.119> module<00:01:09.479> across<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> three-month

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
tackle a module across a three-month

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.800 
tackle a module across a three-month
period<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.920> think<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.400> begin<00:01:11.520> with<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.180> was<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.570> bit

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
period I think to begin with I was a bit

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.870 
period I think to begin with I was a bit
of<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.020> last<00:01:13.470> minute<00:01:13.860> cramming<00:01:14.040> which<00:01:14.400> really

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
of a last minute cramming which really

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.179 
of a last minute cramming which really
didn't<00:01:15.299> sit<00:01:15.630> comfortably<00:01:16.110> with<00:01:16.229> me<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.799> so

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
didn't sit comfortably with me and so

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.920 
didn't sit comfortably with me and so
the<00:01:17.310> best<00:01:17.490> way<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.090> worked<00:01:18.330> for<00:01:18.450> me<00:01:18.659> was<00:01:18.869> I

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
the best way that it worked for me was I

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.260 
the best way that it worked for me was I
started<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.500> come<00:01:19.650> into<00:01:19.799> work<00:01:20.130> at<00:01:20.490> 6<00:01:20.729> a.m.<00:01:20.939> and

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
started to come into work at 6 a.m. and

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.210 
started to come into work at 6 a.m. and
I<00:01:21.630> thought<00:01:21.750> if<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.020> come<00:01:22.229> into<00:01:22.380> work<00:01:22.590> at<00:01:22.770> 6<00:01:23.009> a.m.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
I thought if I come into work at 6 a.m.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.730 
I thought if I come into work at 6 a.m.
and<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.970> work<00:01:24.150> through<00:01:24.509> till<00:01:24.780> 8<00:01:24.930> a.m.<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.409> my

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
and I work through till 8 a.m. on my

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.170 
and I work through till 8 a.m. on my
studies<00:01:26.130> then<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.700> would<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.970> better

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
studies then that would be a better

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.149 
studies then that would be a better
solution<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.810> as<00:01:27.900> soon<00:01:28.110> as<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.380> cracked<00:01:28.740> when

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
solution and as soon as I cracked when

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.280 
solution and as soon as I cracked when
was<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.460> best<00:01:29.670> time<00:01:29.970> for<00:01:30.000> me<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.540> learn<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:31.110> all

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
was the best time for me to learn it all

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.840 
was the best time for me to learn it all
fell<00:01:31.500> into<00:01:31.650> place<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.430> as<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.670> go<00:01:32.820> through

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
fell into place and as you go through

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.450 
fell into place and as you go through
you<00:01:33.479> start<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.049> plan<00:01:34.350> your<00:01:34.590> study<00:01:34.710> around<00:01:35.250> your

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
you start to plan your study around your

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.210 
you start to plan your study around your
life<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.939> as<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.659> moves<00:01:36.990> towards<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.740> end<00:01:37.890> of

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
life and as it moves towards the end of

life and as it moves towards the end of
the<00:01:38.640> module<00:01:38.820> if<00:01:39.180> you're<00:01:39.329> playing<00:01:39.600> correctly

the module if you're playing correctly

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.929 
the module if you're playing correctly
you<00:01:40.350> don't<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.860> complain<00:01:41.549> your<00:01:41.759> life

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
you don't have to complain your life

you don't have to complain your life
around<00:01:42.210> your<00:01:42.420> study
