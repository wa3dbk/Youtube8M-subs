00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:38.069 

now<00:00:31.070> I'm<00:00:31.220> gonna<00:00:31.340> add<00:00:31.550> half<00:00:31.880> of<00:00:32.029> my<00:00:32.150> flour

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.799 

I<00:00:38.640> added<00:00:39.640> the<00:00:39.730> flower<00:00:39.969> in<00:00:40.179> two<00:00:40.359> batches<00:00:40.539> just

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.779 
I added the flower in two batches just
to<00:00:41.199> make<00:00:41.350> sure<00:00:41.559> it's<00:00:41.769> extra<00:00:42.010> well<00:00:42.489> mixed

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
together but you probably don't really

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.939

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
it will start to come together into a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.530 
it will start to come together into a
nice<00:00:58.110> ball<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.040> you<00:00:59.670> can<00:00:59.820> add<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.970> little<00:01:00.270> more

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
flour if it doesn't quite get there

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.990 
flour if it doesn't quite get there
