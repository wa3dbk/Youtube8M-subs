from zipping it up you know from about
here<00:03:31.620> up<00:03:31.860> it<00:03:32.070> was<00:03:32.280> quite<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.790> tight<00:03:33.210> fit<00:03:33.540> but<00:03:33.720> I

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
here up it was quite a tight fit but I

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.950 
here up it was quite a tight fit but I
was<00:03:34.050> able<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.470> get<00:03:34.740> them<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:35.010> up<00:03:35.160> all<00:03:35.520> the<00:03:35.580> way

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
was able to get them it up all the way

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.450 
was able to get them it up all the way
especially<00:03:37.380> after<00:03:37.470> loosening<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.130> buckles

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
especially after loosening the buckles

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.640 
especially after loosening the buckles
back<00:03:38.670> here<00:03:38.940> now<00:03:39.360> they<00:03:39.690> do<00:03:39.750> have<00:03:39.990> a<00:03:40.260> little<00:03:40.500> bit

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
back here now they do have a little bit

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.920 
back here now they do have a little bit
of<00:03:40.920> a<00:03:41.160> stay<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.790> look<00:03:41.970> mainly<00:03:42.390> because<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.870> think

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
of a stay to look mainly because I think

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.960 
of a stay to look mainly because I think
of<00:03:43.170> how<00:03:43.320> tight<00:03:43.650> they<00:03:43.860> are<00:03:43.890> but<00:03:44.670> it's<00:03:44.880> a

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
of how tight they are but it's a

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.180 
of how tight they are but it's a
material<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:45.660> I'm<00:03:45.750> really<00:03:46.320> hoping<00:03:46.710> it<00:03:47.010> does

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
material that I'm really hoping it does

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.100 
material that I'm really hoping it does
feel<00:03:47.460> like<00:03:47.490> it's<00:03:47.790> going<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.150> stretch<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.870> I

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
feel like it's going to stretch and I

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.420 
feel like it's going to stretch and I
just<00:03:49.320> love<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.590> color<00:03:49.800> and<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.100> think<00:03:50.310> they

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
just love the color and I think they

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.970 
just love the color and I think they
still<00:03:50.700> look<00:03:51.570> really<00:03:52.110> great<00:03:52.260> I<00:03:52.500> love<00:03:52.740> how<00:03:52.860> they

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
still look really great I love how they

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.470 
still look really great I love how they
look<00:03:53.010> from<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.400> back<00:03:53.520> actually<00:03:54.150> with<00:03:54.300> these

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
buckles it was exciting for me I rarely

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.920 
buckles it was exciting for me I rarely

rarely rarely can find zip up boots that

actually go all the way up these are

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.250 
actually go all the way up these are
legitimate<00:04:02.820> white<00:04:03.180> calves<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.870> fact<00:04:04.080> that

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
legitimate white calves the fact that

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.030 
legitimate white calves the fact that
they<00:04:04.430> did<00:04:05.430> fit<00:04:05.850> my<00:04:06.360> cat<00:04:06.750> so<00:04:07.020> overall<00:04:07.380> I<00:04:07.560> was

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
they did fit my cat so overall I was

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.310 
they did fit my cat so overall I was
somewhat<00:04:08.790> pleased<00:04:09.150> with<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.540> boots<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:10.080> fact

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
somewhat pleased with the boots the fact

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.770 
somewhat pleased with the boots the fact
that<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.980> Shan<00:04:11.220> style<00:04:11.700> zips<00:04:12.240> up<00:04:12.420> all<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.660> way

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
that the Shan style zips up all the way

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.090 
that the Shan style zips up all the way
was<00:04:13.280> such<00:04:14.280> a<00:04:14.310> thrill<00:04:14.990> and<00:04:15.990> I'm<00:04:16.620> really<00:04:16.859> hoping

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
was such a thrill and I'm really hoping

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.800 
was such a thrill and I'm really hoping
that<00:04:17.310> they<00:04:17.489> both<00:04:17.609> stretches<00:04:18.120> just<00:04:18.450> to<00:04:18.570> fit

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
that they both stretches just to fit

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.719 
that they both stretches just to fit
slightly<00:04:19.710> better<00:04:19.859> I<00:04:20.130> do<00:04:20.250> you<00:04:20.520> wish<00:04:20.700> that

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
slightly better I do you wish that

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.700 
slightly better I do you wish that
JustFab<00:04:21.330> had<00:04:21.600> a<00:04:21.630> measurement<00:04:21.989> for<00:04:22.260> each<00:04:22.440> size

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
JustFab had a measurement for each size

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.150 
JustFab had a measurement for each size
that<00:04:23.100> would<00:04:23.190> be<00:04:23.250> really<00:04:23.580> nice

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
that would be really nice

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.760 
that would be really nice
I<00:04:24.220> was<00:04:24.670> hoping<00:04:24.820> that<00:04:24.970> you<00:04:25.180> know<00:04:25.440> s7<00:04:26.440> is<00:04:26.560> one

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
I was hoping that you know s7 is one

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.290 
I was hoping that you know s7 is one
size<00:04:27.010> down<00:04:27.220> so<00:04:27.550> I<00:04:27.580> was<00:04:27.700> hoping<00:04:27.970> it<00:04:28.120> would<00:04:28.270> be

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
size down so I was hoping it would be

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.720 
size down so I was hoping it would be
closer<00:04:28.720> to<00:04:28.870> 16<00:04:29.350> inches<00:04:29.650> I<00:04:29.860> think<00:04:30.250> these<00:04:30.670> are

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
closer to 16 inches I think these are

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.210 
closer to 16 inches I think these are
probably<00:04:31.240> around<00:04:31.810> 15<00:04:32.530> or<00:04:32.680> 15<00:04:33.010> and<00:04:33.130> a<00:04:33.190> half

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
probably around 15 or 15 and a half

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.640 
probably around 15 or 15 and a half
which<00:04:33.580> is<00:04:33.730> why<00:04:33.910> they<00:04:34.060> fit<00:04:34.300> so<00:04:34.540> snug<00:04:34.840> the<00:04:35.320> only

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
which is why they fit so snug the only

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.470 
which is why they fit so snug the only
suggestion<00:04:36.010> I<00:04:36.190> can<00:04:36.220> make<00:04:36.490> it<00:04:36.640> to<00:04:36.760> JustFab<00:04:37.120> is

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
suggestion I can make it to JustFab is

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.500 
suggestion I can make it to JustFab is
to<00:04:38.380> provide<00:04:39.040> measurements<00:04:39.610> at<00:04:40.030> the<00:04:40.210> top<00:04:40.390> of

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
to provide measurements at the top of

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.450 
to provide measurements at the top of
the<00:04:40.570> boot<00:04:40.810> for<00:04:41.260> each<00:04:41.560> size<00:04:41.890> that<00:04:42.250> would<00:04:42.370> be

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
the boot for each size that would be

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.160 
the boot for each size that would be
really<00:04:42.760> really<00:04:42.790> helpful<00:04:43.150> I<00:04:43.600> don't<00:04:43.990> know<00:04:44.080> about
