 that you guys the second episode of 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.540
 new series of the institute such is that I 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.670
 I decided to leave the same map name 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.980
 crowd was good because I thought it would 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.260
 I am launched myself there more or less right 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.520
 but until it became cool and good staff 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.900
 Here's the second episode I think 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.250
 that will only last about ten minutes 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.780
 Because I asked you to comment on the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.930
 first episode that the feedback was 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.150
 Simply fantastic type was 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.650
 fantastic feedback from you was 800 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.199
 light was not I said that if I had 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.360
 400 or 500 would be very good but it has 800 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.190
 almost double the 400 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.809
