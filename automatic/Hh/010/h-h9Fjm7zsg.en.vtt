00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:08.230
 hi with you slayer 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.800
 I welcome you in a small 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:15.400
 t-34 tank manual 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:18.880
 as you know those 34 this is essentially 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.759
 same t-34 that the advice but with 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.009
 some changes so to us 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:26.140
 unavailable top Soviet cannon 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.349
 so us kitty easier 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.439
 she has armor on paper 112 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:35.680
 and she sodkaliber in mince 189 have earlier 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.579
 with a small 85 damage as 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.929
 you understand it quite a bit 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.210
 nato rate of fire good twenty 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:46.510
 six shots of minutes that is dpm is very 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.539
 even decent and the tips have a gun 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.609
 which is much more than a year 115 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.850
 points of damage you need to punch it goldie 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:57.429
 a bit simpler the date gives homework 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.350
 you about the euro and our basic time to beat and 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:02.379
 opening is not always enough so I 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.809
 I drive 36 sub-caliber shells 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.570
 shells of steel speaking costs 7 units 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.970
 Golda each that is if you will 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.250
 shoot gold then go-ahead of course 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.930
 will not work despite the fact that it is 5 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.820
 level they must farm very much 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:21.910
 not bad here is such a small situation 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.040
 while I buy I stand on lasville 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:28.150
 us lady these points on which allows 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.940
 highlight 10 pieces shot on the ball 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.380
 alpha went a little less than face value 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.380
 actually nothing wrong with that 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.760
 struck it very nice all the same 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.190
 the distance is a big break through like me 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.300
 spoke 112 slight breaking through think 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.610
 went bang 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.040
 bill as you see 14 i think you 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.480
 guess what it all goes because 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.870
 that your hands will have to try 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.760
 haul this fight 10 to 30 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:57.460
 stock shoot back but unfortunately 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:59.350
 I serve the wall and so what if 34 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.890
 she has a good engine as much as 500 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.050
 horses 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.050
 which gives us a power supply 17 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.510
 horses per ton that is and. quite myself 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.390
 vigorous especially in the background for example from 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.090
 panther type pawns which is from many 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.130
 engine do not want more and but will become 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.480
 just so many speakers 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.810
 Of course there is closer to the weight 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.750
 while I lead the classic defense maneuver 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.300
 that is, I hold my gut while I am going to 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.570
 shoot it with greed by dark hours 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.350
 shot without glasses well actually 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.320
 patients 4 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.670
 not heavily armored but for whom 4 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.700
 will have of course to switch to 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.100
 gold now shot on the ball 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.990
 suddenly again about damn well of course not 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.930
 punching I switch to sabreaders 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.710
 because on them fellow t-34 there 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:52.600
 ends but the task I ask q-1 and 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:56.290
 actually almost burned out perfectly 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.410
 account, meanwhile, 49 in my account 700 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.850
 858 damage is a lot of you after all 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.500
 Level 5 and with such an account usually 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.900
 Understand the homework fails 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.760
 but here it seems to be more or less everything goes 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.920
 well well, if that, and the fact that we 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.670
 thoroughly so project take care of this fight 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.730
 continue to learn homework in their own way 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.650
 dogs type t-34 let's a little bit 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.110
 talk about the crew got us there still 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.970
 little time in this fight and so 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.680
 the crew is standard four people 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.710
 and the commander performs at the same time 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.950
 functions 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:34.040
 boy and I already noticed here that we 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.620
 fatal drain three pshki rashad truth and 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.660
 helps and will try accordingly 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.730
 do something then there may be 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:45.890
 here i had an idea to go love 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:47.660
 arthur he does not interfere with four oh ok I his 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.120
 I remove all the same 4 I choose this 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.880
 The problem though I have mine as you can see 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.910
 four pieces but i dont use 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:59.390
 6:12 we have these three cars already 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:02.270
 900 damage and how do you understand this fight 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.490
 drag but very very problematic but 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.490
 it is not so important now I have a task 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.020
 very easy to kill artillery 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.960
 because artillery is evil 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.960
 she must suffer especially if 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.910
 then someone else will play on 261 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.400
 object that gets from the guard 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.580
 it is therefore better for Arthur 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:26.300
 what to harvest note that the enemy has 34 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.070
 I'm on the run shoot feat well 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.900
 accordingly, I am already hiding behind 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.270
 At home, your task is I do not 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.910
 stop drawing becoming like you 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.990
 going to three arta 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.150
 guaranteed to air because 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.640
 all very fat can listen to me 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.770
 easily and accordingly I try 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.050
 make this new answers here a lot 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.229
 I pay the bill between 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.349
 very tired 912 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:55.810
 but I am ready to do such want to become 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:58.720
 a challenge is not so much a challenge as but 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.870
 cleans a ride on the nkida anyone such dior 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.419
 and recommends seizure for 4 frags battle 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.419
 coming to an end and let's recap 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.520
 what is the type of t-34 of that hole and rush 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.909
 Level 5 I'm certainly not the best 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.979
 groups with because good haircut 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:17.020
 enjoyable i mean play her king 3 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.389
 especially since the players are not to face for a long time 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.580
 here as you can see I managed to get the word 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.379
 frags before the capture of the base to get the most 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.469
 warrior and another paskuchchi medal 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:28.330
 actually see with you the result as 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:30.669
 you see the result is just gorgeous stuffed 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.690
 1800 damage on level five is 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.330
 lots and lots 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:37.000
 plus received a warrior paskuchchi medal and 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.280
 masters on this strictly speaking all 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.870
 play on type t-34
