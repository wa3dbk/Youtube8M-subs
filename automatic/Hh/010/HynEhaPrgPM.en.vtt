the letters say it was an NDB you're
headed<00:01:06.200> to<00:01:06.229> to<00:01:06.920> get<00:01:07.100> there<00:01:07.310> if<00:01:07.520> I<00:01:07.640> go<00:01:07.670> in<00:01:07.939> and

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
headed to to get there if I go in and

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.440 
headed to to get there if I go in and
just<00:01:08.270> touch<00:01:08.509> H<00:01:08.780> I<00:01:09.110> can<00:01:09.710> find<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.579> nearest<00:01:10.759> NDB

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
just touch H I can find the nearest NDB

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.179 
just touch H I can find the nearest NDB
and<00:01:11.719> load<00:01:12.229> that<00:01:12.259> into<00:01:12.649> my<00:01:12.770> flight<00:01:13.040> plan

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
and load that into my flight plan

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.490 
and load that into my flight plan
because<00:01:13.969> it<00:01:14.119> uses<00:01:14.479> the<00:01:14.630> alphabet<00:01:15.020> to<00:01:15.170> find<00:01:15.350> it

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
because it uses the alphabet to find it

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.560 
because it uses the alphabet to find it
make<00:01:15.649> sure<00:01:15.680> makes<00:01:16.159> it<00:01:16.250> much<00:01:16.430> quicker<00:01:16.729> and<00:01:16.969> less

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
make sure makes it much quicker and less

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.990 
make sure makes it much quicker and less
possible<00:01:18.530> waypoints<00:01:19.130> that<00:01:19.159> you<00:01:19.340> want<00:01:19.520> to<00:01:19.579> find

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.790 

and<00:01:22.810> then<00:01:22.960> have<00:01:23.080> to<00:01:23.170> touch

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.670

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.980 

one<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.370> cool<00:01:29.550> features<00:01:29.580> of<00:01:30.000> IFD<00:01:30.330> 540<00:01:30.900> is

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
one of the cool features of IFD 540 is

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.050 
one of the cool features of IFD 540 is
hybrid<00:01:31.230> touch<00:01:31.620> what<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.220> means<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.730> things

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
hybrid touch what that means is things

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.210 
hybrid touch what that means is things
that<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.330> can<00:01:33.510> do<00:01:33.690> on<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.110> touchscreen<00:01:34.710> you

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
that you can do on the touchscreen you

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.100 
that you can do on the touchscreen you
can<00:01:35.280> also<00:01:35.550> do<00:01:35.760> with<00:01:35.850> bezel<00:01:36.210> buttons<00:01:36.510> so<00:01:36.870> here

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
can also do with bezel buttons so here

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.340 
can also do with bezel buttons so here
you<00:01:37.290> can<00:01:37.440> see<00:01:37.710> as<00:01:38.640> i<00:01:38.940> zoom<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.480> I<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:40.170> use<00:01:40.320> a

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
you can see as i zoom in I can use a

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.980 
you can see as i zoom in I can use a
screen<00:01:40.710> for<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.010> I<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.430> also<00:01:41.580> use<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.780> knob

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
screen for that I can also use the knob

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.230 
screen for that I can also use the knob
for<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.680> can<00:01:44.190> also<00:01:44.340> use<00:01:44.490> with<00:01:44.910> radio

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
for it I can also use with radio

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.570 
for it I can also use with radio
frequencies<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:46.020> can<00:01:46.260> go<00:01:46.440> I<00:01:46.680> can<00:01:47.070> dial<00:01:47.370> in<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
frequencies I can go I can dial in the

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.810 
frequencies I can go I can dial in the
frequency<00:01:47.700> using<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.870> knob<00:01:49.050> or<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:50.160> can<00:01:50.610> type
