00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
and the reason why I'm tapping it is

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.630 
and the reason why I'm tapping it is
because<00:02:18.620> that<00:02:19.570> way<00:02:20.570> there<00:02:20.870> there<00:02:21.680> won't<00:02:21.920> be<00:02:22.250> as

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
because that way there there won't be as

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.839 
because that way there there won't be as
much<00:02:23.270> fallout<00:02:23.750> as<00:02:24.170> you<00:02:24.380> would<00:02:24.560> think

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:40.350 

so<00:02:31.849> here<00:02:32.120> I'm<00:02:32.240> just<00:02:32.510> creating<00:02:32.780> lakin<00:02:34.599> an<00:02:35.599> outer

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:50.930 

pick<00:02:41.360> an<00:02:41.540> outer<00:02:41.690> V<00:02:42.080> type<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:43.190> thing<00:02:44.180> here<00:02:46.540> and

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:59.170 

I'm<00:02:51.480> just<00:02:52.580> going<00:02:53.580> into<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.240> crease<00:02:54.570> now<00:02:56.840> and

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
I'm just going into the crease now and

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.000 
I'm just going into the crease now and
all<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.450> way<00:03:00.630> through<00:03:01.050> with<00:03:01.500> no<00:03:01.740> additional

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
I'm just going to add this on there as a

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.460 
I'm just going to add this on there as a
base<00:04:08.940> for<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.599> rest<00:04:09.840> of<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.079> shadows<00:04:10.440> that

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
base for the rest of the shadows that

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.430 
base for the rest of the shadows that
I'm<00:04:10.709> going<00:04:10.920> to<00:04:10.980> use<00:04:13.549> then<00:04:14.549> I'm<00:04:14.730> going<00:04:14.940> to<00:04:15.000> take

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
I'm going to use then I'm going to take

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.599 
I'm going to use then I'm going to take
the<00:04:16.440> flat<00:04:17.010> side<00:04:17.910> of<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.239> brush<00:04:18.919> and<00:04:19.919> I'm<00:04:20.519> going

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
the flat side of the brush and I'm going

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.620 
the flat side of the brush and I'm going
to<00:04:21.030> take<00:04:21.539> the<00:04:21.810> color<00:04:22.079> dust<00:04:23.270> that<00:04:24.270> one

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
to take the color dust that one

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.180 
to take the color dust that one
literally<00:04:25.440> is<00:04:25.889> a<00:04:26.370> very<00:04:27.470> dusty<00:04:28.470> color<00:04:28.710> because

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
literally is a very dusty color because

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.920 
literally is a very dusty color because
it<00:04:29.220> does<00:04:29.580> have<00:04:30.260> some<00:04:31.260> fallout<00:04:32.570> so<00:04:33.570> here<00:04:33.900> I

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
it does have some fallout so here I

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.990 
it does have some fallout so here I
would<00:04:34.350> be<00:04:34.560> dabbing<00:04:34.889> it<00:04:35.190> and<00:04:35.490> I<00:04:35.760> took<00:04:35.820> advantage

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
would be dabbing it and I took advantage

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.950 
would be dabbing it and I took advantage
of<00:04:36.690> it<00:04:37.020> having<00:04:37.590> as<00:04:37.740> much<00:04:37.919> fallout<00:04:38.510> so<00:04:39.510> I<00:04:39.539> could

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
of it having as much fallout so I could

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.120 
of it having as much fallout so I could
put<00:04:40.169> it<00:04:40.289> out<00:04:41.210> and<00:04:42.210> out<00:04:42.479> on<00:04:42.930> there<00:04:43.320> before<00:04:43.770> I<00:04:43.800> use

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
put it out and out on there before I use

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:52.480 
put it out and out on there before I use
dark<00:04:44.760> side<00:04:48.919> right<00:04:49.919> into<00:04:50.099> the<00:04:50.610> middle<00:04:50.820> of<00:04:51.180> my

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
dark side right into the middle of my

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.469 
dark side right into the middle of my
eyelid<00:04:53.490> just<00:04:54.479> to<00:04:54.630> create<00:04:54.870> a<00:04:54.990> gradient<00:04:55.410> effect

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
eyelid just to create a gradient effect

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:04.390 
eyelid just to create a gradient effect
because<00:04:58.130> from<00:04:59.130> black<00:04:59.669> heart<00:05:01.639> it<00:05:02.990> gradually

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
because from black heart it gradually

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.870 
because from black heart it gradually
lightens<00:05:05.400> up<00:05:05.610> with<00:05:06.270> the<00:05:06.450> dark<00:05:06.840> side<00:05:07.289> and<00:05:07.880> then

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
lightens up with the dark side and then

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.800 
lightens up with the dark side and then
I<00:05:09.150> just<00:05:09.419> blend<00:05:09.810> it<00:05:09.990> in<00:05:10.139> with<00:05:10.669> and<00:05:11.669> it's<00:05:12.510> just

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
I just blend it in with and it's just

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:19.730 
I just blend it in with and it's just
blended<00:05:13.229> in<00:05:13.349> with<00:05:13.560> um<00:05:15.530> dust<00:05:17.120> so<00:05:18.740> essentially

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
blended in with um dust so essentially

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.480 
blended in with um dust so essentially
the<00:05:20.130> fallout<00:05:20.669> from<00:05:20.700> dust<00:05:21.240> I<00:05:21.710> use<00:05:22.710> it<00:05:22.919> just<00:05:23.130> to

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
the fallout from dust I use it just to

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.310 
the fallout from dust I use it just to
create<00:05:24.270> more<00:05:24.810> shimmer<00:05:26.270> then<00:05:27.270> I<00:05:27.300> just<00:05:27.660> grab

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
create more shimmer then I just grab

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.570 
create more shimmer then I just grab
some<00:05:28.620> more<00:05:28.770> of<00:05:28.889> that<00:05:28.949> dab<00:05:29.639> and<00:05:29.940> track

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
intense it might lost some of the

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.339 
intense it might lost some of the
intensity<00:05:47.370> in<00:05:48.090> the<00:05:48.360> process<00:05:48.780> of<00:05:48.870> a<00:05:48.960> blending

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:49.349 
intensity in the process of a blending

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:54.050
