00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
much room to the left of the snare as

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.180 
much room to the left of the snare as
you're<00:02:28.010> facing<00:02:28.220> it<00:02:28.459> there<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:29.629> rabbit<00:02:30.379> took

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
you're facing it there and rabbit took

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.320 
you're facing it there and rabbit took
that<00:02:31.400> path<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:33.200> resulted<00:02:33.860> in<00:02:33.980> a<00:02:34.129> no<00:02:34.280> catch<00:02:34.519> the

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
that path and resulted in a no catch the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.910 
that path and resulted in a no catch the
long<00:02:35.510> side<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:35.870> this<00:02:35.959> one<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.230> got<00:02:36.470> that<00:02:36.620> one<00:02:36.739> sit

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
long side of this one I got that one sit

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.470 
long side of this one I got that one sit
there<00:02:37.190> I<00:02:37.930> slowly<00:02:38.930> pan<00:02:39.349> over<00:02:39.800> I<00:02:40.239> have<00:02:41.239> another

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
there I slowly pan over I have another

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.520 
there I slowly pan over I have another
one<00:02:41.720> set<00:02:41.930> right<00:02:42.110> there

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
one set right there

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.360 
one set right there
let's<00:02:43.430> go<00:02:43.519> take<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:43.760> look<00:02:43.940> at<00:02:44.030> that<00:02:44.150> one<00:02:45.370> okay

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
let's go take a look at that one okay

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.990 
let's go take a look at that one okay
this<00:02:46.519> one's<00:02:46.760> uh

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
this one's uh

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.619 
this one's uh
nicely<00:02:47.420> set<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:49.670> after<00:02:49.910> a<00:02:49.940> bit<00:02:50.060> comes<00:02:50.420> through

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
nicely set so after a bit comes through

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.229 
nicely set so after a bit comes through
there<00:02:50.870> we<00:02:51.319> should<00:02:51.500> have<00:02:51.709> them<00:02:52.060> we<00:02:53.060> should<00:02:53.180> be

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
there we should have them we should be

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.339 
there we should have them we should be
able<00:02:53.300> to<00:02:53.420> get<00:02:53.540> them<00:02:53.660> if<00:02:53.750> he<00:02:53.840> comes<00:02:54.050> down<00:02:54.110> that

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
able to get them if he comes down that

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.350 
able to get them if he comes down that
path<00:02:54.560> right<00:02:54.739> there<00:02:55.930> so<00:02:56.930> here<00:02:58.030> there<00:02:59.030> are<00:02:59.180> my

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
path right there so here there are my

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:10.940 
path right there so here there are my
key<00:02:59.540> sets<00:02:59.810> right<00:03:00.019> now<00:03:01.989> this<00:03:02.989> one<00:03:06.459> and<00:03:07.459> that<00:03:07.790> one

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.940 

when<00:03:11.950> they<00:03:12.070> vote<00:03:12.250> down<00:03:12.430> with<00:03:12.610> flip<00:03:12.790> ups<00:03:16.950> if

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
when they vote down with flip ups if

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.890 
when they vote down with flip ups if
that<00:03:18.160> first<00:03:18.400> flip<00:03:18.610> up<00:03:18.790> tied<00:03:19.300> to<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.510> tree<00:03:19.690> right

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
that first flip up tied to a tree right

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.630 
that first flip up tied to a tree right
there

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
there

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.600 
there
it<00:03:21.640> goes<00:03:21.820> out<00:03:21.940> that<00:03:22.120> way<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:24.010> this<00:03:24.160> next<00:03:24.460> flip

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
it goes out that way and this next flip

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:32.280 
it goes out that way and this next flip
up<00:03:28.260> right<00:03:29.260> here<00:03:29.760> is<00:03:30.760> time<00:03:31.690> that<00:03:31.900> tree<00:03:32.260> right

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
up right here is time that tree right

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.540 
up right here is time that tree right
there<00:03:33.210> then<00:03:34.210> it<00:03:34.390> goes<00:03:34.570> out<00:03:34.780> that<00:03:35.770> way

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.830 

so<00:03:39.550> that<00:03:39.700> should<00:03:39.850> work<00:03:40.000> out<00:03:40.180> we<00:03:40.420> got<00:03:40.570> an<00:03:40.660> Arab

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
so that should work out we got an Arab

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.960 
so that should work out we got an Arab
to<00:03:41.020> come<00:03:41.170> through<00:03:41.320> there<00:03:41.610> we<00:03:42.610> should<00:03:42.790> have

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
to come through there we should have

00:03:42.970 --> 00:04:19.640 
to come through there we should have
