00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:08.590
 hi how are you 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:15.400
 I recently bought this product because 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:23.250
 for the simple fact that the gate area 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:23.250
 when the noises of hostile flights 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:32.230
 so this is a lot less solid do not you 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.400
 very entrepreneur note like 1744 and it 's 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.940
 better as almost four place 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.740
 without having a lid 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.520
 20 years 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.520
 the reverse 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:53.000
 superman is internet with the chip with 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.000
 the Portuguese 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.950
 there 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.930
 but now there is here 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:11.880
 it's like a lot very much found the games 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:16.369
 they are that kind of games and it comes with cold 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.369
 in that bar that if you stop 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:24.520
 and unfortunately I'm not going to compute it 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.520
 in a shit so 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.480
 they have all this be together read only 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.350
 compatible 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.350
 the control 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.680
 what the Chilean did at least 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.150
 see very well 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:45.660
 but 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.660
 has the double whipped reason to 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:53.350
 manual game because playable you have to 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.350
 give him a cd to work 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.700
 but you have to set the game or 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.700
 to control 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:16.220
 in this number let's see 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.220
 something pretty you thought 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.000
 I demand the market 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.000
 we wait 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:33.100
 with sun 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:35.410
 the cross is going to play buttoned and 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.090
 here you do not notice much in the light and 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.269
 the buttons play them 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.500
 to force a circle a butterfly and a 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.459
 square 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.459
 here is the menu button 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.000
 to understand it 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.000
 there 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.560
 and here because I have more 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.450
 it's very local 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.450
 now we see ourselves at a point of them 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.360
 this connects computed then 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:13.160
 when your computer function 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.930
 you have to connect this question and 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.610
 migration will work 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.080
 the word 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:26.630
 on the disk you have to install functions 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.630
 in this question as functions 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:39.810
 the instructions on how to install August 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.810
 and well we're not going to put the coast 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.659
 the ecology is already here 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.659
 load 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:00.400
 before 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.790
 and to compare just I have the 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.849
 control 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.849
 the original is the same 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.600
 and stars 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:17.489
 did the lines the difference is that 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.489
 he has no 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:24.120
 she is happy she can aim to do it 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:26.789
 up to the screen and this has nothing or 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.880
 whatever is bad is that practically 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:32.990
 it is a control not us and for only 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.990
 the program works in this 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:44.630
 from the beginning of the program and a 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.630
 bit 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:01.300
 the manna and not if it helps us to play 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.300
 games like emulate 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.810
 you're just fucking 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.410
 what can he do 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:24.560
 really a control cup does not have 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.860
 the same I followed and I have not served you 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.830
 only for 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.790
 play one can game pressure game 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.100
 of the crap cost 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.700
 and juanjo should be preferred when 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.700
 this goal 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:49.890
 I wish he liked it thank you very much
