oh<00:00:10.490> this<00:00:11.490> morning's<00:00:11.940> observations<00:00:12.660> show<00:00:13.080> that

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
oh this morning's observations show that

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.990 
oh this morning's observations show that
we<00:00:13.440> haven't<00:00:13.650> seen<00:00:13.740> again<00:00:14.099> much<00:00:14.250> change<00:00:14.639> over

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
we haven't seen again much change over

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.880 
we haven't seen again much change over
the<00:00:15.059> last<00:00:15.270> week<00:00:15.510> week<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.869> a<00:00:15.959> half<00:00:15.990> there's

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
the last week week and a half there's

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.890 
the last week week and a half there's
still<00:00:17.100> obviously<00:00:17.250> activity<00:00:18.029> down<00:00:18.300> year<00:00:18.750> the

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
still obviously activity down year the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.349 
still obviously activity down year the
forefront<00:00:19.350> but<00:00:20.039> nothing<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.880> pushing

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
forefront but nothing that is pushing

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.109

the<00:00:21.710> leading<00:00:22.710> edge<00:00:22.830> any<00:00:23.130> further<00:00:23.430> forward

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
the leading edge any further forward

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.210 
the leading edge any further forward
what<00:00:24.630> we<00:00:24.750> do<00:00:24.930> see<00:00:25.200> is<00:00:25.470> breakups<00:00:25.949> on<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
what we do see is breakups on the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.920 
what we do see is breakups on the
surface<00:00:26.670> as<00:00:26.910> well<00:00:27.060> as<00:00:27.150> on<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.330> margins<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.750> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
surface as well as on the margins of the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.560 
surface as well as on the margins of the
flow<00:00:28.199> further<00:00:28.560> back<00:00:28.910> clearly<00:00:29.910> evident<00:00:30.330> that

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
flow further back clearly evident that

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.269 
flow further back clearly evident that
the<00:00:30.869> supply<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.320> still<00:00:31.710> making<00:00:31.890> its<00:00:32.129> way<00:00:32.160> down

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
the supply is still making its way down

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.670 
the supply is still making its way down
through<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.820> tube<00:00:33.000> system<00:00:33.449> but<00:00:34.230> nothing<00:00:34.649> that

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
through the tube system but nothing that

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.610 
through the tube system but nothing that
is<00:00:34.949> again<00:00:35.460> advancing<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.480> flow<00:00:36.780> therefore

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
is again advancing the flow therefore

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.029 
is again advancing the flow therefore
the<00:00:38.010> furthest<00:00:38.819> downslope<00:00:39.539> edge<00:00:39.929> of<00:00:40.409> the<00:00:40.769> flow

00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:41.039 
the furthest downslope edge of the flow

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:42.979 
the furthest downslope edge of the flow
which<00:00:41.519> is<00:00:41.909> for<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.359> most<00:00:42.449> part<00:00:42.629> stalled

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
pretty well on the pad itself and had

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.420 
pretty well on the pad itself and had
entered<00:01:09.540> into<00:01:09.840> an<00:01:09.990> old<00:01:10.170> flow<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.250> was
