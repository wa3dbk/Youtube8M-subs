00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.290
 Hello 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.570
 today I will talk about a product that is 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.910
 fundamental in the look of all women 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.430
 The blush is the product that gives 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.380
 dyed-out look and healthy air 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.080
 but there are a lot of people who do not know how 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.960
 apply do not know the ideal color do not know 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.420
 the right region and the intensity 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.460
 today we will unravel this mystery the 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.900
 first step is one of the most important 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.340
 it's brush choice 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.530
 We need to use a small brush. 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.600
 otherwise it can stain the face is 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.290
 also important to choose the color of the 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.760
 product 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.800
 When we choose the product, it 's very 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.660
 red has a lot of movement it can 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.910
 staining the old is not cool 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.070
 choose the shades of pink burned one 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.750
 bronze to give a little skin 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.640
 burning money gets easier 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.570
 apply and also more natural 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:03.010
 I chose criminal, I have nothing I do not like 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:06.070
 the fact that entering will give the touch 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.330
 today I'm going to do the application I'll step 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.009
 a little in the brush 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.530
 Whenever I make a lot of product, it 's 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.220
 difficult to explain their general difficult 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.810
 to take away 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.760
 if I put a little bit I'll give it to 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.689
 and then I'll apply more 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.670
 and more 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.790
 so I'll start on the fourth prominent 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.530
 From the cheek I 'm going to smile, I'm going 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.180
 put here and I will always play to 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.909
 off then you 're actually playing to 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.439
 the hair root 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.360
 The first brushstroke is just to give the 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.759
 is that now you know where the 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.110
 Right place can put a little more 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.579
 of product and this sent out 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.439
 I like ironing the brush several times 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.790
 What is this product that looks good? 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.250
 Coladinho na pele 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.210
 I do not go out all day, too. 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.210
 to know more natural 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.690
 not only because the other side of the vehicle 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:00.270
 We always take care to put it here. 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:03.810
 it out and never afraid to take 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.790
 now the brush with nothing is clean and I go 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.550
 even in smoke because they like 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.740
 marking with a snack has to look like 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.310
 that you have healthy skin remember 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.950
 of this 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.900
 I will give a title cup time going 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.430
 neutralize the body and worship in this 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.560
 rose that we chose then 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.640
 his blue chip behavior better. 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.910
 in the skin 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.900
 so alone more natural and well- prepared 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.900
 safe to go out there
