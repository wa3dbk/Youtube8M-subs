couple of systems symptoms of a bad fuel
system<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.880> hard<00:00:18.600> starting<00:00:19.050> or<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.590> tractor

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
system is hard starting or the tractor

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.450 
system is hard starting or the tractor
just<00:00:20.010> doesn't<00:00:20.460> start<00:00:20.699> at<00:00:20.820> all<00:00:21.980> I've<00:00:22.980> got<00:00:23.279> the

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
just doesn't start at all I've got the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.279 
just doesn't start at all I've got the
hood<00:00:23.609> off<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:24.000> this<00:00:24.330> tractor<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:24.930> that's<00:00:25.109> why

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
hood off this this tractor so that's why

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.390 
hood off this this tractor so that's why
it<00:00:25.350> looks<00:00:25.650> funny

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.440 
it and pull it back then to make this
easier<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.460> pull<00:01:41.640> off<00:01:41.670> some<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.119> these<00:01:42.210> lines

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
easier to pull off some of these lines

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.760 
easier to pull off some of these lines
are<00:01:42.659> sometimes<00:01:42.780> hard<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.290> get<00:01:43.439> off<00:01:43.590> because

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
are sometimes hard to get off because

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.230 
are sometimes hard to get off because
you<00:01:44.189> know<00:01:44.280> they've<00:01:44.430> been<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.640> there<00:01:44.790> for<00:01:44.939> years

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
you know they've been on there for years

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.960 
you know they've been on there for years
if<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.649> if<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.009> can<00:01:47.189> somehow<00:01:47.369> grab<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
if you can if you can somehow grab the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.020 
if you can if you can somehow grab the
line<00:01:48.380> gently<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.560> twist<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.850> breaks

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
line gently and twist it so it breaks

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.760 
line gently and twist it so it breaks
free<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.329> work<00:01:51.570> connects<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.320> pump<00:01:52.560> and

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
free of work connects to the pump and

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.630 
free of work connects to the pump and
then<00:01:53.460> pull<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.850> off<00:01:55.070> then<00:01:56.070> we<00:01:56.189> want<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.460> take

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
then pull it off then we want to take

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.429 
then pull it off then we want to take
the<00:01:56.790> inlet<00:01:57.090> line<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> position<00:01:57.869> at<00:01:57.990> below<00:01:58.259> the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
the inlet line a position at below the

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.709 
the inlet line a position at below the
fuel<00:01:58.710> tank<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.040> gravity<00:01:59.579> can<00:01:59.880> pull<00:01:59.909> fuel

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
fuel tank so gravity can pull fuel

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.969 
fuel tank so gravity can pull fuel
through<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> line<00:02:01.350> we<00:02:01.829> can<00:02:01.950> see<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.219> flow<00:02:03.979> and

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
through the line we can see a flow and

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.330 
through the line we can see a flow and
we<00:02:05.250> can<00:02:05.520> hear<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:07.200> we<00:02:07.320> know<00:02:07.469> fuel<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.009> able<00:02:08.250> to

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
we can hear so we know fuel is able to

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.220 
we can hear so we know fuel is able to
flow<00:02:08.580> through<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.000> inlet<00:02:09.330> line

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.490 

and<00:02:13.230> then<00:02:13.740> reconnect<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:18.170> take<00:02:19.170> your<00:02:19.319> pliers

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
and then reconnect it take your pliers

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.290 
and then reconnect it take your pliers
again<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.069> compress<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.550> hose<00:02:20.700> clamp<00:02:21.030> and

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
again and compress the hose clamp and

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:28.010 
again and compress the hose clamp and
put<00:02:22.020> it<00:02:22.110> into<00:02:22.319> position<00:02:26.300> okay<00:02:27.300> if<00:02:27.450> we<00:02:27.630> were<00:02:27.810> not

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
put it into position okay if we were not

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.110 
put it into position okay if we were not
able<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.560> get<00:02:28.709> fuel<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.370> flow<00:02:29.580> out<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.880> it

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
able to get fuel to flow out of it

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.150 
able to get fuel to flow out of it
through<00:02:30.510> this<00:02:30.600> Inlet<00:02:30.990> line<00:02:31.200> there's<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.920> few

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
through this Inlet line there's a few

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.699 
through this Inlet line there's a few
things<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.520> can<00:02:32.610> check<00:02:33.050> one<00:02:34.050> is<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.470> fuel

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
things you can check one is the fuel

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.210 
things you can check one is the fuel
filter<00:02:35.070> it<00:02:35.670> could<00:02:35.820> be<00:02:35.970> clogged<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:38.010> way<00:02:38.160> you

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
filter it could be clogged the way you

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.830 
filter it could be clogged the way you
could<00:02:38.430> check<00:02:38.640> that<00:02:38.670> is<00:02:39.060> disconnect<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.660> line

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
could check that is disconnect the line

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.050 
could check that is disconnect the line
before<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.260> before<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.100> fuel<00:02:41.670> filter<00:02:42.030> and

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
before the before the fuel filter and

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.930 
before the before the fuel filter and
see<00:02:42.330> if<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.480> can<00:02:42.600> get<00:02:42.780> fuel<00:02:43.260> flow<00:02:43.940> another

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
see if you can get fuel flow another

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.670 
see if you can get fuel flow another
thing<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.330> check<00:02:45.360> is<00:02:45.630> if<00:02:45.959> there's<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.260> shutoff

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
thing to check is if there's a shutoff

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.160 
thing to check is if there's a shutoff
valve<00:02:46.950> on<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.430> on<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.760> gas<00:02:47.970> tank<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:48.900> could<00:02:49.050> be

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
valve on the on the gas tank it could be

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.160 
valve on the on the gas tank it could be
in<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.350> opposition<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:50.790> another<00:02:51.750> thing<00:02:52.050> you

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
in the opposition and another thing you

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.229 
in the opposition and another thing you
can<00:02:52.290> check<00:02:52.590> is<00:02:52.860> there's<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.220> vent<00:02:53.550> in<00:02:53.700> these<00:02:53.940> gas

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
can check is there's a vent in these gas

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.870 
can check is there's a vent in these gas
caps<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:54.900> as<00:02:54.989> a<00:02:55.019> divinity<00:02:55.530> can't<00:02:56.400> be<00:02:56.550> plugged

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
caps and as a divinity can't be plugged

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.280 
caps and as a divinity can't be plugged
up<00:02:57.060> it's<00:02:57.239> plugged<00:02:57.540> fuel<00:02:57.690> won't<00:02:58.170> flow<00:03:00.260> you<00:03:01.260> can

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
up it's plugged fuel won't flow you can

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.530 
up it's plugged fuel won't flow you can
take<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.739> gas<00:03:01.950> gas<00:03:02.459> cap<00:03:02.730> off<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.390> then

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
take the gas gas cap off and then

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.540 
take the gas gas cap off and then
recheck<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.650> inlet<00:03:04.920> line<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.340> see<00:03:05.430> if<00:03:05.489> you

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
recheck the inlet line and see if you

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.400 
recheck the inlet line and see if you
can<00:03:05.670> get<00:03:05.760> fuel<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.150> flow<00:03:06.360> if<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.570> can<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.140> then

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
can get fuel to flow if you can and then

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.690 
can get fuel to flow if you can and then
then<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.769> probably<00:03:07.920> need<00:03:08.100> to<00:03:08.190> replace<00:03:08.340> the

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
then you probably need to replace the

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.770 
then you probably need to replace the
gas<00:03:08.880> cap<00:03:13.580> now<00:03:14.580> that<00:03:14.760> we<00:03:14.850> know<00:03:15.000> we<00:03:15.150> can<00:03:15.300> get<00:03:15.420> fuel

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
gas cap now that we know we can get fuel

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.080 
gas cap now that we know we can get fuel
from<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.079> fuel<00:03:16.200> tank<00:03:16.640> through<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.670> inlet

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
from the fuel tank through the inlet

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.880 
from the fuel tank through the inlet
line<00:03:18.329> to<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.720> pump<00:03:18.989> we<00:03:19.320> want<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.620> check<00:03:19.860> to

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
line to the pump we want to check to

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.470 
line to the pump we want to check to
make<00:03:20.070> sure<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.700> pump<00:03:20.910> is<00:03:21.180> actually

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
make sure that the pump is actually

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.170 
make sure that the pump is actually
pumping<00:03:22.079> fuel<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.739> pushing<00:03:23.700> it<00:03:23.820> out<00:03:23.940> of<00:03:24.090> the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
pumping fuel and pushing it out of the

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.210 
pumping fuel and pushing it out of the
outlet<00:03:24.329> line<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:24.989> to<00:03:25.620> do<00:03:25.739> that<00:03:25.920> we<00:03:26.040> got<00:03:26.160> to

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
outlet line and to do that we got to

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.949 
outlet line and to do that we got to
disconnect<00:03:26.760> this<00:03:26.970> outlet<00:03:27.360> line<00:03:27.570> from<00:03:27.810> the

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
disconnect this outlet line from the

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.620 
disconnect this outlet line from the
carburetor<00:03:28.440> so<00:03:29.060> next<00:03:30.060> thing<00:03:30.180> we<00:03:30.269> need<00:03:30.390> to<00:03:30.450> do

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
carburetor so next thing we need to do

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.699 
carburetor so next thing we need to do
is<00:03:30.870> remove<00:03:31.170> this<00:03:31.380> air<00:03:31.650> filter<00:03:31.860> and<00:03:32.220> cover<00:03:33.709> ok

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
is remove this air filter and cover ok

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.390 
is remove this air filter and cover ok
to<00:03:34.769> remove<00:03:35.070> this<00:03:35.250> filter<00:03:36.829> you<00:03:37.829> unscrew<00:03:38.130> this

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
to remove this filter you unscrew this

00:03:38.400 --> 00:04:03.289 
to remove this filter you unscrew this
part<00:04:01.280> okay<00:04:02.280> now<00:04:02.430> we<00:04:02.489> need<00:04:02.670> to<00:04:02.760> remove<00:04:03.060> the

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
part okay now we need to remove the

don't say how to check that flow they

don't say how to check that flow they
basically<00:07:48.020> just<00:07:48.169> say<00:07:48.560> make<00:07:49.219> sure<00:07:49.340> that

basically just say make sure that
there's<00:07:49.729> there's<00:07:50.060> fuel<00:07:50.599> being<00:07:50.810> pushed<00:07:51.080> out<00:07:51.199> of

there's there's fuel being pushed out of

00:07:51.349 --> 00:07:52.629 
there's there's fuel being pushed out of
the<00:07:51.440> pump<00:07:51.680> when<00:07:51.949> the<00:07:52.099> when<00:07:52.310> the<00:07:52.340> engine<00:07:52.610> is

00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639 
the pump when the when the engine is

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:55.540 
the pump when the when the engine is
turning<00:07:52.880> over<00:07:53.120> and<00:07:53.469> if<00:07:54.469> you<00:07:54.590> find<00:07:54.860> if<00:07:55.190> you<00:07:55.310> find

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:55.550 
turning over and if you find if you find

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.249 
turning over and if you find if you find
that<00:07:55.759> that's<00:07:56.060> the<00:07:56.270> case<00:07:56.479> then<00:07:56.810> the<00:07:56.930> pump<00:07:57.139> is

00:07:57.249 --> 00:07:57.259 
that that's the case then the pump is

00:07:57.259 --> 00:08:00.310 
that that's the case then the pump is
good<00:07:58.270> anyway<00:07:59.270> I<00:07:59.330> hope<00:07:59.570> you<00:07:59.630> found<00:07:59.930> this<00:08:00.139> video
