think<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.299> was<00:02:06.360> six<00:02:06.750> now<00:02:07.140> eight<00:02:07.380> seconds<00:02:07.890> and

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
think it was six now eight seconds and

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.249 
think it was six now eight seconds and
that<00:02:08.789> over<00:02:09.119> time<00:02:09.270> which<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:09.929> really

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
that over time which is really

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.809 
that over time which is really
frustrating<00:02:10.530> because<00:02:10.950> we<00:02:11.250> were<00:02:11.370> out<00:02:11.489> slaying

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
frustrating because we were out slaying

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.490 
frustrating because we were out slaying
them<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.330> much<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:12.900> we<00:02:12.989> were<00:02:13.110> just<00:02:13.140> playing

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
them so much and we were just playing

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.280 
them so much and we were just playing
so<00:02:13.710> much<00:02:13.860> better<00:02:14.100> than<00:02:14.250> them<00:02:14.400> at<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.700> time<00:02:14.880> but

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
so much better than them at the time but

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.420 
so much better than them at the time but
they<00:02:16.290> just<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.740> know<00:02:16.770> they<00:02:17.010> got<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.190> really

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
they just you know they got a really

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.460 
they just you know they got a really
clutch<00:02:17.730> flagpole<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.450> they<00:02:18.570> ran<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.960> so<00:02:19.380> as

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
clutch flagpole and they ran it so as

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.780 
clutch flagpole and they ran it so as
you<00:02:19.530> can<00:02:19.680> see<00:02:19.800> this<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.100> first<00:02:20.400> half<00:02:20.640> of

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
you can see this is the first half of

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.070 
you can see this is the first half of
the<00:02:20.880> overtime<00:02:21.270> that's<00:02:21.480> exactly<00:02:21.900> what

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
the overtime that's exactly what

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.540 
the overtime that's exactly what
happened<00:02:22.440> here<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.710> kill<00:02:23.160> feet<00:02:23.340> on<00:02:23.460> the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
happened here the kill feet on the

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.090 
happened here the kill feet on the
bottom<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:24.660> think<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.260> dropped<00:02:25.410> like<00:02:25.620> 10<00:02:25.830> kills

those of you don't know we did MLG rules
where<00:02:41.459> we<00:02:41.700> wait<00:02:42.740> whoever<00:02:43.740> caps<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.100> flag

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
where we wait whoever caps the flag

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.010 
where we wait whoever caps the flag
first<00:02:44.520> in<00:02:44.820> a<00:02:45.060> certain<00:02:45.300> amount<00:02:45.420> of<00:02:45.540> time<00:02:45.690> you

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
first in a certain amount of time you

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.990 
first in a certain amount of time you
have<00:02:46.050> to<00:02:46.230> switch<00:02:46.590> sides<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.100> if<00:02:47.550> you<00:02:47.670> cap<00:02:47.850> the

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
have to switch sides and if you cap the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.500 
have to switch sides and if you cap the
flag<00:02:48.350> faster<00:02:49.459> then<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.730> first<00:02:50.970> team<00:02:51.150> that<00:02:51.270> cap

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
flag faster then the first team that cap

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.940 
flag faster then the first team that cap
then<00:02:51.780> you<00:02:51.900> win<00:02:52.080> if<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.350> don't<00:02:52.470> cap<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:52.920> flag

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
then you win if you don't cap the flag

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.440 
then you win if you don't cap the flag
within<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.520> certain<00:02:53.670> amount<00:02:53.880> of<00:02:54.000> time<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.239> the

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
within a certain amount of time that the

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.990 
within a certain amount of time that the
other<00:02:54.570> flag<00:02:54.810> has<00:02:54.959> been<00:02:55.080> capped<00:02:55.320> then<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:55.709> lose

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
other flag has been capped then you lose

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.180 
other flag has been capped then you lose
so<00:02:57.000> now<00:02:57.150> if<00:02:57.239> that<00:02:57.390> makes<00:02:57.540> any<00:02:57.630> sense<00:02:58.190> that's

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
so now if that makes any sense that's

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.830 
so now if that makes any sense that's
why<00:02:59.430> we<00:02:59.580> lost<00:02:59.760> by<00:02:59.940> eight<00:03:00.090> seconds<00:03:00.480> they<00:03:00.600> kept

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
why we lost by eight seconds they kept

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.449 
why we lost by eight seconds they kept
at<00:03:00.989> eight<00:03:01.140> seconds<00:03:01.560> earlier<00:03:01.920> than<00:03:02.100> we<00:03:02.220> capped

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
at eight seconds earlier than we capped

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.690 
at eight seconds earlier than we capped
it<00:03:02.640> on<00:03:02.730> their<00:03:02.910> side<00:03:03.120> um<00:03:04.130> to<00:03:05.130> make<00:03:05.280> things<00:03:05.489> fair
