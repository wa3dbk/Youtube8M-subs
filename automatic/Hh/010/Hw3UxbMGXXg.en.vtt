hopefully you can hear as you can see

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.410 
hopefully you can hear as you can see
the<00:01:22.229> crack<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:22.890> annoying<00:01:23.330> just<00:01:24.330> a

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
the crack is on it is annoying just a

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.950 
the crack is on it is annoying just a
problem<00:01:24.630> for<00:01:24.869> us<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:26.250> second<00:01:26.610> we<00:01:27.360> if<00:01:27.900> you

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
problem for us and a second we if you

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.680 
problem for us and a second we if you
were<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.170> black<00:01:28.590> version<00:01:29.210> you<00:01:30.210> can<00:01:30.360> see<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.570> here

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
were a black version you can see in here

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.340 
were a black version you can see in here
that<00:01:33.230> doesn't<00:01:33.590> be<00:01:33.890> really<00:01:34.400> light<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:35.900> white

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
that doesn't be really light the white

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.730 
that doesn't be really light the white
line<00:01:36.650> in<00:01:36.890> here<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:37.450> then<00:01:38.450> suck<00:01:38.750> because<00:01:39.170> if<00:01:39.560> we

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
line in here and then suck because if we

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.630 
line in here and then suck because if we
want<00:01:39.920> to<00:01:40.040> adjust<00:01:40.250> like<00:01:41.530> 5<00:01:42.530> out<00:01:42.830> of<00:01:42.890> 5

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
want to adjust like 5 out of 5

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.280 
want to adjust like 5 out of 5
you<00:01:44.000> must<00:01:44.210> like<00:01:44.470> 1<00:01:45.470> 2<00:01:46.250> 3<00:01:46.729> 4<00:01:47.180> like<00:01:47.600> that<00:01:47.659> and

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
you must like 1 2 3 4 like that and

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.120 
you must like 1 2 3 4 like that and
that's<00:01:49.010> a<00:01:49.280> and<00:01:50.119> second<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:51.500> not<00:01:51.710> a<00:01:51.860> solution

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
that's a and second the not a solution

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.520 
that's a and second the not a solution
is<00:01:52.729> way<00:01:53.090> better<00:01:53.360> Kraken<00:01:54.070> why<00:01:55.570> because<00:01:56.570> the

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
is way better Kraken why because the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.590 
is way better Kraken why because the
Elektra<00:01:58.009> used<00:01:58.369> a<00:01:58.550> lot<00:01:58.790> of<00:01:58.970> instrument<00:01:59.509> of

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
Elektra used a lot of instrument of

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.160 
Elektra used a lot of instrument of
course<00:01:59.930> and<00:02:01.150> the<00:02:02.150> new<00:02:02.300> circuit<00:02:02.540> the<00:02:02.990> noise

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
course and the new circuit the noise

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.310 
course and the new circuit the noise
cancellation<00:02:03.500> is<00:02:03.910> for<00:02:04.910> your<00:02:05.060> ears<00:02:05.300> is<00:02:05.690> good

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
cancellation is for your ears is good

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.130 
cancellation is for your ears is good
it's<00:02:07.009> very<00:02:07.070> good<00:02:07.280> but<00:02:07.640> for<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.450> other<00:02:08.660> is<00:02:08.899> not

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
it's very good but for the other is not

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.500 
it's very good but for the other is not
good<00:02:09.440> I<00:02:09.739> mean<00:02:11.560> admit<00:02:12.560> admit<00:02:13.190> volume<00:02:13.940> you

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
good I mean admit admit volume you

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.920 
good I mean admit admit volume you
probably<00:02:14.810> can<00:02:15.050> hear<00:02:15.440> I<00:02:15.680> mean<00:02:16.640> if<00:02:17.330> if<00:02:17.720> your

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
probably can hear I mean if if your

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.260 
probably can hear I mean if if your
friend<00:02:18.200> variant<00:02:18.610> you're<00:02:19.610> gonna<00:02:19.790> be<00:02:20.000> you're

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
friend variant you're gonna be you're

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.990 
friend variant you're gonna be you're
gonna<00:02:20.360> be<00:02:20.890> hearing<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.280> sound<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.910> music

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
gonna be hearing the sound the music

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.910 
gonna be hearing the sound the music
because<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:24.620> new<00:02:24.739> solution<00:02:25.280> is<00:02:25.459> is<00:02:26.769> it's<00:02:27.769> not

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
because the new solution is is it's not

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.500 
because the new solution is is it's not
very<00:02:28.190> good<00:02:28.340> but<00:02:28.640> it's<00:02:28.850> not<00:02:28.940> that<00:02:29.090> they're<00:02:29.300> too

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
very good but it's not that they're too

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.290 
very good but it's not that they're too
I<00:02:29.750> mean<00:02:29.959> if<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:30.950> give<00:02:31.190> if<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:31.489> are<00:02:31.730> this<00:02:31.910> in<00:02:32.150> a

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
I mean if you give if you are this in a

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.720 
I mean if you give if you are this in a
silent<00:02:32.690> place<00:02:32.810> just<00:02:33.440> go<00:02:33.620> with<00:02:33.769> a<00:02:33.800> low<00:02:34.010> volume<00:02:34.280> I

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
silent place just go with a low volume I

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.680 
silent place just go with a low volume I
recommend<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:36.200> then<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:38.060> ear<00:02:38.239> cups<00:02:38.590> is<00:02:39.590> warm

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
recommend and then the ear cups is warm

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.420 
recommend and then the ear cups is warm
it's<00:02:41.690> warm<00:02:41.750> I<00:02:41.959> mean<00:02:42.170> if<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.070> write<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:43.340> your

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
it's warm I mean if you write to your

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.240 
it's warm I mean if you write to your
ears<00:02:43.700> it's<00:02:44.540> warm<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.019> then<00:02:45.230> if<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.890> listen<00:02:46.130> to

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
ears it's warm and then if you listen to

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.699 
ears it's warm and then if you listen to
music<00:02:46.340> for<00:02:46.850> too<00:02:47.060> long<00:02:47.239> just<00:02:47.630> like<00:02:48.410> gets

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
music for too long just like gets

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.630 
music for too long just like gets
trapped<00:02:49.600> it's<00:02:50.600> just<00:02:50.810> my<00:02:50.959> opinion<00:02:51.350> but<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:52.010> guess

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
trapped it's just my opinion but I guess

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.690 
trapped it's just my opinion but I guess
getting<00:02:52.970> swept<00:02:53.299> because<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:57.170> ear<00:02:57.980> cup<00:02:58.190> is<00:02:58.370> too

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
getting swept because the ear cup is too
