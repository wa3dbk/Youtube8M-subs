 simple reason one consciously 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.540
 capture brain information series 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.030
 one works like a radar but you 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:04.050
 subconscious that is much wiser 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.360
 primitive does not choose captures everything grasped and 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.660
 begins to signal the brain of

 done in a hypnosis session you 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.319

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:14.580
 people what hair color but one 

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:16.620
 he asked a conscious question 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.250
 can answer they realize where 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.770
 they are and probably nobody is going to give 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.560
