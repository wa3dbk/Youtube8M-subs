children the parents have to be told
well<00:03:23.380> in<00:03:23.530> this<00:03:23.709> case<00:03:24.010> it<00:03:24.250> was<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.579> parents<00:03:25.150> who

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660

had made these threats against the

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.119 
had made these threats against the
children<00:03:28.090> so<00:03:28.660> police<00:03:29.650> didn't<00:03:29.889> really<00:03:30.040> know

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
children so police didn't really know

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:31.470 
children so police didn't really know
how<00:03:30.250> to<00:03:30.310> handle<00:03:30.639> you<00:03:30.730> know<00:03:30.790> how<00:03:30.970> to<00:03:31.030> handle<00:03:31.209> and

how to handle you know how to handle and
that's<00:03:31.629> because<00:03:31.930> it's<00:03:32.079> a<00:03:32.139> relatively<00:03:32.560> new

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:32.919 
that's because it's a relatively new
