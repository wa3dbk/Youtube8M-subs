00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
discuss how to thaw or defrost a chicken

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.580 
discuss how to thaw or defrost a chicken
there<00:00:19.980> are<00:00:20.100> three<00:00:20.310> ways<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.670> doing<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:21.180> a

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
there are three ways of doing it a

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.349 
there are three ways of doing it a
microwave<00:00:22.590> oven<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.789> first<00:00:24.000> way<00:00:24.180> but

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
microwave oven is is the first way but

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.050 
microwave oven is is the first way but
i'm<00:00:24.449> not<00:00:24.600> going<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.990> recommend<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.619> because

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
i'm not going to recommend that because

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.429 
i'm not going to recommend that because
unless<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.269> really<00:00:27.510> know<00:00:27.779> your<00:00:27.990> settings

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
unless you really know your settings

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.580 
unless you really know your settings
well<00:00:28.710> it's<00:00:29.279> very<00:00:29.699> very<00:00:30.000> easy<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.630> cook<00:00:30.869> the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
well it's very very easy to cook the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.060 
well it's very very easy to cook the
chicken<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.730> microwave<00:00:33.079> so<00:00:34.079> my<00:00:34.559> two<00:00:34.620> ways

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
chicken in the microwave so my two ways

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.830 
chicken in the microwave so my two ways
of<00:00:35.219> doing<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.640> or<00:00:35.760> as<00:00:35.850> follows<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.390> first<00:00:36.570> way

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
of doing it or as follows the first way

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.440 
of doing it or as follows the first way
is<00:00:37.170> take<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> chicken<00:00:38.399> out<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.640> freezer<00:00:38.940> and

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
is take the chicken out the freezer and

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.810 
is take the chicken out the freezer and
lay<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> tray<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.940> then<00:00:42.500> put<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.700> well<00:00:44.700> in

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
lay it on a tray and then put it well in

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.130 
lay it on a tray and then put it well in
this<00:00:44.969> case<00:00:45.239> i'm<00:00:45.510> going<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.719> put<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
this case i'm going to put it on the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.940 
this case i'm going to put it on the
bottom<00:00:46.320> shelf<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:47.160> my<00:00:48.000> fridge<00:00:48.950> generally

bottom shelf of my fridge generally
speaking<00:00:50.489> you're<00:00:50.730> looking<00:00:51.030> at<00:00:51.379> for<00:00:52.379> every

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
five hours for every pound in the fridge

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.250 
five hours for every pound in the fridge
and<00:00:55.949> because<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:57.420> provided<00:00:57.809> your<00:00:58.050> fridge

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
and because it provided your fridge

temperature<00:01:13.560> below<00:01:13.860> eight<00:01:14.250> degrees<00:01:14.840> you<00:01:15.840> can

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
temperature below eight degrees you can

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.510 
temperature below eight degrees you can
take<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.259> out<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.650> refrigerator<00:01:16.740> and

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
take it out of the refrigerator and

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.880 
take it out of the refrigerator and
start<00:01:17.820> working<00:01:18.060> with<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.590> well<00:01:19.590> i'm<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:19.830> to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
start working with it well i'm going to

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.050 
start working with it well i'm going to
take<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:21.090> one<00:01:21.360> out<00:01:22.430> now<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.759> about<00:01:23.880> a

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
take this one out now this is about a

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.289 
take this one out now this is about a
1.5<00:01:24.840> kilo<00:01:25.380> chicken<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.640> will<00:01:26.880> typically

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
1.5 kilo chicken so this will typically

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.480 
1.5 kilo chicken so this will typically
take<00:01:27.450> somewhere<00:01:28.170> between<00:01:28.740> seven<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.340> eight

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
take somewhere between seven and eight

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.569 
take somewhere between seven and eight
hours<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.180> thaw<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.200> fridge<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
hours to thaw in the fridge and the

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.999 
hours to thaw in the fridge and the
reason<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.939> would<00:01:33.060> keep<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.540> on<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.530> container

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
reason you would keep it on a container

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.240 
reason you would keep it on a container
is<00:01:35.280> any<00:01:35.549> excess<00:01:36.530> juice

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
is any excess juice

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.800 
is any excess juice
you<00:01:38.670> wouldn't<00:01:38.939> want<00:01:39.090> dripping<00:01:39.420> over<00:01:39.540> other

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
you wouldn't want dripping over other

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.260 
you wouldn't want dripping over other
food<00:01:40.140> which<00:01:40.380> would<00:01:40.590> cause

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
food which would cause

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.850 
food which would cause
cross-contamination<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:43.290> other<00:01:43.470> way<00:01:43.710> of

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
cross-contamination the other way of

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.179 
cross-contamination the other way of
defrosting<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.549> chicken<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.530> to<00:01:46.530> do<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:46.920> by

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
defrosting a chicken is to do so by

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.120 
defrosting a chicken is to do so by
submerging<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.060> cold<00:01:48.299> water<00:01:49.009> and<00:01:50.009> again

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
submerging it in cold water and again

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.130 
submerging it in cold water and again
this<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> much<00:01:51.060> safer<00:01:51.299> way<00:01:51.689> because

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
this is a much safer way because

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.520 
this is a much safer way because
provided<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> water<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.100> cold<00:01:53.280> enough

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
provided the water is cold enough

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.170 
provided the water is cold enough
you're<00:01:55.530> not<00:01:55.680> going<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.920> develop<00:01:56.219> any<00:01:56.430> bacteria

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
you're not going to develop any bacteria

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.950 
you're not going to develop any bacteria
my<00:01:57.689> advice<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.439> as<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.850> said<00:02:00.030> submerge<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.780> bird

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
my advice is as I said submerge the bird

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.050 
my advice is as I said submerge the bird
totally<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.649> water

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
totally in water

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.929 
totally in water
and<00:02:03.450> then<00:02:03.899> maybe<00:02:04.170> every<00:02:04.649> two<00:02:04.890> hours<00:02:04.950> just

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
and then maybe every two hours just

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.960 
and then maybe every two hours just
drain<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.719> water<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.459> recharge<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.759> cover

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
drain the water and recharge and cover

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.850 
drain the water and recharge and cover
and<00:02:10.240> you<00:02:10.330> will<00:02:10.510> find<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:10.990> within<00:02:11.230> I<00:02:11.590> mean

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
and you will find that within I mean

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.400 
and you will find that within I mean
cooking<00:02:12.220> times<00:02:12.460> a<00:02:12.640> far<00:02:13.000> letter<00:02:13.360> sorry

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
cooking times a far letter sorry

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.170 
cooking times a far letter sorry
defrosting<00:02:15.100> times<00:02:15.340> are<00:02:15.520> far<00:02:15.730> less<00:02:15.940> you're

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
defrosting times are far less you're

as<00:02:45.310> possible<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:47.320> reason<00:02:47.350> for<00:02:47.770> that<00:02:47.830> is

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
as possible the reason for that is

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.700 
as possible the reason for that is
purely<00:02:49.240> and<00:02:49.690> you<00:02:49.960> don't<00:02:50.230> want<00:02:50.560> any<00:02:51.550> excess

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
purely and you don't want any excess

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.050 
purely and you don't want any excess
dripping<00:02:53.710> on<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:54.010> other<00:02:54.160> foods<00:02:54.490> which<00:02:54.760> again

dripping on to other foods which again

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.690 
dripping on to other foods which again
will<00:02:55.660> cause<00:02:56.040> cross-contamination<00:02:57.040> and

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
will cause cross-contamination and

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.530 
will cause cross-contamination and
that's<00:02:58.630> how<00:02:58.930> you<00:02:58.990> defrost<00:02:59.890> or<00:03:00.220> or<00:03:00.460> thaw<00:03:01.300> out

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540
