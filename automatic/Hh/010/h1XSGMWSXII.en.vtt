00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.809

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.870
 it seems okay to you now to begin 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.699
 that is a beyblade is a type of spin 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.529
 developed and manufactured by this face 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.510
 the introduction of the toy in Japanese 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.310
 corresponded with the dissemination of a 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.880
 anime television series 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.650
 same name here your curiosities 1 the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.990
 start song in English is 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.910
 sung by lucas rossi 2 the 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.820
 protagonist of the series is called equal 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.309
 that the creator 3 in the manga vegas 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.350
 justice 5 make a single appearance and they 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.079
 they look very different from their versions of 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.480
 Anime shows them on a page without 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.610
 relationship with history 4 although 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.100
 It was originally made for children and 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.140
 young people between 12 and 15 years old was very 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.969
 popular among teenage girls the 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.340
 which they considered viso unite the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.190
 most of the characters like kai king 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.809
 Brooklyn milestones and felling to the degree that it 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.879
 they have done hundreds of dawkins is 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.890
 romantics with stories alternating to the 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.870
 most series with strong content 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.630
 sensual or with relationships 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.790
 between the characters 5 from the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.380
 second season all the characters 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.810
 they are drawn in a way 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.370
 moderately different being this 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.530
 the most notorious change between 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.630
 protagonists which seem to have 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.450
 like five years less when in fact 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.700
 they have one more year than in the first 6 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.350
 the author of the manga was inspired by akira 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.690
 toriyama to create your story 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.090
 including small tributes to the series 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.430
 of dragon ball for example in the first 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.830
 tomo del manga taca or throw your beyblade 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.050
 with feet to beat grotto Carlos 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.660
 in Latin America in the same way that 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.100
 goku throws a cameo against piccolo this 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.570
 because both cases are 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.540
 protagonists had arms 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.400
 hurt another reference can be noticed 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.500
 in the fight between street and king in the 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.360
 third season when I fall drops 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.550
 your scarf is making a noise 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.770
 thunderously suggesting that it is 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.780
 made of a rather heavy material of 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.510
 same way as piccolo in 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.880
 dragon ball 7 the names of the beasts 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.360
 bi of the lakers start with deere 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.560
 dragon transfer trigger dry the 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.720
 exactly the same happens with the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.210
 bi beasts of the 'all stars' which 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.250
 they start against 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.680
 triple prior indeed all the beasts 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.470
 I saw from the first season they start with 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.750
 the same initial letter or syllable 8 in the 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.700
 original story the beasts beat only 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.400
 can be seen by its owner and by 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.170
 all that fighter who possesses this 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.230
 is a relevant fact that was passed through 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.090
 high in the anime 9 in the manga when the 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.190
 bei fighter wants to invoke his beast 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.770
 beat on the forehead of this appears the 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.410
 figure of his corresponding beast this 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.810
 neither happens in the anime 10 when 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.270
 come back the beast beat of yuri is the in 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.250
 Latin America realizes its attack can 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.570
 glimpse a woman appearing 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.670
 in the snow 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.410
 this is a cultural reference to a 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.480
 legend of japan about a woman who 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.240
 makes travelers facing the 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.130
 storm get lost and never come back this 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.820
 history has been mentioned in others 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.490
 animes like in jacar sakura 11 in the 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.620
 American version the musical replaced 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.170
 in its entirety not only when changing them 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.270
 openings endings but also the themes 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.850
 in the background the instrumental soundtrack 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.310
 in the same way the names of the 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.200
 characters are changed mostly 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.170
 just as it has happened in several 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.930
 series distributed from the USA logo 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.340
 of the series is changed completely 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.880
 this has been seen in other animes as 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.099
 satchwell meda box or rain 12 something that 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.319
 it caught the attention of the fans is that the 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.239
 manga has some nude scenes 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.250
 or yaoi connotations by the 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.459
 protagonists arriving at what is 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.280
 known in the anime as fun service 13 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.900
 when distributed by the united states the 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.050
 version brought for the rest of america 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.180
 it was heavily censored mainly 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.450
 by violent content and in some 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.360
 sensual cases of the three seasons that 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.790
 has the anime the third that revolution 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.340
 He was the hardest hit this censorship to 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.040
 show several bloody scenes of 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.650
 naked with homosexual content and in 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.989
 an episode transvestism this scene was 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.510
 shown for comedy purposes but to 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.880
 despite that said scene together with 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.389
 others were removed from the version 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.000
 americana 14 the concept of beasts 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.830
 legendary is authentic according to the 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.050
 Japanese mythology 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.150
 to guarded by four beasts that 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.740
 they guarded and protected each of the 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.469
 four cardinal points 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.169

 bi beasts of the demolition voice are 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:47.430
 Inspired by a Nordic legend 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.439
 quite similar to the Japanese one too 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.509
 it is said that they were inspired by four 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:54.210
 Chinese constellations of the same name 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:56.520
 15 there is a video game for the game

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.030
 exclusively sold in japan in the

 among others fighting counterattack 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.810
 last mile of this series in a way 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:20.190
 similar to what happens in games of 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:22.289
 super smash bros de nintendo 16 stopper 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.240
 ibra alves the commentators of the

 animated version were added for 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.639
 play that role in tournaments 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.650
 However, these do not exist in the version 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:34.560
 original since whoever has this 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:38.610

 third season 18 the phrase goussot 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:53.970
 was replaced by let it right 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.800
 possibly to avoid references to 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.039
 the house with shotgun but in 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.319
 official reasoning is unknown 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:04.219
