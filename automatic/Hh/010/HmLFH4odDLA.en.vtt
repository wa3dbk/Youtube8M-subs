00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.370 
long-lasting liner that you want I would
actually<00:01:24.670> recommend<00:01:24.970> to<00:01:25.479> use<00:01:25.659> a<00:01:25.690> gel<00:01:26.170> liner

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
actually recommend to use a gel liner

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.170 
actually recommend to use a gel liner
because<00:01:26.650> it<00:01:26.920> will<00:01:27.040> last<00:01:27.220> a<00:01:27.430> lot<00:01:27.670> longer<00:01:27.729> and

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
because it will last a lot longer and

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.450 
because it will last a lot longer and
