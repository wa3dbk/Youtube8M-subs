00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 ah 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.540
 hello everyone I bring you another one of the myths 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.340
 blank then all the zombies in the 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.290
 knock down map and well you know that 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.510
 this map gives a lot to talk about the 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.560
 people are fed a lot of things here but 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.689
 well before I start I would like 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.740
 tell you that if you can put me in the 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.810
 comments if you want to participate 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.390
 with me in this series since I've seen 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.800
 that I quite like to go putting some 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.570
 of the myths that people invent 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.309
 dare but things that really people are 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.140
 he creates them, not the typical thing that comes to you 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.270
 the typical one who tells you so because my 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.460
 mittal cousin my friend has seen it 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.379
 such and really that person believes the 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.730
 lie that is telling you not because that 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.649
 kind of things are what I would like 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.390
 that you would put in from time to time or about 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.190
 everything in this series in the comments 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.899
 for us to laugh good 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.120
 and I will try to at least deny it 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.649
 and nothing is simply that 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.750
 basically for you to participate a bit 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.850
 also with me in this series not good 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.110
 I'm going to talk about the myth of this video and 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.460
 that you are seeing that we are on the map 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.930
 from nocte although he has put me like that to fly 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.850
 a little bit I'm showing a little bit what 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.789
 it is this road here that has had 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.070
 pretty good enough to talk about and 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:15.350
 another one that there is at the bottom good we are 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.039
 in search of the lost bus of luque town 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.700
 the famous bus that everyone looks for and 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:22.259
 nobody finds 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.909
 the typical one that always says yes yes that I 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.189
 I got on the bus and I went until transit is 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.649
 Luque, so clear, you do not think so 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.270
 nor you champion but good 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.159
 let's find it worth it so that people 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.560
 because his paranoia is not necessary to do 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.450
 the bottom road is boiling is 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.009
 quite long but good let's get there 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.780
 at the end you are going to see that as always 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.189
 there is a cut of graphics there is nothing 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.229
 out of the maps forget that 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.789
 have physical things can be worth of 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.130
 background to the best so typical a 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.049
 things like that but it's going to be not 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.939
 transparent is worth but you can 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.890
 to pass, it is very different 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.899
 It has no texture, it is not solid, it is worth 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.039
 then it is impossible to get there the 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.509
 only way you are seeing is 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.039
 float like that a little in the air you know 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.679
 that we are using a ps3 index 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.030
 worth a hack worth to float like this 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.799
 in the air and being able to get to places 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.799
 inaccessible not this game was with 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.660
 cease as always and good you are already 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.640
 seeing there is no bus around here yes 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.760
 that it's true that an audio sounds in the 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.890
 game and the bus horn sounds but 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.470
 the bus here I assure you that it is not 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.540
 nowhere does the map repay me but 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.459
 a lot of times I do not know how many 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.470
 turns it gives me the map and there is no 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.360
 bus is worth it so neither my cousin has 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.220
 arrived nor my friend has arrived 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.050
 no bus arrived because it was not 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.020
 there is no way or anything 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.420
 transit or here the rock is invented 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.670
 each one that you know it but good yes 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.560
 which is a myth that has long since 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.450
 given what to talk about since yes it is 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.090
 true that there is an audio of a horn 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.340
 ok but it does not mean that the 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.260
 bus out there far no less or 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.790
 be for nothing is the crater there in a 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.160
 crater that there is nothing inside the crater 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.170
 and in the background there are some houses that I already teach 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.850
 in the previous video it's good that 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.130
 houses are buildings but there is no 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.750
 nothing and we are saying in the part of 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.730
 off the map but in the part where 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.209
 are the booths these are not there either 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.920
 nothing there is no bus so nothing 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.300
 that's for the people who are 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.860
 they invent that the typical not that if my 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.380
 cousin my friend 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.270
 you already know that that is all a lie 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.520
 that you do not pay any attention there is no 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.209
 bus there is no road to transit 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.040
 it's worth it or is it all invention of the people 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:26.099
 who knows if in the future 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.590
 future game can get something they can not 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.540
 make history have something to do 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.189
 but that history has something to do 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.519
 it does not mean that the bus is 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:39.120
 physically there is worth among other things 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:41.010
 same as what happens with the doctor's chungo 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.590
 with the highway with all those 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.110
 things may that in the future 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.150
 can put it to some relate it of 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.980
 some way with the story but 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.900
 physically as I say, or is it 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.060
 there so that you can go up and you 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.590
 you can go let's go to the stop of the 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.780
 bus there is out there luque town and you 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.860
 pull back yes yes of course clear that 's 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.959
 that nobody believes it 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.920
 it's like the bunker what the bunker is 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.709
 as I'm watching, I'm behind the 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.720
 bunker worth there are still people still 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.430
 there are people who keep telling me that there 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.799
 to do easter ec but that this ere 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.920
 that there is no stress that there is not 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.600
 salt no no you can not enter here voucher and 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.519
 in case you enter the only way is 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.169
 that we enter as we enter and 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.180
 that there are no stairs that go down 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.740
 an underworld or anything how invents 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.310
 the people or I who flip as it is 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.010
 current that you still believe it or that is what 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.210
 You have seen that you have not seen it 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.190
 this question is for people who 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.260
 are watching this video but that 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.850
 they really say this nonsense not what 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.750
 have seen here they have not seen it has not 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.510
 seen because you will not be able to see 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.669
 because it is impossible or is neither your friend nor 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.169
 your cousin or your brother or no one has 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.460
 could come to this invention of the 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.699
 people who do not understand why they do that 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.699
 but good 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.910
 basically that not now you are going to see that 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.610
 this already here a little bit I'm not 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.560
 floating now I'm off the map but 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.390
 close because that's the solid piece 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.190
 let's say the other part where you have 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.510
 seen that we are floating is not solid 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.610
 that's why we have to fly 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.200
 because you can not do anything else 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.430
 and around here, I 'm going for a walk 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.020
 so you can see that there is no bus 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.170
 that leads to transit and much less 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.550
 so nothing is simply this and nothing 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.380
 remember that if you want a little 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.060
 participate with me in this series me 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.430
 leave some comment some madness 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.190
 I have told someone and we 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.289
 maybe we laugh a lot 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.469
 I will try 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:27.749
 deny or confirm if it is 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:29.249
 true if it's true then I'll say hey look 

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:33.119
 This is true, we do it and it is already 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:34.319
 but well that's basically what that's worth 

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:35.969
 I'm going to leave it like that and it does not 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:37.830
 roll more I leave you with the rest of the 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:38.789
 video that is little left so nothing 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.259
 I hope you liked it and if it has 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.699
 liked to vote i like favorites and we 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:43.969
 we see in the next video greetings to 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:43.969
 everyone 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:48.699
 yes
