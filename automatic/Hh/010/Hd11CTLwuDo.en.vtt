00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.050
 specific immune systems are the lymphocytes it is cells that 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:10.910
 they specifically recognize foreign antigens and they respond to them are 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.320
 therefore the mediators of cellular and humoral immunity exist 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.439
 different subpopulations of lymphocytes that differentiate in the manner of 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.069
 recognize antigens in effector functions 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:28.689
 some lymphocytes called t regulatory lymphocytes can perform 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.559
 primarily an inhibitory function on immune responses 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.140
 the team of Professor Maxim worked on this function of history 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.910
 hammers University of Perugia in a translational research from the animal 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.630
 man 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.360
 the scientists for a CD first in the world have identified the possibility 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.200
 to make d make you war reduce the present immune response 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.640
 in bone marrow transplant given an incompatible or partially acting actor 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.190
 incompatible but also in those conditions of system malfunction 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.680
 of autoimmune diseases 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.840
 in some respects yes but in reality it is an open door 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.850
 an extremely vast field to be a man 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.890
 who can have a noticeable impact even in another series of diseases 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.609
 like autoimmune diseases 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:20.970
 after organ transplants 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.010
 we applied for the first time in the new world 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.260
 A of the cells called regulatory t cells with one of us have i 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.330
 own internal even if it is good to check 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.430
 immunity and to make our immune system announce self 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.049
 destroyed but we have separated these cells from a donor 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.860
 Previous infusion in an incompatible transplant and these stem cells 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.270
 dodik to control one of the main complications 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.960
 in bone marrow transplantation which is the transplant disease. guest his 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.890
 so-called graft versus host disease and at the same time favoring reconstitution 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.140
 immunological therefore it is essentially an organic data of 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.790
 extremely important 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.490
 and images there are also some notable clinical effects as we hope for 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.160
 coming months to further show an improvement in survival in 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.280
 these transplants extremely difficult good technical terms professor like 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.019
 always the own ie but 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.129
 discovered marco new step of time it takes for the application by ha 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:35.010
 talked of months no no these applied catholic internships are immersed 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.430
 sent island 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.180
 results in humans have already been sent for a publication that 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.209
 we hope it succeeds 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.650
 have been done on the 27 28 patients and if I remember well then there is already 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.970
 application as all new things and then need 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:53.959
 progressive 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.379
 and sometimes slow er say we are committed. 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:01.250
 and improvement 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.909
 the first step was done was a step I love 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.059
 now small successive steps are needed 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:10.119
