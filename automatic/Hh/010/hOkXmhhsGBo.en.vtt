I<00:02:13.090> don't<00:02:13.480> like<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.860> fact<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.490> wireless

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.850 
I don't like the fact that the wireless
does<00:02:15.970> not<00:02:16.120> have<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.810> number<00:02:17.050> cat<00:02:17.260> because

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860

to<00:03:36.430> I<00:03:36.459> believe<00:03:36.910> it's<00:03:37.840> two<00:03:38.110> terabytes<00:03:38.769> but<00:03:39.610> I

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
to I believe it's two terabytes but I

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.150 
to I believe it's two terabytes but I
have<00:03:39.820> a<00:03:39.850> set<00:03:40.090> up<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.360> raid<00:03:40.510> one<00:03:40.900> so<00:03:41.620> i<00:03:41.650> only<00:03:42.040> get

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
have a set up and raid one so i only get

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.890 
have a set up and raid one so i only get
one<00:03:42.280> terabyte<00:03:42.640> out<00:03:42.850> off<00:03:43.120> of<00:03:43.420> it<00:03:43.570> but<00:03:43.780> it's

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
one terabyte out off of it but it's

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.150 
one terabyte out off of it but it's
mirrored<00:03:44.290> so<00:03:44.500> I'm<00:03:44.799> definitely<00:03:45.400> keeping<00:03:45.880> a<00:03:47.160> my

because<00:03:56.530> everything<00:03:57.220> i<00:03:57.489> have<00:03:57.670> set<00:03:57.970> up<00:03:58.090> it<00:03:58.810> goes

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
because everything i have set up it goes

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.960 
because everything i have set up it goes
into<00:03:59.200> here<00:03:59.590> and<00:03:59.680> then<00:04:00.130> i<00:04:00.220> just<00:04:00.250> have<00:04:00.580> the<00:04:00.610> wires

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
into here and then i just have the wires

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.530 
into here and then i just have the wires
that<00:04:01.150> go<00:04:01.390> back<00:04:01.750> here<00:04:02.080> to<00:04:02.739> the<00:04:02.940> macbook<00:04:03.940> pro<00:04:03.970> so

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
that go back here to the macbook pro so

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.360 
that go back here to the macbook pro so
it<00:04:04.600> makes<00:04:04.720> life<00:04:04.959> easier<00:04:05.350> the<00:04:05.739> only<00:04:06.010> thing<00:04:06.190> i

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
it makes life easier the only thing i

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.880 
it makes life easier the only thing i
have<00:04:06.610> is<00:04:06.640> firewire<00:04:07.299> 800<00:04:07.510> right<00:04:08.110> here<00:04:08.380> which
