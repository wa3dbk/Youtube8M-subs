00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:06.220 

you

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.230 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:27.609 

hi<00:00:07.230> this<00:00:07.830> is<00:00:07.890> kat<00:00:08.220> with<00:00:08.460> beadaholique.com<00:00:25.429> and

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
hi this is kat with beadaholique.com and

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.950 
hi this is kat with beadaholique.com and
you'll<00:00:28.619> notice<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.160> has<00:00:29.189> ID<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.660> stands

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
you'll notice it has ID and that stands

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.749 
you'll notice it has ID and that stands
for<00:00:31.109> inner<00:00:31.439> diameter<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.310> we're<00:00:32.460> going<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.669> be

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
for inner diameter so we're going to be

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.080 
for inner diameter so we're going to be
working<00:00:32.970> with<00:00:33.150> a<00:00:33.860> 7/32<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:35.040> eighteen<00:00:35.820> gauge

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
working with a 7/32 in eighteen gauge

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.740 
working with a 7/32 in eighteen gauge
and<00:00:37.430> we're<00:00:38.430> also<00:00:38.580> going<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.030> be<00:00:39.270> working<00:00:39.450> with

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
and we're also going to be working with

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.940 
and we're also going to be working with
another<00:00:40.050> 18<00:00:40.560> gauge<00:00:40.800> but<00:00:41.340> it's<00:00:41.780> 1160<00:00:42.780> force<00:00:43.080> so

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
another 18 gauge but it's 1160 force so

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.240 
another 18 gauge but it's 1160 force so
these<00:00:44.160> are<00:00:44.490> the<00:00:44.700> two<00:00:44.940> sizes<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.410> find<00:00:46.860> are

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
these are the two sizes that I find are

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.450 
these are the two sizes that I find are
best<00:00:47.940> for<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.480> project<00:00:49.070> so<00:00:50.070> let's<00:00:50.280> begin

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
best for this project so let's begin

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.350 
best for this project so let's begin
you're<00:00:51.420> going<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.810> need<00:00:51.990> your<00:00:52.410> two<00:00:53.150> chain<00:00:54.150> nose

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
you're going to need your two chain nose

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.240 
you're going to need your two chain nose
pliers<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:55.020> like<00:00:55.290> to<00:00:55.470> use<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.770> same<00:00:55.980> pliers

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
pliers I like to use the same pliers

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.980 
pliers I like to use the same pliers
because<00:00:56.520> all<00:00:56.850> you're<00:00:57.030> doing<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.450> opening<00:00:57.480> and

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:57.990 
because all you're doing is opening and

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.480 
because all you're doing is opening and
closing<00:00:58.320> jump<00:00:58.590> rings<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.100> makes<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.430> a

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
closing jump rings so it makes it a

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.120 
closing jump rings so it makes it a
little<00:00:59.580> bit<00:00:59.760> easier<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.240> handle<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.990> as<00:01:01.980> you

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
little bit easier to handle and as you

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.130 
little bit easier to handle and as you
can<00:01:02.250> see<00:01:02.490> I've<00:01:02.700> already<00:01:02.820> opened<00:01:03.150> all<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:04.019> my

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
can see I've already opened all of my

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.109 
can see I've already opened all of my
jump<00:01:04.409> rings<00:01:04.650> with<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.400> exception<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.909> one

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
jump rings with the exception of one

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.490 
jump rings with the exception of one
because<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.509> need<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.689> start<00:01:06.840> with<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> closed

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
because I need to start with a closed

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.710 
because I need to start with a closed
and<00:01:07.799> then<00:01:08.340> I've<00:01:08.460> opened<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:09.060> other<00:01:09.180> size<00:01:09.509> as

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
and then I've opened the other size as

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.540 
and then I've opened the other size as
well<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.140> we<00:01:10.290> will<00:01:10.440> be<00:01:10.560> using<00:01:10.590> those<00:01:11.010> just<00:01:11.340> yet

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
well but we will be using those just yet

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.750 
well but we will be using those just yet
so<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:12.450> create<00:01:12.660> the<00:01:13.440> spiral<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.370> you<00:01:14.520> see

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
so to create the spiral that you see

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.940 
so to create the spiral that you see
here<00:01:15.180> we're<00:01:16.020> going<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.260> start<00:01:16.380> with<00:01:16.680> one

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
here we're going to start with one

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.130 
here we're going to start with one
closed<00:01:17.700> jump<00:01:18.180> ring<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:19.490> onto<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.640> jump<00:01:20.940> ring

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
closed jump ring and onto this jump ring

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.110 
closed jump ring and onto this jump ring
we're<00:01:22.140> going<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.590> add<00:01:22.970> one<00:01:23.970> open<00:01:24.930> jump<00:01:25.170> ring

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
we're going to add one open jump ring

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.970 
we're going to add one open jump ring
and<00:01:27.470> just<00:01:28.470> go<00:01:28.650> ahead<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:30.470> close<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.530> nice

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
and just go ahead and close that nice

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.300 
and just go ahead and close that nice
and<00:01:32.190> tight<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:33.979> that's<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.130> thing<00:01:35.280> about

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
and tight and that's the thing about

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.740 
and tight and that's the thing about
jami'a<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:37.530> can<00:01:37.770> be<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> bit<00:01:38.159> slippery<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:38.880> just

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
jami'a it can be a bit slippery so just

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.870 
jami'a it can be a bit slippery so just
try<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.020> hold<00:01:40.229> tight<00:01:40.610> especially<00:01:41.610> when<00:01:41.760> you're

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
try to hold tight especially when you're

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.320 
try to hold tight especially when you're
working<00:01:42.000> with<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.450> an<00:01:42.570> 18-gauge<00:01:44.120> just<00:01:45.120> don't

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
working with like an 18-gauge just don't

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.070 
working with like an 18-gauge just don't
get<00:01:45.479> frustrated

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
get frustrated

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.110 
get frustrated
chainmail<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.570> definitely<00:01:48.570> for<00:01:48.900> the<00:01:49.260> patient

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
chainmail is definitely for the patient

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.690 
chainmail is definitely for the patient
so<00:01:51.120> now<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:52.049> my<00:01:52.530> two<00:01:52.590> rings<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.340> I'm<00:01:53.549> going

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
so now I have my two rings and I'm going

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.210 
so now I have my two rings and I'm going
to<00:01:53.760> go<00:01:53.880> ahead<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.150> set<00:01:54.330> them<00:01:54.450> down<00:01:54.510> and<00:01:55.220> kind

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
to go ahead and set them down and kind

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.340 
to go ahead and set them down and kind
of<00:01:56.340> lock<00:01:56.760> them<00:01:57.000> together<00:01:57.210> like<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:58.260> you

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
of lock them together like that so you

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.140 
of lock them together like that so you
can<00:01:58.409> see<00:01:58.560> what<00:01:59.130> we're<00:01:59.280> going<00:01:59.400> to<00:01:59.430> end<00:01:59.640> up<00:01:59.820> doing

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
can see what we're going to end up doing

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.760 
can see what we're going to end up doing
is<00:02:00.299> we're<00:02:00.540> going<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.780> add<00:02:00.960> jump<00:02:01.350> rings<00:02:01.590> and

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
is we're going to add jump rings and

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.109 
is we're going to add jump rings and
they're<00:02:01.950> going<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.280> be<00:02:02.400> in<00:02:02.490> concentric

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
they're going to be in concentric

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.149 
they're going to be in concentric
circles<00:02:03.210> like<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.710> now<00:02:04.860> I'm<00:02:05.010> going<00:02:05.100> to

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
circles like that so now I'm going to

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.789 
circles like that so now I'm going to
pick<00:02:05.369> up<00:02:05.490> my<00:02:05.840> another<00:02:06.840> open<00:02:07.200> jump<00:02:07.440> ring<00:02:07.650> and

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
pick up my another open jump ring and

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.460 
pick up my another open jump ring and
I'm<00:02:08.729> going<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.000> go<00:02:09.149> take<00:02:09.659> my<00:02:09.840> little<00:02:10.080> hook<00:02:10.289> and

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
I'm going to go take my little hook and

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.339 
I'm going to go take my little hook and
go<00:02:10.739> down<00:02:11.069> through<00:02:11.519> so<00:02:12.239> I<00:02:12.299> keep<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.840> spiral

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
go down through so I keep that spiral

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.649 
go down through so I keep that spiral
going<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:14.609> see<00:02:14.790> how<00:02:14.939> now<00:02:15.090> it's<00:02:15.299> on<00:02:15.480> there

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
going you see how now it's on there

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.009 
going you see how now it's on there
nicely<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.609> now<00:02:17.609> all<00:02:17.879> I'm<00:02:18.029> going<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.239> do<00:02:18.480> is

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
nicely and now all I'm going to do is

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:19.990 
nicely and now all I'm going to do is
just<00:02:19.260> adjust<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.799> in

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
just adjust it in

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.840 
just adjust it in
my<00:02:20.060> pliers<00:02:20.270> and<00:02:21.100> I'm<00:02:22.100> going<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.310> close<00:02:22.520> this

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
my pliers and I'm going to close this

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.360 
my pliers and I'm going to close this
jump<00:02:23.210> ring<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:26.290> again<00:02:27.290> go<00:02:27.770> ahead<00:02:27.860> and<00:02:28.100> set<00:02:28.340> it

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
jump ring and again go ahead and set it

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.830 
jump ring and again go ahead and set it
down<00:02:28.490> and<00:02:28.970> just<00:02:30.040> adjust<00:02:31.040> your<00:02:31.580> spiral<00:02:31.880> so<00:02:32.660> that

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
down and just adjust your spiral so that

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.460 
down and just adjust your spiral so that
it<00:02:32.930> keeps<00:02:33.110> spiraling<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.240> just<00:02:35.240> repeat<00:02:35.720> so

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
it keeps spiraling and just repeat so

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.870 
it keeps spiraling and just repeat so
I'm<00:02:36.530> going<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.709> take<00:02:36.860> one<00:02:37.100> more<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:39.610> get<00:02:40.610> in<00:02:40.730> my

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
I'm going to take one more and get in my

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.610 
I'm going to take one more and get in my
pliers<00:02:41.060> there<00:02:41.360> I'm<00:02:41.600> going<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:41.810> go<00:02:41.930> down<00:02:42.290> and

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
pliers there I'm going to go down and

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.600 
pliers there I'm going to go down and
catch<00:02:43.520> all<00:02:43.930> three<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.830> keep<00:02:46.130> them<00:02:46.370> in<00:02:46.490> their

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
catch all three and keep them in their

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.000 
catch all three and keep them in their
spiral<00:02:46.940> just<00:02:47.900> like<00:02:48.140> that<00:02:48.350> and<00:02:49.750> now<00:02:50.750> again<00:02:51.110> it's

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
spiral just like that and now again it's

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.920 
spiral just like that and now again it's
a<00:02:52.100> lot<00:02:52.280> of<00:02:52.430> adjusting<00:02:52.970> with<00:02:53.060> your<00:02:53.239> pliers<00:02:53.480> but

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
a lot of adjusting with your pliers but

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.930 
a lot of adjusting with your pliers but
just<00:02:55.959> remain<00:02:56.959> patient<00:02:57.610> so<00:02:58.610> that<00:02:58.640> one<00:02:58.910> is

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
just remain patient so that one is

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.510 
just remain patient so that one is
closed<00:02:59.450> so<00:03:00.440> again<00:03:00.739> I'm<00:03:00.920> just<00:03:01.070> going<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.220> put<00:03:01.430> it

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
closed so again I'm just going to put it

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.190 
closed so again I'm just going to put it
down<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:02.060> make<00:03:02.630> sure<00:03:02.660> that<00:03:02.959> it<00:03:03.110> continues

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
down and make sure that it continues

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.800 
down and make sure that it continues
that<00:03:03.709> spiral<00:03:04.250> you<00:03:05.060> can<00:03:05.239> see<00:03:05.480> how<00:03:05.600> it's

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
that spiral you can see how it's

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.510 
that spiral you can see how it's
starting<00:03:05.989> to<00:03:06.290> develop<00:03:08.290> now<00:03:09.290> this<00:03:10.100> is<00:03:10.310> the

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
starting to develop now this is the

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.840 
starting to develop now this is the
fifth<00:03:10.700> jump<00:03:11.150> ring<00:03:11.390> and<00:03:12.100> now<00:03:13.100> it<00:03:13.280> starts<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.670> get

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
fifth jump ring and now it starts to get

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.910 
fifth jump ring and now it starts to get
a<00:03:13.910> little<00:03:13.970> tight<00:03:14.420> in<00:03:14.450> there<00:03:14.720> so<00:03:15.080> just<00:03:15.350> help<00:03:15.739> it

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
a little tight in there so just help it

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.180 
a little tight in there so just help it
out<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.070> little<00:03:17.410> again<00:03:18.410> move<00:03:18.770> your<00:03:18.920> pliers

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
out a little again move your pliers

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.660 
out a little again move your pliers
where<00:03:19.610> they<00:03:19.730> need<00:03:19.910> to<00:03:20.060> be<00:03:21.130> close<00:03:22.130> that<00:03:22.430> jump

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
where they need to be close that jump

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.320 
where they need to be close that jump
ring<00:03:23.950> again<00:03:24.950> set<00:03:25.250> it<00:03:25.280> down<00:03:25.519> so<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:25.820> can<00:03:25.910> find

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
ring again set it down so you can find

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.250 
ring again set it down so you can find
the<00:03:26.480> center<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:28.299> this<00:03:29.299> is<00:03:29.450> our<00:03:29.600> final<00:03:29.840> jump

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
the center and this is our final jump

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.170 
the center and this is our final jump
ring<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:30.769> sixth<00:03:31.220> jump<00:03:31.790> ring<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:33.820> I'm<00:03:34.820> going

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
ring the sixth jump ring and I'm going

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.430 
ring the sixth jump ring and I'm going
to<00:03:35.209> go<00:03:35.299> down<00:03:35.570> through<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:35.900> center<00:03:36.170> one<00:03:36.320> more

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
to go down through the center one more

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.120 
to go down through the center one more
time<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:37.180> this<00:03:38.180> one's<00:03:38.390> the<00:03:38.450> hardest<00:03:39.010> there<00:03:40.010> we

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
time and this one's the hardest there we

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.570 
time and this one's the hardest there we
go<00:03:40.570> so<00:03:41.570> I<00:03:41.600> picked<00:03:41.900> up<00:03:42.019> all<00:03:42.200> six<00:03:42.620> or<00:03:43.010> all<00:03:43.280> five

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
go so I picked up all six or all five

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.390 
go so I picked up all six or all five
this<00:03:43.880> is<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.090> sixth<00:03:44.570> one<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:45.130> now<00:03:46.130> I'm<00:03:46.370> just

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
this is the sixth one and now I'm just

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.240 
this is the sixth one and now I'm just
going<00:03:46.790> to<00:03:46.970> close<00:03:47.799> this<00:03:48.799> last<00:03:49.160> one<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.780> again

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
going to close this last one and again

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.520 
going to close this last one and again
set<00:03:52.250> it<00:03:52.280> down<00:03:52.540> so<00:03:53.540> you<00:03:53.630> see<00:03:53.810> how<00:03:53.930> that<00:03:53.959> spiral

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
set it down so you see how that spiral

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.360 
set it down so you see how that spiral
is<00:03:54.650> really<00:03:55.640> nice<00:03:55.820> like<00:03:56.060> that<00:03:56.769> it<00:03:57.769> matches<00:03:58.190> the

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
is really nice like that it matches the

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.030 
is really nice like that it matches the
one<00:03:58.400> in<00:03:58.610> my<00:03:58.730> bracelet<00:03:59.180> here<00:03:59.650> so<00:04:00.650> now<00:04:00.829> as<00:04:01.010> you

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
one in my bracelet here so now as you

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.840 
one in my bracelet here so now as you
can<00:04:01.190> see<00:04:01.519> on<00:04:01.760> either<00:04:02.690> side<00:04:03.170> of<00:04:03.410> your<00:04:04.130> spiral

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
can see on either side of your spiral

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.720 
can see on either side of your spiral
you're<00:04:05.540> going<00:04:05.840> to<00:04:05.959> add<00:04:06.079> two<00:04:06.680> jump<00:04:07.340> rings<00:04:07.430> and

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
you're going to add two jump rings and

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.370 
you're going to add two jump rings and
these<00:04:07.940> jump<00:04:08.299> rings<00:04:08.510> are<00:04:08.750> going<00:04:09.049> to<00:04:09.170> be<00:04:09.260> our

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
these jump rings are going to be our

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.060 
these jump rings are going to be our
other<00:04:09.590> size<00:04:09.950> our<00:04:10.310> smaller<00:04:10.730> size<00:04:11.560> so<00:04:12.560> just

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
other size our smaller size so just

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:19.960 
other size our smaller size so just
bring<00:04:13.519> them<00:04:13.700> over<00:04:17.380> okay<00:04:18.380> now<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:19.400> first<00:04:19.430> one

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
bring them over okay now the first one

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.750 
bring them over okay now the first one
is<00:04:20.030> the<00:04:20.479> trickiest<00:04:21.310> is<00:04:22.310> what<00:04:22.520> you're<00:04:22.610> going<00:04:22.729> to

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
is the trickiest is what you're going to

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.580 
is the trickiest is what you're going to
need<00:04:22.940> to<00:04:23.060> do<00:04:23.210> is<00:04:23.450> again<00:04:23.810> this<00:04:24.050> is<00:04:24.110> a<00:04:24.229> smaller

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
need to do is again this is a smaller

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.200 
need to do is again this is a smaller
jump<00:04:24.860> ring<00:04:25.160> so<00:04:25.520> you're<00:04:25.640> going<00:04:25.790> to<00:04:25.850> go<00:04:25.970> down

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
jump ring so you're going to go down

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.490 
jump ring so you're going to go down
through<00:04:26.510> the<00:04:26.660> center<00:04:27.039> hook<00:04:28.039> all<00:04:28.280> of<00:04:28.610> them<00:04:28.820> and

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
through the center hook all of them and

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.560 
through the center hook all of them and
bring<00:04:30.500> them<00:04:30.740> up

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
bring them up

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.460 
bring them up
and<00:04:32.870> hold<00:04:33.170> and<00:04:34.540> now<00:04:35.540> you're<00:04:35.960> just<00:04:36.110> going<00:04:36.380> to

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
and hold and now you're just going to

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.000 
and hold and now you're just going to
close<00:04:36.860> this<00:04:37.190> jump<00:04:37.880> ring<00:04:38.030> and<00:04:38.620> now<00:04:39.620> you<00:04:39.680> don't

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
close this jump ring and now you don't

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.100 
close this jump ring and now you don't
want<00:04:40.100> this<00:04:40.340> one<00:04:40.400> to<00:04:40.700> fall<00:04:40.910> into<00:04:41.150> the<00:04:41.360> center<00:04:41.720> so

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
want this one to fall into the center so

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.350 
want this one to fall into the center so
what<00:04:42.410> I<00:04:42.440> recommend<00:04:42.620> now<00:04:43.070> is<00:04:43.310> trying<00:04:44.000> to<00:04:44.090> hold

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
what I recommend now is trying to hold

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.010 
what I recommend now is trying to hold
your<00:04:44.630> work<00:04:44.780> just<00:04:45.740> like<00:04:45.950> so<00:04:46.750> taking<00:04:47.750> another

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
your work just like so taking another

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.840 
your work just like so taking another
jump<00:04:48.320> ring<00:04:48.440> this<00:04:49.010> is<00:04:49.070> why<00:04:49.280> it's<00:04:49.430> good<00:04:49.580> to<00:04:49.610> have

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
jump ring this is why it's good to have

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.840 
jump ring this is why it's good to have
them<00:04:49.970> already<00:04:50.270> previously<00:04:50.600> opened<00:04:51.170> and

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
them already previously opened and

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.150 
them already previously opened and
putting<00:04:52.850> it<00:04:52.970> through<00:04:53.180> that<00:04:53.390> center<00:04:53.930> hole

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
putting it through that center hole

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.490 
putting it through that center hole
which<00:04:55.210> it's<00:04:56.210> going<00:04:56.360> to<00:04:56.480> be<00:04:56.570> hard<00:04:56.810> to<00:04:56.870> see<00:04:57.230> here

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
which it's going to be hard to see here

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.390 
which it's going to be hard to see here
but<00:04:59.170> so<00:05:00.170> I<00:05:00.200> went<00:05:00.500> through<00:05:00.530> all<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:00.950> jump<00:05:01.190> rings

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
but so I went through all the jump rings

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.950 
but so I went through all the jump rings
and<00:05:01.640> it's<00:05:01.760> around<00:05:02.030> that<00:05:02.180> center<00:05:02.480> hole<00:05:02.510> again

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
and it's around that center hole again

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.350 
and it's around that center hole again
see<00:05:03.530> and<00:05:03.820> now<00:05:04.820> I'm<00:05:04.940> just<00:05:05.090> going<00:05:05.270> to<00:05:05.360> close<00:05:05.690> that

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
see and now I'm just going to close that

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:17.170 
see and now I'm just going to close that
and<00:05:09.040> there<00:05:10.040> we<00:05:10.250> go<00:05:10.450> okay<00:05:11.450> so<00:05:11.740> now<00:05:12.740> I<00:05:14.530> have<00:05:16.180> two

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
and there we go okay so now I have two

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.010 
and there we go okay so now I have two
jump<00:05:17.510> rings<00:05:17.600> to<00:05:18.590> one<00:05:18.800> side<00:05:19.360> the<00:05:20.360> easiest<00:05:20.870> thing

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
jump rings to one side the easiest thing

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.400 
jump rings to one side the easiest thing
to<00:05:21.050> do<00:05:21.290> now<00:05:21.500> to<00:05:21.560> hold<00:05:21.980> your<00:05:22.130> work<00:05:22.310> in<00:05:22.490> place<00:05:22.760> is

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
to do now to hold your work in place is

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.990 
to do now to hold your work in place is
we<00:05:24.410> need<00:05:24.560> to<00:05:24.680> add<00:05:24.800> two<00:05:25.070> more<00:05:25.100> jump<00:05:25.580> rings<00:05:25.790> to

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
we need to add two more jump rings to

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.810 
we need to add two more jump rings to
this<00:05:26.180> side<00:05:26.480> down<00:05:26.810> here<00:05:27.260> but<00:05:27.800> I'm<00:05:28.070> going<00:05:28.550> to<00:05:28.580> go

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
this side down here but I'm going to go

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.240 
this side down here but I'm going to go
ahead<00:05:28.880> and<00:05:29.300> add<00:05:29.510> one<00:05:30.200> of<00:05:30.320> the<00:05:30.440> jump<00:05:30.710> rings<00:05:30.980> on

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
ahead and add one of the jump rings on

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.060 
ahead and add one of the jump rings on
the<00:05:32.030> top<00:05:32.270> here<00:05:32.570> and<00:05:32.750> that<00:05:33.530> way<00:05:33.680> it'll<00:05:33.830> hold

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
the top here and that way it'll hold

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.390 
the top here and that way it'll hold
these<00:05:34.310> two<00:05:34.550> guys<00:05:34.700> in<00:05:35.000> place<00:05:36.040> one<00:05:37.040> more<00:05:37.190> of<00:05:37.310> the

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
these two guys in place one more of the

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.800 
these two guys in place one more of the
smaller<00:05:37.640> size<00:05:37.880> that<00:05:38.120> I'm<00:05:38.210> adding<00:05:38.420> to<00:05:38.570> these

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
smaller size that I'm adding to these

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.110 
smaller size that I'm adding to these
two<00:05:39.140> top<00:05:40.100> ones<00:05:40.130> there<00:05:40.640> and<00:05:41.890> then<00:05:42.890> just<00:05:43.700> to

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
two top ones there and then just to

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.110 
two top ones there and then just to
complete<00:05:44.540> this<00:05:44.810> I'm<00:05:45.620> going<00:05:46.130> to<00:05:46.250> add<00:05:46.370> this<00:05:46.760> last

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
complete this I'm going to add this last

00:05:47.120 --> 00:06:02.369 
complete this I'm going to add this last
one<00:05:47.390> into<00:05:48.230> these<00:05:48.380> two<00:05:48.740> rings<00:05:49.030> one<00:05:50.030> last<00:05:50.300> time

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:02.379 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:09.909 

so<00:06:03.379> now<00:06:04.030> this<00:06:05.030> is<00:06:05.330> what<00:06:05.629> I'm<00:06:05.840> working<00:06:06.199> with<00:06:08.919> so

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 
so now this is what I'm working with so

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:15.429 
so now this is what I'm working with so
I<00:06:09.949> have<00:06:10.219> my<00:06:10.430> spiral<00:06:11.349> my<00:06:12.349> -<00:06:12.409> and<00:06:13.120> -<00:06:14.120> and<00:06:14.439> you're

00:06:15.429 --> 00:06:15.439 
I have my spiral my - and - and you're

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:17.020 
I have my spiral my - and - and you're
just<00:06:15.680> going<00:06:15.830> to<00:06:15.860> continue<00:06:16.370> in<00:06:16.490> this<00:06:16.610> pattern

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
just going to continue in this pattern

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.490 
just going to continue in this pattern
I'm<00:06:17.210> going<00:06:17.569> to<00:06:17.719> go<00:06:17.840> ahead<00:06:17.930> and<00:06:18.110> show<00:06:18.229> you<00:06:18.289> how

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
I'm going to go ahead and show you how

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.559 
I'm going to go ahead and show you how
to<00:06:18.560> add<00:06:18.740> on<00:06:18.949> the<00:06:19.370> other<00:06:19.550> two<00:06:19.939> to<00:06:20.210> the<00:06:20.300> end<00:06:20.449> of

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:20.569 
to add on the other two to the end of

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:22.839 
to add on the other two to the end of
the<00:06:20.659> spiral<00:06:21.069> so<00:06:22.069> you<00:06:22.129> can<00:06:22.340> work<00:06:22.520> in<00:06:22.699> both

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:22.849 
the spiral so you can work in both

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:23.700 
the spiral so you can work in both
directions

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
directions

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.709 
directions
so<00:06:24.710> again<00:06:25.039> if<00:06:25.879> you're<00:06:26.060> holding<00:06:26.389> your<00:06:26.539> work

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:26.719 
so again if you're holding your work

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.779 
so again if you're holding your work
you're<00:06:27.500> going<00:06:27.650> to<00:06:27.710> need<00:06:27.979> to<00:06:28.099> go<00:06:28.219> down<00:06:28.490> through

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:28.789 
you're going to need to go down through

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:33.999 
you're going to need to go down through
the<00:06:29.330> center<00:06:29.750> of<00:06:29.960> your<00:06:30.650> spiral<00:06:31.039> and<00:06:32.680> come<00:06:33.680> up

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:34.009 
the center of your spiral and come up

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:38.790 
the center of your spiral and come up
making<00:06:34.699> sure<00:06:34.849> to<00:06:35.150> catch<00:06:35.330> all<00:06:35.599> the<00:06:36.469> Rings<00:06:36.710> just

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
making sure to catch all the Rings just

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.019 
making sure to catch all the Rings just
kind<00:06:39.800> of<00:06:39.860> wiggle<00:06:40.159> it<00:06:40.340> around<00:06:40.400> there<00:06:40.789> so<00:06:40.969> you

00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:41.029 
kind of wiggle it around there so you

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:45.249 
kind of wiggle it around there so you
can<00:06:41.150> get<00:06:41.240> a<00:06:41.270> good<00:06:41.509> grip<00:06:41.779> and<00:06:42.729> now<00:06:43.960> close<00:06:44.960> the

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:45.259 
can get a good grip and now close the

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:49.570 
can get a good grip and now close the
jump<00:06:45.439> ring<00:06:47.439> and<00:06:48.439> with<00:06:48.860> this<00:06:49.009> last<00:06:49.279> one

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
jump ring and with this last one

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.100 
jump ring and with this last one
same<00:06:50.389> thing<00:06:50.659> and<00:06:51.669> go<00:06:52.669> through<00:06:53.029> all<00:06:53.270> the<00:06:53.840> Rings

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110 
same thing and go through all the Rings

00:06:54.110 --> 00:07:02.589 
same thing and go through all the Rings
just<00:06:54.409> like<00:06:55.069> that<00:06:55.340> and<00:06:57.159> close<00:06:59.889> and<00:07:01.449> you're<00:07:02.449> just

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:02.599 
just like that and close and you're just

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:05.070 
just like that and close and you're just
going<00:07:02.779> to<00:07:02.810> continue<00:07:03.319> in<00:07:03.500> the<00:07:03.620> same<00:07:03.830> pattern

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 
going to continue in the same pattern

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.930 
going to continue in the same pattern
and<00:07:07.120> the<00:07:08.120> Rings<00:07:08.360> that<00:07:09.080> are<00:07:09.379> the<00:07:10.159> spirals<00:07:10.699> are

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
and the Rings that are the spirals are

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.579 
and the Rings that are the spirals are
the<00:07:11.150> only<00:07:11.300> ones<00:07:11.569> that<00:07:11.719> are<00:07:11.750> that<00:07:11.870> size<00:07:12.289> these

00:07:12.579 --> 00:07:12.589 
the only ones that are that size these

00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:14.140 
the only ones that are that size these
are<00:07:12.650> your<00:07:12.949> bigger<00:07:13.129> rings<00:07:13.430> and<00:07:13.729> then<00:07:13.940> all<00:07:14.120> of

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:14.150 
are your bigger rings and then all of

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.059 
are your bigger rings and then all of
these<00:07:14.449> little<00:07:14.659> ones<00:07:14.870> in<00:07:15.020> between<00:07:15.139> these<00:07:15.889> are
