00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
really like the color on me so I'll

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.550

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
probably begin that again but as an

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.730 
probably begin that again but as an
initial<00:01:13.950> review<00:01:14.130> um<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:16.110> hair<00:01:16.320> was<00:01:16.500> pretty

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
initial review um this hair was pretty

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.240 
initial review um this hair was pretty
good<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> one<00:01:17.880> pack<00:01:18.210> only<00:01:18.509> hair<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.770> did

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
good it is a one pack only hair so I did

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.590 
good it is a one pack only hair so I did
use<00:01:20.930> thing<00:01:21.930> near<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.470> whole<00:01:22.680> pack<00:01:23.509> and<00:01:24.509> I

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
use thing near the whole pack and I

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.149 
use thing near the whole pack and I
think<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:24.990> too<00:01:25.170> because<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> smaller

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
think it's too because I have a smaller

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.830 
think it's too because I have a smaller
head<00:01:26.549> I'm<00:01:26.970> going<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.210> show<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.390> how<00:01:27.540> much<00:01:27.689> I
