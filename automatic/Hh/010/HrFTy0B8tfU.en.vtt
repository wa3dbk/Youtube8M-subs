00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
any kind of water spray you can just

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.060 
any kind of water spray you can just
take<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.630> know<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.780> spritz<00:01:07.260> bottle<00:01:07.409> fill<00:01:07.950> up

with water then just stamp in your face
but<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> thing<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.549> don't<00:01:11.880> want<00:01:12.060> to

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
but the thing is that you don't want to

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.539 
but the thing is that you don't want to
make<00:01:12.240> your<00:01:12.420> face<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:12.960> wet<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.310> want<00:01:14.490> to

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
make it a bit damp because that way it's

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.770 
make it a bit damp because that way it's
going<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.070> absorb<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.880> bit<00:01:18.060> differently<00:01:18.540> or

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780

video on reviewing it which I'm going to

link<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.140> bottom<00:02:04.259> or<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:04.950> can

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
watch it also cream foundation works

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.859 
watch it also cream foundation works
better<00:02:08.429> for<00:02:08.819> getting<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.209> globe<00:02:09.420> your<00:02:09.599> skin

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
better for getting the globe your skin

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.449 
better for getting the globe your skin
because<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.410> texture<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.009> bit<00:02:11.129> more

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
because the texture is a bit more

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.830 
because the texture is a bit more
emollient<00:02:12.090> which<00:02:12.900> reflects<00:02:13.349> like

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
emollient which reflects like

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.530 
emollient which reflects like
bit<00:02:13.959> nicer<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:15.550> just<00:02:15.760> kind<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:16.060> soaks<00:02:16.330> into

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
bit nicer and it just kind of soaks into

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.089 
bit nicer and it just kind of soaks into
the<00:02:16.750> skin<00:02:17.019> a<00:02:17.050> bit<00:02:17.290> differently<00:02:17.709> than<00:02:17.950> your

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
the skin a bit differently than your

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.600 
the skin a bit differently than your
average<00:02:18.220> liquid<00:02:19.209> or<00:02:19.330> powder<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:21.340> if<00:02:21.459> your

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
skin seems to be dry again then and

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.320 
skin seems to be dry again then and
you're<00:02:24.040> not<00:02:24.190> done<00:02:24.400> with<00:02:24.430> your<00:02:24.790> foundation

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
then don't be afraid to use a bit more

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.240 
then don't be afraid to use a bit more
it's<00:02:29.410> not<00:02:29.620> going<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:29.920> mess<00:02:30.040> up<00:02:30.220> your

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
it's not going to mess up your

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:41.170 
it's not going to mess up your
foundation

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180

so I finished applying my foundation to
my<00:02:43.640> skin<00:02:43.969> and<00:02:44.209> that<00:02:44.359> would<00:02:44.569> be<00:02:44.599> the<00:02:44.840> time<00:02:45.079> to

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
my skin and that would be the time to

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.080 
my skin and that would be the time to
use<00:02:45.469> your<00:02:45.680> concealer<00:02:46.219> if<00:02:46.430> you'd<00:02:46.609> like<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.939> use

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
use your concealer if you'd like to use

them I've already had some under my eyes

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.630 
them I've already had some under my eyes
so<00:02:50.090> I'm<00:02:50.180> not<00:02:50.359> going<00:02:50.599> to<00:02:50.659> go<00:02:50.780> back<00:02:50.989> to<00:02:51.019> it<00:02:51.439> and

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
so I'm not going to go back to it and

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.550 
so I'm not going to go back to it and
now<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.700> last<00:02:53.120> step<00:02:53.420> you're<00:02:54.019> not<00:02:54.230> going<00:02:54.469> to

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
now the last step you're not going to

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.080

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
kind of wet but the setting spray or

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.550 
kind of wet but the setting spray or
water<00:02:59.120> is<00:02:59.420> going<00:02:59.689> to<00:02:59.780> actually<00:02:59.870> work<00:03:00.290> as<00:03:00.530> a

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
water is going to actually work as a

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.309 
water is going to actually work as a
fixator<00:03:01.569> probably<00:03:02.569> if<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:02.930> do<00:03:03.079> have<00:03:03.290> a

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
fixator probably if you do have a

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.259 
fixator probably if you do have a
problem<00:03:03.680> with<00:03:04.010> foundation<00:03:04.489> lasting<00:03:04.969> on<00:03:05.090> your

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
skin I would use a makeup setting spray

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.209 
skin I would use a makeup setting spray
rather<00:03:08.180> than<00:03:08.480> just<00:03:08.719> a<00:03:08.900> water<00:03:09.109> spray<00:03:09.469> but<00:03:10.040> all<00:03:10.189> I

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:10.219 
rather than just a water spray but all I

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:12.699 
rather than just a water spray but all I
have<00:03:10.579> oily<00:03:10.939> skin<00:03:10.969> this<00:03:11.480> just<00:03:11.810> works<00:03:12.349> pretty

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
have oily skin this just works pretty

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.890 
have oily skin this just works pretty
well<00:03:12.829> for<00:03:12.980> me<00:03:13.340> and<00:03:13.370> it<00:03:13.760> lasts<00:03:14.239> all<00:03:14.419> day<00:03:14.480> without

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.259 
well for me and it lasts all day without
creasing<00:03:15.409> so<00:03:16.220> I'm<00:03:16.280> just<00:03:16.489> going<00:03:16.669> to<00:03:16.730> spray<00:03:17.000> one
