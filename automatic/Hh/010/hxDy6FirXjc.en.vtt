what<00:01:47.729> you're<00:01:47.850> hearing<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:49.080> between<00:01:49.260> the

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
what you're hearing is in between the

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.800 
what you're hearing is in between the
bowing<00:01:50.040> affect<00:01:50.580> your<00:01:50.729> hearing<00:01:50.850> feedback

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.680 

let's<00:01:54.810> say<00:01:55.369> he<00:01:56.369> also<00:01:56.640> it's<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.060> same<00:01:57.300> kind<00:01:57.570> of

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
let's say he also it's the same kind of

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.359 
let's say he also it's the same kind of
effect<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.050> he<00:01:58.170> did<00:01:58.380> on<00:01:59.660> on<00:02:00.660> atomic<00:02:01.140> punk<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
effect that he did on on atomic punk the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:10.550 
effect that he did on on atomic punk the
intro<00:02:08.660> it's<00:02:09.660> not<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.929> end<00:02:10.050> that's<00:02:10.140> our<00:02:10.320> phaser

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
intro it's not the end that's our phaser

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
intro it's not the end that's our phaser
so<00:02:10.920> didn't<00:02:11.310> one<00:02:11.430> sound<00:02:11.780> as<00:02:12.780> good<00:02:16.430> we're<00:02:17.430> just

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
so didn't one sound as good we're just

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:36.670 
so didn't one sound as good we're just
using<00:02:17.730> just<00:02:17.820> a<00:02:18.000> role<00:02:18.180> in<00:02:18.300> practice<00:02:18.690> amp<00:02:18.870> right

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.949 

and<00:02:37.680> so<00:02:38.519> that's<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.820> same<00:02:39.060> effect<00:02:39.450> here<00:02:39.750> just

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
and so that's the same effect here just

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.979 
and so that's the same effect here just
you're<00:02:40.170> just<00:02:40.410> rubbing<00:02:40.590> all<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.280> strings<00:02:41.989> on

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
you're just rubbing all the strings on

00:02:42.989 --> 00:03:00.860 
you're just rubbing all the strings on
I'm<00:02:43.350> muting<00:02:55.220> so<00:02:56.220> that's<00:02:59.269> kind<00:03:00.269> of<00:03:00.420> version<00:03:00.780> of

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
I'm muting so that's kind of version of

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.520 
I'm muting so that's kind of version of
that<00:03:01.049> but<00:03:01.890> yeah<00:03:02.549> so<00:03:03.269> that's<00:03:03.480> all<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.840> is

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.500 

and<00:03:07.980> I<00:03:08.250> remember<00:03:08.730> I'm<00:03:08.820> just<00:03:09.060> doing<00:03:09.240> the<00:03:09.330> low

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
and I remember I'm just doing the low

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.130 
and I remember I'm just doing the low
e-string<00:03:11.000> that's<00:03:12.000> why<00:03:12.090> I'm<00:03:12.210> not<00:03:12.360> muting<00:03:12.810> with

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
e-string that's why I'm not muting with

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.020 
e-string that's why I'm not muting with
this<00:03:13.290> hand<00:03:14.780> I'm<00:03:15.780> letting<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.820> low<00:03:17.820> e-string

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
this hand I'm letting the low e-string

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:34.830 
this hand I'm letting the low e-string
ring<00:03:18.480> out

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.990 

you<00:03:35.840> get<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.319> idea<00:03:36.490> and<00:03:37.490> you<00:03:37.550> can<00:03:37.730> tell<00:03:37.910> what

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
you get the idea and you can tell what

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.910 
you get the idea and you can tell what
I'm<00:03:38.060> doing

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
I'm doing

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.510 
I'm doing
oh<00:03:40.780> yeah<00:03:41.780> I<00:03:41.840> was<00:03:41.900> gonna<00:03:42.020> show<00:03:42.230> you<00:03:42.290> guys<00:03:42.520> but

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
wondering why I got this stuff up here

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.110 
wondering why I got this stuff up here
when<00:03:45.860> I<00:03:45.920> was<00:03:46.040> a<00:03:46.100> kid<00:03:46.340> I<00:03:46.520> still<00:03:46.760> like<00:03:46.850> to<00:03:46.970> mess

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
when I was a kid I still like to mess

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.940 
when I was a kid I still like to mess
around<00:03:47.300> with<00:03:47.600> getting<00:03:48.020> different<00:03:48.350> sounds<00:03:48.800> and

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
around with getting different sounds and

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.500 
around with getting different sounds and
that's<00:03:49.610> probably<00:03:49.850> one<00:03:49.970> of<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.090> reasons<00:03:50.180> why<00:03:50.480> I

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
that's probably one of the reasons why I

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.720 
that's probably one of the reasons why I
liked<00:03:50.780> Eddie<00:03:51.200> is<00:03:51.530> because<00:03:51.920> he<00:03:52.459> was<00:03:52.580> always

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
liked Eddie is because he was always

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.520 
liked Eddie is because he was always
getting<00:03:52.880> all<00:03:53.060> these<00:03:53.180> really<00:03:53.570> weird<00:03:53.840> sounds

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
getting all these really weird sounds

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.220 
getting all these really weird sounds
with<00:03:54.620> his<00:03:54.650> guitars<00:03:55.070> and<00:03:55.570> sighs<00:03:56.570> to<00:03:56.870> actually

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
with his guitars and sighs to actually

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.370 
with his guitars and sighs to actually
play<00:03:57.440> with<00:03:57.800> a<00:03:58.130> quarter<00:03:58.989> and<00:03:59.989> of<00:04:00.080> course<00:04:00.290> you
