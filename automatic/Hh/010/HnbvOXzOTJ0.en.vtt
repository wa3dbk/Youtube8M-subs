00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
space in Windows so if you're running

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.349 
space in Windows so if you're running
low<00:00:05.069> and<00:00:05.220> you<00:00:05.310> need<00:00:05.490> to<00:00:05.609> make<00:00:05.759> up<00:00:05.910> some<00:00:06.089> space

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
low and you need to make up some space

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.750 
low and you need to make up some space
here's<00:00:06.779> how<00:00:07.080> first<00:00:07.799> thing<00:00:08.040> let's<00:00:08.370> decrease

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
here's how first thing let's decrease

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.509 
here's how first thing let's decrease
your<00:00:09.240> disk<00:00:09.510> usage<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.710> recycle<00:00:11.190> bin<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.429> a

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
your disk usage the recycle bin is a

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.220 
your disk usage the recycle bin is a
common<00:00:11.820> place<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.269> people<00:00:12.420> use<00:00:12.719> up<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:13.019> lot<00:00:13.049> of

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
common place of people use up a lot of

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.020 
common place of people use up a lot of
space<00:00:13.559> on<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.950> machine<00:00:14.309> so<00:00:14.340> right-click<00:00:14.759> on

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
space on the machine so right-click on

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.390 
space on the machine so right-click on
the<00:00:15.150> recycle<00:00:15.599> bin<00:00:15.750> go<00:00:16.379> into<00:00:16.650> properties<00:00:17.160> and

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
the recycle bin go into properties and

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.609 
the recycle bin go into properties and
then<00:00:17.789> you'll<00:00:18.210> see<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.510> there's<00:00:19.289> an<00:00:19.410> option

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
then you'll see that there's an option

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.970 
then you'll see that there's an option
for<00:00:19.890> setting<00:00:20.340> up<00:00:20.490> one<00:00:21.350> option<00:00:22.350> here<00:00:22.590> for<00:00:22.619> all

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
for setting up one option here for all

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.179 
for setting up one option here for all
drives<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.779> have<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.230> set<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.560> like<00:00:25.710> one<00:00:25.980> or

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
drives and I have it set to like one or

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.939 
drives and I have it set to like one or
two<00:00:26.220> percent<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:27.000> my<00:00:27.750> total<00:00:27.810> disk<00:00:28.439> space<00:00:28.619> if

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
two percent of my total disk space if

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.070 
two percent of my total disk space if
you<00:00:28.980> have<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.460> percentage<00:00:30.029> set<00:00:30.750> really<00:00:31.050> high

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
you have the percentage set really high

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.220 
you have the percentage set really high
then<00:00:31.590> you're<00:00:31.710> using<00:00:31.920> up<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.250> lot<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.430> space

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
then you're using up a lot of space

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.260 
then you're using up a lot of space
unnecessarily<00:00:34.260> right<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.219> lower<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.910> down

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
unnecessarily right so lower that down

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.910 
unnecessarily right so lower that down
and<00:00:36.719> if<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.140> want<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.350> check<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.620> see<00:00:37.770> well

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
and if you want to check and see well

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.440 
and if you want to check and see well
how<00:00:38.070> much<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.280> one<00:00:38.610> percent<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.120> your<00:00:39.210> hard

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
how much is one percent of your hard

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.209 
how much is one percent of your hard
drive<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.870> can<00:00:40.020> always<00:00:40.140> go<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.829> local

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
drive you can always go to the local

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.779 
drive you can always go to the local
disk<00:00:41.550> C<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.270> then<00:00:42.719> check<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.200> say<00:00:43.350> ok<00:00:43.649> my<00:00:44.550> C

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789

hundred Meg's worth of stuff to delete
and<00:05:32.630> that<00:05:33.630> you<00:05:33.690> can<00:05:33.840> go<00:05:33.960> ahead<00:05:34.080> and<00:05:34.260> do<00:05:34.380> that

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:34.529 
and that you can go ahead and do that

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:36.560 
and that you can go ahead and do that
using<00:05:35.070> the<00:05:35.400> cleaner<00:05:35.700> but<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:36.300> cleaner

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
using the cleaner but the cleaner

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.830 
using the cleaner but the cleaner
doesn't<00:05:36.840> really<00:05:37.320> free<00:05:38.310> up<00:05:38.430> all<00:05:38.700> of<00:05:38.969> the<00:05:39.150> areas

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
doesn't really free up all of the areas

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.959 
doesn't really free up all of the areas
of<00:05:40.080> Windows<00:05:41.070> so<00:05:41.190> that's<00:05:41.370> why<00:05:41.550> this<00:05:41.610> is<00:05:41.760> the

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:41.969 
of Windows so that's why this is the

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:43.730 
of Windows so that's why this is the
last<00:05:42.180> resort<00:05:42.570> that<00:05:42.810> you<00:05:42.900> do<00:05:43.050> at<00:05:43.200> the<00:05:43.320> very<00:05:43.500> end

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
last resort that you do at the very end

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.560 
last resort that you do at the very end
so<00:05:44.490> there<00:05:44.610> you<00:05:44.700> go<00:05:44.849> a<00:05:44.880> whole<00:05:45.120> bunch<00:05:45.419> of

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
so there you go a whole bunch of

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.180 
so there you go a whole bunch of
different<00:05:45.719> things<00:05:45.990> you<00:05:46.289> can<00:05:46.409> do<00:05:46.680> to<00:05:46.830> clean<00:05:47.070> up

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
different things you can do to clean up

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.300 
different things you can do to clean up
your<00:05:47.340> PC<00:05:47.760> for<00:05:48.690> Windows<00:05:49.080> I<00:05:49.380> hope<00:05:49.860> you<00:05:50.010> can<00:05:50.159> free

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
your PC for Windows I hope you can free

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.219 
your PC for Windows I hope you can free
up<00:05:50.430> some<00:05:50.610> space<00:05:50.669> and<00:05:51.180> you<00:05:51.599> enjoyed<00:05:51.900> the<00:05:52.080> video
