00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.440
 hello today also on how to make phones 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.690
 Cell phones or tablet for your dolls 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.350
 monster high first here in the 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.240
 description I'll leave a link to this 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.220
 my blog where you will be able to download some 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.220
 this beautiful designs for your city 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.529
 here this sheet is now that I'm going to 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.869
 leave it there so you can download it and 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.949
 then we can start doing 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:36.890
 our phones and tablets too 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:39.340
 we will need gaston can be any 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.340
 type of box 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:49.809
 glue scissors in bagÃ  and pen 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.320
 now we will pursue first of all 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:56.110
 count all our images and then 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.970
 continue I have already cut my 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.970
 images are some accounts 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.650
 if you can not print the template 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.830
 although technically it is very cheap since 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.500
 it costs me only a peso the 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.900
 impression is that if you can not 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.930
 print you can this catch some brochure 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.270
 where cell phones come and there you can 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.240
 cut the phone images 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.860
 OK 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.320
 okay now let's go let's take the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.350
 pieces of cardboard now we are going to 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.909
 translate our screen at this height 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.189
 from the back since this is the 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.070
 screen and this basket back does not 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.340
 we have to hit like this but we need 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:42.080
 two cardboard boxes so that it is 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.000
 it hard enough 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.710
 you also have to paint it on the part of 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.020
 back because if we can not shut up 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.020
 the image that we just cut 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.649
 here we already have our two templates 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.060
 then we will be able to do our 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.709
 iphone 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.709
 now if we want to do our 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.110
 tablet as well as the templates that 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.739
 you can translate me simply 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.739
 they can paste 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.750
 now that if you want a phone that 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.359
 open let's take for example can 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.680
 see here in the template that let 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:36.030
 there is a division in the middle that is 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.030
 white color on each phone 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.070
 so let's cut a template between 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.070
 well just side let's see in the middle 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:56.000
 and in a carton and masters 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.000
 elect angle totally 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.480
 As you can see, I've already seen 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.780
 cut some of the designs 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:21.360
 I'm leaving the templates 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.740
 I am stuck in it is also cardboard worth 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.230
 now once and we have already cut 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.530
 our designs we could start to 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.660
 paste 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.620
 our 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.620
 covers 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.500
 in the template I have left these 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:58.100
 small these little pictures in 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.100
 coffin shape and these from the tablet 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:06.110
 well once we have cut both 

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:07.289
 let's put our image of 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.969
 coffin 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.770
 it can be for the front to 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:12.869
 the back I did not do for the 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.680
 back and with a vision we're going 

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:15.680
 to shape 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:23.700
 then we're just going to cut what 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.700
 let's make two pieces of cardboard 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:24.080
 technically if all this is very easy 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:30.520
 is the sword dolls or more than anything 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:33.340
 because I did it for iphone 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.080
 since I do not like to be in any 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.370
 remember that many designs in the 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.139
 template 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.449
 you can choose the one you like most and 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:42.750
 the one you love most are very nice and 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:44.970
 easy to make 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.480
 and technically good everything is silver and 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.480
 taste of life
