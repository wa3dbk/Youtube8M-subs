00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
started I'll show you how to do it when

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.420 
started I'll show you how to do it when
it<00:00:25.840> comes<00:00:26.080> to<00:00:26.260> a<00:00:26.290> taking<00:00:26.710> the<00:00:26.800> back<00:00:27.130> end<00:00:27.340> of

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
it comes to a taking the back end of

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.220 
it comes to a taking the back end of
this<00:00:27.520> bike<00:00:27.730> apart<00:00:28.030> bear<00:00:28.810> with<00:00:28.990> me<00:00:29.140> because

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
this bike apart bear with me because

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.660 
this bike apart bear with me because
I've<00:00:29.470> actually<00:00:29.890> had<00:00:30.190> to<00:00:30.310> kind<00:00:30.460> of<00:00:30.550> put

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
I've actually had to kind of put

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.330 
I've actually had to kind of put
everything<00:00:30.789> back<00:00:31.090> on<00:00:31.390> out<00:00:31.930> of<00:00:32.110> memory<00:00:32.410> so<00:00:32.680> I'm

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
everything back on out of memory so I'm

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.549 
everything back on out of memory so I'm
pretty<00:00:33.489> sure<00:00:33.700> this<00:00:33.879> will<00:00:34.030> be<00:00:34.149> accurate<00:00:34.559> so

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
pretty sure this will be accurate so

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.860 
pretty sure this will be accurate so
anyway<00:00:35.949> I<00:00:36.399> think<00:00:37.120> the<00:00:37.210> first<00:00:37.420> step<00:00:37.659> would<00:00:37.809> be

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
anyway I think the first step would be

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.349 
anyway I think the first step would be
to<00:00:37.989> go<00:00:38.170> ahead<00:00:38.289> and<00:00:38.530> remove<00:00:38.649> the<00:00:38.920> seat

00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:39.359 
to go ahead and remove the seat

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:41.399 
to go ahead and remove the seat
basically<00:00:40.359> all<00:00:40.449> is<00:00:40.690> involved<00:00:40.960> is<00:00:41.170> there's<00:00:41.319> a

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:41.409 
basically all is involved is there's a

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:42.989 
basically all is involved is there's a
screw<00:00:41.620> under<00:00:41.920> here<00:00:42.249> and<00:00:42.460> one<00:00:42.699> on<00:00:42.850> the<00:00:42.969> other

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:42.999 
screw under here and one on the other

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:44.759 
screw under here and one on the other
side<00:00:43.390> just<00:00:43.690> go<00:00:44.109> ahead<00:00:44.199> and<00:00:44.350> remove<00:00:44.589> those

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
side just go ahead and remove those

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:46.979 
side just go ahead and remove those
screws<00:00:45.100> and<00:00:45.789> then<00:00:45.909> the<00:00:46.120> seat<00:00:46.480> I<00:00:46.600> think<00:00:46.839> should

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
screws and then the seat I think should

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:56.729 
screws and then the seat I think should
just<00:00:47.199> slide<00:00:47.319> right<00:00:47.379> off<00:00:50.159> that<00:00:51.159> was<00:00:51.280> easy<00:00:55.739> okay

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
just slide right off that was easy okay

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.799 
just slide right off that was easy okay
and<00:00:56.859> I<00:00:56.920> think<00:00:57.129> the<00:00:57.249> next<00:00:57.399> step<00:00:58.120> would<00:00:58.420> be<00:00:58.479> to<00:00:58.569> go

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
and I think the next step would be to go

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.840 
and I think the next step would be to go
ahead<00:00:58.839> and<00:00:59.229> if<00:00:59.769> you<00:00:59.920> can<00:01:00.069> see<00:01:00.249> your<00:01:00.399> wiring

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
ahead and if you can see your wiring

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.479 
ahead and if you can see your wiring
there<00:01:01.059> should<00:01:01.659> be<00:01:01.749> right<00:01:01.899> in<00:01:02.019> this<00:01:02.109> area<00:01:02.260> here

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
there should be right in this area here

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.420 
there should be right in this area here
go<00:01:03.489> ahead<00:01:03.729> and<00:01:03.879> unplug<00:01:04.150> your<00:01:04.600> wires<00:01:04.809> from<00:01:05.080> this

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
go ahead and unplug your wires from this

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.820 

okay<00:01:40.510> let's<00:01:40.720> go<00:01:40.780> ahead<00:01:40.900> and<00:01:41.110> remove<00:01:41.410> this<00:01:41.650> last

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.950 
okay let's go ahead and remove this last
screw<00:01:42.160> here<00:01:42.400> you<00:01:43.330> may<00:01:43.450> want<00:01:43.480> to<00:01:43.660> go<00:01:43.780> ahead<00:01:43.810> and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
screw here you may want to go ahead and

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.830 
screw here you may want to go ahead and
disconnect<00:01:44.110> these<00:01:44.560> lights<00:01:45.160> from<00:01:45.340> this<00:01:45.580> little

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
disconnect these lights from this little

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.870 
disconnect these lights from this little
keeper<00:01:46.840> there<00:01:47.050> so<00:01:47.320> these<00:01:47.470> chrome<00:01:48.310> pieces<00:01:48.700> come

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
keeper there so these chrome pieces come

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.240 
keeper there so these chrome pieces come
off<00:01:49.030> when<00:01:49.270> you<00:01:49.360> undo<00:01:49.720> their<00:01:49.870> bolts<00:01:53.250> sameer

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
off when you undo their bolts sameer

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.380 
off when you undo their bolts sameer
that'll<00:01:54.460> come<00:01:54.550> off

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:15.120 

then<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.420> think<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.900> fingers<00:02:01.350> should<00:02:01.440> come<00:02:01.650> off

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.580 

okay<00:02:15.820> then<00:02:16.000> go<00:02:16.180> ahead<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:16.410> loosen<00:02:17.410> these

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
okay then go ahead and loosen these

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.990 
okay then go ahead and loosen these
screws<00:02:17.740> in<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.130> scrub<00:02:18.370> there<00:02:18.580> I'm<00:02:18.700> go<00:02:18.850> ahead

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
screws in the scrub there I'm go ahead

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.310 
screws in the scrub there I'm go ahead
and<00:02:19.090> take<00:02:19.210> the<00:02:19.330> chain<00:02:19.540> guard<00:02:19.810> off<00:02:19.960> for<00:02:20.200> now

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
and take the chain guard off for now

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.500 
and take the chain guard off for now
just<00:02:20.620> so<00:02:20.740> it's<00:02:20.890> not<00:02:21.040> in<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.310> way<00:02:21.490> kind<00:02:22.300> of<00:02:22.390> to

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
just so it's not in the way kind of to

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.390 
just so it's not in the way kind of to
push<00:02:22.690> forward<00:02:22.990> there's<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:23.860> little<00:02:24.010> pin<00:02:24.250> on

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
push forward there's a little pin on

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.940 
push forward there's a little pin on
there<00:02:24.580> that<00:02:25.260> keep<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.410> on<00:02:26.590> we'll<00:02:26.740> go<00:02:26.830> ahead

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
there that keep that on we'll go ahead

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:36.450 
there that keep that on we'll go ahead
and<00:02:27.040> take<00:02:27.130> that<00:02:27.160> off<00:02:27.430> too<00:02:34.920> let's<00:02:35.920> go<00:02:36.070> ahead<00:02:36.190> and

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
and take that off too let's go ahead and

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.550 
and take that off too let's go ahead and
remove<00:02:36.910> this<00:02:37.090> rear<00:02:37.360> section<00:02:37.960> maybe<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.290> little

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
remove this rear section maybe a little

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.860 
remove this rear section maybe a little
easier<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:38.980> work<00:02:39.130> on<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.370> motorcycle<00:02:39.720> if<00:02:40.720> we

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
easier to work on the motorcycle if we

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.120 
easier to work on the motorcycle if we
can<00:02:41.020> get<00:02:41.170> this<00:02:41.290> off<00:02:41.500> here<00:02:41.710> so<00:02:41.740> anyway

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
can get this off here so anyway

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.410 
can get this off here so anyway
basically<00:02:42.520> there's<00:02:42.670> just<00:02:42.850> a<00:02:42.940> bolt<00:02:43.150> here<00:02:43.390> and

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
basically there's just a bolt here and

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.690 
basically there's just a bolt here and
not<00:02:43.690> here<00:02:43.930> on<00:02:44.200> both<00:02:44.800> sides<00:02:45.100> so<00:02:45.400> we'll<00:02:45.520> go<00:02:45.640> ahead

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
not here on both sides so we'll go ahead

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.560 
not here on both sides so we'll go ahead
and<00:02:45.820> take<00:02:46.000> those<00:02:46.180> out<00:02:48.150> then<00:02:49.150> this<00:02:49.330> rear

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
and take those out then this rear

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.800 
and take those out then this rear
section<00:02:50.050> should<00:02:50.260> just<00:02:50.440> come<00:02:50.590> right<00:02:50.740> off
