 I hope well I'm good something 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.919
 distributed tutorials teach how 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.260
 install hacks or put house as 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.840
 you want as you want in 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.370
 the maitÃ©n can we are going to proceed everything 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.160
 what you have to do is download this 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.650
 winrar file that says in roubaix I've 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.539
 downloaded that I downloaded this 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.210
 winrar file we are going to click on 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.630
 right and we will go extend it here 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.820
 once and we will give extract 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.490
 here an extracted you we will leave this 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.550
 blondes folder 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.340
 once we have done all this 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.800
 we are going to give here in start if they have 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.910
 some 27 and we're going to write percent 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.329
 percent property 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.559
 if in your case it is the majority of cases it is 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.920
 a 28 then they give the windows key 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.460
 yr 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.820
 and we will also write percent of the 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.140
 portion once we have written the 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.140
 90 percent 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:08.530
 we are going to go to version 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.550
 and we're going to paste the folder that we 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.520
 permit 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.890
 ok we would have our hub ready 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.560
 to start and all that's needed 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.910
 now is to start our mantra my 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.910
 minecraft is the prize 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:29.110
 is for me premium and premium, so 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.860
 do not fear, I recommend you are this 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.620
 hack on servers with protection but if 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.170
 they will not be banned, you can go alone 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.690
 seen one is that we are at the point 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.200
 minecraft we are going to go to eddie profile 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:47.980
 and here we go and we will use version 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:53.310
 and we seek here relax in roubaix and 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.310
 we are going to give 6% we are going to give him play 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:05.470
 how do you see here? 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:24.520
 and good yourself to go out and to our 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.740
 minecraft with this with this lobby 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.040
 and we go for example I'm going to 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.969
 teach some hacks 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.969
 in a single player 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.140
 I have much good so I do not know 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.710
 what to do 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.140
 only because when are we going to 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:52.760
 cancel good we are here 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.770
 and well here we have our hub and for 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.230
 example let's give the air and we will 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.100
 leave flight this is a the multiplayer 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.100
 Can be done 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:06.049
 Be careful with this if we give you xy 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.230
 the famous one who creates us and who 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:11.780
 it serves to see below with our portion 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.390
 deep mine then that serves for the 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.390
 gold diamond iron and things like that 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.160
 for example, now I'm going to give to Huesca 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:29.330
 already pork that you knit 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:32.480
 subnormal, that is, we are going to give 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.510
 now v and so for example if we give to 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:39.440
 the uve will tell us fulbright by 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:42.650
 example according to map is in dark 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.230
 what can be some map is in 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.140
 dark for example at night because if 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:52.880
 we give the uve is going to put travel 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.970
 for example to see set and I think it is 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.970
 A) Yes 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.550
 is that I do not remember anymore 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.880
 I do not remember, I do not remember 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:14.819
 well then when it is night then 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:17.220
 is the people are of many spring 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.639
 bars I was staying very much 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.639
 as you see 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.690
 and if we get to the car he will tell us 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.990
 that the aura what does this mean because 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.000
 for example 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:33.229
 when we invite players 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.260
 directly to paste them restlessness that 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:39.310
 you click 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:41.530
 the kiel aura the most social that is now 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.030
 active the m will attack that pig since 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:47.460
 the crows are modes 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.560
 and the modes are the monsters at night or 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.660
 be that now it does not attack it but yes that 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.470
 I would attack only the mods of the night 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:58.350
 as diverse skeletons skeletons and 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.470
 things like that are worth now for example I'm going 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.360
 to give the lx and the animal aura that now 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.669
 is that they are animals 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.120
 and I 'm not giving it up, I 'm going to 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.120
 zoom in 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.810
 it's like we're going to say it's like a 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.340
 kind of ai wood as you have seen it because 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.940
 He has killed her without 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.940
 without such 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.120
 when I am now approaching the 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.270
 cats 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.389
 to see to see have left vale is heard 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:31.030
 not for it now I have it super close 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:35.190
 look at you 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:37.620
 no no no no no learners 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.950
 come and see 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.330
 and they go 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.330
 to see if they kill him what I do 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:52.219
 OK 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:55.099
 well now in the blazers are when is 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:56.869
 how to detect players this way 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:59.479
 It goes very well when you're at the angles 

00:05:56.869 --> 00:06:01.729
 game and it's already super well equipped and 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:04.789
 you want to see the players where they are 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:09.889
 Well, you can locate them if you hit the and 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:13.330
 he says I'm sors the h locker 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.330
 I do not know what 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.330
 I have no idea 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.330
 now 

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:27.149
 and this one is good because I 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.369
 I recommend that when they are 

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:31.919
 flying put to read not folk that is the 

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:34.009
 key that is not so will not suffer any 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.009
 hurt 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.360
 OK 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:44.870
 now I'm going to deactivate the n-ii to see 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.870
 although it happens 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:55.790
 good and here there are more cheste and there are many 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.040
