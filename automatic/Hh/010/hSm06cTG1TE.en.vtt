00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
between the gains they were trying to

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:15.809

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
deal with and the insurgents overseas

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.789 
deal with and the insurgents overseas
and<00:04:16.180> so<00:04:16.630> they<00:04:16.750> incorporated<00:04:17.469> some<00:04:17.620> of<00:04:17.709> those

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
and so they incorporated some of those

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.279 
and so they incorporated some of those
tactics<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.579> help<00:04:18.789> address<00:04:19.090> what<00:04:19.900> was<00:04:20.019> going

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
tactics to help address what was going

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.980 
tactics to help address what was going
on<00:04:20.409> as<00:04:20.560> I<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:20.949> I<00:04:21.010> suggest<00:04:21.519> that<00:04:21.789> by<00:04:22.330> looking<00:04:22.870> at

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
on as I and I suggest that by looking at

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.689 
on as I and I suggest that by looking at
it<00:04:23.080> from<00:04:23.139> a<00:04:23.289> different<00:04:23.469> cultural<00:04:24.070> lens<00:04:24.370> and

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
it from a different cultural lens and

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:25.830 
it from a different cultural lens and
not<00:04:24.729> treating<00:04:25.150> as<00:04:25.240> some<00:04:25.419> sort<00:04:25.630> of

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
not treating as some sort of

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.800 
not treating as some sort of
clines<00:04:26.320> but<00:04:26.620> rather<00:04:26.800> what<00:04:27.100> it<00:04:27.220> really<00:04:27.370> is

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
clines but rather what it really is

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.420 
clines but rather what it really is
members<00:04:28.810> of<00:04:28.840> our<00:04:29.050> society<00:04:29.500> terrorizing<00:04:30.310> the

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.170 
personally I think tagging them
terrorists<00:05:11.380> is<00:05:11.470> actually<00:05:11.830> an<00:05:12.010> incorrect<00:05:12.940> use

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
terrorists is actually an incorrect use

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.330 
terrorists is actually an incorrect use
of<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.540> word<00:05:13.750> and<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:14.110> solution<00:05:14.650> wouldn't<00:05:15.250> be

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
of the word and the solution wouldn't be

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.290 
of the word and the solution wouldn't be
terrorists

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
terrorists

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.460
