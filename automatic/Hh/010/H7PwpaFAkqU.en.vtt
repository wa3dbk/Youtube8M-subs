I<00:02:55.850> have<00:02:56.000> some<00:02:56.180> rosemary<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:57.130> some<00:02:58.130> basil<00:02:58.400> and

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
I have some rosemary and some basil and

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.700 
I have some rosemary and some basil and
a<00:02:59.270> little<00:02:59.300> bit<00:02:59.540> of<00:02:59.600> thyme<00:03:00.490> okay<00:03:02.290> now<00:03:03.290> put<00:03:03.620> the

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
a little bit of thyme okay now put the

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:16.200 
a little bit of thyme okay now put the
chunks<00:03:04.040> in<00:03:04.190> here

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.900 

and<00:03:17.210> again<00:03:17.950> I'm<00:03:18.950> doing<00:03:19.250> this<00:03:19.370> so<00:03:19.580> it<00:03:19.700> cooks

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
and again I'm doing this so it cooks

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.500 
and again I'm doing this so it cooks
more<00:03:20.360> evenly<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:21.590> thorough<00:03:21.860> and<00:03:22.300> I<00:03:23.300> want

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
more evenly and thorough and I want

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.000 
more evenly and thorough and I want
every<00:03:23.960> single<00:03:24.200> piece<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.800> be

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
every single piece to be

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.590 
every single piece to be
melt-in-your-mouth<00:03:25.550> tender<00:03:26.210> when<00:03:26.480> it's

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
melt-in-your-mouth tender when it's

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.710 
melt-in-your-mouth tender when it's
completed<00:03:27.020> now<00:03:27.320> a<00:03:27.890> lot<00:03:28.130> of<00:03:28.160> times<00:03:28.690> when<00:03:29.690> people

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
completed now a lot of times when people

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.830 
completed now a lot of times when people
talk<00:03:30.140> about<00:03:30.170> pressure<00:03:30.710> cookers<00:03:31.570> they'll<00:03:32.570> talk

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
talk about pressure cookers they'll talk

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.160 
talk about pressure cookers they'll talk
about<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.680> time<00:03:33.980> savings<00:03:34.580> and<00:03:35.170> that's

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
about the time savings and that's

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.410 
about the time savings and that's
exactly<00:03:36.770> right<00:03:36.980> usually<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:37.700> rule<00:03:38.060> of<00:03:38.180> thumb

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
exactly right usually the rule of thumb

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.060 
exactly right usually the rule of thumb
is<00:03:38.630> one<00:03:38.930> third<00:03:39.140> of<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.350> cooking<00:03:39.560> time<00:03:39.740> when

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
is one third of the cooking time when

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.530 
is one third of the cooking time when
you're<00:03:40.190> using<00:03:40.370> an<00:03:40.550> electric<00:03:40.910> pressure<00:03:41.090> cooker

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
you're using an electric pressure cooker

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.310 
you're using an electric pressure cooker
or<00:03:41.570> a<00:03:41.960> conventional<00:03:42.800> pressure<00:03:43.070> cooker<00:03:44.110> but<00:03:45.110> I

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
or a conventional pressure cooker but I

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.600 
or a conventional pressure cooker but I
like<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.830> use<00:03:45.980> it<00:03:46.220> not<00:03:46.810> necessarily<00:03:47.810> for<00:03:48.140> the

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
like to use it not necessarily for the

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.580 
like to use it not necessarily for the
faster<00:03:49.610> cooking<00:03:49.940> times<00:03:50.360> which<00:03:50.720> would<00:03:50.900> be<00:03:51.050> just

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
faster cooking times which would be just

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.490 
faster cooking times which would be just
one<00:03:51.860> third<00:03:52.190> but<00:03:52.880> I<00:03:53.120> like<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.840> cook<00:03:54.110> for<00:03:54.170> the

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
one third but I like to cook for the

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.040 
one third but I like to cook for the
same<00:03:54.710> amount<00:03:55.040> of<00:03:55.160> time<00:03:55.460> but<00:03:55.760> get<00:03:56.630> it<00:03:56.750> three

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
same amount of time but get it three

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.820 
same amount of time but get it three
times<00:03:57.320> as<00:03:57.590> tender<00:04:00.460> that's<00:04:01.460> my<00:04:01.760> favorite<00:04:02.240> mode

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
times as tender that's my favorite mode

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.060 
times as tender that's my favorite mode
of<00:04:03.830> pressure<00:04:04.280> cooking<00:04:05.320> you<00:04:06.320> can<00:04:06.470> see<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.800> size

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
of pressure cooking you can see the size

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.670 
of pressure cooking you can see the size
of<00:04:07.250> the<00:04:07.340> chumps<00:04:07.670> I<00:04:07.790> have<00:04:08.030> here<00:04:08.300> let's<00:04:09.290> put<00:04:09.590> them

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
of the chumps I have here let's put them

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.820 
of the chumps I have here let's put them
on<00:04:09.860> here<00:04:09.980> just<00:04:10.220> so<00:04:10.280> you<00:04:10.370> can<00:04:10.520> see<00:04:11.650> again<00:04:12.650> it's

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
on here just so you can see again it's

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.050 
on here just so you can see again it's
not<00:04:12.980> very<00:04:13.040> critical<00:04:15.310> that's<00:04:16.310> all<00:04:16.549> there<00:04:16.760> is<00:04:16.790> to

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
not very critical that's all there is to

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.580 
not very critical that's all there is to
it<00:04:17.209> now<00:04:18.110> you<00:04:18.170> should<00:04:18.620> add<00:04:18.830> is<00:04:19.160> approximately

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
it now you should add is approximately

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:38.230 
it now you should add is approximately
one<00:04:21.590> cup<00:04:22.070> of<00:04:22.250> water

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:46.640 

and<00:04:39.240> then<00:04:39.360> put<00:04:39.569> on<00:04:39.659> your<00:04:39.689> lid<00:04:45.020> set<00:04:46.020> it<00:04:46.169> to<00:04:46.289> seal

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
and then put on your lid set it to seal

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:55.429 
and then put on your lid set it to seal
there's<00:04:47.099> vent<00:04:47.400> and<00:04:47.610> seal<00:04:47.849> and<00:04:49.939> plug<00:04:50.939> it<00:04:51.090> in<00:04:54.439> and

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:55.439 
there's vent and seal and plug it in and

00:04:55.439 --> 00:05:00.950 
there's vent and seal and plug it in and
we'll<00:04:56.039> select<00:04:57.439> meet<00:04:58.439> and<00:04:59.210> I<00:05:00.210> like<00:05:00.449> to<00:05:00.629> do<00:05:00.780> it

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
we'll select meet and I like to do it

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:09.709 
we'll select meet and I like to do it
for<00:05:00.990> 60<00:05:01.590> minutes<00:05:08.120> and<00:05:09.120> there<00:05:09.300> you<00:05:09.389> have<00:05:09.419> it<00:05:09.569> now

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:09.719 
for 60 minutes and there you have it now

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:12.559 
for 60 minutes and there you have it now
in<00:05:09.840> 60<00:05:10.349> minutes<00:05:10.650> is<00:05:10.770> up<00:05:11.000> the<00:05:12.000> heating<00:05:12.270> element

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569 
in 60 minutes is up the heating element

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:14.600 
in 60 minutes is up the heating element
will<00:05:12.659> switch<00:05:12.930> off<00:05:13.110> after<00:05:13.500> approximately<00:05:14.129> 60

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
will switch off after approximately 60

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.339 
will switch off after approximately 60
minutes<00:05:14.789> then<00:05:15.180> as<00:05:15.449> it<00:05:15.629> says<00:05:15.840> on<00:05:16.020> the<00:05:16.110> timer

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
minutes then as it says on the timer

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:19.129 
minutes then as it says on the timer
once<00:05:16.740> it<00:05:16.860> reaches<00:05:17.219> the<00:05:17.759> proper<00:05:18.210> pressure<00:05:18.750> and

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
once it reaches the proper pressure and

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.100 
once it reaches the proper pressure and
temperature<00:05:19.680> at<00:05:20.460> that<00:05:20.759> point<00:05:21.150> it'll<00:05:21.539> switch

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
temperature at that point it'll switch

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.080 
temperature at that point it'll switch
off<00:05:22.319> into<00:05:22.710> the<00:05:22.860> warming<00:05:23.250> mode<00:05:23.460> and<00:05:23.759> I'd<00:05:23.909> like

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
off into the warming mode and I'd like

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.760 
off into the warming mode and I'd like
to<00:05:24.180> leave<00:05:24.330> it<00:05:24.449> to<00:05:24.569> say<00:05:24.810> then<00:05:25.409> a<00:05:25.439> word<00:05:25.620> I<00:05:25.740> believe

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
to leave it to say then a word I believe

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.499 
to leave it to say then a word I believe
for<00:05:26.129> 12<00:05:26.370> hours<00:05:26.580> before<00:05:26.789> it<00:05:27.150> shuts<00:05:27.360> off

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:27.509 
for 12 hours before it shuts off

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:30.019 
for 12 hours before it shuts off
completely<00:05:27.719> and<00:05:28.259> I<00:05:29.129> led<00:05:29.340> to<00:05:29.520> it<00:05:29.610> I'll<00:05:29.849> let<00:05:30.000> it

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:30.029 
completely and I led to it I'll let it

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:32.390 
completely and I led to it I'll let it
run<00:05:30.210> overnight<00:05:30.500> let<00:05:31.500> it<00:05:31.650> run<00:05:31.860> for<00:05:32.069> the<00:05:32.159> 12

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
run overnight let it run for the 12

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.309 
run overnight let it run for the 12
hours<00:05:32.819> and<00:05:33.029> then<00:05:33.419> in<00:05:33.569> the<00:05:33.659> morning<00:05:33.810> I'll<00:05:34.110> wake

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:34.319 
hours and then in the morning I'll wake

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:36.529 
hours and then in the morning I'll wake
up<00:05:34.560> take<00:05:34.860> it<00:05:34.979> out<00:05:35.099> and<00:05:35.250> put<00:05:35.370> it<00:05:35.460> away<00:05:35.550> and<00:05:35.939> that

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
up take it out and put it away and that

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.450 
up take it out and put it away and that
way<00:05:36.750> you<00:05:36.810> have<00:05:37.110> the<00:05:37.169> most<00:05:37.319> tender<00:05:37.889> succulent

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
way you have the most tender succulent
