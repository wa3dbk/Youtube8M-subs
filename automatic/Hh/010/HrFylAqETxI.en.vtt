because<00:01:04.439> before<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.159> Patriots<00:01:05.640> game<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
because before the Patriots game the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.690 
because before the Patriots game the
Patriots<00:01:06.900> had<00:01:07.260> never<00:01:07.409> won<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.740> Texas<00:01:08.070> Stadium

Patriots had never won in Texas Stadium

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.600 
Patriots had never won in Texas Stadium
I<00:01:08.869> don't<00:01:09.869> believe<00:01:10.110> any<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.920> Cowboys<00:01:11.340> fans

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
I don't believe any of the Cowboys fans

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.820 
I don't believe any of the Cowboys fans
were<00:01:11.729> using<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.210> as<00:01:12.510> one<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:12.990> our<00:01:13.140> basis<00:01:13.650> of

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
were using that as one of our basis of

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.920 
were using that as one of our basis of
that<00:01:14.220> we're<00:01:14.340> gonna<00:01:14.460> win<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.700> game<00:01:15.000> okay

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
that we're gonna win that game okay

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.020 
that we're gonna win that game okay
because<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.740> totally<00:01:16.950> different<00:01:17.610> teams

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
because it's totally different teams

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.640 
because it's totally different teams
what<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.509> do<00:01:18.600> though<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.110> past<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.590> will

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
should be proud of but it doesn't really

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.399 
should be proud of but it doesn't really
