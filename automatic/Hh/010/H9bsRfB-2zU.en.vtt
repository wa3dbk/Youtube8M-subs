00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.200
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.680
 my youtube channel to another 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.230
 movie about the dji phantom 2 maybe 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.259
 you are like us and you have too 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.349
 here a 10 news gimbel with gopro on 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.880
 phantom two attached and have it 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.429
 found that in the last time 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.430
 not so really all about and 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.260
 clean because if you try the 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.460
 gimbel lean back here with the 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.430
 lever on the back of the 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.320
 remote control then the run the 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.820
 is not really clean but so 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.519
 been a bit jerky 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.920
 this is due to the firmware of the gable 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:50.140
 that had a problem and this one 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.170
 problem that has the mom meanwhile 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.839
 eliminated and how to get one here now 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.370
 new firmware on the gimbel gets that 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.370
 I want to show you today 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.409
 to keep the pictures up to date 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.290
 you need a current one to bring 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.600
 system software for the phantom 2 is 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.899
 that the dod phantom two it is the 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.420
 software in the version 1.0 eight that is 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.770
 currently the latest version if I have 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.479
 I know what they already have 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.430
 shown several times in my videos 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.440
 the site of ideas in the 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.500
 area support here a there in the 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.450
 area of thom 2 and then in the 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.530
 download area and here it is 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.360
 the system software and also the usb 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.390
 driver usb driver install 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.340
 Install software and 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.270
 then you can use that 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.509
 yes I start the times and if we the 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.149
 then we are here and 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.039
 have these individual riders in front of us and 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.090
 Here we go now in this rider 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.270
 upgrade purely 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.940
 Now the software checks everything 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.100
 is installed and on what software 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.579
 The whole thing is like you see here 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.729
 that the software also recognized the gimbel 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.959
 once here has the cpu and once the 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.239
 gimbel mio 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.989
 and here we see that now 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:22.100
 the firmware version is 1.6 and that it 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:24.079
 a new version 1.8 are around now 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.209
 we simply click behind 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:28.070
 on the new fashion available 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.799
 then a small opens 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.590
 additional window and here we see 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:37.430
 then what changes it from the 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.790
 version 1.6 on version 1.8 there and 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.760
 you see this is the one to that 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.950
 interplay of the sky with the 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.260
 remote control of the phantom two 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.630
 it was exactly the point that I improved 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.940
 also addressed in the moderation yes 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.940
 To perform the update we click 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.760
 then down here on upgrade then confirm 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.060
 We will post the following message with yes 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.900
 and then it will upgrade now 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.620
 carried out 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:10.220
 that takes a little moment so after 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.739
 the upgrade is about a minute then 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.979
 finally done and we get here 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:20.600
 this note from great success power 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:22.250
 cycle white so on and off 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:29.120
 let's just do that 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:33.220
 phantom off but also directly 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.799
 then again and start the 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.820
 software is again new and 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:43.070
 then we go back to that 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:46.400
 upgrade area and you see now 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:51.199
