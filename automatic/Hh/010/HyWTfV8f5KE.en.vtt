not burn and it did not press up at all
but<00:05:15.720> I<00:05:15.930> kept<00:05:16.380> it<00:05:16.410> on<00:05:16.710> the<00:05:16.830> lowest<00:05:17.430> number<00:05:18.270> and

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
but I kept it on the lowest number and

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.650 
but I kept it on the lowest number and
that<00:05:18.660> was<00:05:18.870> number<00:05:19.140> one<00:05:19.800> so<00:05:20.580> if<00:05:20.910> you<00:05:21.210> get<00:05:21.450> this

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
that was number one so if you get this

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.960 
that was number one so if you get this
unit<00:05:22.080> you<00:05:22.560> need<00:05:22.710> to<00:05:22.860> remember<00:05:23.130> that<00:05:23.280> it<00:05:23.730> is

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
unit you need to remember that it is

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:30.830 
unit you need to remember that it is
synthetic<00:05:25.160> and<00:05:29.000> don't<00:05:30.000> put<00:05:30.240> the<00:05:30.330> curling<00:05:30.660> iron

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840
