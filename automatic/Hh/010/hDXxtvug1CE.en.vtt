00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979 
get down in there fender well I'm gonna

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:59.439 
get down in there fender well I'm gonna
put<00:00:56.760> some<00:00:56.909> silicone<00:00:57.350> up<00:00:58.350> through<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.799> center

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
put some silicone up through the center

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.200 
put some silicone up through the center
that<00:01:00.449> way<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.900> get<00:01:01.019> down

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
that way I can get down

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.289 
that way I can get down

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.660 

we're<00:01:22.549> recording<00:01:22.880> it<00:01:23.180> all<00:01:23.329> friend<00:01:23.869> up<00:01:24.079> but

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
we're recording it all friend up but

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.020 
we're recording it all friend up but
doing<00:01:25.670> my<00:01:25.789> best<00:01:27.070> this<00:01:28.070> is<00:01:28.280> how<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.520> Sharks

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
doing my best this is how the Sharks

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.600 
doing my best this is how the Sharks
work<00:01:29.299> see<00:01:30.110> all<00:01:30.409> the<00:01:30.619> old<00:01:30.740> woman<00:01:31.159> on<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.429> net

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
work see all the old woman on the net

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:39.940 
work see all the old woman on the net
cool<00:01:31.969> I<00:01:32.950> just<00:01:33.950> leave<00:01:34.159> like<00:01:34.429> that<00:01:34.689> bud<00:01:38.950> the

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
cool I just leave like that bud the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.830 
cool I just leave like that bud the
geometry<00:01:40.700> is<00:01:41.920> articulation<00:01:43.329> ones<00:01:44.329> gonna<00:01:44.600> have

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
geometry is articulation ones gonna have

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.950 
geometry is articulation ones gonna have
a<00:01:44.869> lot<00:01:45.200> more<00:01:45.229> than<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.799> other<00:01:46.450> it's<00:01:47.450> going<00:01:47.719> in

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
a lot more than the other it's going in

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.279 
a lot more than the other it's going in
that<00:01:48.140> force<00:01:48.469> so<00:01:48.799> it'll<00:01:49.039> dampen<00:01:49.520> it<00:01:49.610> quicker

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
that force so it'll dampen it quicker

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.320 
that force so it'll dampen it quicker
that's<00:01:51.289> what<00:01:51.469> my<00:01:51.590> theory<00:01:51.979> was<00:01:52.130> but<00:01:52.490> hopefully

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
that's what my theory was but hopefully

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.710 
that's what my theory was but hopefully
it'll<00:01:53.450> work<00:01:57.579> the<00:01:58.579> only<00:01:58.670> thing<00:01:59.060> that's<00:01:59.240> bumming

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
it'll work the only thing that's bumming

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.819 
it'll work the only thing that's bumming
it<00:01:59.840> was<00:01:59.990> when<00:02:00.200> it<00:02:00.319> bottoms<00:02:00.740> out<00:02:02.500> you<00:02:03.500> almost

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
it was when it bottoms out you almost

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.910 
it was when it bottoms out you almost
have<00:02:04.340> pressure<00:02:04.729> on<00:02:05.000> your<00:02:05.209> show<00:02:05.509> off<00:02:05.659> but<00:02:05.959> now

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
have pressure on your show off but now

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.160 
have pressure on your show off but now
I'll<00:02:07.819> deal<00:02:08.209> with<00:02:08.239> it<00:02:08.479> I'll<00:02:08.630> just<00:02:08.660> get<00:02:08.989> some

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
I'll deal with it I'll just get some

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.979 
I'll deal with it I'll just get some
shafts

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
shafts

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.110 
shafts
I'll<00:02:11.989> just<00:02:12.230> beef<00:02:12.470> it<00:02:12.650> up<00:02:12.769> put<00:02:13.640> some<00:02:13.670> different

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
I'll just beef it up put some different

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:23.710 
I'll just beef it up put some different
oil<00:02:18.099> that's<00:02:19.099> all<00:02:19.430> she<00:02:19.790> wrote<00:02:19.940> there<00:02:22.690> do<00:02:23.690> a

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
oil that's all she wrote there do a

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.630 
oil that's all she wrote there do a
