00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.439 

let's<00:00:01.170> take<00:00:01.410> a<00:00:01.439> look<00:00:01.800> at<00:00:02.070> a<00:00:02.129> few<00:00:02.669> examples<00:00:03.300> of

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
let's take a look at a few examples of

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.690 
let's take a look at a few examples of
how<00:00:03.689> we<00:00:03.750> process<00:00:04.259> visual<00:00:04.740> stimuli<00:00:05.370> this<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:05.670> a

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
how we process visual stimuli this is a

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.760 
how we process visual stimuli this is a
famous<00:00:06.180> illusion<00:00:06.810> and<00:00:06.990> as<00:00:07.259> I<00:00:07.379> mentioned<00:00:07.680> in<00:00:07.740> a

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
famous illusion and as I mentioned in a

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.970 
famous illusion and as I mentioned in a
previous<00:00:07.830> video<00:00:09.200> the<00:00:10.200> existence<00:00:10.769> of

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
previous video the existence of

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.450 
previous video the existence of
illusions<00:00:11.820> kind<00:00:12.330> of<00:00:12.679> reinforces<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:13.980> our

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
illusions kind of reinforces that our

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.570 
illusions kind of reinforces that our
brain<00:00:15.000> can<00:00:15.330> easily<00:00:15.990> be<00:00:16.139> tricked<00:00:16.529> by<00:00:16.770> various

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
brain can easily be tricked by various

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.939 
brain can easily be tricked by various
things<00:00:18.020> there<00:00:19.020> are<00:00:19.109> tons<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.529> illusions<00:00:19.890> that

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
things there are tons of illusions that

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.170 
things there are tons of illusions that
are<00:00:20.039> out<00:00:20.160> there<00:00:20.189> people<00:00:20.400> try<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.640> study<00:00:20.970> them

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
are out there people try to study them

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.029 
are out there people try to study them
and<00:00:21.300> try<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.449> figure<00:00:21.660> out<00:00:21.990> well<00:00:22.380> why<00:00:22.769> we

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
and try to figure out well why we

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.980 
and try to figure out well why we
actually<00:00:23.250> experience<00:00:24.029> these<00:00:24.359> illusions<00:00:24.840> this

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
actually experience these illusions this

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.540 
actually experience these illusions this
is<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.109> famous<00:00:25.470> one<00:00:25.619> called<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.010> harming<00:00:26.340> grid

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
is a famous one called the harming grid

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.390 
is a famous one called the harming grid
and<00:00:26.760> one<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.150> have<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.420> understand<00:00:28.400> the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
and one that you have to understand the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.470 
and one that you have to understand the
actual<00:00:29.939> explanation<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.929> very<00:00:31.500> very<00:00:32.480> complex

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
actual explanation is very very complex

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.600 
actual explanation is very very complex
I'm<00:00:33.809> going<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.050> try<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.230> give<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.860> but<00:00:35.250> I

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
I'm going to try to give it to you but I

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.830 
I'm going to try to give it to you but I
want<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.210> understand<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> significance

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
want you to understand the significance

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.930 
want you to understand the significance
of<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:37.920> what<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.250> should<00:00:38.309> be<00:00:38.550> noticing

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
of this so what you should be noticing

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.090 
of this so what you should be noticing
when<00:00:39.059> you're<00:00:39.180> looking<00:00:39.390> at<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:40.100> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
when you're looking at this is the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.670 
when you're looking at this is the
intersections<00:00:42.000> look<00:00:42.270> kind<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.690> gray<00:00:43.079> but<00:00:43.500> if<00:00:43.620> I

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
intersections look kind of gray but if I

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.440 
intersections look kind of gray but if I
stare<00:00:43.920> directly<00:00:44.040> at<00:00:44.489> an<00:00:44.730> intersection<00:00:45.000> so

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
stare directly at an intersection so

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.029 
stare directly at an intersection so
just<00:00:45.600> look<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:45.960> area<00:00:46.320> if<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.800> stare

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
just look in this area if you stare

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.220 
just look in this area if you stare
directly<00:00:47.190> at<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.789> intersection<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.870> doesn't

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
directly at that intersection it doesn't

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.260 
directly at that intersection it doesn't
look<00:00:49.379> great<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:50.430> doesn't<00:00:50.820> look<00:00:50.910> great<00:00:51.030> it

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
look great it doesn't look great it

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.060 
look great it doesn't look great it
looks<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:51.780> normally<00:00:52.289> white<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:52.890> if<00:00:52.980> you

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
looks just normally white but if you

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.709 
looks just normally white but if you
just<00:00:53.250> look<00:00:53.399> at<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.610> diagram<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.120> general<00:00:54.539> like

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
just look at the diagram in general like

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.200 
just look at the diagram in general like
stare<00:00:55.079> for<00:00:55.289> example<00:00:55.710> right<00:00:56.129> here<00:00:56.160> if<00:00:57.030> you

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
stare for example right here if you

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.939 
stare for example right here if you
stare<00:00:57.420> at<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.690> section<00:00:57.930> right<00:00:58.170> here<00:00:58.199> then

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
stare at this section right here then

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.340 
stare at this section right here then
you<00:00:59.219> should<00:00:59.670> be<00:01:00.000> perceiving<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.140> rest

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
you should be perceiving that the rest

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.569 
you should be perceiving that the rest
of<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.559> intersections<00:01:02.160> while<00:01:02.309> all<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
of the intersections while all the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.000 
of the intersections while all the
intersections<00:01:03.120> actually<00:01:03.600> look<00:01:03.809> great<00:01:04.140> so

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
intersections actually look great so

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.130 
intersections actually look great so
what's<00:01:05.280> happening<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.810> something

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
what's happening is this is something

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.330 
what's happening is this is something
that<00:01:07.530> your<00:01:07.740> brain<00:01:08.159> does<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:09.330> help<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:10.280> kind<00:01:11.280> of

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
that your brain does to help you kind of

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.060 
that your brain does to help you kind of
see<00:01:11.549> outlines<00:01:12.090> more<00:01:12.450> clearly<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:13.530> creates<00:01:13.890> a

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
see outlines more clearly it creates a

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.880 
see outlines more clearly it creates a
halo<00:01:14.549> around<00:01:15.000> objects<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:15.930> can<00:01:16.439> better

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
halo around objects so you can better

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.179 
halo around objects so you can better
perceive<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:18.000> don't<00:01:18.540> know<00:01:18.630> targets<00:01:19.259> or<00:01:19.500> threats

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
perceive I don't know targets or threats

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.480 
perceive I don't know targets or threats
and<00:01:20.780> what<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.869> does<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.350> when<00:01:22.890> you're<00:01:23.280> looking

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
and what it does is when you're looking

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.969 
and what it does is when you're looking
at<00:01:23.850> an<00:01:24.119> edge<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.900> something<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.770> have<00:01:25.950> a

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
at an edge of something and you have a

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.190 
at an edge of something and you have a
very<00:01:26.250> dark<00:01:26.640> area<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:27.689> surrounded<00:01:28.080> by

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
very dark area and it's surrounded by

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.780 
very dark area and it's surrounded by
white<00:01:28.500> what<00:01:28.770> will<00:01:28.860> happen<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.280> your<00:01:29.430> brain

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
white what will happen is your brain

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.469 
white what will happen is your brain
actually<00:01:30.329> makes<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.670> kind<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.790> even<00:01:33.299> more

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
actually makes a kind of even more

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.069 
actually makes a kind of even more
bright<00:01:33.780> area<00:01:34.710> surrounding<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.720> outline<00:01:36.720> so

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
bright area surrounding that outline so

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.740 
bright area surrounding that outline so
kind<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.470> makes<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.740> stand<00:01:38.070> out<00:01:38.540> so<00:01:39.540> if<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:39.720> a

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
kind of makes it stand out so if it's a

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.120 
kind of makes it stand out so if it's a
person<00:01:40.140> coming<00:01:40.380> down<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.680> street<00:01:40.920> and

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
person coming down the street and

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.580 
person coming down the street and
they're<00:01:41.759> coming<00:01:41.939> against<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.590> light

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
they're coming against a light

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.469 
they're coming against a light
background<00:01:43.619> or<00:01:44.280> even<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.610> not<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.299> light

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
background or even a not so light

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.240 
background or even a not so light
background<00:01:45.960> you're<00:01:46.320> able<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.649> kind<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.009> pick

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
background you're able to kind of pick

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.190 
background you're able to kind of pick
that<00:01:47.490> out<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.939> lot<00:01:48.329> more<00:01:48.509> clearly<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.049> that's

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that out a lot more clearly so that's

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.990 
that out a lot more clearly so that's
the<00:01:49.380> significance<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.759> keep<00:01:50.939> the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
the significance of this so keep the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.060 
the significance of this so keep the
significance<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.200> whole<00:01:52.380> thing<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.799> mind

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
significance of the whole thing in mind

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.550 
significance of the whole thing in mind
and<00:01:53.280> don't<00:01:54.270> get<00:01:54.509> too<00:01:54.720> bogged<00:01:55.049> down<00:01:55.200> by<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
and don't get too bogged down by the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.219 
and don't get too bogged down by the
details<00:01:56.149> about<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.360> even<00:01:57.810> though<00:01:58.049> I'm<00:01:58.140> going

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
details about it even though I'm going

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.600 
details about it even though I'm going
to<00:01:58.350> try<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.560> explain<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.070> here<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.399> here's

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
to try to explain that here so here's

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.639 
to try to explain that here so here's
another<00:01:59.880> another<00:02:00.570> diagram<00:02:01.079> showing<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.469> same

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
another another diagram showing the same

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.560 
another another diagram showing the same
thing<00:02:01.710> same<00:02:02.310> effect<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.880> should<00:02:03.210> be<00:02:03.329> seeing

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
thing same effect you should be seeing

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.590 
thing same effect you should be seeing
grayed<00:02:04.320> out<00:02:04.350> corners<00:02:05.340> right<00:02:05.490> here<00:02:05.549> but<00:02:06.270> if<00:02:06.450> you

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
grayed out corners right here but if you

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.270 
grayed out corners right here but if you
stare<00:02:06.869> directly<00:02:07.020> at<00:02:07.350> an<00:02:07.560> intersection<00:02:07.770> like

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
stare directly at an intersection like

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.919 
stare directly at an intersection like
where<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:09.030> what<00:02:09.330> you're<00:02:09.450> going<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.599> mention

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
where a is what you're going to mention

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.900 
where a is what you're going to mention
it<00:02:10.110> doesn't<00:02:10.319> actually<00:02:10.649> look<00:02:10.890> gray<00:02:11.700> if<00:02:11.879> you

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
it doesn't actually look gray if you

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.330 
it doesn't actually look gray if you
stay<00:02:12.150> right<00:02:12.300> here<00:02:12.360> it's<00:02:12.959> not

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
stay right here it's not

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.580 
stay right here it's not
look<00:02:13.580> great<00:02:13.849> and<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.390> reason<00:02:14.750> is<00:02:14.930> is<00:02:15.170> because

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
look great and the reason is is because

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.619 
look great and the reason is is because
when<00:02:15.830> you<00:02:15.890> stare<00:02:16.069> at<00:02:16.220> this<00:02:16.340> point<00:02:16.700> here<00:02:17.090> so

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
when you stare at this point here so

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.750 
when you stare at this point here so
when<00:02:17.840> you're<00:02:17.959> staring<00:02:18.379> here<00:02:18.680> it's<00:02:19.160> actually

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
when you're staring here it's actually

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.640 
when you're staring here it's actually
there's<00:02:20.030> some<00:02:20.300> light<00:02:20.569> parts<00:02:20.989> that<00:02:21.170> are<00:02:21.260> around

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
there's some light parts that are around

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.979 
there's some light parts that are around
it<00:02:21.890> so<00:02:22.430> some<00:02:22.730> light<00:02:22.910> parts<00:02:23.269> that<00:02:23.420> are<00:02:23.540> rounded

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
it so some light parts that are rounded

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.780 
it so some light parts that are rounded
it<00:02:24.140> doesn't<00:02:24.500> tell<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:24.890> your<00:02:25.400> brain<00:02:25.580> is

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
it doesn't tell it your brain is

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.180 
it doesn't tell it your brain is
thinking<00:02:25.940> oh<00:02:26.330> that's<00:02:27.200> not<00:02:27.410> much<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.800> an<00:02:27.920> edge

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
thinking oh that's not much of an edge

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.710 
thinking oh that's not much of an edge
because<00:02:28.580> there's<00:02:28.760> some<00:02:28.970> bright<00:02:29.180> stuff<00:02:29.420> around

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
because there's some bright stuff around

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.270 
because there's some bright stuff around
it<00:02:29.959> so<00:02:30.140> I'm<00:02:30.260> not<00:02:30.410> going<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.650> perceive<00:02:30.980> that<00:02:31.129> as

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
it so I'm not going to perceive that as

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.009 
it so I'm not going to perceive that as
any<00:02:31.430> different<00:02:31.610> but<00:02:32.209> when<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.390> look<00:02:32.660> somewhere

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
any different but when I look somewhere

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.500 
any different but when I look somewhere
else<00:02:33.080> for<00:02:33.650> example<00:02:34.220> at<00:02:34.400> point<00:02:34.670> B<00:02:34.910> so<00:02:35.209> in<00:02:35.330> one<00:02:35.480> of

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
else for example at point B so in one of

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.380 
else for example at point B so in one of
these<00:02:35.660> lanes<00:02:35.989> here<00:02:36.790> when<00:02:37.790> I<00:02:37.819> look<00:02:38.030> at<00:02:38.150> one<00:02:38.299> of

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
these lanes here when I look at one of

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.500 
these lanes here when I look at one of
these<00:02:38.480> lanes<00:02:38.780> my<00:02:39.410> brain<00:02:39.799> is<00:02:40.099> trying<00:02:40.580> to<00:02:40.819> my

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
these lanes my brain is trying to my

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.050 
these lanes my brain is trying to my
brain<00:02:41.750> says<00:02:42.019> okay<00:02:42.470> this<00:02:43.160> point<00:02:43.580> right<00:02:43.730> here<00:02:43.790> is

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
brain says okay this point right here is

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.650 
brain says okay this point right here is
surrounded<00:02:44.269> by<00:02:44.900> a<00:02:45.170> lot<00:02:45.440> of<00:02:45.470> darkness<00:02:46.190> so<00:02:46.849> your

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
surrounded by a lot of darkness so your

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.509 
surrounded by a lot of darkness so your
brain<00:02:47.870> is<00:02:47.930> actually<00:02:48.440> making<00:02:48.680> this<00:02:49.010> appear

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
brain is actually making this appear

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.150 
brain is actually making this appear
more<00:02:49.910> white<00:02:50.239> than<00:02:50.630> it<00:02:50.750> actually<00:02:50.900> is<00:02:51.170> but<00:02:52.040> you

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
more white than it actually is but you

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.860 
more white than it actually is but you
can't<00:02:52.459> really<00:02:52.790> perceive<00:02:53.239> that<00:02:53.420> unless<00:02:53.720> you

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
can't really perceive that unless you

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.839 
can't really perceive that unless you
compare<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.500> other<00:02:54.590> parts<00:02:55.190> so<00:02:55.640> this

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
compare it to other parts so this

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.170 
compare it to other parts so this
actually<00:02:56.390> appears<00:02:56.989> to<00:02:57.709> be<00:02:57.890> more<00:02:58.549> white<00:02:58.910> and

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
actually appears to be more white and

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.479 
actually appears to be more white and
how<00:02:59.690> can<00:02:59.750> you<00:02:59.930> tell<00:03:00.200> because<00:03:00.530> these<00:03:00.890> corners

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
how can you tell because these corners

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.339 
how can you tell because these corners
are<00:03:01.640> actually<00:03:02.090> starting<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.450> look<00:03:02.660> gray<00:03:02.930> gray

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
are actually starting to look gray gray

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.860 
are actually starting to look gray gray
means<00:03:03.650> less<00:03:03.980> white<00:03:04.340> so<00:03:04.879> when<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:05.060> stared<00:03:05.390> here

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
means less white so when I stared here

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.960 
means less white so when I stared here
the<00:03:06.200> other<00:03:06.410> corners<00:03:06.950> all<00:03:07.129> the<00:03:07.250> intersections

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
the other corners all the intersections

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.289 
the other corners all the intersections
all<00:03:08.180> look<00:03:08.599> great<00:03:09.379> are<00:03:09.980> you<00:03:10.220> following<00:03:10.459> it's<00:03:11.239> a

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
all look great are you following it's a

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.089 
all look great are you following it's a
little<00:03:11.540> bit<00:03:11.660> little<00:03:11.959> bit<00:03:12.079> complex<00:03:12.620> but

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
little bit little bit complex but

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.339 
little bit little bit complex but
because<00:03:13.430> this<00:03:13.670> part<00:03:14.000> here<00:03:14.420> has<00:03:14.690> more<00:03:15.049> of<00:03:15.230> an

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
because this part here has more of an

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.440 
because this part here has more of an
edge<00:03:15.590> your<00:03:16.160> brain<00:03:16.519> is<00:03:16.730> trying<00:03:16.940> to<00:03:17.030> enhance

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
edge your brain is trying to enhance

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.900 
edge your brain is trying to enhance
that<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:17.989> it's<00:03:18.410> enhancing<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.220> edges<00:03:19.579> and<00:03:19.790> as

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
that and it's enhancing the edges and as

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.059 
that and it's enhancing the edges and as
a<00:03:19.940> result<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.900> corners<00:03:21.380> which<00:03:21.739> have<00:03:21.920> more

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
a result the corners which have more

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.590 
a result the corners which have more
white<00:03:22.310> around<00:03:22.579> them<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:22.910> less<00:03:23.090> darkness

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
white around them and less darkness

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.759 
white around them and less darkness
around<00:03:23.870> them<00:03:24.049> actually<00:03:24.950> appear<00:03:25.489> to<00:03:25.639> be<00:03:25.760> darker

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
around them actually appear to be darker

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.259 
around them actually appear to be darker
all<00:03:27.769> right<00:03:28.040> that's<00:03:28.459> it<00:03:28.670> if<00:03:28.760> you<00:03:28.790> understood

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
all right that's it if you understood

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.819 
all right that's it if you understood
that<00:03:29.450> then<00:03:29.630> you<00:03:29.720> can<00:03:29.840> probably<00:03:30.019> just<00:03:30.470> move<00:03:30.680> on

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
that then you can probably just move on

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.020 
that then you can probably just move on
but<00:03:31.069> I'm<00:03:31.160> going<00:03:31.340> to<00:03:31.370> give<00:03:31.609> you<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:31.760> rest<00:03:31.940> of

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
but I'm going to give you the rest of

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.830 
but I'm going to give you the rest of
this<00:03:32.120> anyways<00:03:32.510> so<00:03:33.319> what's<00:03:34.310> happening<00:03:34.760> is<00:03:35.000> when

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
this anyways so what's happening is when

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.300 
this anyways so what's happening is when
a<00:03:35.870> small<00:03:36.049> spot<00:03:36.470> of<00:03:36.590> light<00:03:36.739> shines<00:03:37.069> on<00:03:37.190> the

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
a small spot of light shines on the

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.370 
a small spot of light shines on the
retina<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:37.910> ganglions<00:03:38.480> may<00:03:38.690> increase<00:03:39.139> or

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
retina the ganglions may increase or

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.750 
retina the ganglions may increase or
decrease<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.829> number<00:03:39.980> of<00:03:40.280> impulses

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
decrease the number of impulses

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.370 
decrease the number of impulses
depending<00:03:41.090> on<00:03:41.209> where<00:03:41.359> the<00:03:41.480> light<00:03:41.660> shines<00:03:41.690> so

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
depending on where the light shines so

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.740 
depending on where the light shines so
try<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.040> look<00:03:43.310> at<00:03:43.519> and<00:03:43.730> study<00:03:44.030> this<00:03:44.239> diagram

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
try to look at and study this diagram

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.629 
try to look at and study this diagram
really<00:03:45.019> quickly<00:03:45.319> this<00:03:45.919> is<00:03:46.160> what<00:03:46.310> your<00:03:46.489> brain

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
really quickly this is what your brain

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:50.699 
really quickly this is what your brain
is<00:03:46.849> doing<00:03:47.030> to<00:03:47.269> help<00:03:47.510> enhance<00:03:47.720> these<00:03:48.650> edges

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
is doing to help enhance these edges

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.949 
is doing to help enhance these edges
basically<00:03:51.709> if<00:03:52.010> light<00:03:52.519> is<00:03:52.730> falling<00:03:53.180> so<00:03:53.750> if<00:03:53.870> you

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
basically if light is falling so if you

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.449 
basically if light is falling so if you
look<00:03:54.079> at<00:03:54.200> a<00:03:54.230> point<00:03:54.410> like<00:03:54.560> a<00:03:54.829> if<00:03:55.040> light<00:03:55.280> is

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
look at a point like a if light is

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.370 
look at a point like a if light is
falling<00:03:55.819> in<00:03:56.299> the<00:03:56.630> center<00:03:57.049> where<00:03:57.230> you're

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
falling in the center where you're

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.059 
falling in the center where you're
staring<00:03:57.889> and<00:03:58.069> also<00:03:58.639> around<00:03:59.239> then<00:03:59.870> it's<00:04:00.829> not

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
staring and also around then it's not

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.220 
staring and also around then it's not
doing<00:04:01.459> any<00:04:01.609> extra<00:04:01.970> firing<00:04:02.630> therefore<00:04:03.109> it's

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
doing any extra firing therefore it's

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.170 
doing any extra firing therefore it's
not<00:04:03.349> going<00:04:03.590> to<00:04:03.680> enhance<00:04:04.099> this<00:04:04.459> actual<00:04:04.970> color

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
not going to enhance this actual color

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.909 
not going to enhance this actual color
here<00:04:05.540> but<00:04:05.989> if<00:04:06.109> you're<00:04:06.200> looking<00:04:06.440> at<00:04:06.560> a<00:04:06.590> dark

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:06.919 
here but if you're looking at a dark

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:09.129 
here but if you're looking at a dark
point<00:04:07.519> here<00:04:08.329> there's<00:04:08.599> a<00:04:08.660> lot<00:04:08.840> of<00:04:08.989> light

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
point here there's a lot of light

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.259 
point here there's a lot of light
falling<00:04:09.500> on<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:10.130> point<00:04:10.400> you're<00:04:10.730> where<00:04:11.150> you're

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
falling on the point you're where you're

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.620 
falling on the point you're where you're
actually<00:04:11.750> staring<00:04:12.970> but<00:04:13.970> there's<00:04:14.299> not<00:04:14.419> a<00:04:14.480> lot

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
actually staring but there's not a lot

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.050 
actually staring but there's not a lot
of<00:04:14.780> light<00:04:15.019> falling<00:04:15.290> on<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:15.650> edges<00:04:16.519> around<00:04:16.639> it

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
of light falling on the edges around it

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.940 
of light falling on the edges around it
because<00:04:17.389> it's<00:04:17.570> dark<00:04:17.900> and<00:04:18.169> so<00:04:18.500> as<00:04:18.650> a<00:04:18.680> result

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
because it's dark and so as a result

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.159 
because it's dark and so as a result
there's<00:04:19.489> more<00:04:19.760> firing<00:04:20.120> happening<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:20.840> so

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
there's more firing happening and so

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.550 
there's more firing happening and so
this<00:04:21.409> is<00:04:21.620> being<00:04:22.310> enhanced<00:04:23.270> more<00:04:23.960> firing<00:04:24.320> it

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
this is being enhanced more firing it

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.930 
this is being enhanced more firing it
says<00:04:24.740> hey<00:04:24.890> look<00:04:25.099> it's<00:04:25.280> bright<00:04:25.520> it's<00:04:25.700> bright

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
says hey look it's bright it's bright

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.200 
says hey look it's bright it's bright
it's<00:04:26.120> bright<00:04:26.330> it's<00:04:26.510> bright<00:04:26.719> it's

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
it's bright it's bright it's

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.939 
it's bright it's bright it's
the<00:04:27.330> more<00:04:27.479> that<00:04:27.600> fires<00:04:27.930> because<00:04:28.289> this<00:04:28.590> is<00:04:28.740> dark

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
the more that fires because this is dark

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.100 
the more that fires because this is dark
around<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:29.669> more<00:04:29.850> these<00:04:30.000> other<00:04:30.270> parts<00:04:30.690> look

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
around the more these other parts look

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.749 
around the more these other parts look
gray<00:04:31.560> because<00:04:32.220> there<00:04:32.400> are<00:04:32.550> they're

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 
gray because there are they're

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.640 
gray because there are they're
surrounded<00:04:33.150> by<00:04:33.180> more<00:04:33.509> white<00:04:33.750> so<00:04:34.199> when<00:04:34.320> I<00:04:34.350> stare

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
surrounded by more white so when I stare

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.590 
surrounded by more white so when I stare
at<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:34.919> corner<00:04:35.100> directly<00:04:35.820> again<00:04:36.180> I'm<00:04:36.389> sorry

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
at the corner directly again I'm sorry

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.300 
at the corner directly again I'm sorry
for<00:04:36.720> them<00:04:36.900> repeating<00:04:37.289> myself<00:04:37.410> when<00:04:38.009> I<00:04:38.039> stare

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
for them repeating myself when I stare

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.010 
for them repeating myself when I stare
at<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.520> corner<00:04:38.669> at<00:04:38.880> this<00:04:39.150> intersection<00:04:39.570> a

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
at the corner at this intersection a

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.939 
at the corner at this intersection a
right<00:04:40.740> here<00:04:42.110> since<00:04:43.110> there's<00:04:43.350> a<00:04:43.410> lot<00:04:43.590> of<00:04:43.740> light

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
right here since there's a lot of light

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.100 
right here since there's a lot of light
around<00:04:44.190> from<00:04:44.759> this<00:04:44.910> edge<00:04:45.150> from<00:04:45.600> here<00:04:45.900> from

around from this edge from here from
here<00:04:46.470> and<00:04:46.710> from<00:04:46.860> here<00:04:47.360> your<00:04:49.820> ganglion<00:04:50.820> firing

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
here and from here your ganglion firing

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.420 
here and from here your ganglion firing
is<00:04:51.419> being<00:04:51.630> canceled<00:04:52.350> out<00:04:52.470> it's<00:04:52.710> saying<00:04:52.979> okay

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
is being canceled out it's saying okay

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.159 
is being canceled out it's saying okay
we're<00:04:53.580> not<00:04:53.699> going<00:04:53.850> to<00:04:53.940> fire<00:04:54.330> that<00:04:54.660> those<00:04:54.990> ones

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
we're not going to fire that those ones

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:56.570 
we're not going to fire that those ones
in<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.380> center<00:04:55.560> as<00:04:55.860> actively<00:04:56.280> because

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
in the center as actively because

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.580 
in the center as actively because
there's<00:04:56.910> light<00:04:57.210> landing<00:04:57.960> around<00:04:58.050> the<00:04:58.350> side

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
there's light landing around the side

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.370 
there's light landing around the side
right<00:04:59.160> there<00:04:59.539> so<00:05:00.539> it's<00:05:00.690> a<00:05:00.750> balance<00:05:01.139> of

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
right there so it's a balance of

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.879 
right there so it's a balance of
excitatory<00:05:02.070> in<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.639> center<00:05:02.970> and<00:05:03.150> inhibitory

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
excitatory in the center and inhibitory

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.080 
excitatory in the center and inhibitory
responses<00:05:04.889> that<00:05:05.039> are<00:05:05.160> telling<00:05:05.460> you<00:05:05.610> whether

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
responses that are telling you whether

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.350 
responses that are telling you whether
you<00:05:06.300> should<00:05:06.330> do<00:05:06.599> extra<00:05:07.050> firing<00:05:07.560> or<00:05:07.740> not<00:05:08.430> so

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
you should do extra firing or not so

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.070 
you should do extra firing or not so
this<00:05:10.020> is<00:05:10.139> called<00:05:10.410> edge<00:05:10.880> enhancement

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
this is called edge enhancement

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.760 
this is called edge enhancement
specifically<00:05:13.080> this<00:05:13.169> is<00:05:13.259> called<00:05:13.470> lateral

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
specifically this is called lateral

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.600 
specifically this is called lateral
inhibition<00:05:14.270> edge<00:05:15.380> enhancement<00:05:16.380> by<00:05:16.680> lateral

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
inhibition edge enhancement by lateral

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.580 
inhibition edge enhancement by lateral
inhibition<00:05:17.849> it's<00:05:18.630> basically<00:05:19.080> creating<00:05:19.320> a

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
inhibition it's basically creating a

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.070 
inhibition it's basically creating a
halo<00:05:19.800> of<00:05:20.220> contrast<00:05:20.759> around<00:05:21.000> and<00:05:21.509> helps<00:05:21.750> us<00:05:21.900> to

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
halo of contrast around and helps us to

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.560 
halo of contrast around and helps us to
pick<00:05:22.620> out<00:05:22.800> some<00:05:23.130> things<00:05:23.370> from<00:05:23.610> there<00:05:23.880> from

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
pick out some things from there from

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.810 
pick out some things from there from
their<00:05:24.780> backgrounds<00:05:25.440> when<00:05:26.280> staring<00:05:26.610> at<00:05:26.729> a

their backgrounds when staring at a
excitatory<00:05:27.479> photoreceptor<00:05:28.259> stimulated<00:05:28.740> I've

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
excitatory photoreceptor stimulated I've

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.140 
excitatory photoreceptor stimulated I've
said<00:05:29.039> this<00:05:29.130> ready<00:05:29.370> but<00:05:29.580> because<00:05:29.849> of<00:05:29.880> the<00:05:30.000> white

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
said this ready but because of the white

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.670 
said this ready but because of the white
lines<00:05:30.360> around<00:05:30.660> it<00:05:30.840> some<00:05:31.080> inhibitory

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
lines around it some inhibitory

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.920 
lines around it some inhibitory
photoreceptors<00:05:32.550> also<00:05:32.820> receive<00:05:33.150> light<00:05:33.360> so

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
photoreceptors also receive light so

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.350 
photoreceptors also receive light so
there's<00:05:34.470> less<00:05:34.650> firing<00:05:35.340> when<00:05:35.789> glancing<00:05:36.210> at<00:05:36.330> a

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
there's less firing when glancing at a

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.529 
there's less firing when glancing at a
line<00:05:36.659> at<00:05:36.990> point<00:05:37.229> B<00:05:37.560> right<00:05:37.830> here<00:05:38.039> only<00:05:38.789> a<00:05:39.120> few<00:05:39.419> of

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
line at point B right here only a few of

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.270 
line at point B right here only a few of
the<00:05:39.630> inhibitory<00:05:40.080> receptors<00:05:40.530> will<00:05:40.919> receive

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
the inhibitory receptors will receive

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.800 
the inhibitory receptors will receive
light<00:05:41.520> because<00:05:41.760> it's<00:05:41.880> mostly<00:05:42.210> surrounded<00:05:42.690> by

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
light because it's mostly surrounded by

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.890 
light because it's mostly surrounded by
darkness<00:05:43.139> and<00:05:43.500> so<00:05:43.889> that<00:05:44.460> edge<00:05:44.880> actually<00:05:45.360> gets

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
darkness and so that edge actually gets

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.399 
darkness and so that edge actually gets
enhanced<00:05:46.169> so<00:05:47.070> it<00:05:47.190> looks<00:05:47.400> brighter<00:05:47.820> than<00:05:48.360> a<00:05:48.720> for

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
enhanced so it looks brighter than a for

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.080 
enhanced so it looks brighter than a for
example<00:05:49.800> so<00:05:49.949> that's<00:05:50.130> why<00:05:50.310> you<00:05:50.370> still<00:05:50.880> see

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
example so that's why you still see

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.909 
example so that's why you still see
these<00:05:51.240> gray<00:05:51.479> spots<00:05:51.840> well<00:05:52.349> I'm<00:05:52.470> going<00:05:52.770> crazy

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
these gray spots well I'm going crazy

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.680 
these gray spots well I'm going crazy
seeing<00:05:53.520> all<00:05:53.729> these<00:05:53.849> gray<00:05:54.060> spots<00:05:54.330> I'm<00:05:54.449> seeing

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
seeing all these gray spots I'm seeing

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.689 
seeing all these gray spots I'm seeing
gray<00:05:54.840> spots<00:05:55.110> over<00:05:55.349> here<00:05:55.620> as<00:05:55.979> well<00:05:56.220> too

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 
gray spots over here as well too

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.080 
gray spots over here as well too
that's<00:05:57.060> from<00:05:57.300> retinal<00:05:57.780> burn<00:05:58.050> how<00:05:58.740> poor<00:05:59.550> our

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
that's from retinal burn how poor our

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.740 
that's from retinal burn how poor our
are<00:06:00.509> our<00:06:01.470> human<00:06:01.919> eyes<00:06:02.310> like<00:06:02.789> all<00:06:03.570> these

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
are our human eyes like all these

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.870 
are our human eyes like all these
problems<00:06:04.289> when<00:06:04.800> focusing<00:06:05.190> on<00:06:05.310> a<00:06:05.340> spot<00:06:05.610> we<00:06:05.759> use

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
problems when focusing on a spot we use

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.850 
problems when focusing on a spot we use
photo<00:06:06.090> receptors<00:06:06.449> from<00:06:06.539> fovea<00:06:07.080> the<00:06:07.409> receptive

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
photo receptors from fovea the receptive

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.499 
photo receptors from fovea the receptive
areas<00:06:08.190> are<00:06:08.340> smaller<00:06:08.639> so<00:06:08.909> the<00:06:09.000> gray<00:06:09.180> spots

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:09.509 
areas are smaller so the gray spots

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:12.950 
areas are smaller so the gray spots
disappear<00:06:09.840> as<00:06:10.590> we've<00:06:10.800> talked<00:06:11.009> about<00:06:11.960> okay

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
disappear as we've talked about okay

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.749 
disappear as we've talked about okay
that's<00:06:13.139> the<00:06:13.259> Hermann<00:06:13.590> gray<00:06:13.800> so<00:06:14.280> go<00:06:14.430> look<00:06:14.610> at

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 
that's the Hermann gray so go look at

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:16.040 
that's the Hermann gray so go look at
all<00:06:14.880> the<00:06:15.030> other<00:06:15.120> illusions<00:06:15.479> that<00:06:15.810> are<00:06:15.930> out

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
all the other illusions that are out

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.540 
all the other illusions that are out
there<00:06:16.080> and<00:06:16.440> see<00:06:16.860> if<00:06:16.949> you<00:06:17.009> can<00:06:17.130> figure<00:06:17.280> them<00:06:17.430> out

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
there and see if you can figure them out

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.249 
there and see if you can figure them out
this<00:06:17.729> one<00:06:17.909> is<00:06:17.940> really<00:06:18.300> well<00:06:18.479> understood<00:06:18.780> some

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 
this one is really well understood some

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:22.520 
this one is really well understood some
of<00:06:19.349> them<00:06:19.440> are<00:06:19.590> still<00:06:20.900> perceivable<00:06:21.900> some<00:06:22.409> of

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
of them are still perceivable some of

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:23.450 
of them are still perceivable some of
the<00:06:22.590> other<00:06:22.740> illusions<00:06:23.190> that<00:06:23.220> are<00:06:23.370> out<00:06:23.430> there

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
the other illusions that are out there

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.100 
the other illusions that are out there
but<00:06:23.789> they<00:06:23.849> don't<00:06:24.060> have<00:06:24.240> explanations<00:06:24.599> as

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
but they don't have explanations as

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.409 
but they don't have explanations as
fully<00:06:25.530> understood<00:06:26.280> as<00:06:26.520> something<00:06:26.909> like<00:06:27.180> this

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 
fully understood as something like this

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.080 
fully understood as something like this
and<00:06:27.690> one<00:06:28.229> more<00:06:28.470> way<00:06:29.430> that<00:06:29.729> we<00:06:29.820> process

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
and one more way that we process

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.760 
and one more way that we process
information<00:06:30.659> if<00:06:31.169> you<00:06:31.259> look<00:06:31.409> at<00:06:31.500> this<00:06:31.590> diagram

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
information if you look at this diagram

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.510 
information if you look at this diagram
take<00:06:32.310> a<00:06:32.340> look<00:06:32.580> at<00:06:32.699> this<00:06:32.880> eye<00:06:33.229> right<00:06:34.229> here<00:06:34.370> okay

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
take a look at this eye right here okay

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.760 
take a look at this eye right here okay
this<00:06:35.849> particular<00:06:36.479> eye<00:06:36.599> if<00:06:37.139> you<00:06:37.440> look<00:06:37.590> at<00:06:37.710> the

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
this particular eye if you look at the

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.440 
this particular eye if you look at the
optic<00:06:38.190> nerve<00:06:38.400> the<00:06:38.669> optic<00:06:39.000> nerve<00:06:39.150> actually

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:39.450 
optic nerve the optic nerve actually

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.420 
optic nerve the optic nerve actually
splits

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430 
splits

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.420 
splits
into<00:06:40.790> so<00:06:41.180> this<00:06:41.330> is<00:06:41.480> just<00:06:41.660> from<00:06:41.810> one<00:06:41.870> eye<00:06:42.430> part

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430 
into so this is just from one eye part

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.010 
into so this is just from one eye part
of<00:06:43.580> the<00:06:43.700> part<00:06:44.240> of<00:06:44.300> the<00:06:44.450> information<00:06:44.630> gets

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
of the part of the information gets

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.990 
of the part of the information gets
processed<00:06:45.260> in<00:06:45.680> the<00:06:46.250> right<00:06:46.430> side<00:06:46.670> of<00:06:46.790> the<00:06:46.880> brain

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 
processed in the right side of the brain

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.850 
processed in the right side of the brain
and<00:06:47.330> some<00:06:47.870> of<00:06:47.960> it<00:06:48.050> gets<00:06:48.200> processed<00:06:48.350> in<00:06:48.770> the

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
and some of it gets processed in the

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.170 
and some of it gets processed in the
left<00:06:49.070> side<00:06:49.370> of<00:06:49.460> the<00:06:49.550> brain<00:06:49.730> and<00:06:49.760> same<00:06:50.150> goes

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.180 
left side of the brain and same goes

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.330 
left side of the brain and same goes
true<00:06:50.690> for<00:06:50.780> the<00:06:51.110> other<00:06:51.140> eye<00:06:51.440> that<00:06:52.010> some<00:06:52.190> of<00:06:52.280> the

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.340 
true for the other eye that some of the

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.800 
true for the other eye that some of the
information<00:06:52.460> gets<00:06:52.910> processed<00:06:53.150> in<00:06:53.480> the<00:06:53.540> left

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:53.810 
information gets processed in the left

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.690 
information gets processed in the left
and<00:06:54.020> it<00:06:54.380> gets<00:06:54.530> some<00:06:54.710> of<00:06:54.800> it<00:06:54.890> gets<00:06:55.040> processed<00:06:55.310> in

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:55.700 
and it gets some of it gets processed in

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.020 
and it gets some of it gets processed in
the<00:06:56.090> right<00:06:56.300> and<00:06:56.540> as<00:06:56.630> a<00:06:56.660> result<00:06:57.140> we<00:06:58.040> are<00:06:58.340> much

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.030 
the right and as a result we are much

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.840 
the right and as a result we are much
better<00:06:59.060> at<00:06:59.590> figuring<00:07:00.590> out<00:07:00.860> distances<00:07:01.610> and

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:01.850 
better at figuring out distances and

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.120 
better at figuring out distances and
sizes<00:07:02.540> right<00:07:03.050> so<00:07:03.500> when<00:07:03.680> we're<00:07:03.800> standing

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.130 
sizes right so when we're standing

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.670 
sizes right so when we're standing
somewhere<00:07:04.400> with<00:07:04.700> this<00:07:04.850> by<00:07:05.120> this<00:07:05.960> binocular

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:06.680 
somewhere with this by this binocular

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.240 
somewhere with this by this binocular
vision<00:07:07.190> we<00:07:07.610> we<00:07:08.300> can<00:07:08.450> actually<00:07:08.980> determine<00:07:09.980> if

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:10.250 
vision we we can actually determine if

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.240 
vision we we can actually determine if
things<00:07:10.430> are<00:07:10.610> closer<00:07:10.820> or<00:07:11.390> farther<00:07:12.110> away<00:07:12.410> like

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:13.250 
things are closer or farther away like

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.370 
things are closer or farther away like
when<00:07:13.400> I<00:07:13.430> look<00:07:13.610> at<00:07:13.700> the<00:07:13.820> moon<00:07:14.000> versus<00:07:14.630> I<00:07:14.900> don't

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.380 
when I look at the moon versus I don't

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.190 
when I look at the moon versus I don't
know<00:07:15.440> a<00:07:15.590> house<00:07:15.890> I<00:07:16.220> can<00:07:16.640> tell<00:07:16.880> which<00:07:17.510> one<00:07:17.780> is<00:07:17.930> is

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:18.200 
know a house I can tell which one is is

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.160 
know a house I can tell which one is is
smaller<00:07:18.790> and<00:07:19.790> my<00:07:20.210> brain<00:07:20.420> process<00:07:20.840> that<00:07:20.990> but<00:07:21.110> I

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.170 
smaller and my brain process that but I

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.750 
smaller and my brain process that but I
also<00:07:21.320> know<00:07:21.530> which<00:07:21.680> one<00:07:21.830> is<00:07:21.950> further<00:07:22.160> away<00:07:22.430> so<00:07:22.580> I

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:22.760 
also know which one is further away so I

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.400 
also know which one is further away so I
don't<00:07:22.850> get<00:07:23.060> confused<00:07:23.180> and<00:07:23.750> think<00:07:23.810> that<00:07:24.290> the

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:24.410 
don't get confused and think that the

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.930 
don't get confused and think that the
moon<00:07:24.590> is<00:07:24.620> as<00:07:25.070> big<00:07:25.310> as<00:07:25.430> a<00:07:25.460> building<00:07:25.790> or

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:25.940 
moon is as big as a building or

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.060 
moon is as big as a building or
something<00:07:26.210> like<00:07:26.330> that<00:07:26.620> so<00:07:27.620> that's<00:07:27.800> basically

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:28.070 
something like that so that's basically

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.100 
something like that so that's basically
what<00:07:28.250> this<00:07:28.340> is<00:07:28.400> saying<00:07:29.020> information<00:07:30.020> the

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:30.110 
what this is saying information the

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.120 
what this is saying information the
right<00:07:30.230> side<00:07:30.470> of<00:07:30.560> the<00:07:30.620> visual<00:07:30.830> field<00:07:31.070> is

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:31.130 
right side of the visual field is

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.950 
right side of the visual field is
processed<00:07:31.580> by<00:07:31.700> the<00:07:31.760> left<00:07:32.030> hemisphere<00:07:32.270> of<00:07:32.600> the

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 
processed by the left hemisphere of the

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.860 
processed by the left hemisphere of the
brain<00:07:32.990> as<00:07:33.380> well<00:07:33.650> as<00:07:33.860> the<00:07:34.070> right<00:07:34.430> side<00:07:34.700> this<00:07:35.600> is

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:35.870 
brain as well as the right side this is

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.410 
brain as well as the right side this is
per<00:07:36.260> eyeball<00:07:36.800> okay<00:07:37.280> per<00:07:37.580> eyeball<00:07:38.030> so<00:07:38.210> each

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:38.420 
per eyeball okay per eyeball so each

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.540 
per eyeball okay per eyeball so each
eyeballs<00:07:38.960> optic<00:07:39.440> nerve<00:07:39.650> actually<00:07:40.190> splits

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:40.550 
eyeballs optic nerve actually splits

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.670 
eyeballs optic nerve actually splits
into<00:07:40.910> the<00:07:41.030> left<00:07:41.270> and<00:07:41.480> the<00:07:41.930> right<00:07:42.140> and<00:07:42.350> that's

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:42.680 
into the left and the right and that's

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.430 
into the left and the right and that's
just<00:07:42.920> an<00:07:43.040> extra<00:07:43.490> little<00:07:43.700> fact<00:07:44.660> about<00:07:44.900> how<00:07:45.380> we

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 
just an extra little fact about how we

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.600 
just an extra little fact about how we
perceive<00:07:46.220> information<00:07:46.610> and<00:07:47.120> process<00:07:47.570> it
