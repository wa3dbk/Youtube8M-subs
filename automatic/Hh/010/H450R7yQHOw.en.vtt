00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.589
 My name is chris benvenutti. I'm here. 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.230
 to invite you to a workshop where 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.750
 we will discuss how to show a 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.219
 woman in her best version 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.630
 after all this is not what we people 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.820
 dreams 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.779
 I hope this happens, it 's necessary 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.880
 take a very important first step 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.199
 know the anatomy of the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.320
 feminine silhouette 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.269
 If not, we 'll go. 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.730
 keep making those same mistakes 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.040
 and having a wardrobe full of things and 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.780
 nothing to wear in reality is not that 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.329
 do not have anything to wear you have not got 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.210
 appropriate clothing what happens 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.520
 you end up always using half a dozen 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.789
 clothes because those coincidentally 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.800
 cable on you like a glove and when you 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.610
 wear a suit that fits you like a 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.949
 glove 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.010
 you feel comfortable feel 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.129
 hold your self-esteem and lead and your life 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.770
 works well is a good metaphor for 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.320
 talking about form is just the 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.150
 puzzle of geometric shapes 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.090
 Can you think if I give you this? 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.860
 triangle and put in place 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.350
 immediately and goes because it is 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.030
 that we adults have mastered this 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.799
 question geometrically 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.159
 if you do this with a child who 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.990
 she will do she will try to put the 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.479
 little holes until you hit 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.100
 And you know what it reminds me of in our 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.790
 wardrobe dealing with our 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.610
 clothes 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.920
 as we are not aware of our 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.259
 body we buy a clothes not 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.329
 we consider the body shape and the time of 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.990
 put oil that happens 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.420
 wears our body test but stays 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.460
 weird because it's left over from the 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.640
 missing the other and then you stay in that 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.329
 Security pulls the seam there I've been 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.950
 here at the moment you are aware 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:58.430
 the shape of your body you do it here 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:04.210
 What we want is that your clothes 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:08.860
 enter into your body as well as a glove 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.959
 Are you a stylist? 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.120
 imagine someone who has developed a 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.440
 packaging for a particular product 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.440
 that he does not know 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.170
 Now this packaging can be modern can 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.300
 being creative can be used it can be 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.280
 within the trends but if it is not 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.850
 suitable for that product 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.150
 none of this is any good what you 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.340
 Do you get a clothes for a 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.730
 product that is the woman 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.180
 so the first step is really 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.300
 to be aware of your product or 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.230
 that you really know anatomy of the 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.900
 female figure costing image 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.090
 consider me do you think these 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.989
 conventional classification models 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:59.019
 so that it takes into account only 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:01.150
 Shoulder measures Waists and hips are 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.390
 able to cover all the diversity 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.880
 female silhouette of course they are 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.410
 important but for a first step 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.290
 a long way 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.650
 after all, when a customer who hires 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.930
 that she hopes is that you give her a 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.250
 result based on all your 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.799
 features 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.350
 I want to invite you to meet 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:26.680
 the method which takes into account the 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.530
 whole body and all its 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.209
 dimensions including volume 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:37.329
 I'll show you a way to 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:40.870
 expertise in image anatomy for you 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:43.510
 who is a loyal customer shopkeeper is that 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.269
 that you have the feeling that your store was 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.760
 made for her but for this 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.150
 what happens if you have to offer 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.019
 your salespeople in consulting lightning 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:58.480
 When does this happen in the taster? 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:03.250
 when you act as a customer you look in the mirror and 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.049
 exclaims that it is just like her if she liked 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.450
 From that moment the seller does not 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.769
 you need to use those old cliches to 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.350
 convince you, it's a beautiful party 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:15.540
 wonderful spectacular 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.850
 she looked at herself if she liked 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.459
 if she was convinced she had no doubt that she 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:24.810
 go buy and go back to make new 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:27.060
 shopping and now the last message from 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.150
 woman to woman 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.500
 Vanity is our thing and since 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.960
 she is healthy 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.360
 No problem, you do not like 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.220
 if you see well this is good not only for us 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.020
 but also for all the people who 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.780
 live with us 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:47.190
 The point is that we think it is 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.370
 beautiful is not fast and can believe that 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.259
 is it possible for anyone 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.630
 independent of your bank account from 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:57.900
 time you have to yourself the 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.660
 balance and is much more than 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.690
 easy and much more economical than you 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.599
 can you imagine then my invitation and 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.599
 Come and spend these two days with us and 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:13.190
 definitively end this myth of 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:13.190
 What beauty is not for you?
