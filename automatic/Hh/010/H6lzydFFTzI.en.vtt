00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.140
 hello xix 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.630
 I alone in the field I'm here in mine. 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.610
 room in the studio w iguatemi and now I go 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.730
 talk a little to you about mouth 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.650
 the trends now for this season and 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.890
 how to make more last your lipstick and 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.480
 comment the games come on let's go there 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.350
 the first thing we need 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.890
 before doing moisturizing lipstick 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.810
 then the moisturizer will increase the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.820
 durability and will also leave your 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.440
 most beautiful side will take those 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.690
 which mainly 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.210
 When we wear lipstick darker and 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.329
 button mate that the ladybug goes crazy 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.430
 But for this you have to leave your mouth well. 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.410
 moisturized because otherwise, instead of 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.450
 Wonderful, he stayed alive then you. 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.450
 can pass 1st on the whole lip 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:01:02.789
 even off the lip come here where 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.250
 are these wines that we have the color 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.010
 lipstick then choose this thing from 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.290
 outline which is a more orange tone 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.180
 which is a very strong trend now 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.760
 for the summer then it matches our 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.340
 climate is more tropical I will use the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.150
 orange lipstick is also cool when you 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.570
 think dark mouth is that you see a 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.970
 Only color you do not see the difference between 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.659
 lipstick color contour is then awoke 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.369
 your outline is not so the same color 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.430
 Lipstick it's cool you give lipstick 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.909
 a little over the edge for you 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.520
 is to make the color more uniform 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.009
 then the first of all at the time the 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.500
 people to apply the outline how to 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.030
 so I always like to start with 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.530
 center of the lips 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.500
 It's something people do not realize. 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.290
 when they make mouths they sometimes 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.570
 leaves one side different from the other then 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.060
 when you are in the darkest mouth 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.829
 asymmetry is super important and we 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.790
 have to take a little care with 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.210
 that 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.380
 when you pass the outline over the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.810
 your own lip that happens 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.450
 the lipstick also last longer then it goes 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.390
 further boost the trailer now 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.070
 I 'll pass on the act of cupid that is 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.300
 This little heart that we have here. 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:26.180
 over the side 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:28.430
 so I always like to see 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.180
 and it's cool to use your 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.800
 little finger as a point of support at the time 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.470
 you are passing outline 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.620
 because then you can do the next 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.200
 more perfect without erasing this moment 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.540
 now is to finish the top is 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.970
 where we have more difficulty 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.410
 because this is where you can leave 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.020
 one side different from the other 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.980
 so my tip is to make the 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.810
 little 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:03:00.230
 so I always like to start 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:03.790
 from the inside to the middle to 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.790
 other side do the same 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.350
 now to increase the size of my side 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.180
 what I do 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.190
 usually have people who have this 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.590
 higher than from 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.970
 down or down from the bottom of the 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.050
 higher up 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.700
 so it's always cool you give a trading 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.620
 that there when the cupid in the 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:33.980
 down and do it when you do it 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.220
 you automatically balance the part 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.170
 from top to bottom part and after that there 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.220
 Did you see that balance you're going to make? 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.350
 the outline again and if you want 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.910
 increase a little more you will see 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:54.500
 slightly out of thin air 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:57.850
 a little bit and you're going to do the same 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.850
 thing in part of that 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:06.980
 so I got my mouth brush here 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:09.440
 and I'll give you lipstick and then I'll apply 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.910
 the lipstick always trade the 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.890
 ends up half an hour if you 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.959
 want to make the color more intense you 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.050
 pass the lipstick directly in the center 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.450
 The good side of my mouth is ready but 

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:28.280
 if I had been wrong with the author, what 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:33.770
 I wanted to do is take the collective and then with 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:40.040
 the harder brush I pick up the tone is 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:43.460
 very similar to my skin and strip 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:46.150
 I overdo the taste of evil and I will pass on 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.150
 return 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.810
 the girls this my mouth tip to 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.759
 you chose rural because one of the 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.310
 super strong trend stuff now 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:03.490
 this season and I hope you 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.990
 use and use your mouth to help you 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.090
 When you 're out of patience 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.009
 do lots of make -up 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.819
 mouth more things and save ourselves 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:11.819
 at these moments
