00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.259
 lacking in remarkable indie play 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.960
 it really is not one right now 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.389
 Another representative of the category oblique 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.740
 smart and great is that walker from 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.640
 Little Finnish developer team 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.680
 called face pair the 2d puzzle game of the 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.080
 Above all, swopper speaks to the people 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.820
 to look forward to when you are fast 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.369
 to see through the mechanisms with 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.769
 a clever leveldesign to head 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.260
 muscle-forming riddles merge 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.960
 the weather is therefore ideal for 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.760
 designated portal lovers just that 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.590
 you do not have holes in the swopper 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.540
 walls closes but clones of itself 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.440
 create your own and be your soul 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:55.489
 i understand this clone 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:55.489
 swap the name of the game stupid 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.040
 similar to valves brain replacing 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.800
 portal magic works also us rapper 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.020
 with an intangible because only 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.750
 minimal play described right 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.850
 abstract world we move as 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.729
 lonely astronaut through a near 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.040
 Orphaned the space station in the year now 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.000
 strange things have happened and still 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.640
 always happen 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.150
 There are keywords like the observers 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.830
 We agree to read 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.550
 logbook entries and stones speak up 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.410
 Above us everything stands for the 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.030
 philosophical question about unity 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.830
 of body and soul 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.960
 a question that asks us about it 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.789
 take up the theme of the game mechanics 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.070
 It is always possible to see who wants to 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.470
 So even off the puzzles a lot 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.210
 thinks material is pulling out of the swopper 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.070
 who does not want to enjoy it 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.440
 Just have to go to the head so soon 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.750
 solved exactly as in portal this beautiful 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.440
 Feeling oh how smart I am 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.440
 produce 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.470
 the weather does not last long around already 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.670
 a few steps into the space station 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.619
 into it we find the cannon up to 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.330
 four clones simultaneously from ours 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.190
 small astronauts can create and 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.209
 between the we then cheerfully back and forth 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.250
 can swap 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.110
 The clones, however, do not just look 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.120
 like the little man in spacesuit she 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.250
 do exactly the same as him 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.110
 if we run right also 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.050
 the clones right to left the 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.340
 clones too we jump and up to four 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.680
 clones hop with 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.560
 if we press the right mouse button to 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.000
 Generate a clone while holding it 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.950
 the time slows down so we have 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.480
 the possibility also great caves in 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.700
 to overcome both directions 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.730
 simply by gradually adding new ones 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.849
 create clones and into them 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.250
 to stop 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.230
 A clown dies because he is too big 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.420
 Height falls on the ground he will us 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.890
 touch incidentally credited back 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.810
 like one happens the same 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.580
 and when we go through a beam of light 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.849
 or running a goal will disappear soon 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.530
 all clones back into our weapon 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.599
 and with the clown cannon and our bis 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.700
 it is about us now to four images 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.769
 through the space station to the end 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:10.500
 puzzles which at the beginning still quite simple 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:12.629
 is how we see this example ever 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.849
 further we advance into the game the more 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.280
 it gets heavier, however, above all 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.260
 by red and blue lights in blue 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.090
 light we can not create clones 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.459
 and red light prevents crawls 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.870
 So you have to exchange the body and have to do so 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.150
 we sent our skills 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.159
 use this at first glance 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.349
 to create the impossible and the energy 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.969
 google up here to reach the top 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.310
 we need to bring from to 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:37.079
 operate or portals to activate the 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.310
 help us keep getting into the 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.310
 room station to penetrate 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.890
 the puzzles do not wear off though 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.230
 They almost all with the same means 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.630
 work they stay exciting demanding 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.820
 and still always logical and feasible 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.190
 Sooner or later everyone will be behind 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.780
 every headless in until summer comes that 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.630
 We promise or at least hope 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.500
 after that, as already mentioned, powerful 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.500
 to feel smart 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.200
 that was so far only for the pc 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.270
 has appeared only one 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.350
 Control via mouse and keyboard 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:18.060
 and unfortunately only English language 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.470
 Who does not control himself 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.340
 the puzzle quality of the game 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.370
 must restrict 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.440
 and of course on the optics of the optics 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.020
 Gropper is rather economical though 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.620
 still very atmospheric strange 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.900
 Forms Rugged Rock Industrial Facilities 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.580
 look everything arises diffuse light 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.400
 dipped in mood and with a light 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.890
 Grain blur effects front 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.690
 in the picture and in the deep the space station 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.730
 remains visually puzzling and visual 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.350
 even if elements repeat themselves 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.860
 our eyes are bored in this 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.990
 strange construct to a second 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.910
 under the craziness has face pair with 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.890
 appropriate ambient noise and 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.600
 beautiful ambient music on top of that one 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.600
 very good sound carpet 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.050
 the weather is not necessarily one 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.850
 long game at least what the pure 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.770
 size, how long then 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.140
 Ultimately it really depends 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.760
 From how fast you cracked some of them 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.470
 need longer others are turn 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.000
 but faster in about six hours 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:27.170
 everyone should be able to do it 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.480
 do not care or seven or eight 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:32.480
 Entertaining and demanding is in everyone 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.070
 the unique game design will do that 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.470
 Clever puzzles with a mysterious 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.660
 environment and a philosophical question 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.380
 At any rate, mixed has captivated us immediately 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.840
 beaten 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.210
 the victim is one of those many in the 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.190
 games that we fully recommend 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:50.770
 At least people can do that 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.770
 Portals liked us as much as we did
