00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
do grab food and consume it but they're

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.259 
do grab food and consume it but they're

some other corals and that leads to a

some other corals and that leads to a
weird<00:02:57.390> situation<00:02:57.629> where<00:02:58.200> they<00:02:58.349> just<00:02:58.530> kind<00:02:58.769> of

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
weird situation where they just kind of

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.949 
weird situation where they just kind of
hold<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.400> food<00:02:59.579> out<00:02:59.819> there<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.329> then<00:03:00.629> fish

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
hold the food out there and then fish

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.650 
hold the food out there and then fish
come<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.379> pick<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.560> off<00:03:02.299> having<00:03:03.299> said<00:03:03.629> that

these<00:03:04.019> corals<00:03:04.440> seem<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.739> really<00:03:05.010> benefit<00:03:05.459> from

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
these corals seem to really benefit from

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.580 
these corals seem to really benefit from
regular<00:03:05.819> feeding<00:03:06.329> despite<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.989> harassment

regular feeding despite the harassment
from<00:03:07.680> fish<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.639> can<00:03:08.819> see<00:03:08.970> here<00:03:09.329> that<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.600> food

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
from fish you can see here that the food

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.599 
from fish you can see here that the food
eventually<00:03:10.470> makes<00:03:10.680> its<00:03:10.859> way<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:11.100> one<00:03:11.430> of<00:03:11.519> the

mouths at the center of the coral as the

coral grows the mouths split I've seen

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.599 
coral grows the mouths split I've seen
some<00:03:17.609> larger<00:03:18.090> ones<00:03:18.120> with<00:03:18.480> dozens<00:03:19.079> of<00:03:19.260> mouths
