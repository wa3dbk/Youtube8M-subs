okay so here we are for part two and
this<00:00:10.469> time<00:00:10.710> we're<00:00:10.830> going<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:10.980> work<00:00:11.040> on<00:00:11.340> the

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
this time we're going to work on the

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.610 
this time we're going to work on the
skin<00:00:11.790> tone<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.240> contrast<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.080> do<00:00:13.380> that

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
skin tone and contrast and to do that

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.770 
skin tone and contrast and to do that
we're<00:00:14.190> going<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.400> add<00:00:14.549> three<00:00:15.089> adjustment

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
we're going to add three adjustment

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.630 
we're going to add three adjustment
layers<00:00:16.020> so<00:00:16.949> we're<00:00:17.130> going<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.310> come<00:00:17.430> over<00:00:17.520> to

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
layers so we're going to come over to

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.160 
layers so we're going to come over to
the<00:00:17.699> right<00:00:17.880> hand<00:00:18.119> side<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.449> our<00:00:18.539> screen<00:00:18.600> where

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
the right hand side of our screen where

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.630 
the right hand side of our screen where
we<00:00:19.230> have<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.529> adjustment<00:00:20.070> layers<00:00:20.310> up

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
we have the adjustment layers up

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.880 
we have the adjustment layers up
available<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.750> us<00:00:21.930> I'm<00:00:22.260> going<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.560> click<00:00:22.769> on

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
available to us I'm going to click on

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.980 
available to us I'm going to click on
channel<00:00:23.369> mixer<00:00:23.789> we're<00:00:24.359> gonna<00:00:24.449> put<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> tick

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
channel mixer we're gonna put a tick

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.990 
channel mixer we're gonna put a tick
where<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.380> says<00:00:25.560> monochrome<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.400> then<00:00:26.789> if<00:00:26.880> we

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
where it says monochrome and then if we

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.939 
where it says monochrome and then if we
look<00:00:27.150> into<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.480> layers<00:00:27.720> panel<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.619> have<00:00:28.830> the

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
look into the layers panel we have the

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.589 
look into the layers panel we have the
channel<00:00:29.189> mixer<00:00:29.490> adjustment<00:00:29.970> layer<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.449> we're

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
channel mixer adjustment layer and we're

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.269 
channel mixer adjustment layer and we're
going<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.779> reduce<00:00:30.960> reduce<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.769> opacity<00:00:31.830> of

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
going to reduce reduce the opacity of

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.990 
going to reduce reduce the opacity of
that<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.910> around<00:00:33.120> about<00:00:33.469> 40%<00:00:34.820> so<00:00:35.820> if<00:00:35.910> i<00:00:35.969> zoom

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
that to around about 40% so if i zoom

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.090 
that to around about 40% so if i zoom
out<00:00:36.420> we<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:36.989> see<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.320> effect<00:00:37.559> that's<00:00:37.710> had<00:00:37.860> so

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
out we can see the effect that's had so

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.920 
out we can see the effect that's had so
far<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.640> I'll<00:00:38.700> turn<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.059> light<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.600> off

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
far so I'll turn that light on and off

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.869 
far so I'll turn that light on and off
we<00:00:40.200> can<00:00:40.379> see<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.710> effect<00:00:41.070> that's<00:00:41.190> having<00:00:41.610> on

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
we can see the effect that's having on

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.959 
we can see the effect that's having on
the<00:00:42.149> skin<00:00:42.390> tone<00:00:43.460> okay<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> next<00:00:44.730> thing<00:00:44.820> we

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
the skin tone okay the next thing we

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.790 
the skin tone okay the next thing we
need<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.149> do<00:00:45.300> add<00:00:45.539> another<00:00:45.870> channel<00:00:46.590> mixer

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
need to do add another channel mixer

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.740 
need to do add another channel mixer
adjustment<00:00:47.280> layer<00:00:47.460> again<00:00:48.239> we're<00:00:48.390> gonna<00:00:48.480> click

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
adjustment layer again we're gonna click

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.690 
adjustment layer again we're gonna click
in<00:00:48.899> monochrome<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.250> time<00:00:50.489> we're<00:00:50.640> gonna

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
in monochrome but this time we're gonna

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.220 
in monochrome but this time we're gonna
come<00:00:50.940> over<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.239> layers<00:00:51.449> panel<00:00:51.750> I'm<00:00:51.989> gonna

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
come over to the layers panel I'm gonna

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.139 
come over to the layers panel I'm gonna
change<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.739> blend<00:00:53.070> mode<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.610> layer<00:00:53.879> to

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
change the blend mode of that layer to

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.029 
change the blend mode of that layer to
screen<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.170> what<00:00:55.320> that's<00:00:55.469> gonna<00:00:55.590> do<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.860> going

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
screen and what that's gonna do is going

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.490 
screen and what that's gonna do is going
to<00:00:56.129> brighten<00:00:56.699> up<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.030> picture<00:00:57.449> if<00:00:58.050> i<00:00:58.170> zoom<00:00:58.199> out

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
to brighten up the picture if i zoom out

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.260 
to brighten up the picture if i zoom out
to<00:00:58.800> show<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.100> button<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.730> layer<00:00:59.879> on<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.210> off

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
to show you button that layer on and off

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.580 
to show you button that layer on and off
we<00:01:00.570> can<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.050> picture'<00:01:01.350> have<00:01:01.469> been

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
we can see that the picture' have been

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.640 
we can see that the picture' have been
brightened<00:01:02.520> up<00:01:02.609> quite<00:01:03.000> considerably<00:01:03.750> okay

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
brightened up quite considerably okay

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.170 
brightened up quite considerably okay
clearly<00:01:04.949> that's<00:01:05.129> too<00:01:05.339> much<00:01:05.489> at<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.729> moment<00:01:06.060> so

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
clearly that's too much at the moment so

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.670 
clearly that's too much at the moment so
we<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.420> come<00:01:06.659> over<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.049> reduce<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.590> opacity

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
we can come over and reduce the opacity

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.039 
we can come over and reduce the opacity
of<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.310> level<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.180> layer<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.780> I'm

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
of that level so that layer and I'm

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.510 
of that level so that layer and I'm
going<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.229> go<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.619> moment<00:01:10.920> around<00:01:11.130> about

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
going to go for the moment around about

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.399 
going to go for the moment around about
the<00:01:11.700> 40%<00:01:12.210> mark<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.869> again<00:01:13.080> we<00:01:13.200> can<00:01:13.320> adjust

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
the 40% mark and again we can adjust

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.920 
the 40% mark and again we can adjust
these<00:01:13.860> later<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:15.150> get<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.360> desired<00:01:15.689> effect

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
these later on to get the desired effect

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.380 
these later on to get the desired effect
that<00:01:16.259> we're<00:01:16.380> after<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.490> third<00:01:17.759> stage<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.270> this

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
that we're after the third stage in this

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.270 
that we're after the third stage in this
again<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.020> another<00:01:19.110> challenge<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.830> adjustment

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
again is another challenge to adjustment

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.550 
again is another challenge to adjustment
layer<00:01:20.460> clicking<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.390> monochrome<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.110> this

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
layer clicking in monochrome and this

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.840 
layer clicking in monochrome and this
time<00:01:22.770> I'm<00:01:22.830> going<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.040> change<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.400> blend<00:01:23.700> mode

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
time I'm going to change the blend mode

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.179 
time I'm going to change the blend mode
of<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.240> layer<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.780> soft<00:01:25.500> light<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.070> that's

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
of that layer to soft light and that's

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.740 
of that layer to soft light and that's
going<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.369> add<00:01:26.520> some<00:01:26.759> contrast<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.630> this

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
going to add some contrast to this

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.630 
going to add some contrast to this
picture<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.799> can<00:01:28.920> see<00:01:29.159> maybe<00:01:29.369> that's<00:01:29.610> a

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
picture you can see maybe that's a

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.310 
picture you can see maybe that's a
little<00:01:29.790> bit<00:01:29.909> too<00:01:30.119> much<00:01:30.360> that's<00:01:30.900> at<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> hundred

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
little bit too much that's at a hundred

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.780 
little bit too much that's at a hundred
percent<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:31.950> we've<00:01:32.070> returned<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.400> layer<00:01:32.549> off

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
percent and we've returned the layer off

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.969 
percent and we've returned the layer off
we<00:01:32.909> can<00:01:33.060> see<00:01:33.210> no<00:01:33.420> contrast<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.619> we're<00:01:34.710> gonna<00:01:34.799> go

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
we can see no contrast so we're gonna go

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.710 
we can see no contrast so we're gonna go
for<00:01:35.009> somewhere<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.520> between<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:36.180> I'm<00:01:36.600> gonna

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
for somewhere in between and I'm gonna

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.109 
for somewhere in between and I'm gonna
probably<00:01:36.990> end<00:01:37.350> up<00:01:37.710> around<00:01:38.070> about<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.549> 35%

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
probably end up around about the 35%

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.700 
probably end up around about the 35%
mark<00:01:40.970> okay<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.030> that's<00:01:42.420> before<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.170> after<00:01:43.439> so

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
mark okay so that's before and after so

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.130 
mark okay so that's before and after so
contrast<00:01:44.369> has<00:01:44.490> been<00:01:44.640> added<00:01:44.880> as<00:01:45.000> well<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.840> next

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
contrast has been added as well the next

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.929 
contrast has been added as well the next
thing<00:01:46.259> we're<00:01:46.500> gonna<00:01:47.130> do<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.490> come<00:01:47.640> over<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
thing we're gonna do is come over to the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.340 
thing we're gonna do is come over to the
layers<00:01:48.119> panel<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.600> I'm<00:01:48.720> going<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.899> rename

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
layers panel and I'm going to rename

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.590 
layers panel and I'm going to rename
these<00:01:49.619> layers<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:50.579> layer<00:01:50.790> just<00:01:51.149> done<00:01:51.360> called

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
these layers the layer just done called

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.120 
these layers the layer just done called
soft<00:01:51.899> light<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.259> I'm<00:01:52.320> going<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.530> rename<00:01:52.920> that

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
soft light so I'm going to rename that

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.870 
soft light so I'm going to rename that
to<00:01:53.189> contrast<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:55.159> then<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.310> language<00:01:56.670> change

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
to contrast and then the language change

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.670 
to contrast and then the language change
to<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.090> screen<00:01:57.450> blend<00:01:57.719> mode<00:01:57.840> I'm<00:01:58.200> going<00:01:58.619> to

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
to the screen blend mode I'm going to

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.580 
to the screen blend mode I'm going to
change<00:01:58.920> nice<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.880> simple<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.509> screen<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.469> what

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
change nice and simple to screen so what

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.959 
change nice and simple to screen so what
we<00:02:01.680> can<00:02:01.799> do<00:02:02.009> now<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.430> come<00:02:02.640> into<00:02:02.759> these

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
we can do now is come into these

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.719 
we can do now is come into these
individual<00:02:03.719> layers<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.619> adjust<00:02:05.460> them<00:02:05.700> to

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
individual layers and adjust them to

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.969 
individual layers and adjust them to
taste<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.869> let's<00:02:07.079> say<00:02:07.229> we<00:02:07.350> want<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.619> screen

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
taste so let's say we want the screen

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.290 
taste so let's say we want the screen
low<00:02:08.190> if<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.640> wanted<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.940> picture<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.209> little

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
low if you wanted the picture a little

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.639 
low if you wanted the picture a little
bit<00:02:09.509> brighter<00:02:09.690> we<00:02:10.110> would<00:02:10.229> click<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
bit brighter we would click on the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.120 
bit brighter we would click on the
screen<00:02:10.950> adjustment<00:02:11.489> layer<00:02:11.670> there

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
screen adjustment layer there

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.580 
screen adjustment layer there
and<00:02:12.220> just<00:02:12.670> reduce<00:02:13.030> increase<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.810> opacity<00:02:13.900> or

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
and just reduce increase the opacity or

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.020 
and just reduce increase the opacity or
decrease<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.220> depending<00:02:15.580> on<00:02:15.670> how<00:02:15.820> you<00:02:15.880> want

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
decrease it depending on how you want

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.640 
decrease it depending on how you want
the<00:02:16.120> picture<00:02:16.270> to<00:02:16.570> look<00:02:16.600> so<00:02:17.410> I'm<00:02:17.470> going<00:02:17.620> to

the picture to look so I'm going to

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.050

all those three adjustment layers have
been<00:02:44.410> put<00:02:44.800> into<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.250> one<00:02:45.520> group<00:02:46.420> here<00:02:46.810> so<00:02:47.080> what

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
been put into the one group here so what

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.650 
been put into the one group here so what
I<00:02:47.680> can<00:02:47.770> do<00:02:48.100> is<00:02:48.220> adjust<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.640> opacity<00:02:48.910> of<00:02:49.330> all<00:02:49.510> of

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
I can do is adjust the opacity of all of

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.490 
I can do is adjust the opacity of all of
those<00:02:49.840> at<00:02:50.620> one<00:02:50.890> go<00:02:51.220> by<00:02:51.760> using<00:02:52.060> this<00:02:52.270> slider<00:02:52.500> so

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
those at one go by using this slider so

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.570 
those at one go by using this slider so
I'm<00:02:53.590> going<00:02:53.710> to<00:02:53.770> probably<00:02:53.890> go<00:02:54.190> for<00:02:54.490> around

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
I'm going to probably go for around

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.210 
I'm going to probably go for around
about<00:02:54.820> 85<00:02:55.810> percent<00:02:55.840> something<00:02:56.740> around<00:02:57.070> that

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
about 85 percent something around that

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.430 
about 85 percent something around that
region<00:02:57.700> there<00:02:57.880> I'm<00:02:58.030> quite<00:02:58.270> happy<00:02:58.630> with<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:59.410> I

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
region there I'm quite happy with so I

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.440 
region there I'm quite happy with so I
can<00:02:59.530> see<00:02:59.830> that<00:02:59.860> with<00:03:00.700> this<00:03:00.850> stage<00:03:01.090> now<00:03:01.300> we've

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
can see that with this stage now we've

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.120 
can see that with this stage now we've
added<00:03:01.600> some<00:03:01.810> skin<00:03:02.170> tone<00:03:02.380> in<00:03:02.500> contrast<00:03:02.980> but

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
added some skin tone in contrast but

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.800 
added some skin tone in contrast but
what<00:03:03.280> that's<00:03:03.460> actually<00:03:03.850> done<00:03:04.150> it's<00:03:04.660> actually

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
what that's actually done it's actually

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.390 
what that's actually done it's actually
affected<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.560> color<00:03:05.800> of<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:05.980> eyes<00:03:06.100> as<00:03:06.370> well

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
affected the color of the eyes as well

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.130 
affected the color of the eyes as well
clearly<00:03:07.060> because<00:03:07.390> we've<00:03:07.540> changed<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:08.020> few

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
clearly because we've changed a few

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.320 
clearly because we've changed a few
blend<00:03:08.440> modes<00:03:08.650> so<00:03:09.370> what<00:03:09.490> I'm<00:03:09.610> going<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:09.880> do<00:03:10.120> is

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
blend modes so what I'm going to do is
