or more and you guys did it was a
thousand<00:00:13.440> 26<00:00:14.099> for<00:00:14.429> this<00:00:14.549> question<00:00:14.969> so<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.299> is

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
thousand 26 for this question so that is

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.450 
thousand 26 for this question so that is
really<00:00:15.780> really<00:00:15.809> exciting<00:00:16.139> I'm<00:00:16.949> loving<00:00:17.340> how

really really exciting I'm loving how
much<00:00:17.640> feedback<00:00:17.940> we're<00:00:18.330> getting<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.750> its

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
much feedback we're getting and its

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.450 
much feedback we're getting and its
really<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.109> think<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.529> more<00:00:19.710> feedback<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.340> get

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
really I think the more feedback you get

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.370 
really I think the more feedback you get
on<00:00:20.609> something<00:00:21.060> like<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.750> more<00:00:21.960> accurate

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
on something like this the more accurate

on something like this the more accurate
like<00:00:23.189> your<00:00:23.400> results<00:00:23.580> become<00:00:24.180> because<00:00:24.510> they're

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
like your results become because they're

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.679 
like your results become because they're
um<00:00:25.279> you<00:00:26.279> know<00:00:26.430> accounting<00:00:27.029> for<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.359> many<00:00:27.480> more

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689

people so this week's question asks what
is<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> mascaras<00:00:31.260> biggest<00:00:31.769> downfall<00:00:32.399> like<00:00:32.640> what

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
is a mascaras biggest downfall like what

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.750 
is a mascaras biggest downfall like what
is<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.059> worst<00:00:33.329> problem<00:00:34.340> one<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.430> them<00:00:35.610> can

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
is the worst problem one of them can

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.869 
is the worst problem one of them can
cause<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.420> forty-nine<00:00:37.350> percent<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:38.100> really

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
cause and forty-nine percent so really

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.760 
cause and forty-nine percent so really
close<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.300> half<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.899> everybody<00:00:40.710> that

close to half of everybody that
responded<00:00:41.399> said<00:00:41.670> clumps<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:43.230> next<00:00:43.680> vote<00:00:44.430> was

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
responded said clumps the next vote was

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.799 
responded said clumps the next vote was
smudges<00:00:45.420> during<00:00:45.750> where<00:00:46.280> 23%<00:00:47.280> next<00:00:48.239> said<00:00:48.600> not

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
smudges during where 23% next said not

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.840 
smudges during where 23% next said not
volumizing<00:00:49.620> enough<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.010> was<00:00:50.129> ten<00:00:50.399> percent

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
volumizing enough that was ten percent

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.270 
volumizing enough that was ten percent
six<00:00:51.480> percent<00:00:51.930> said<00:00:52.110> not<00:00:52.350> lengthening<00:00:52.980> enough

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
five percent said the formula isn't

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.799 
five percent said the formula isn't
buildable<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.489> three<00:00:57.090> percent<00:00:57.480> said<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
buildable and three percent said the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.939

wand<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.379> hard<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.920> use<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.670> I<00:01:00.739> wanted<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.800> I

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
wand is hard to use so I wanted to I

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.799 
wand is hard to use so I wanted to I
give<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> lot<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.489> recommendations<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.600> feel

give a lot of recommendations I feel
like<00:01:03.930> with<00:01:04.559> my<00:01:04.710> question<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.280> week<00:01:05.430> depending

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
like with my question the week depending

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.460 
like with my question the week depending
on<00:01:06.000> what<00:01:06.180> your<00:01:06.330> response<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.930> were<00:01:07.110> but<00:01:07.320> for

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
on what your response is were but for

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.840 
on what your response is were but for
this<00:01:07.560> one<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.799> thought<00:01:08.070> maybe<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.400> might<00:01:08.460> just

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
this one I thought maybe I might just

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.590 
this one I thought maybe I might just
give<00:01:09.060> some<00:01:09.390> tips<00:01:09.979> instead<00:01:10.979> some<00:01:11.909> application

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
give some tips instead some application

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.390 
give some tips instead some application
tips<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.080> can<00:01:13.229> sort<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.799> help<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.220> get

tips that can sort of help you get
around<00:01:14.549> some<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.119> these<00:01:15.270> common<00:01:15.750> issues<00:01:16.110> so

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
around some of these common issues so

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.749 
around some of these common issues so
for<00:01:17.159> clumps<00:01:17.759> um<00:01:18.170> recently<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.439> was<00:01:20.280> with<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
for clumps um recently I was with in the

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.530 
for clumps um recently I was with in the
past<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.450> know<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.810> couple<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:22.560> years<00:01:23.540> brands

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
past you know a couple of years brands

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.880 
past you know a couple of years brands
have<00:01:24.659> come<00:01:24.810> out<00:01:24.930> with<00:01:24.960> more<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.350> these<00:01:25.500> rubber

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
have come out with more of these rubber

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.749 
have come out with more of these rubber
brush<00:01:26.400> mascaras<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:28.310> although<00:01:29.310> some<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.610> them

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
brush mascaras and although some of them

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.420 
brush mascaras and although some of them
I<00:01:29.939> haven't<00:01:30.240> been<00:01:30.329> satisfied<00:01:30.930> with<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:32.400> fact

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
I haven't been satisfied with the fact

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.830 
I haven't been satisfied with the fact
like<00:01:33.030> maybe<00:01:33.329> they<00:01:33.479> didn't<00:01:33.720> give<00:01:33.810> enough

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
like maybe they didn't give enough

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.289 
like maybe they didn't give enough
length<00:01:34.320> or<00:01:34.619> thickness<00:01:34.790> what<00:01:35.790> they<00:01:35.939> have<00:01:36.270> done

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
length or thickness what they have done

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.649 
length or thickness what they have done
is<00:01:36.840> really<00:01:37.500> kept<00:01:37.799> from<00:01:38.070> clumping<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:39.090> if<00:01:39.360> that

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
is really kept from clumping so if that

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.350 
is really kept from clumping so if that
is<00:01:39.960> your<00:01:40.350> biggest<00:01:40.590> concern<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:42.180> know

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
is your biggest concern and you know

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.060 
is your biggest concern and you know
maybe<00:01:42.810> there<00:01:43.049> are<00:01:43.350> certain<00:01:43.619> formulas<00:01:44.040> that

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
maybe there are certain formulas that

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.770 
maybe there are certain formulas that
are<00:01:44.220> buildable<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.909> where<00:01:45.060> maybe<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.600> get

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
are buildable to where maybe you can get

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.999 
are buildable to where maybe you can get
more<00:01:45.930> likely<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.350> can't<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:46.680> more<00:01:46.860> volume

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
more likely you can't get more volume

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.850 
more likely you can't get more volume
but<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.850> won't<00:01:48.060> get<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.390> clumps<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.020> those<00:01:49.500> um

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
but you won't get the clumps so those um

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.050 
but you won't get the clumps so those um
some<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.909> those<00:01:51.020> mascaras<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.320> allow<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.710> to

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060

meanwhile some might say the wand is

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.570 
meanwhile some might say the wand is
hard<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.410> use<00:02:22.560> because<00:02:22.710> it<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.100> kind<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.340> big

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
hard to use because it is kind of big

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.160 
hard to use because it is kind of big
and<00:02:23.610> it's<00:02:23.880> kind<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.090> bulky<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.540> get<00:02:24.660> right<00:02:24.990> in

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170

lashes<00:03:37.170> with<00:03:37.739> like<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.340> false<00:03:38.610> ones<00:03:38.910> so<00:03:39.269> um

lashes with like the false ones so um

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.750 
lashes with like the false ones so um
but<00:03:40.350> another<00:03:40.560> thing<00:03:40.860> with<00:03:41.070> clumps<00:03:41.459> in<00:03:41.549> terms

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
but another thing with clumps in terms

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.120 
but another thing with clumps in terms
of<00:03:41.850> just<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.150> way<00:03:42.299> you<00:03:42.360> apply<00:03:42.950> sometimes<00:03:43.950> with

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
of just the way you apply sometimes with

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.949 
of just the way you apply sometimes with
some<00:03:44.310> of<00:03:44.400> these<00:03:44.489> traditional<00:03:45.060> brush<00:03:45.299> mascaras

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
some of these traditional brush mascaras

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.640 
some of these traditional brush mascaras
like<00:03:46.170> this<00:03:46.380> one<00:03:46.620> or<00:03:46.830> my<00:03:47.040> L'Oreal<00:03:47.400> hit<00:03:47.670> mascara

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
like this one or my L'Oreal hit mascara

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.539 
like this one or my L'Oreal hit mascara
sometimes<00:03:49.650> there's<00:03:49.799> just<00:03:49.860> way<00:03:50.190> too<00:03:50.250> much

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
sometimes there's just way too much

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.210 
sometimes there's just way too much
product<00:03:50.850> on<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.239> brush<00:03:51.269> and<00:03:52.040> you<00:03:53.040> know<00:03:53.160> you

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
product on the brush and you know you

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.100 
product on the brush and you know you
can<00:03:53.519> get<00:03:53.610> away<00:03:53.730> with<00:03:54.000> taking<00:03:54.239> a<00:03:54.510> tissue<00:03:54.750> and

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
can get away with taking a tissue and

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.900 
can get away with taking a tissue and
just<00:03:55.140> wiping<00:03:55.620> your<00:03:55.769> brush<00:03:56.010> on<00:03:56.190> or<00:03:56.370> blotting

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
just wiping your brush on or blotting

just wiping your brush on or blotting
the<00:03:57.060> brush<00:03:57.330> sometimes<00:03:58.170> because<00:03:58.890> sometimes

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
the brush sometimes because sometimes

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.310 
the brush sometimes because sometimes
the<00:03:59.489> little<00:03:59.640> stopper<00:04:00.360> that's<00:04:00.570> in<00:04:00.810> these<00:04:00.989> that

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
the little stopper that's in these that

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.710 
the little stopper that's in these that
you<00:04:01.739> know<00:04:01.860> cleans<00:04:02.250> off<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.820> wand<00:04:03.060> is<00:04:03.330> you<00:04:03.480> take

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
you know cleans off the wand is you take

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.080 
you know cleans off the wand is you take
it<00:04:03.870> out<00:04:04.019> does<00:04:04.739> not<00:04:04.980> clean<00:04:05.250> off<00:04:05.400> enough<00:04:05.790> and

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
it out does not clean off enough and

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.270 
it out does not clean off enough and
that's<00:04:06.660> just<00:04:07.049> a<00:04:07.140> flaw<00:04:07.500> in<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.920> way<00:04:08.010> some<00:04:08.250> of

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
that's just a flaw in the way some of

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.949 
that's just a flaw in the way some of
these<00:04:08.489> are<00:04:08.700> made<00:04:08.910> you<00:04:09.209> know<00:04:09.330> some<00:04:09.720> of<00:04:09.750> them

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
these are made you know some of them

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.289 
these are made you know some of them
just<00:04:10.230> they<00:04:10.739> weren't<00:04:10.980> designed<00:04:11.310> right<00:04:11.940> in<00:04:12.180> my

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
just they weren't designed right in my

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:13.880 
just they weren't designed right in my
opinion<00:04:12.660> because<00:04:12.870> you<00:04:13.170> could<00:04:13.380> you<00:04:13.530> bring<00:04:13.769> the

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
opinion because you could you bring the

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.289 
opinion because you could you bring the
brush<00:04:14.100> out<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.400> there's<00:04:14.519> way<00:04:14.670> too<00:04:14.700> much<00:04:15.000> there

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
brush out and there's way too much there

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.750 
brush out and there's way too much there
so<00:04:15.690> keep<00:04:16.410> in<00:04:16.590> mind<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:16.979> that<00:04:17.040> goes<00:04:17.400> for<00:04:17.669> the

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
so keep in mind and that goes for the

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.159 
so keep in mind and that goes for the
smudging<00:04:18.209> that<00:04:18.359> brings<00:04:18.540> me<00:04:18.630> right<00:04:18.780> into<00:04:19.049> the

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
smudging that brings me right into the

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.990 
smudging that brings me right into the
smudging<00:04:19.620> point<00:04:19.890> because<00:04:20.250> sometimes<00:04:20.760> you're

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
smudging point because sometimes you're

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.920 
smudging point because sometimes you're
putting<00:04:21.419> too<00:04:21.720> much<00:04:22.020> product<00:04:22.500> on<00:04:22.860> your<00:04:22.919> eye

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
putting too much product on your eye

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.600 
putting too much product on your eye
shizz<00:04:24.350> and<00:04:24.590> you<00:04:24.770> wonder<00:04:24.979> why<00:04:25.130> you<00:04:25.310> have

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
shizz and you wonder why you have

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.340 
shizz and you wonder why you have
smudges<00:04:26.210> and<00:04:26.240> I've<00:04:26.509> said<00:04:26.750> this<00:04:26.780> before<00:04:26.930> with

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
smudges and I've said this before with

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.960 
smudges and I've said this before with
eyeliner<00:04:27.830> it's<00:04:28.100> because<00:04:28.400> there's<00:04:28.580> too<00:04:28.820> much

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
eyeliner it's because there's too much

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.020 
eyeliner it's because there's too much
there<00:04:29.330> okay<00:04:29.900> so<00:04:30.860> that's<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.639> reason<00:04:31.669> why<00:04:31.910> you

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
there okay so that's the reason why you

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.820 
there okay so that's the reason why you
smudge<00:04:32.449> out<00:04:32.630> your<00:04:32.780> liner<00:04:33.050> and<00:04:33.320> you<00:04:33.470> that's

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
smudge out your liner and you that's

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.230 
smudge out your liner and you that's
another<00:04:34.070> reason<00:04:34.280> why<00:04:34.430> you<00:04:34.550> need<00:04:34.729> to<00:04:34.789> sometimes

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
another reason why you need to sometimes

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.420 
another reason why you need to sometimes
wipe<00:04:35.479> off<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.930> brush<00:04:36.139> a<00:04:36.199> little<00:04:36.380> bit<00:04:36.740> and<00:04:36.919> by

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
wipe off the brush a little bit and by

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.790 
wipe off the brush a little bit and by
doing<00:04:37.639> that<00:04:37.789> if<00:04:38.090> you<00:04:38.210> need<00:04:38.530> I'll<00:04:39.530> give<00:04:39.680> you<00:04:39.770> a

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
doing that if you need I'll give you a

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.480 
doing that if you need I'll give you a
little<00:04:40.039> demo<00:04:40.699> here<00:04:40.729> for<00:04:41.180> that<00:04:41.300> got<00:04:41.810> a<00:04:41.840> tissue

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
little demo here for that got a tissue

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.879 
little demo here for that got a tissue
here's<00:04:43.490> my<00:04:43.729> brush<00:04:44.120> and<00:04:44.539> I'm<00:04:45.350> just<00:04:45.410> going<00:04:45.770> to

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
here's my brush and I'm just going to

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.270 
here's my brush and I'm just going to
kind<00:04:46.190> of<00:04:46.340> like<00:04:47.350> go<00:04:48.350> like<00:04:48.380> that<00:04:48.740> a<00:04:48.800> little<00:04:49.039> bit

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
kind of like go like that a little bit

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.210 
kind of like go like that a little bit
or<00:04:49.639> just<00:04:49.759> blot<00:04:50.180> it<00:04:50.210> okay<00:04:51.139> it's<00:04:51.620> cleaned<00:04:52.009> off<00:04:52.190> a

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
or just blot it okay it's cleaned off a

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.670 
or just blot it okay it's cleaned off a
little<00:04:52.520> more<00:04:52.639> and<00:04:53.150> it's<00:04:53.660> going<00:04:54.139> to<00:04:54.259> be<00:04:54.380> more

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
little more and it's going to be more

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.469 
little more and it's going to be more
buildable<00:04:55.250> that<00:04:55.490> way<00:04:55.729> too<00:04:55.789> because<00:04:56.360> you're

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
buildable that way too because you're

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.360 
buildable that way too because you're
not<00:04:56.599> going<00:04:56.720> to<00:04:56.810> have<00:04:56.960> one<00:04:57.380> super<00:04:57.889> thick<00:04:58.130> coat

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
not going to have one super thick coat

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.950 
not going to have one super thick coat
you're<00:04:58.759> gonna<00:04:58.880> have<00:04:59.000> thinner<00:04:59.330> coats<00:04:59.660> and<00:04:59.900> you

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
you're gonna have thinner coats and you

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.659 
you're gonna have thinner coats and you
can<00:05:00.110> build<00:05:00.320> on<00:05:00.590> top<00:05:00.830> of<00:05:01.070> that<00:05:01.280> and<00:05:01.490> the

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
can build on top of that and the

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.029 
can build on top of that and the
lengthening<00:05:02.240> will<00:05:02.449> take<00:05:02.660> more<00:05:02.990> and<00:05:03.199> the

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
lengthening will take more and the

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:05.740 
lengthening will take more and the
volumizing<00:05:04.580> the<00:05:04.970> thickening<00:05:05.360> will<00:05:05.539> work

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
volumizing the thickening will work

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.589 
volumizing the thickening will work
better<00:05:05.990> for<00:05:06.320> you<00:05:06.440> too<00:05:06.650> so<00:05:07.060> keep<00:05:08.060> that<00:05:08.120> in<00:05:08.300> mind

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
better for you too so keep that in mind

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:11.680 
better for you too so keep that in mind
I'm<00:05:08.840> a<00:05:08.900> really<00:05:09.770> good<00:05:09.800> tip<00:05:10.250> for<00:05:10.490> not<00:05:11.150> if<00:05:11.479> it's

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
I'm a really good tip for not if it's

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.140 
I'm a really good tip for not if it's
not<00:05:11.870> volumizing<00:05:12.710> enough<00:05:12.949> how<00:05:13.490> think<00:05:13.970> about

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
not volumizing enough how think about

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.180 
not volumizing enough how think about
how<00:05:14.360> you're<00:05:14.599> applying<00:05:14.930> your<00:05:15.199> mascara<00:05:15.740> okay

volumizing enough try false eyelashes
watch<00:05:25.460> the<00:05:25.699> tutorial<00:05:26.210> I<00:05:26.539> made<00:05:26.810> one<00:05:26.990> but<00:05:27.919> I'm

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
watch the tutorial I made one but I'm

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.600 
watch the tutorial I made one but I'm
putting<00:05:29.539> it<00:05:29.659> on<00:05:29.870> and<00:05:30.289> wiggling<00:05:30.979> it<00:05:31.190> side<00:05:31.580> to

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
putting it on and wiggling it side to

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.990 
putting it on and wiggling it side to
side<00:05:31.940> like<00:05:32.630> this<00:05:33.130> okay<00:05:34.130> that's<00:05:34.370> gonna<00:05:34.580> get<00:05:34.820> in

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
side like this okay that's gonna get in

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.659 
side like this okay that's gonna get in
there<00:05:35.240> and<00:05:35.270> make<00:05:35.690> by<00:05:36.650> volume<00:05:37.130> we<00:05:37.220> mean<00:05:37.430> the

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
there and make by volume we mean the

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.640 
there and make by volume we mean the
look<00:05:37.909> of<00:05:38.090> more<00:05:38.419> lashes<00:05:38.720> so<00:05:39.199> if<00:05:39.320> you're<00:05:39.470> going

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
look of more lashes so if you're going

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.560 
look of more lashes so if you're going
in<00:05:39.889> there<00:05:40.099> and<00:05:40.280> you're<00:05:40.729> wiggling<00:05:40.940> it<00:05:41.180> back<00:05:41.360> and

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
in there and you're wiggling it back and

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.750 
in there and you're wiggling it back and
forth<00:05:41.840> that<00:05:42.320> formula<00:05:42.919> is<00:05:43.070> getting<00:05:43.340> on<00:05:43.430> more

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
forth that formula is getting on more

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.430 
forth that formula is getting on more
lashes<00:05:44.090> because<00:05:44.479> you're<00:05:44.720> wiggling<00:05:45.050> it<00:05:45.320> you're

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
lashes because you're wiggling it you're

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.990 
lashes because you're wiggling it you're
really<00:05:45.830> getting<00:05:46.099> it<00:05:46.190> in<00:05:46.340> there<00:05:46.460> and<00:05:46.639> not<00:05:46.789> just

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
really getting it in there and not just

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.850 
really getting it in there and not just
hitting<00:05:47.300> the<00:05:47.330> surface<00:05:47.750> you<00:05:48.229> know<00:05:48.349> few<00:05:48.620> lashes

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
hitting the surface you know few lashes

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.230 
hitting the surface you know few lashes
that<00:05:49.159> you<00:05:49.370> might<00:05:49.550> hit<00:05:49.699> when<00:05:49.880> you<00:05:49.970> lightly

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
that you might hit when you lightly

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.909 
that you might hit when you lightly
lightly<00:05:50.630> touch<00:05:50.990> it<00:05:51.169> you<00:05:51.260> really<00:05:51.530> want<00:05:51.770> to<00:05:51.800> get

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
lightly touch it you really want to get

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:53.620 
lightly touch it you really want to get
in<00:05:52.099> there<00:05:52.280> almost<00:05:52.849> like<00:05:52.970> you're<00:05:53.150> it's<00:05:53.419> like

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
in there almost like you're it's like

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.719 
in there almost like you're it's like
you're<00:05:53.810> scrubbing<00:05:54.289> it<00:05:54.530> onto<00:05:54.949> your<00:05:54.979> eyelashes

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
you're scrubbing it onto your eyelashes

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:58.089 
you're scrubbing it onto your eyelashes
so<00:05:56.360> that<00:05:56.630> is<00:05:56.780> going<00:05:56.870> to<00:05:56.990> build<00:05:57.169> thickness<00:05:57.680> and

00:05:58.089 --> 00:05:58.099 
so that is going to build thickness and

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:01.450 
so that is going to build thickness and
for<00:05:58.849> volume<00:05:59.330> do<00:05:59.900> that<00:06:00.080> same<00:06:00.440> thing<00:06:00.470> but<00:06:01.190> make

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
for volume do that same thing but make

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.100 
for volume do that same thing but make
sure<00:06:01.490> you're<00:06:01.820> getting<00:06:02.000> it<00:06:02.210> all<00:06:02.360> the<00:06:02.840> way<00:06:03.050> to

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
sure you're getting it all the way to

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.070 
sure you're getting it all the way to
the<00:06:03.470> ends<00:06:03.889> of<00:06:03.949> the<00:06:04.009> eyelashes<00:06:04.789> okay<00:06:05.180> all<00:06:05.449> the

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
the ends of the eyelashes okay all the

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.050 
the ends of the eyelashes okay all the
way<00:06:06.289> to<00:06:06.349> the<00:06:06.800> very<00:06:06.830> end<00:06:07.220> like<00:06:07.490> I<00:06:07.639> sometimes

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
way to the very end like I sometimes

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.939 
way to the very end like I sometimes
continue<00:06:08.509> the<00:06:08.630> movement<00:06:08.810> even<00:06:09.349> though<00:06:09.800> I'm

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:09.949 
continue the movement even though I'm

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:11.920 
continue the movement even though I'm
out<00:06:10.099> past<00:06:10.430> it<00:06:10.669> just<00:06:10.909> to<00:06:11.090> ensure<00:06:11.240> that<00:06:11.630> I've<00:06:11.750> got

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
out past it just to ensure that I've got

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.710 
out past it just to ensure that I've got
all<00:06:12.169> the<00:06:12.380> way<00:06:12.500> to<00:06:12.530> the<00:06:12.860> end<00:06:13.009> okay<00:06:13.610> sometimes<00:06:14.570> we

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
all the way to the end okay sometimes we

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.050 
all the way to the end okay sometimes we
just<00:06:14.870> hit<00:06:15.110> it<00:06:15.169> and<00:06:15.349> then<00:06:15.889> we<00:06:16.430> come<00:06:16.820> away<00:06:17.000> from

just hit it and then we come away from

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.399 
just hit it and then we come away from
it<00:06:17.330> that's<00:06:17.539> not<00:06:17.780> the<00:06:17.810> way<00:06:17.960> to<00:06:18.080> go<00:06:18.229> you're<00:06:18.349> not

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
going to build up anything that way

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.879 
going to build up anything that way
you're<00:06:20.570> not<00:06:20.630> going<00:06:20.810> to<00:06:20.870> get<00:06:20.990> any<00:06:21.259> length<00:06:21.620> you

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:21.889 
you're not going to get any length you

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:24.820 
you're not going to get any length you
want<00:06:22.580> to<00:06:22.699> go<00:06:22.820> all<00:06:23.060> the<00:06:23.300> way<00:06:23.330> and<00:06:23.720> beyond<00:06:24.259> okay

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 
because the way a lot of these mascaras

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.749 
because the way a lot of these mascaras
work<00:06:27.080> are<00:06:27.229> with<00:06:27.349> micro<00:06:27.800> fibers<00:06:28.280> and<00:06:28.490> those<00:06:28.639> are

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 
work are with micro fibers and those are

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:30.730 
work are with micro fibers and those are
like<00:06:28.909> itty-bitty<00:06:29.150> fibers<00:06:30.080> that<00:06:30.680> are

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.740 
like itty-bitty fibers that are

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.469 
like itty-bitty fibers that are
attaching<00:06:31.370> to<00:06:31.430> your<00:06:31.460> lashes<00:06:31.729> and<00:06:32.090> making<00:06:32.389> them

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 
attaching to your lashes and making them

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:35.080 
attaching to your lashes and making them
longer<00:06:32.750> well<00:06:33.500> there's<00:06:33.889> you're<00:06:34.460> not<00:06:34.610> really

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
longer well there's you're not really

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.119 
longer well there's you're not really
doing<00:06:35.300> yourself<00:06:35.450> any<00:06:35.810> favors<00:06:35.930> by<00:06:36.469> not<00:06:36.590> going

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:37.129 
doing yourself any favors by not going

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:39.249 
doing yourself any favors by not going
full<00:06:37.610> length<00:06:38.059> of<00:06:38.179> your<00:06:38.239> eyelashes<00:06:39.020> because

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:39.259 
full length of your eyelashes because

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:41.409 
full length of your eyelashes because
then<00:06:39.679> those<00:06:39.830> microfibers<00:06:40.219> aren't<00:06:41.149> building

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:41.419 
then those microfibers aren't building

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:43.209 
then those microfibers aren't building
on<00:06:41.689> top<00:06:41.929> of<00:06:42.169> one<00:06:42.349> another<00:06:42.379> like<00:06:42.800> they<00:06:43.009> would

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:43.219 
on top of one another like they would

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:46.149 
on top of one another like they would
otherwise<00:06:44.149> so<00:06:44.809> keep<00:06:45.439> that<00:06:45.469> in<00:06:45.649> mind<00:06:45.739> go<00:06:45.949> all

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:46.159 
otherwise so keep that in mind go all

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:47.139 
otherwise so keep that in mind go all
the<00:06:46.369> way<00:06:46.399> to<00:06:46.519> the<00:06:46.639> ends<00:06:46.819> of<00:06:46.849> your<00:06:46.909> lashes

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:47.149 
the way to the ends of your lashes

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:50.949

that's a good tip for lengthening trying

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:52.419 
that's a good tip for lengthening trying
to<00:06:51.019> think<00:06:51.169> if<00:06:51.259> I<00:06:51.349> have<00:06:51.529> any<00:06:51.769> other<00:06:51.979> tips<00:06:52.159> those

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:52.429 
to think if I have any other tips those

00:06:52.429 --> 00:06:54.850 
to think if I have any other tips those
are<00:06:52.580> my<00:06:52.699> main<00:06:52.969> ones<00:06:53.269> basically<00:06:53.989> look<00:06:54.679> at<00:06:54.800> the

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860 
are my main ones basically look at the

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.619 
are my main ones basically look at the
mascara<00:06:55.309> you're<00:06:55.519> using<00:06:55.759> if<00:06:56.089> you're<00:06:56.209> finding<00:06:56.479> a

00:06:56.619 --> 00:06:56.629 
mascara you're using if you're finding a

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:58.179 
mascara you're using if you're finding a
lot<00:06:56.749> of<00:06:56.899> clumps<00:06:57.199> try<00:06:57.529> one<00:06:57.709> of<00:06:57.739> those<00:06:57.889> rubber

00:06:58.179 --> 00:06:58.189 
lot of clumps try one of those rubber

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:00.999 
lot of clumps try one of those rubber
brush<00:06:58.459> mascaras<00:06:59.269> and<00:06:59.419> also<00:07:00.289> in<00:07:00.589> terms<00:07:00.830> of

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:01.009 
brush mascaras and also in terms of

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:04.239 
brush mascaras and also in terms of
clumping<00:07:01.519> and<00:07:01.719> smudging<00:07:02.719> wipe<00:07:03.589> off<00:07:03.830> the<00:07:04.039> brush

00:07:04.239 --> 00:07:04.249 
clumping and smudging wipe off the brush

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:06.249 
clumping and smudging wipe off the brush
from<00:07:04.550> time<00:07:04.819> to<00:07:04.939> time<00:07:04.999> especially<00:07:05.419> when<00:07:06.139> that

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:06.259 
from time to time especially when that

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.229 
from time to time especially when that
mascara<00:07:06.739> is<00:07:06.949> new<00:07:07.279> I<00:07:07.309> think<00:07:07.580> it<00:07:07.819> will<00:07:07.909> help<00:07:08.059> a

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:08.239 
mascara is new I think it will help a

00:07:08.239 --> 00:07:10.209 
mascara is new I think it will help a
lot<00:07:08.479> it'll<00:07:08.809> make<00:07:09.019> it<00:07:09.139> more<00:07:09.289> buildable<00:07:09.769> too<00:07:09.979> so

00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:10.219 
lot it'll make it more buildable too so

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:12.159 
lot it'll make it more buildable too so
that's<00:07:10.399> a<00:07:10.490> tip<00:07:10.669> to<00:07:10.819> make<00:07:10.849> if<00:07:11.209> the<00:07:11.779> formula

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:12.169 
that's a tip to make if the formula

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:14.829 
that's a tip to make if the formula
isn't<00:07:12.319> buildable<00:07:12.830> enough<00:07:13.069> try<00:07:13.399> that<00:07:13.699> you<00:07:14.659> can

00:07:14.829 --> 00:07:14.839 
isn't buildable enough try that you can

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:16.540 
isn't buildable enough try that you can
do<00:07:14.959> multiple<00:07:15.169> coats<00:07:15.649> and<00:07:15.919> it<00:07:15.979> will<00:07:16.099> build<00:07:16.309> much

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:16.550 
do multiple coats and it will build much

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.899 
do multiple coats and it will build much
upon<00:07:16.969> itself<00:07:17.330> much<00:07:17.629> better<00:07:17.899> um<00:07:18.459> for<00:07:19.459> volume

00:07:19.899 --> 00:07:19.909 
upon itself much better um for volume

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:21.339 
upon itself much better um for volume
make<00:07:20.089> sure<00:07:20.240> you're<00:07:20.419> wiggling<00:07:20.659> it<00:07:20.990> and<00:07:21.139> for

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:21.349 
make sure you're wiggling it and for

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:23.079 
make sure you're wiggling it and for
length<00:07:21.589> make<00:07:21.830> sure<00:07:22.009> you're<00:07:22.159> going<00:07:22.309> all<00:07:22.639> the

length make sure you're going all the

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:25.239 
length make sure you're going all the
