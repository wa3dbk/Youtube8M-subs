00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.570
 often this kind of message a lot 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.980

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.450
 make videos where you meet our 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.560

 to be editor completely make video 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.949

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.620
 a question there not just a 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.840

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.670
 singer serge gainsbourg he i called 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.170
 my cat serge gainsbourg I wish 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.209
 that we were a little long a bit bad at 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.099
 to say you see serge gainsbourg serge 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.970
 gainsbourg what was it excessively 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.790
 long ridiculous 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.840
 So I obviously genius serge 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.609
 serge is like me i am someone 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.260
 who loves all minions a risk is 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:49.090
 everything there are minutes if it has 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.140
 very quickly transformed into energy thoughts 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.030
 you that everything is relative 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.280
 it depends on why you do not show up 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.329
 not in presidential elections because 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.579
 that if I were president the republic 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:00.239
 you see I think that France 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.239
 would look like that 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.640
 your kind of girl frankly me 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.340
 I like the girls a little in the 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.930
 style there frankly I like it 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.070
 all types of girls as long as they 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.800
 are nice you wait until they are 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.120
 sincere natural as long as there is the 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.700
 kindness that passes in the eyes 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.810
 like that not me it suits me able 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.580
 to say that first name as quickly 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.950
 possible without stumbling aaa 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.190
 that was difficult what do you do 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.450
 to have a baldness is barely 26 years old 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.220
 board already I have the chance of not at all 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.900
 to have baldness and when do you 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.490
 you said I'm going to suck some girls 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.480
 calling me on twitter ben laden 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.590
 otherwise it's really stopped ten years 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.540
 have you ever cried while doing 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.740
 kaka kind of times it hurts you have 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.630
 the impression that it's a rocket that 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.520
 fate ligh light really has a concern 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.170
 mind you mean how much then that 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.130
 means that we can often camera 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.660
 like her a little bit diving 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.700

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.550
 not hide that with girls 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.550

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.410

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.850

 I hope you liked me tell me 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.920
