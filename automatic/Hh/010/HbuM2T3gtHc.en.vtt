00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.319
 there comes to the reading and meditation of the 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.480
 second biblical book of samuel 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.820
 revived by his word offers us the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.650
 opportunity to be united in the meal 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.990
 daily bible 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.510
 the two books known today as 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.760
 first and second if tomorrow appear 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.550
 as a single volume in all 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.220
 Hebrew manuscripts seems very 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.910
 reasonable to conclude that they are a 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.149
 collection of narrations each complete 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.910
 in itself each author wrote for 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.239
 inspiration and all parties have been 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.730
 finally united as a whole only to the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.340
 direction of holy spirit 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.180
 Samuel's second book begins with the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.100
 death of Saul and Jonathan continues when 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.100
 the glorious reign of David 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.710
 first and foremost about helping by 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.850
 seven and a half years and logan jerusalem 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.180
 mainly help Israel for 33 years and 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.880
 complete with a purchase of the place where 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.939
 later the time was raised for 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.310
 much more would like to pass on the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.080
 history we can learn lessons and 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.560
 apply this our life 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.570
 after its approval of saul china to 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.479
 David's faithfulness 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.390
 the name chosen by God as the model of 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.030
 leader with a certain one's mistakes 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.689
 authority does not compare to anything 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.820
 before him and his descendants 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:36.119
 would be born messiah bringing salvation 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.700
 hope for all mankind 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.869

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.470
 second of samuel chapter 22 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:49.860
