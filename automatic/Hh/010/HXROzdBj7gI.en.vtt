00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 since the prehistory the Inuit 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.109
 they used fast freezing for 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.300
 keep the fish put the preys 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.269
 in the ice to freeze them instantly 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.799
 but only in the twentieth century the rest 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.680
 of the world has discovered that this method 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.779
 it was better than slow freezing is a 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:26.010
 case of progress made in rhythm 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:28.560
 the frozen fish quickly frozen 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.340
 already on the ship and more tasty and maintains 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.340
 its consistency 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.850
 this is a piece of cod it was 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.350
 frozen quickly in china then 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.960
 transported this state up to 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.469
 new scotland establishment where it will come 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.300
 turned into fish sticks i 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.070
 pieces of fish are placed in one 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.440
 machine where a powerful piston there 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.050
 pushes towards the blades that the Italian i 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.050
 blocks of the length of 48 centimeters 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.510
 the pieces are inserted vertically 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.229
 in special grooves below 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.720
 of the blades the Italian further from 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.410
 a piece of fish is obtained 85 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.410
 chopsticks 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.930
 finally it checks itself with attention 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.119
 are all integers in another chain of 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.520
 production of fine egle fillets 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.759
 frozen quickly are discharged 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:41.220
 in a hopper then pass on a 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:44.330
 conveyor then the threads fall on 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.330
 a vibrating plane 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.610
 vibrations separate the threads that are 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.610
 move to different lanes 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.970
 then we move on to the inspection for 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:10.380
 check for any 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:12.610
 faults it's time for a hot shower 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.500
 lasts just a second and water 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.110
 hot melts the outer ice 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.760
 without thawing the fish in this way 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.780
 the batter will adhere perfectly 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.780
 with fish 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.200
 now the fish sticks come 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.849
 covered with a batter of 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.849
 flour water and rho 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.269
 the excess ends up in a container 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.110
 below and covers the fund of 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.110
 fish sticks 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.250
 returning to the production chain of the 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.840
 gra up a toasted wheat mixture 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.010
 is inserted in a called machine 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.690
 in a breakdown this creates a twinge 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.819
 rain of crumbs covering 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:05.370
 evenly fillets that pass there 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:09.230
 then the files that frozen 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.230
 breaded pass into the fryer 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.370
 even the sticks are fried for 28 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.290
 enough seconds to cook it 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.180
 outer layer leaving frozen 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.550
 the inside of the typical fish 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.580
 characteristic of the famous sticks of 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.580
 fish 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.430
 the coating now cooked the sticks 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.270
 the fish fillets are conveyed 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.270
 towards the fried foods 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.910
 meanwhile in a third chain of 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.010
 production are paid into a 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.010
 oil and red pepper blender 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:49.040
 then parsley is added to it 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.459
 everything is mixed by hand while 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.920
 cook the red pepper sauce in Naples 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.329
 falls from an applicator covering these 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.140
 tilapia fillets 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.140
 will rise 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.050
 the tilapia fillets are covered 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:10.040
 without being fried after that they pass 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.380
 in the freezer suck the sticks of 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.040
 fish fillets palati le up yes 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.110
 found in similar freezers after 45 minutes 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.260
 the three until it slides on a hopper 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:30.860
 where it is weighed and then wrapped 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:32.810
 each package is sealed a 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:38.960
 oscillating feeder deposit e 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:41.450
 fish sticks in boxes a 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.910
 last check and are ready for the 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.950
 sale 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:49.480
 the red pepper fillets instead come 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.480
 vacuum packed 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.900
 and now there is plenty of fish to be 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.039
 to fry 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.039
 there is something for everyone
