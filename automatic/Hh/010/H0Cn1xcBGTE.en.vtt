could could could fight effectively on
the<00:01:00.949> skylines<00:01:01.370> became<00:01:01.730> way<00:01:02.120> more<00:01:02.149> important

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929

the skylines became way more important
and<00:01:03.129> by<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.220> time<00:01:04.280> Booker<00:01:05.180> gets<00:01:05.420> to<00:01:05.860> to

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
and by the time Booker gets to to

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.219 
and by the time Booker gets to to
Columbia<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:07.670> skylines<00:01:08.150> have<00:01:08.600> a<00:01:08.630> broad<00:01:09.020> range

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.050 
Columbia the skylines have a broad range
of<00:01:09.409> usage<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.100> there<00:01:10.310> you<00:01:10.430> can<00:01:10.460> still<00:01:10.850> see

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
of usage and there you can still see

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.910 
of usage and there you can still see
you'll<00:01:11.240> see<00:01:11.390> in<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:11.570> demo<00:01:11.689> cargo<00:01:12.560> being<00:01:12.740> moved

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
you'll see in the demo cargo being moved

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.679 
you'll see in the demo cargo being moved
around<00:01:13.009> on<00:01:13.340> those<00:01:13.460> things<00:01:13.820> that<00:01:14.000> creates<00:01:14.450> even

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
around on those things that creates even

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.170 
around on those things that creates even
more<00:01:14.750> hazardous<00:01:15.320> situation<00:01:15.860> but<00:01:16.700> there's

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
more hazardous situation but there's

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.170 
more hazardous situation but there's
also<00:01:17.420> people<00:01:17.689> using<00:01:18.170> it<00:01:18.729> for<00:01:19.729> all<00:01:19.850> kinds<00:01:20.030> of

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180

one of the my big frustrations and

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.550 
one of the my big frustrations and
working<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:32.970> bioshock<00:01:33.510> 1<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:34.020> we<00:01:34.170> have<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
working on bioshock 1 is we have the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.850 
working on bioshock 1 is we have the
ocean<00:01:34.790> but<00:01:35.900> it<00:01:36.900> was<00:01:37.110> really<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:37.440> a<00:01:37.650> piece<00:01:37.830> of

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
ocean but it was really just a piece of

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.800 
ocean but it was really just a piece of
art<00:01:38.160> we<00:01:38.340> never<00:01:38.520> really<00:01:38.820> dealt<00:01:39.090> with<00:01:39.330> you<00:01:39.780> know

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
art we never really dealt with you know

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.330 
art we never really dealt with you know
what<00:01:40.080> it<00:01:40.170> was<00:01:40.290> like<00:01:40.440> to<00:01:40.500> fight<00:01:40.860> at<00:01:41.010> the<00:01:41.100> bottom

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
what it was like to fight at the bottom

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.670 
what it was like to fight at the bottom
of<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.520> ocean<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:42.540> any<00:01:42.780> meaningful<00:01:42.930> way<00:01:43.260> um

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
of the ocean in any meaningful way um

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.750 
of the ocean in any meaningful way um
and<00:01:44.750> in<00:01:45.750> an<00:01:46.440> infinite<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.010> know<00:01:47.130> we<00:01:47.369> wanted

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
and in an infinite you know we wanted

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.219 
and in an infinite you know we wanted
you<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.940> be<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.300> sky<00:01:48.540> we<00:01:48.750> wanted<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
you to be in the sky we wanted the

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.690 
you to be in the sky we wanted the
visuals<00:01:49.680> obviously<00:01:50.190> that<00:01:50.280> which<00:01:50.430> i<00:01:50.490> think<00:01:50.550> are

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
visuals obviously that which i think are

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.240 
visuals obviously that which i think are
really<00:01:50.850> great<00:01:51.180> but<00:01:51.810> we<00:01:51.900> also<00:01:52.110> wanted<00:01:52.619> vertical

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
really great but we also wanted vertical

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.249 
really great but we also wanted vertical
combat<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.850> we<00:01:54.420> played<00:01:54.660> around<00:01:54.869> lots<00:01:55.140> of

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
combat and we played around lots of

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.859 
combat and we played around lots of
ideas<00:01:55.350> for<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:55.770> using<00:01:56.250> flight<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.030> stuff

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
ideas for like using flight and stuff

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:58.969 
ideas for like using flight and stuff
like<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.020> for<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.290> while<00:01:58.320> but<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.800> end<00:01:58.890> of

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
like that for a while but in the end of

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.800 
like that for a while but in the end of
the<00:01:59.040> day<00:01:59.220> you<00:01:59.790> know<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.910> me<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.330> experience<00:02:00.540> of

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
the day you know to me the experience of

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.560 
the day you know to me the experience of
being<00:02:00.869> on<00:02:01.080> a<00:02:01.110> plane<00:02:02.149> versus<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.240> experience

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
being on a plane versus the experience

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.630 
being on a plane versus the experience
of<00:02:03.630> being<00:02:03.780> on<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> roller<00:02:04.289> coaster<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.399> very
