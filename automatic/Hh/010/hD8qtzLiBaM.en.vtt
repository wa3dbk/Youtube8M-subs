00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
don't really like about this figure is

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.190 
don't really like about this figure is
the<00:01:21.900> detachable<00:01:22.549> leg<00:01:23.549> on<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.850> back<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.420> mean<00:01:24.840> I

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
the detachable leg on the back I mean I

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.999 
the detachable leg on the back I mean I
don't<00:01:25.409> think<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:25.680> supposed<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.920> be

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
don't think it's supposed to be

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.100 
don't think it's supposed to be
detachable<00:01:26.460> but<00:01:26.700> yeah<00:01:27.119> whatever<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.780> think<00:01:27.930> I

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
detachable but yeah whatever I think I

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.530 
detachable but yeah whatever I think I
broke<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.549> but<00:01:29.549> yeah<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.210> only<00:01:30.360> one

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
broke it but yeah this is the only one

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.960 
broke it but yeah this is the only one
that<00:01:30.600> comes<00:01:30.840> off<00:01:31.020> really<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.850> has

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
that comes off really and it has

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.370 
that comes off really and it has
different<00:01:33.180> articulation<00:01:33.990> than<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.229> other

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
different articulation than the other

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.460 
different articulation than the other
legs<00:01:34.650> which<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.759> kind<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:35.970> weird<00:01:36.150> but<00:01:36.990> maybe

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
legs which is kind of weird but maybe

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.200 
legs which is kind of weird but maybe
it's<00:01:37.740> just<00:01:37.829> for<00:01:38.040> us<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.400> can<00:01:38.579> like<00:01:38.729> stand<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.090> up

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
it's just for us a can like stand it up

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.539 
it's just for us a can like stand it up
different<00:01:39.659> ways<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:40.049> don't<00:01:40.290> know<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:41.460> it's

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
different ways I don't know but it's

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.469 
different ways I don't know but it's
really<00:01:42.320> pointless<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.560> my<00:01:43.680> opinion<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:45.119> this

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
really pointless in my opinion and this

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.690 
really pointless in my opinion and this
little<00:01:45.869> thing<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.259> top<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:47.430> looks<00:01:47.610> like

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
little thing on the top it looks like

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.359 
little thing on the top it looks like
the<00:01:47.759> Venus<00:01:47.880> flytrap<00:01:48.149> can<00:01:48.810> come<00:01:49.020> off<00:01:49.340> but<00:01:50.340> I

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
the Venus flytrap can come off but I

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.649 
the Venus flytrap can come off but I
suggest<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.909> not<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.210> do<00:01:51.299> this<00:01:51.479> because

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
suggest you not to do this because

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.609 
suggest you not to do this because
