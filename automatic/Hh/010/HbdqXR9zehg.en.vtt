thing you want to do is look at your
modules<00:00:10.889> first<00:00:11.670> module<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.330> want<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.540> drop<00:00:12.690> is

modules first module you want to drop is

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.259 
modules first module you want to drop is
an<00:00:12.960> ace<00:00:13.139> medical<00:00:13.620> category<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.309> then<00:00:14.549> medical

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
an ace medical category and then medical

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.450 
an ace medical category and then medical
settings<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.650> you'll<00:00:16.830> see<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.039> medical

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
settings in that you'll see a medical

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.029 
settings in that you'll see a medical
level<00:00:17.789> whether<00:00:17.940> it's<00:00:18.029> basic<00:00:18.750> or<00:00:18.930> advanced<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
level whether it's basic or advanced the

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.340 
level whether it's basic or advanced the
basic<00:00:20.490> level<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:21.000> similar<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.840> AGM

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350

basic level is similar to the AGM
medical<00:00:22.890> system<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:24.150> I'm<00:00:24.210> going<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.420> detail

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
medical system so I'm going to detail

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.320 
medical system so I'm going to detail
the<00:00:24.960> advanced<00:00:25.380> medical<00:00:25.710> system<00:00:26.269> then<00:00:27.269> you

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
the advanced medical system then you

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.429 
the advanced medical system then you
look<00:00:27.480> at<00:00:27.570> your<00:00:27.599> medical<00:00:27.960> setting<00:00:28.260> whether

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
look at your medical setting whether

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.250 
look at your medical setting whether
that's<00:00:28.619> normal<00:00:29.039> or<00:00:29.099> advanced<00:00:29.929> so<00:00:30.929> for<00:00:31.109> normal

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
that's normal or advanced so for normal

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.530 
that's normal or advanced so for normal
when<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.859> take<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.160> blood<00:00:32.759> pressure<00:00:32.969> for<00:00:33.510> a

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
when you take a blood pressure for a

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.660 
when you take a blood pressure for a
patient<00:00:34.050> you'll<00:00:34.230> get<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.469> either<00:00:35.010> low<00:00:35.219> medium

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
patient you'll get a either low medium

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.030 
patient you'll get a either low medium
or<00:00:35.760> high<00:00:35.989> whereas<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.350> advanced<00:00:37.890> one

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
or high whereas in the advanced one

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.670 
or high whereas in the advanced one
it'll<00:00:38.340> give<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.000> number<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:40.379> blood

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
it'll give you the number of the blood

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.060 
it'll give you the number of the blood
pressure<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.160> 120<00:00:41.640> over<00:00:41.760> 80<00:00:42.710> that's<00:00:43.710> just<00:00:43.980> a

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
pressure so 120 over 80 that's just a

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.100 
pressure so 120 over 80 that's just a
type<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.760> detail<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.510> include<00:00:45.719> into<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
type of detail you can include into the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.950 
type of detail you can include into the
game<00:00:46.289> for<00:00:46.500> little<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:48.090> can<00:00:48.239> enable<00:00:48.480> little

default I just recommend setting it to a
negative<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:06.869> which<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.170> forever<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.770> this

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
negative one which is forever as this

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.800 
negative one which is forever as this
could<00:01:08.460> clutter<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.880> game<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.420> have<00:01:09.630> not

use a personal aid kit you can set that
to<00:04:40.190> a<00:04:40.730> range<00:04:41.030> of<00:04:41.210> different<00:04:41.300> things<00:04:41.630> I'll

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
to a range of different things I'll

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.940 
to a range of different things I'll
explain<00:04:42.170> each<00:04:42.320> of<00:04:42.440> these<00:04:42.560> and<00:04:42.770> we<00:04:42.860> actually

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
explain each of these and we actually

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.670 
explain each of these and we actually
set<00:04:43.370> those<00:04:43.810> so<00:04:44.810> currently<00:04:45.260> the<00:04:45.380> moment<00:04:45.620> I'll

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
set those so currently the moment I'll

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.190 
set those so currently the moment I'll
leave<00:04:45.830> that<00:04:45.860> at<00:04:46.070> vehicles<00:04:46.460> and<00:04:46.610> facility

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
leave that at vehicles and facility

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.380 
leave that at vehicles and facility
there's<00:04:48.200> also<00:04:48.380> a<00:04:48.530> surgical<00:04:49.100> kit<00:04:49.250> I<00:04:49.490> could<00:04:50.210> not

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
there's also a surgical kit I could not

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.390 
there's also a surgical kit I could not
find<00:04:50.780> how<00:04:51.200> to<00:04:51.260> use<00:04:51.620> the<00:04:51.800> surgery<00:04:52.070> compute

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
find how to use the surgery compute

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.580 
find how to use the surgery compute
properly<00:04:52.790> you<00:04:53.000> can<00:04:53.210> use<00:04:53.600> it<00:04:53.750> on<00:04:53.900> the<00:04:54.020> torso<00:04:54.290> but

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
properly you can use it on the torso but

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.680 
properly you can use it on the torso but
it<00:04:54.680> doesn't<00:04:55.010> seem<00:04:55.190> to<00:04:55.400> do<00:04:55.850> any<00:04:56.150> affect<00:04:56.540> to<00:04:56.660> the

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
it doesn't seem to do any affect to the

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.960 
it doesn't seem to do any affect to the
patient<00:04:57.170> so<00:04:57.830> this<00:04:57.980> may<00:04:58.190> not<00:04:58.220> be<00:04:58.460> implemented

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
patient so this may not be implemented

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.410 
patient so this may not be implemented
yet<00:04:59.920> again<00:05:00.920> is<00:05:01.160> the<00:05:01.280> surgical<00:05:01.700> kit<00:05:01.820> consumable

player can be given CPR should they go
down<00:05:36.320> multiple<00:05:36.800> times<00:05:36.860> I<00:05:38.650> believe<00:05:39.650> if<00:05:39.800> you

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
down multiple times I believe if you

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.370 
down multiple times I believe if you
leave<00:05:40.100> this<00:05:40.220> as<00:05:40.370> disabled<00:05:41.060> they<00:05:41.840> have<00:05:42.350> a

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
leave this as disabled they have a

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.270 
leave this as disabled they have a
infinite<00:05:43.160> amount<00:05:43.370> of<00:05:43.430> time<00:05:43.669> to<00:05:44.270> be<00:05:44.419> revived

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
infinite amount of time to be revived

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.840 
infinite amount of time to be revived
however<00:05:46.280> I<00:05:46.430> haven't<00:05:46.910> tested<00:05:47.240> that<00:05:48.550> the<00:05:49.550> next

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
however I haven't tested that the next

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.330 
however I haven't tested that the next
one<00:05:49.910> we'll<00:05:50.030> look<00:05:50.060> at<00:05:50.210> is<00:05:50.270> the<00:05:50.510> set<00:05:50.690> medic<00:05:50.870> class

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
one we'll look at is the set medic class

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.159 
one we'll look at is the set medic class
so<00:05:52.340> you'll<00:05:52.580> put<00:05:52.880> in<00:05:53.060> the<00:05:53.090> name<00:05:53.419> of<00:05:53.720> the<00:05:53.840> unit

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 
so you'll put in the name of the unit

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:56.470 
so you'll put in the name of the unit
and<00:05:54.290> then<00:05:55.130> you<00:05:55.220> can<00:05:55.370> put<00:05:55.520> that<00:05:55.700> up<00:05:55.910> so<00:05:56.240> you<00:05:56.330> can

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
and then you can put that up so you can

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.870 
and then you can put that up so you can
set<00:05:56.750> that<00:05:56.960> list<00:05:57.650> as<00:05:57.890> either<00:05:58.160> regular<00:05:58.430> medics

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
set that list as either regular medics

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.390 
set that list as either regular medics
or<00:05:59.000> doctors<00:05:59.450> so<00:06:00.230> you<00:06:00.290> can<00:06:00.530> have<00:06:00.680> two<00:06:00.919> so<00:06:01.160> I<00:06:01.220> can

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
or doctors so you can have two so I can

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.300 
or doctors so you can have two so I can
set<00:06:01.640> a<00:06:01.910> list<00:06:02.240> of<00:06:02.419> regular<00:06:02.780> medics<00:06:03.020> and<00:06:03.260> then<00:06:04.250> I

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
set a list of regular medics and then I

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.360 
set a list of regular medics and then I
can<00:06:04.460> set<00:06:04.700> a<00:06:04.730> list<00:06:05.090> of<00:06:05.300> doctors<00:06:05.540> as<00:06:06.370> separate

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
can set a list of doctors as separate

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.090 
can set a list of doctors as separate
things<00:06:07.400> so<00:06:07.880> I<00:06:08.090> want<00:06:08.270> this<00:06:08.360> medic<00:06:08.660> here<00:06:08.919> to<00:06:09.919> be

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100

on<00:07:10.460> the<00:07:10.580> map<00:07:10.760> however<00:07:11.180> I've<00:07:11.300> tested<00:07:11.780> that<00:07:11.930> and
