00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
conventional like you know some of its

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.900 
conventional like you know some of its
very<00:02:04.530> sketchy<00:02:04.980> and<00:02:05.340> one<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.580> people<00:02:05.790> see

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
very sketchy and one of the people see

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.520 
very sketchy and one of the people see
are<00:02:06.000> sketchy<00:02:06.330> you<00:02:06.600> might<00:02:06.750> think<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:07.050> 101

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
are sketchy you might think of 101

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.650 
are sketchy you might think of 101
dalmatian<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.310> less<00:02:08.580> clear<00:02:08.880> than<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.240> I

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
dalmatian this is less clear than that I

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.990 
dalmatian this is less clear than that I
really<00:02:10.200> like<00:02:10.710> the<00:02:10.860> style<00:02:10.920> like<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.640> kind<00:02:11.940> of

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
really like the style like that kind of

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.340 
really like the style like that kind of
sketchy<00:02:12.330> style<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:12.900> thought<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.200> worked

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
sketchy style and I thought it worked

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.380 
sketchy style and I thought it worked
really<00:02:13.470> well<00:02:13.650> for<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:14.040> film<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.460> how<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.270> was

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
really well for the film and how it was

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.600 
really well for the film and how it was
very<00:02:15.750> personal<00:02:16.050> it's<00:02:16.500> basically<00:02:16.950> his<00:02:17.220> old<00:02:17.430> guy

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
very personal it's basically his old guy

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.580 
very personal it's basically his old guy
telling<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.180> his<00:02:18.600> experience<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.380> dog

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
telling you his experience of the dog

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.560 
telling you his experience of the dog
and<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.890> sketchy<00:02:20.190> style<00:02:20.520> i<00:02:20.760> think<00:02:21.000> worked

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
and the sketchy style i think worked

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.000 
and the sketchy style i think worked
with<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:22.050> i<00:02:22.170> don't<00:02:22.320> know<00:02:22.380> if<00:02:22.470> they<00:02:22.590> call<00:02:22.830> it

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
with it i don't know if they call it

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.830 
with it i don't know if they call it
sketchy<00:02:23.340> but<00:02:23.670> i<00:02:23.910> thought<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.390> was<00:02:24.510> kind<00:02:24.750> of

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
sketchy but i thought it was kind of

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.150 
sketchy but i thought it was kind of
sketchy<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.380> sometimes<00:02:25.740> they<00:02:25.890> do<00:02:26.010> these

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
sketchy and sometimes they do these

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.040 
sketchy and sometimes they do these
things<00:02:26.220> where<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.940> would<00:02:27.090> change<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.840> up<00:02:27.959> a

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
things where it would change it up a

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.510 
things where it would change it up a
little<00:02:28.080> bit<00:02:28.410> but<00:02:28.709> I<00:02:28.740> felt<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.010> really<00:02:29.310> worked

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
little bit but I felt that really worked

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.130 
little bit but I felt that really worked
for<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:30.150> think<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.600> animation<00:02:30.990> sound

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
for it I think the animation sound

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.110 
for it I think the animation sound
really<00:02:31.440> engages<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.190> audience<00:02:32.220> rather<00:02:32.820> than

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
really engages the audience rather than

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.030 
really engages the audience rather than
and<00:02:33.270> just<00:02:33.570> like<00:02:33.780> here's<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.380> style<00:02:34.650> do<00:02:35.010> you

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
and just like here's the style do you

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.740 
and just like here's the style do you
like<00:02:35.100> it<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:35.850> lines<00:02:36.090> going<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.390> be<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.570> same

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
like it the lines going to be the same

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.390 
like it the lines going to be the same
