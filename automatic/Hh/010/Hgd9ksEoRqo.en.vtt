pivots<00:00:40.620> all<00:00:41.219> right<00:00:41.700> let's<00:00:42.540> get<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.989> work<00:00:43.820> first

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
pivots all right let's get to work first

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.850 
pivots all right let's get to work first
thing<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.210> do<00:00:45.270> when<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.719> get<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.230> machine<00:00:46.590> is

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
thing I do when I get to the machine is

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.830 
thing I do when I get to the machine is
to<00:00:47.039> take<00:00:47.219> out<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.610> old<00:00:47.640> pivot<00:00:48.300> pin<00:00:48.570> and

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
to take out the old pivot pin and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.810 
to take out the old pivot pin and
dismount<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.649> bucket<00:00:50.070> from<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.460> machine

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
dismount the bucket from the machine

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.970 
dismount the bucket from the machine
then<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.390> remove<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.079> old<00:00:52.260> bushing<00:00:52.860> and

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
then I remove the old bushing and

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.979 
then I remove the old bushing and
install<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.579> new<00:00:53.730> one<00:00:53.910> me<00:00:54.690> too<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.260> do<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.039> same

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
install the new one me too I do the same

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.650 
install the new one me too I do the same
next<00:00:57.989> step<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.859> spot<00:00:59.129> weld<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.609> jig<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.449> can

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
next step is to spot weld a jig so I can

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.770 
next step is to spot weld a jig so I can
attach<00:01:00.930> my<00:01:01.170> line<00:01:01.410> boring<00:01:01.800> machine<00:01:02.750> there<00:01:03.750> is

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
attach my line boring machine there is

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.920 
attach my line boring machine there is
no<00:01:04.439> line<00:01:04.979> boring<00:01:05.670> with<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.000> expander<00:01:06.540> system

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930

all<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.619> have<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.250> do<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.640> reassemble<00:01:09.570> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
all I have to do is reassemble the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.080 
all I have to do is reassemble the
