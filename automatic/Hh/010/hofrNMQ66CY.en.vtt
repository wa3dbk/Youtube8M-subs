00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello youtube friends like this in the 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.879
 Today we will discuss the 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.370
 doten is a great egg for android 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.010
 that just appeared in the last 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.590
 weeks and has had several million 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.660
 downloads from a bol play that is what 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.660
 that makes it so good to use it in the video 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.000
 well we started the first thing that I'm going to 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:30.869
 explain how it is always how to download 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.329
 of 23 from the appstore is very easy 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.010
 installation and download so you do not get 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.350
 Worry about the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.600
 is to go to the link that we have below 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.159
 the video information we will go 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.890
 to the bottom of the web that appears 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:46.290
 and here we find tennis 3d download 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.809
 from google play we are going to give you the 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.670
 green button to install and here 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.509
 we select our phone and we 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.850
 we are going to give to install as simple as that 

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:59.040
 congratulations of doten and it will be installed 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.320
 automatically the only thing that we have to 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.299
 do is go to our phone that I do not 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.820
 I have here and it will already be installed in the 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:07.470
 application if this does not work is because 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.320
 you have never logged in from google 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.869
 play show you first in game mode 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.700
 fast wyplay any resemblance of the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.530
 players with reality is pure 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.229
 coincidence and is that they have not had 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.990
 better idea than to put some of our very 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.689
 similar and the names also to 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.830
 professional atp players that 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.510
 we always see through peace 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.700
 so you're going to be pretty 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.250
 familiar with this do not worry 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.430
 once you choose against here in playing 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.370
 we are going to give che so simple 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.350
 we choose the player and then we're going to 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.750
 give the check remember that in each 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.300
 party you will be able to get points and 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.730
 money we can choose the type of court 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.950
 fast court you want or court of 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.100
 clay the number of games also 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.250
 game number 1 3 or 5 and finally you 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.960
 let's give to play now I'm going to 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.030
 choose only one game to make 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.950
 this faster and now if I give to 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.960
 play now the game load is 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.600
 pretty fast and that's another of the 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.150
 positive aspects that has finger 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.220
 anise to play it the only thing we have 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.650
 what to do is press our screen 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.010
 with your finger the player is going to move 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.550
 automatically so you do not get 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.670
 worry about that just press the 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.300
 ball before done leaving it and so on 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.250
 simple we are already playing between the other 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.640
 of the good things that this game has 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.220
 is the speed 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.190
 that you will not have any problem with 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:43.090
 it has several options in players 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.910
 however there is something that still does not 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.459
 develops so much and is the amount of 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.660
 blows for now I just found about 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:55.600
 how many and is the normal blow and the blow 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.560
 with the topspin that is made by sliding 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.390
 faster finger when hitting 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.489
 the ball 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.550
 only selected one game so 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.130
 this is already going to stop let's show you 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.530
 also the fast floor court that is 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.410
 prettier without doubt and also runs 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.900
 pretty good, something good about this game 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.290
 is the amount of advertising that appears 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.480
 since it is very little, it is very 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.459
 advertising that appears to us despite 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.519
 that the download of the application is 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.220
 totally free so it's something that 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.620
 we have to thank the 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.870
 developers of the knot x other 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.310
 aspect to mention is that you can 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.860
 buy some additional things in the 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.800
 I'll show it to you later and there 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.470
 if you are going to have to pay with your points 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.069
 of game or you can also do it with 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.620
 balance and money from your cell phone 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.530
 I have the purchases deactivated as well 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.590
 that the only way I have to do it 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.819
 for now it 's through the points that 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.980
 go winning in the matches to be able 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:09.120
 perform the world tour championship 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.879
 you're going to have to win some 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.920
 dollars so I will not show more 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:16.199
 go ahead do not worry we are seeing 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.239
 there also the topspin hit that is 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:20.789
 another one of the good options of this 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.710
 game well the game is over so 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.750
 let's go back to the main and I'll show you 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.630
 now the other game mode the tour 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.320
 world here you will choose between 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.180
 different championships of the atp so 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.210
 to go unlocking you're going to need 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.460
 more money and more experience which I 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.759
 I do not have for now so I'm going to 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:45.000
 show you with the simplest ones that is 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:47.759
 that of Miami and another one that appears to me 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.520
 here we will be able to choose between buying 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:53.810
 money 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:57.590
 or we will be able to choose our player 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:00.319
 also so let's give it to full and 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.900
 with that would be ready I'm not going to 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:05.930
 do to show you some other 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.720
 options let's see now the options 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.509
 configuration settings asks us 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.960
 choose the tie breack option 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:17.750
 Music option and sound option 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.120
 so there's not much to see there you're going to 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.419
 can also choose the number of sets 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.580
 in each game and finally the store the 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.080
 store is fine for now but it's 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.360
 necessary that in the following 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.919
 updates give us a greater 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.259
 amount of options 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:35.000
 you can choose between rackets you're going 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:38.030
 to be able to buy with the money you've 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.569
 won or you can also buy credits 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.610
 through google world truck you can 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:45.590
 choose also some clothes to
