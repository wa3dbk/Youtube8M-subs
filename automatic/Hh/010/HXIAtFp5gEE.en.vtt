00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
the things to look for are whether we

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.020 
the things to look for are whether we
have<00:01:04.690> chords<00:01:05.690> intervals<00:01:06.470> thirds<00:01:07.130> which<00:01:07.820> there

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
have chords intervals thirds which there

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.670 
have chords intervals thirds which there
are<00:01:08.180> a<00:01:08.210> lot<00:01:08.450> of<00:01:08.479> those<00:01:08.750> in<00:01:08.990> this<00:01:09.170> zone<00:01:09.380> so<00:01:09.650> a

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
are a lot of those in this zone so a

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.170 
are a lot of those in this zone so a
quick<00:01:09.950> glance<00:01:10.130> you<00:01:10.790> hopefully<00:01:11.090> you've

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
quick glance you hopefully you've

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.620 
quick glance you hopefully you've
reviewed<00:01:11.600> your<00:01:11.720> thirds<00:01:12.110> in<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.470> key<00:01:12.619> of<00:01:12.650> D

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.330 

we<00:01:16.260> also<00:01:16.409> want<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.680> try<00:01:16.800> and<00:01:16.950> kind<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.130> take<00:01:17.310> a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
we also want to try and kind of take a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.420 
we also want to try and kind of take a
look<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:17.880> places<00:01:18.330> where<00:01:18.450> we<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.720> scale<00:01:19.110> runs

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.860 

we<00:01:23.430> alternating<00:01:24.000> right<00:01:24.150> hand<00:01:24.360> fingers<00:01:24.720> on

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
we alternating right hand fingers on

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:35.450 
we alternating right hand fingers on
those<00:01:25.020> types<00:01:25.260> of<00:01:25.380> things<00:01:25.620> or<00:01:26.300> arpeggios

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.260 

now<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.660> is<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.780> waltz<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.500> it's<00:01:37.650> in<00:01:37.800> three

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
now this is the waltz so it's in three

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.970 
now this is the waltz so it's in three
triple<00:01:39.270> time<00:01:39.570> at<00:01:39.750> least<00:01:39.900> now<00:01:40.590> if<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.830> wrote

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
triple time at least now if you wrote

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.440 
triple time at least now if you wrote
this<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.250> three<00:01:41.520> eight<00:01:41.730> but<00:01:42.060> where<00:01:42.330> you<00:01:42.420> want

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
this in three eight but where you want

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.900 
this in three eight but where you want
to<00:01:42.600> play<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.840> slow<00:01:43.140> enough<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.700> beats

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
to play it slow enough so that the beats

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.700 
to play it slow enough so that the beats
especially<00:01:45.420> when<00:01:45.510> we<00:01:45.600> see<00:01:45.780> sixteenth<00:01:46.380> notes<00:01:46.590> a

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
especially when we see sixteenth notes a

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.380 
especially when we see sixteenth notes a
little<00:01:46.890> bit<00:01:46.980> later<00:01:47.160> then<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:47.880> want<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.120> just

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
little bit later then we want to just

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.290 
little bit later then we want to just
keep<00:01:48.510> it<00:01:48.660> going<00:01:48.720> one<00:01:49.560> two<00:01:50.130> three<00:01:50.729> one<00:01:51.270> two

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
keep it going one two three one two

keep it going one two three one two
three<00:01:51.780> just<00:01:52.770> because<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:53.430> three<00:01:53.670> eight

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
three just because it's in three eight

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.070 
three just because it's in three eight
doesn't<00:01:54.180> mean<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.360> has<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.510> go<00:01:54.660> one<00:01:54.840> two<00:01:55.050> three

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
doesn't mean it has to go one two three

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.590 
doesn't mean it has to go one two three

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
also keep an eye out for accidentals

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.310 
also keep an eye out for accidentals
times<00:02:23.700> what<00:02:23.880> he<00:02:23.970> would<00:02:24.090> temporarily<00:02:24.480> leave

let's<00:02:41.180> see<00:02:41.540> what<00:02:41.660> we<00:02:41.750> have<00:02:41.780> here<00:02:42.280> start<00:02:43.280> taking

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
let's see what we have here start taking

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.460 
let's see what we have here start taking
a<00:02:43.580> look<00:02:43.700> at<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.569> top<00:02:44.720> of<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:44.959> page<00:02:45.170> this

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
a look at the the top of the page this

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.259 
a look at the the top of the page this
one<00:02:45.650> by<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:45.920> way<00:02:46.010> is<00:02:46.340> more<00:02:46.819> of<00:02:47.000> from<00:02:47.239> a

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
one by the way is more of from a

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.930 
one by the way is more of from a
manuscript<00:02:48.019> rather<00:02:48.470> than<00:02:48.709> my<00:02:49.400> usual<00:02:49.519> guitar

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
manuscript rather than my usual guitar

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.390 
manuscript rather than my usual guitar
pro<00:02:50.180> things<00:02:50.629> so<00:02:50.989> even<00:02:51.530> I<00:02:51.680> see<00:02:51.920> notes<00:02:52.099> it<00:02:52.250> looks

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
pro things so even I see notes it looks

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.059 
pro things so even I see notes it looks
a<00:02:52.430> little<00:02:52.519> bit<00:02:52.730> different<00:02:52.819> um<00:02:53.569> what<00:02:54.560> I<00:02:54.590> see<00:02:54.860> in

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
a little bit different um what I see in

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.850 
a little bit different um what I see in
the<00:02:55.160> first<00:02:55.370> part<00:02:55.670> is<00:02:56.120> bass<00:02:57.110> notes<00:02:57.410> played<00:02:57.739> on

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
the first part is bass notes played on

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.040 
the first part is bass notes played on
beat<00:02:58.040> one<00:02:58.250> and<00:02:58.489> then<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:58.670> couple<00:02:58.940> of<00:02:59.000> pairs<00:02:59.930> of

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
beat one and then a couple of pairs of

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.059 
beat one and then a couple of pairs of
notes<00:03:00.640> small<00:03:01.640> chords<00:03:02.030> intervals<00:03:02.720> on<00:03:03.069> the

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
notes small chords intervals on the

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.160 
notes small chords intervals on the
second<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:04.730> third<00:03:04.819> beats<00:03:05.150> so<00:03:05.660> I<00:03:05.690> want<00:03:05.989> to<00:03:06.049> try

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
second and third beats so I want to try

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.350 
second and third beats so I want to try
to<00:03:06.230> recognize<00:03:06.769> those<00:03:07.099> and<00:03:07.519> in<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.150> first

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
to recognize those and in the first

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.059 
to recognize those and in the first
measure<00:03:08.569> should<00:03:09.110> see<00:03:09.260> right<00:03:09.500> away<00:03:09.620> that<00:03:09.739> we've

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
measure should see right away that we've

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.690 
measure should see right away that we've
got<00:03:10.280> a<00:03:10.310> pair<00:03:10.700> of<00:03:11.319> the<00:03:12.319> the<00:03:12.590> first<00:03:12.890> third<00:03:13.400> in<00:03:13.640> the

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
got a pair of the the first third in the

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.479 
got a pair of the the first third in the
key<00:03:13.849> of<00:03:13.880> D<00:03:14.120> D<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:14.599> F<00:03:14.690> sharp<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:16.010> next<00:03:16.220> interval

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
key of D D and F sharp the next interval

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.670 
key of D D and F sharp the next interval
is<00:03:16.700> wider<00:03:17.060> so<00:03:17.239> we're<00:03:17.480> not<00:03:17.569> just<00:03:17.630> sliding<00:03:18.380> just

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
is wider so we're not just sliding just

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.630 
is wider so we're not just sliding just
something<00:03:18.920> like<00:03:19.040> this<00:03:19.220> we're<00:03:19.430> going<00:03:19.519> to<00:03:19.579> be

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
something like this we're going to be

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.460 
something like this we're going to be
reversing<00:03:20.239> things<00:03:20.390> so<00:03:20.599> I<00:03:20.660> see<00:03:20.870> a<00:03:20.900> second<00:03:21.290> chord

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
reversing things so I see a second chord

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.580 
reversing things so I see a second chord
there<00:03:21.739> that<00:03:22.400> looks<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:23.360> I<00:03:23.450> think<00:03:23.690> okay<00:03:23.900> you

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
there that looks and I think okay you

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.800 
there that looks and I think okay you
have<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:24.860> pay<00:03:24.980> attention<00:03:25.099> that<00:03:25.489> way<00:03:25.610> so<00:03:26.150> now

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
have to pay attention that way so now

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.150 
have to pay attention that way so now
I'm<00:03:26.900> looking<00:03:27.049> for<00:03:27.349> a<00:03:27.380> little<00:03:27.769> bit<00:03:27.860> further

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
I'm looking for a little bit further

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.680 
I'm looking for a little bit further
before<00:03:28.430> we<00:03:28.670> go<00:03:28.790> through<00:03:28.940> there<00:03:29.120> I<00:03:29.150> see<00:03:29.329> a<00:03:29.360> sharp

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
before we go through there I see a sharp

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.380 
before we go through there I see a sharp
coming<00:03:30.049> up<00:03:30.140> in<00:03:30.319> the<00:03:30.470> fourth<00:03:30.680> measure<00:03:31.269> so<00:03:32.269> I'd

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
coming up in the fourth measure so I'd

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.789 
coming up in the fourth measure so I'd
see<00:03:32.569> that<00:03:32.599> there's<00:03:32.900> this<00:03:32.989> little<00:03:33.230> eighth

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
see that there's this little eighth

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.979 
see that there's this little eighth
measure<00:03:34.099> phrase<00:03:34.640> and<00:03:35.450> really<00:03:35.720> just<00:03:35.870> has<00:03:35.959> a

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
measure phrase and really just has a

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.140 
measure phrase and really just has a
couple<00:03:36.170> of<00:03:36.349> chords<00:03:36.560> in<00:03:36.769> it<00:03:36.890> and<00:03:37.280> a<00:03:37.910> little<00:03:38.000> bit

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
couple of chords in it and a little bit

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.240 
couple of chords in it and a little bit
of<00:03:38.269> a<00:03:38.329> melody<00:03:38.630> in<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.780> middle<00:03:39.250> continuing

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
of a melody in the middle continuing

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.420 
of a melody in the middle continuing
with<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.209> next<00:03:41.239> part<00:03:41.630> I<00:03:41.870> see<00:03:42.170> different<00:03:42.980> bass

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
with the next part I see different bass

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.680 
with the next part I see different bass
note<00:03:43.730> so<00:03:43.910> it<00:03:43.970> looks<00:03:44.090> like<00:03:44.209> we've<00:03:44.359> gone<00:03:44.450> from

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
note so it looks like we've gone from

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:51.430 
note so it looks like we've gone from
these<00:03:44.930> DS<00:03:45.319> and<00:03:45.560> A's<00:03:45.700> to<00:03:46.700> a<00:03:46.730> is<00:03:47.090> an<00:03:47.209> ease<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:50.440> and

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
these DS and A's to a is an ease and and

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.870 
these DS and A's to a is an ease and and
then<00:03:51.739> a<00:03:51.889> couple<00:03:52.160> of<00:03:52.250> different<00:03:52.549> chords

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
then a couple of different chords

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.059 
then a couple of different chords
another<00:03:53.180> accidental<00:03:53.630> coming<00:03:54.079> up<00:03:54.200> at<00:03:54.829> one

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
another accidental coming up at one

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:56.890 
another accidental coming up at one
point<00:03:55.340> as<00:03:55.819> we<00:03:56.030> get<00:03:56.150> into<00:03:56.269> the<00:03:56.389> second<00:03:56.750> line

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
point as we get into the second line

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.080 
point as we get into the second line
we're<00:03:57.200> gonna<00:03:57.290> see<00:03:57.500> a<00:03:57.530> quick<00:03:57.799> change<00:03:58.190> with<00:03:58.609> to

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
we're gonna see a quick change with to

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.650 
we're gonna see a quick change with to

the G natural being reinstated because

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.520 
the G natural being reinstated because
we're<00:04:11.420> coming<00:04:11.630> back<00:04:11.780> into<00:04:12.080> the<00:04:12.170> end<00:04:12.380> of<00:04:12.470> the

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
we're coming back into the end of the

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.390 
we're coming back into the end of the
key<00:04:12.740> of<00:04:13.010> D<00:04:13.990> okay<00:04:14.990> let<00:04:15.770> me<00:04:15.830> start<00:04:16.040> now<00:04:16.160> let's

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
key of D okay let me start now let's

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.440 
key of D okay let me start now let's
start<00:04:16.580> playing<00:04:16.730> through<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.120> see<00:04:17.240> what<00:04:17.360> we

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
start playing through and see what we

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.870 
start playing through and see what we
have<00:04:17.630> got<00:04:18.470> a<00:04:18.500> D<00:04:18.740> and<00:04:19.040> a<00:04:19.070> pair<00:04:19.310> of<00:04:19.340> notes<00:04:19.610> that

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
have got a D and a pair of notes that

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.580 
have got a D and a pair of notes that
are<00:04:20.030> really<00:04:20.390> part<00:04:20.630> of<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:20.750> D<00:04:20.870> chord

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.340 

let's<00:04:25.590> see<00:04:25.680> what<00:04:25.800> this<00:04:25.890> sounds<00:04:26.160> like<00:04:26.490> slowly<00:04:27.390> 1

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
let's see what this sounds like slowly 1

00:04:28.350 --> 00:05:03.550 
let's see what this sounds like slowly 1
2<00:04:29.040> 3

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:06:43.810 

you

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:43.820 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.160 

hopefully<00:06:44.820> I<00:06:44.850> didn't<00:06:45.060> speed<00:06:45.270> up<00:06:45.390> too<00:06:45.570> much<00:06:45.720> as

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.170 
hopefully I didn't speed up too much as

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.540 
hopefully I didn't speed up too much as
time<00:06:46.440> went<00:06:46.620> on<00:06:46.740> through<00:06:47.070> there<00:06:47.190> it's<00:06:47.370> kind<00:06:47.520> of

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
time went on through there it's kind of

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:48.590 
time went on through there it's kind of
hard<00:06:47.730> to<00:06:47.760> play<00:06:47.910> the<00:06:48.030> first<00:06:48.240> part<00:06:48.330> of<00:06:48.510> that

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.600 
hard to play the first part of that

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.270 
hard to play the first part of that
slowly<00:06:49.140> but<00:06:49.410> I<00:06:49.470> was<00:06:49.590> trying<00:06:49.770> to<00:06:49.830> keep<00:06:50.040> save

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 
slowly but I was trying to keep save

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.190 
slowly but I was trying to keep save
little<00:06:50.520> gas<00:06:50.640> in<00:06:50.910> the<00:06:51.000> tank<00:06:51.240> for<00:06:51.600> when<00:06:51.780> the<00:06:51.960> one

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200 
little gas in the tank for when the one

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.470 
little gas in the tank for when the one
the<00:06:52.290> 16th<00:06:52.680> notes<00:06:52.950> came<00:06:53.910> out<00:06:54.090> there<00:06:54.330> um

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:54.480 
the 16th notes came out there um

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.510 
the 16th notes came out there um
something<00:06:55.170> else<00:06:55.680> occurred<00:06:56.040> to<00:06:56.160> me<00:06:56.250> as<00:06:56.370> I<00:06:56.490> was

thoughts<00:07:01.050> on<00:07:01.260> this<00:07:01.410> are<00:07:03.110> be<00:07:04.110> sure<00:07:04.530> to<00:07:04.860> be

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:04.980 
thoughts on this are be sure to be

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.280 
thoughts on this are be sure to be
looking<00:07:05.520> ahead<00:07:05.760> as<00:07:06.360> much<00:07:06.570> as<00:07:06.720> you<00:07:06.840> can<00:07:07.110> now

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:07.290 
looking ahead as much as you can now

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.050 
looking ahead as much as you can now
this<00:07:07.440> has<00:07:07.590> a<00:07:07.620> lot<00:07:08.100> of<00:07:08.220> notes<00:07:08.370> changing<00:07:08.850> quickly

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 
this has a lot of notes changing quickly

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.320 
this has a lot of notes changing quickly
and<00:07:09.510> it<00:07:10.170> can<00:07:10.350> get<00:07:10.650> it<00:07:11.310> can<00:07:11.340> be<00:07:11.790> a<00:07:12.150> little

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.330 
and it can get it can be a little

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.240 
and it can get it can be a little
especially<00:07:13.080> getting<00:07:13.290> to<00:07:13.380> the<00:07:13.500> last<00:07:13.620> part<00:07:14.010> with

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.250 
especially getting to the last part with

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.330 
especially getting to the last part with
sometimes<00:07:15.030> scales<00:07:15.450> sometimes<00:07:16.230> notes<00:07:16.980> played

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:17.340 
sometimes scales sometimes notes played

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.220 
sometimes scales sometimes notes played
by<00:07:17.550> steps<00:07:17.940> steps<00:07:18.390> apart<00:07:18.660> sometimes<00:07:18.870> notes

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:19.230 
by steps steps apart sometimes notes

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.590 
by steps steps apart sometimes notes
played<00:07:19.440> skips<00:07:19.830> apart<00:07:20.160> arpeggio<00:07:20.790> type<00:07:21.330> things

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:21.600 
played skips apart arpeggio type things

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.610 
played skips apart arpeggio type things
so<00:07:22.380> it<00:07:22.860> really<00:07:23.010> takes<00:07:23.190> a<00:07:23.340> lot<00:07:23.370> of<00:07:24.350> focus<00:07:25.350> and

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:25.620 
so it really takes a lot of focus and

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.650 
so it really takes a lot of focus and
concentration<00:07:26.250> to<00:07:26.940> get<00:07:27.060> to<00:07:27.300> get<00:07:27.419> through

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:27.660 
concentration to get to get through

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.230 
concentration to get to get through
there<00:07:27.840> but<00:07:28.320> looking<00:07:28.800> ahead<00:07:28.950> rather<00:07:29.669> than<00:07:30.000> just

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 
there but looking ahead rather than just

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.300 
there but looking ahead rather than just
what<00:07:30.480> notes<00:07:30.690> you're<00:07:30.900> on<00:07:31.020> all<00:07:31.410> the<00:07:31.530> way<00:07:31.650> is<00:07:31.919> kind

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:32.310 
what notes you're on all the way is kind

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.730 
what notes you're on all the way is kind
of<00:07:32.340> an<00:07:32.460> important<00:07:32.820> thing<00:07:33.150> in<00:07:33.360> there<00:07:33.540> so<00:07:33.840> okay

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740 
of an important thing in there so okay
