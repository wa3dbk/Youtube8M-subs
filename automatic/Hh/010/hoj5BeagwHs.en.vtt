entwined plate and it's this one just
here<00:00:29.090> this<00:00:30.090> great<00:00:30.480> technique<00:00:31.050> it's<00:00:31.349> great<00:00:31.560> fun

as<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.539> say<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.750> can<00:00:57.930> actually<00:00:58.050> cut<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.559> out<00:00:58.680> of

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
as you say I can actually cut it out of

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.799 
as you say I can actually cut it out of
the<00:00:58.920> sheet<00:00:59.129> yet<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.520> do<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.850> sometimes<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.539> sort

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
the sheet yet I do that sometimes I sort

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.959 
the sheet yet I do that sometimes I sort
of<00:01:00.870> I've<00:01:01.500> used<00:01:01.890> them<00:01:02.070> still<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.550> sheets<00:01:02.789> or

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
of I've used them still on the sheets or

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.359 
of I've used them still on the sheets or
I<00:01:03.030> cut<00:01:03.270> them<00:01:03.420> out<00:01:03.570> or<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.870> mount<00:01:04.170> them<00:01:04.409> depending

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
I cut them out or I mount them depending

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.600 
I cut them out or I mount them depending
on<00:01:05.460> what<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.670> want<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.060> use<00:01:06.210> them<00:01:06.390> for<00:01:07.520> so<00:01:08.520> I'm

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
on what I want to use them for so I'm

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.480 
on what I want to use them for so I'm
gonna<00:01:08.790> start<00:01:10.010> from<00:01:11.010> light<00:01:12.229> to<00:01:13.229> dark<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.189> I

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
gonna start from light to dark and I

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.760 
gonna start from light to dark and I
just<00:01:14.700> want<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.909> mix<00:01:15.240> up<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.750> water<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
just want to mix up the water in the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.390 
just want to mix up the water in the
paint<00:01:17.630> get<00:01:18.630> some<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.990> micro<00:01:19.500> out<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.040> lots

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
paint get some of the micro out and lots

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.710 
paint get some of the micro out and lots
of<00:01:20.549> color<00:01:23.000> you<00:01:24.000> know<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.330> then<00:01:24.570> I'm<00:01:24.689> just

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
of color you know and then I'm just

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.410 
of color you know and then I'm just
going<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.960> apply<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.350> directly<00:01:25.790> onto<00:01:26.790> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
going to apply it directly onto the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.999 
going to apply it directly onto the
stamp<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.909> as<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.500> would<00:01:34.650> if<00:01:34.860> you're

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
stamp and is as you would if you're

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.010 
stamp and is as you would if you're
using<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.520> pen<00:01:35.790> directly<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.360> your<00:01:36.509> stamp<00:01:36.810> but

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
using a pen directly on your stamp but

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.760 
using a pen directly on your stamp but
this<00:01:37.170> time<00:01:37.409> I'm<00:01:37.530> using<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.950> brush<00:01:39.229> so<00:01:40.229> then<00:01:40.500> move

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
this time I'm using a brush so then move

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:49.569 
this time I'm using a brush so then move
onto<00:01:41.009> my<00:01:41.220> next<00:01:41.520> color<00:01:41.899> give<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.079> girl<00:01:43.409> mix

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.330 

now<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.640> trick<00:01:51.149> with<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.680> try<00:01:52.950> not<00:01:53.189> to

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
now the trick with this is to try not to

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.950 
now the trick with this is to try not to
put<00:01:53.549> too<00:01:53.579> much<00:01:54.210> water<00:01:55.490> you<00:01:56.490> don't<00:01:56.640> want<00:01:56.960> the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
put too much water you don't want the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.160 
put too much water you don't want the
paint<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.860> be<00:01:59.040> too<00:01:59.520> wet<00:01:59.790> you're<00:02:00.719> going<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.990> lose

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
paint to be too wet you're going to lose

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.679 
paint to be too wet you're going to lose
a<00:02:01.200> little<00:02:01.469> bit<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.770> definition<00:02:01.950> anyway<00:02:02.969> when

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
a little bit of definition anyway when

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.100 
a little bit of definition anyway when
using<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.619> technique<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:06.110> wouldn't

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
using this this technique I wouldn't

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.749 
using this this technique I wouldn't
worry<00:02:07.290> about<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.920> all<00:02:08.039> adds<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.550> the

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
worry about that it all adds to the

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.840 
worry about that it all adds to the
texture

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.610 

okay<00:02:13.070> but<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:15.180> still<00:02:15.420> want<00:02:15.570> to<00:02:15.600> get<00:02:15.720> some<00:02:16.230> of

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
okay but you still want to get some of

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.960 
okay but you still want to get some of
the<00:02:17.870> detail<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:21.440> mean<00:02:22.440> then<00:02:22.830> use<00:02:23.040> my<00:02:23.250> darkest

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
the detail I mean then use my darkest

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.630 
the detail I mean then use my darkest
color<00:02:24.060> around<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.900> edges<00:02:28.100> mix<00:02:29.100> it<00:02:29.250> up<00:02:29.370> get<00:02:29.610> a

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
color around the edges mix it up get a

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:37.310 
color around the edges mix it up get a
nice<00:02:29.880> bit<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.420> paint<00:02:30.900> onto<00:02:31.590> my<00:02:31.860> brush<00:02:35.390> okay<00:02:36.390> now

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
nice bit of paint onto my brush okay now

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.740 
nice bit of paint onto my brush okay now
each<00:02:37.620> time<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.160> do<00:02:38.400> this<00:02:38.640> even<00:02:39.210> if<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.420> use<00:02:39.570> in

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
each time you do this even if you use in

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.350 
each time you do this even if you use in
same<00:02:40.080> colors<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.890> same<00:02:41.190> stamp<00:02:41.520> you're<00:02:42.180> still

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
same colors and same stamp you're still

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.080 
same colors and same stamp you're still
going<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.540> get<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:42.930> different<00:02:43.470> look<00:02:43.940> it's<00:02:44.940> one

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
going to get a different look it's one

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.910 
going to get a different look it's one
of<00:02:45.180> those<00:02:45.270> nice<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.570> random<00:02:46.320> techniques
