00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
tune her up but it's been largely a case

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.580 
tune her up but it's been largely a case
of<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:08.549> getting<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.330> settled<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.930> taking<00:01:10.470> over

as<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.310> said<00:01:11.460> stretching<00:01:12.030> her<00:01:12.119> legs<00:01:12.150> are

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
as you said stretching her legs are

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.640 
as you said stretching her legs are
really<00:01:12.540> getting<00:01:12.780> her<00:01:12.900> out<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.049> her<00:01:13.170> box<00:01:13.409> and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
really getting her out of her box and

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.850 
really getting her out of her box and
I'm<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:15.270> sort<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.930> keeping<00:01:16.229> her<00:01:16.290> interested

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
I'm just sort of keeping her interested

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.789 
I'm just sort of keeping her interested
in<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.299> moving<00:01:18.299> on<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.750> regular<00:01:18.990> basis<00:01:19.619> but

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
in and moving on a regular basis but

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.399 
in and moving on a regular basis but
she's<00:01:20.070> not<00:01:20.250> gonna<00:01:20.369> she's<00:01:21.270> she's<00:01:21.990> taken<00:01:22.290> lots

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
she's not gonna she's she's taken lots

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.410 
she's not gonna she's she's taken lots
and<00:01:22.650> lots<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.920> races<00:01:23.310> actually<00:01:23.670> she's<00:01:23.880> she

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
and lots of races actually she's she

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.300 
and lots of races actually she's she
runs<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> regular<00:01:25.140> basis<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.770> Australia<00:01:26.250> so

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
runs on a regular basis in Australia so

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.530 
runs on a regular basis in Australia so
Fitness<00:01:26.700> isn't<00:01:27.030> going<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.270> be<00:01:27.360> an<00:01:27.450> issue

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
Fitness isn't going to be an issue

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.670 
Fitness isn't going to be an issue
they're<00:01:27.810> not<00:01:27.900> going<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.080> need<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.500> keep

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
they're not going to need to keep

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.289 
they're not going to need to keep
pumping<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.159> working<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.670> her<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.939> they're

pumping and working to her and they're

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.640 
pumping and working to her and they're
going<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.509> want<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.720> give<00:01:31.049> Anna<00:01:31.200> plenty<00:01:31.560> of

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
going to want to give Anna plenty of

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.560 
going to want to give Anna plenty of
time<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.549> get<00:01:32.850> over<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.180> flight<00:01:33.420> because

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
time to get over that flight because

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.700 
time to get over that flight because
it's<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.869> first<00:01:33.900> time<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.320> she'll<00:01:34.619> have

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
it's the first time that she'll have

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.899 
it's the first time that she'll have
traveled<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.400> extent<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:37.610> they'll<00:01:38.610> step

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
traveled to that extent so they'll step

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.399 
traveled to that extent so they'll step
things<00:01:39.150> up<00:01:39.299> probably<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.810> give<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.020> one<00:01:40.049> or

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
things up probably just give it one or

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.660 
things up probably just give it one or
two<00:01:40.500> pieces<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.920> work<00:01:41.009> during<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.400> course<00:01:41.579> of

just<00:02:45.100> playing<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.520> all<00:02:45.670> down<00:02:45.880> quite<00:02:46.240> nicely<00:02:46.480> at

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
just playing it all down quite nicely at

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.180 
just playing it all down quite nicely at
this<00:02:46.870> stage<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.320> think<00:02:47.560> maybe<00:02:47.650> haven't<00:02:47.950> got<00:02:48.100> the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
this stage I think maybe haven't got the

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.900 
this stage I think maybe haven't got the
usual<00:02:48.420> arrogance<00:02:49.420> of<00:02:49.600> an<00:02:49.690> Aussie<00:02:49.930> perhaps<00:02:50.910> in

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
usual arrogance of an Aussie perhaps in

usual arrogance of an Aussie perhaps in
a<00:02:52.000> sporting<00:02:52.510> sense<00:02:52.840> I<00:02:54.150> think<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.330> they're

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
a sporting sense I think that they're

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.900 
a sporting sense I think that they're
just<00:02:55.750> that<00:02:55.990> they<00:02:56.710> know<00:02:56.980> that<00:02:57.190> she's<00:02:57.400> expected

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
just that they know that she's expected

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.120 
just that they know that she's expected
to<00:02:57.940> win<00:02:58.240> they've<00:02:58.690> let<00:02:59.230> her<00:02:59.380> do<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.650> talking<00:02:59.680> on

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
to win they've let her do the talking on

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.850 
to win they've let her do the talking on
the<00:03:00.250> track<00:03:00.490> so<00:03:00.730> far<00:03:01.170> in<00:03:02.170> Australia<00:03:02.710> and<00:03:02.740> I

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
the track so far in Australia and I

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.170 
the track so far in Australia and I
think<00:03:03.220> they're<00:03:03.340> gonna<00:03:03.460> do<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.790> exact<00:03:04.090> same

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
think they're gonna do the exact same

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.810 
think they're gonna do the exact same
thing<00:03:04.540> with<00:03:04.660> her<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:04.960> and<00:03:05.680> there's<00:03:06.400> that<00:03:06.670> they

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
thing with her and and there's that they

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.280 
thing with her and and there's that they
don't<00:03:07.000> need<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.450> be<00:03:07.480> coming<00:03:07.840> out<00:03:07.990> everyone

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
don't need to be coming out everyone

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.600 
don't need to be coming out everyone
knows<00:03:08.530> that<00:03:08.560> she's<00:03:08.890> brilliant<00:03:09.100> that<00:03:09.430> she's

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
knows that she's brilliant that she's

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.770

probably<00:03:09.790> going<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.090> be<00:03:10.150> far<00:03:10.330> too<00:03:10.480> good<00:03:10.660> four

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
probably going to be far too good four

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.900 
probably going to be far too good four
hours<00:03:10.840> but<00:03:11.140> you're<00:03:11.830> basically<00:03:12.610> setting

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
hours but you're basically setting

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.220
