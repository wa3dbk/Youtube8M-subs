00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.250
 hello good as you see is a different one to the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.170
 that you usually see is not usually a 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.550
 day makeup but it's just that 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.170
 now I just recorded the tutorial 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.269
 halloween is a halloween a little 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.920
 different and good because he wanted to leave me the 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.510
 makeup I have removed some things 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.800
 because I did not want it to be a 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.510
 makeup very have been for a day 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.340
 normal and good so in this video we're going 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.279
 to talk a little about my essentials 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.900
 for the autumn so we started like 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.970
 surely you will know I am super 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.800
 whopping a lot or my temperature 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.480
 environment has to be about 30 degrees 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.420
 because if I do not have a lot right away 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.399
 cold and also on the other hand heard the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.040
 coats because they overwhelm me so much then 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.340
 I prefer to add layers to my outfit 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.020
 and scarves and cardigans and leave 6 and that 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.579
 such as indoor and before 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.500
 put on maybe a coat because 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.120
 be very very chubby 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.520
 that's why it includes essential cost 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.050
 While this scarf signals plus zara 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.940
 I like you because I love feeling 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.880
 super covered so much you can leave it like this 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.710
 everything has put like 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.180
 if for example that is also very 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.430
 well a part of the scarf had 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.680
 feet almost up to me 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.390
 love it like more is super warm 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.220
 it's good this would be one of my 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.900
 essential the next one was going very 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.900
 the style and it is this cajigal 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.899
 all right 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.369
 it's exactly like the scarf but 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.229
 in cardinal and I love it because it is 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.909
 Pretty long with both pockets 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.770
 and for me this type of garment 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.930
 They complemented the look very well because 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.840
 You can wear a basic mask or a 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.490
 wet shirt and even on top and I also 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.250
 I really liked that a penalty has fallen 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.960
 I think that it greatly favors the figure 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.759
 of this type of clothes and well then 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.200
 This would be another of my essentials 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.810
 for a person like me who am super 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.390
 whopping and last a 35 of going 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.450
 dedicated to clothing are these lolita that 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.580
 they are made of chalcedony which are the leggings 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.920
 eject and I find them super comfortable 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.420
 because it 's like it's going well adjusted to the 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.100
 leg and I do not know I liked that 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.020
 feeling in addition these kings are 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.940
 whatsapp are moll of before and favor 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.649
 very much the figure the truth is that I 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.860
 I really like the only inconvenience that 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.630
 the encounter is that they tend to lower their 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.250
 little selected this obviously fall 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.440
 but once that feeling that 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.420
 you have to go up sometimes because this 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.860
 but if we put a lot because the 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.580
 super comfortable encounters and very 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.020
 Versatile I have it in black in persimmon and 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.610
 in beige 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.310
 and it's very unequal not just put with 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.530
 boots other things that you already know me 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.720
 love and more at this time of year are 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.980
 the candles this one in particular is light 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.180
 but good designs this because it's the 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.150
 that he had a desk position 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.210
 but turn on and start looking for candles 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.590
 different that I like big and new 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.150
 to go refilling to the room 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.370
 because these ones have the same 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.660
 what I have left of last year and is that 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.640
 I love it I love the atmosphere 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.500
 with candles when you just get home by 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.390
 night after dinner're tired 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.430
 club you have some candles or you have it 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.170
 then the lamp and you can 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.460
 go out for a while or watch some video in 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.590
 youtube or velarde is that it does not relax 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.330
 very much and I liked a lot about 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.550
 everything that are aromatic I love 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.260
 and in relation to what you say the candles 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.720
 because nobody likes me because it's sitting 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.610
 in bed and read a while I'm going to teach 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.530
 three books that I just bought that 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.230
 are this one that I really wanted to 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.760
 have it that is alexa char and good 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.140
 he simply gave us a head or they came 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.000
 a couple of days ago so I did not either 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.620
 gave time to start rolling the the 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.480
 álex to say that it is well measured and I do 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.069
 a page but that has not given me either 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.629
 too much time 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.700
 and the truth is that I do not know I love 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.749
 I really wanted to have it on 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.849
 his story is explained a bit 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:28.040
 where comes the desire for the chicken 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.620
 Peter Pan on how photos are made 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.180
 she herself and good are small 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.040
 curiosities of her that they have with 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.870
 relation to fashion and the other is that it 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.909
 which is a book of what will be very 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.810
 well the three books I bought them by 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:43.549
 amazon I got nothing in 223 days the 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.319
 I had them at home now that very 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.659
 well and the other two are those of laura 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.060
 find European studies you will know 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.680
 all one on the makeup and is not 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.599
 in your personal dress at the time of 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.459
 dress and the truth that these too 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.530
 I really wanted to have you over 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.090
 all of the makeup because yes that 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.949
 I had seen it very much and had 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.540
 a lot of advertising for giving you a 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.189
 look also from a section of 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.780
 hairstyles and I think it's very good and I 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.909
 has given many ideas and also for 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.159
 make videos so nothing then I hope 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:12.739
 I can start to sit down and read them 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.689
 well because I really want is not 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.789
 No secret that I love the 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:19.340
 coffee and at this time of year that you fancy 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:21.590
 because it's very cold because even more so 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.360
 that I am very very addicted and very fan of 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.250
 to be 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.080
 lie on the couch either for 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.610
 work a while to chat for a while 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.580
 with someone or whatever it is normally what 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.620
 that I drink is a normal cappuccino or a 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.139
 flat mouth as for makeup I have to 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.639
 say that I know that I not only 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.219
 change a lot because I 'm not a 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.740
 great makeup artist but I 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:43.599
 love the eyes in black is so much in 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.759
 summer like in winter do not change between 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:47.710
 ocación a somewhat special makeup 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:50.560
 or more elaborate just make me a smoked 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.949
 in black and regarding the nails always 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.719
 I usually go either red or burgundy 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:57.669
 they like them well for the whole year especially 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:05:00.610
 at this time of year and at Christmas 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.050
 they took him much more and the black in 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.689
 as to the gray and you know that I am 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.430
 a lot of red but you also use the 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:07.599
 color is a little darker as 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.300
 this nash 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:12.129
 this is the fastweb guayos commented that 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.259
 this age and the good thing is that 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:16.539
 It is very gradual and is simply applied 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:17.229
 a little touch gives you that aspect of eladio 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:18.610
 bitten 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.770
 or you can also give him his 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.900
 applications until you reach a tone 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.310
 much darker and already as the last 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.440
 therefore essential that name already 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.040
 reference to the mobile I will show you a 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.470
 3d stick 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.330
 actions that use a lot of them is 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.880
 this mold that is with that only 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.500
 modify some photos of instagram me 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.110
 allows you to do either collage or 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.729
 different photographs a same photo and 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.460
 as well 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.889
 allows me to change the background 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.990
 some stamping write or some kind of 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:49.059
 text put some emoticon and so on 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.249
 then another of the faces neutralized is 

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:53.349
 insta size is this application that you 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:55.990
 allows you to modify the size of the 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:58.330
 photograph to upload it to instagram 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.640
 and finally what I want to show you is 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.140
 the application of the lookbook because the 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.940
 true that it is very easy to access it 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.590
 to access these looks is a good 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.270
 way to inspire them someday because no 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:11.430
 we knew what to put simply 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.430
 We wanted to take a look at other looks 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:20.629
