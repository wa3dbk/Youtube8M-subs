00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
wished it's never happened but it did

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.740 
wished it's never happened but it did
and<00:01:46.770> unfortunately<00:01:47.730> people<00:01:48.300> got<00:01:48.510> to<00:01:48.600> pull

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
and unfortunately people got to pull

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.860 
and unfortunately people got to pull
together<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.110> try<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.230> make<00:01:49.440> this<00:01:49.530> better<00:01:49.770> I

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
together and try to make this better I

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.060 
together and try to make this better I
think<00:01:51.870> I<00:01:51.990> think<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.620> way<00:01:52.740> some<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
think I think in a way some of the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.320 
think I think in a way some of the
things<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> boardwalk<00:01:53.640> even<00:01:54.120> though<00:01:54.210> it

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
things on the boardwalk even though it

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.370 
things on the boardwalk even though it
looked<00:01:54.479> bad<00:01:54.630> right<00:01:54.900> now<00:01:55.050> what<00:01:55.229> we're<00:01:55.350> seeing

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
looked bad right now what we're seeing

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.890 
looked bad right now what we're seeing
out<00:01:55.740> there<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:56.100> think<00:01:56.729> ultimately<00:01:57.300> down<00:01:57.780> the

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
out there I think ultimately down the

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.210 
out there I think ultimately down the
road<00:01:58.050> will<00:01:58.200> be<00:01:58.229> better<00:01:58.500> it'll<00:01:58.680> be<00:01:58.770> revamp

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
road will be better it'll be revamp

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.130 
road will be better it'll be revamp
revitalized<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.120> I<00:02:00.479> think<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.810> will<00:02:00.930> come

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
revitalized and I think it will come

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.660 
revitalized and I think it will come
back<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.350> use<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.650> governor's<00:02:02.070> words<00:02:02.430> a

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
back to use the governor's words a

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.490 
back to use the governor's words a
better<00:02:02.940> than<00:02:03.060> ever<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.510> think<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.200> might<00:02:04.320> be<00:02:04.470> a

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
better than ever I think this might be a

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.900 
better than ever I think this might be a
blessing<00:02:04.650> in<00:02:04.950> disguise<00:02:04.979> what<00:02:05.580> happened

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
blessing in disguise what happened

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.580 
blessing in disguise what happened
because<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.630> think<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.869> poor<00:02:07.050> dog<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.290> ready<00:02:07.380> to

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
because I think the poor dog is ready to

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.160 
because I think the poor dog is ready to
be<00:02:07.680> fixed<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.160> upgrade<00:02:08.820> it<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.630> think<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.990> I

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
be fixed and upgrade it and I think it I

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.890 
be fixed and upgrade it and I think it I
think<00:02:10.380> this<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.649> like<00:02:11.100> a<00:02:11.160> necessary<00:02:11.670> evil

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
think this is like a necessary evil

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.930 
think this is like a necessary evil
clean<00:02:12.900> everything<00:02:13.200> up<00:02:13.290> now<00:02:13.470> I<00:02:13.680> think

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
clean everything up now I think

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.600 
clean everything up now I think
that's<00:02:16.660> guy<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:17.110> guess<00:02:17.320> it's<00:02:17.500> kind<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.100> sad<00:02:18.370> in<00:02:18.550> a

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
that's guy I guess it's kind of sad in a

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.950 
that's guy I guess it's kind of sad in a
way<00:02:18.640> right<00:02:18.970> it's<00:02:19.330> been<00:02:19.540> here<00:02:19.630> for<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.810> long<00:02:19.930> long
