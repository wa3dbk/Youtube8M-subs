00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:22.350
 and what we want is to have a place 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.810
 for all types of public 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.640
 an unassuming place where all the 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.960
 people have a good time rescuing them a little 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.800
 traditions respecting culture but 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.170
 trying to give it a touch more 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.110
 contemporary in the design of what is 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.410
 This all place is Juan Pablo II 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.020
 who wanted to rescue not this one 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.710
 also local elements did not use 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.420
 woods from the estela region reused and 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.930
 good is a mixture of grief will be 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.710
 wood that practically people do not 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:01.090
 purchase 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:03.010
 the resin we have mezcales of several 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.710
 regions obviously we are trying to 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.590
 privilege from michoacán of the 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.990
 products are 100% Mexican in both 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.450
 food without measure and in treat each other 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.280
 of doing that quite personally with the 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.740
 client asking a little more or 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.960
 less what kind of flavors do you like that 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.409
 the recommendation depends on each person 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.450
 not every person is a world a little bit already 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.550
 a client nobel if he is a man is a 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.960
 woman if it's someone who was already 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.360
 little experienced in the world of 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.310
 mezcal is someone who is initiating 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.890
 obviously that is a person who is 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.539
 starting you have to start with something be 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.350
 softer we like to always recommend it 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.080
 michoacano first 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.720
 it seems to me that for the closed section 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.090
 it would be pretty good from the agave brand 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.250
 of agave cortez espadín always os 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.049
 We recommend that you change your mezcal every 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.620
 once they come to come out and they can 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.200
 go testing and create a flavor 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.390
 well in the future they will go looking for 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.760
 that kind of plants the palate and the 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.920
 memory go identifying those flavors 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.600
 and each time serving more usually there are 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.990
 to start with graduations a little bit 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.820
 lower we have even mezcales of the 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.530
 variety of your wool webber not that it is with 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.300
 what is the tequila made then this 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.060
 web for people who drink tequila 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.850
 maybe it's good you can start a little 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.220
 on that part all the dishes in treats 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.890
 They are made with 100% products 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.350
 Mexicans always thought to go from 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.350
 a proper way with mezcal 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.740
 gorditas with cheese aged this 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.080
 I would recommend in the case of one much here 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.840
 not with our mezcal the mezcal is 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.240
 is in the ox community produces it 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.030
 the family of courts in the case of a 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.710

 Municipality of site and production of light 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.640
 what I tolerate to recommend it with a 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.790
 waka that does not go perfectly with a 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.200

 Cotija cheese roll on a 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.400
 Chipotle jam with a thorn 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.530
 of gold where the gift of patent leather 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.040
 next type a manzanita weighs without a 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:49.310

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.230

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.070
 we also have beer we do not have 12 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.040
 beer types different than three 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.470
 marks two of them are morelianas and one 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.850

 macadamia quite interesting and good 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.409

 new to give you 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:59.219
