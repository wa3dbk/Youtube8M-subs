 thank you to all who are with me

 have pulled through the blizzcon stream 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.230
 you have to be really crazy 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.700

 yes and with that we would be mine too 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.090
 first point the blizzcon there is 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.910
 really much to tell about 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.449

 a lot of what in the next few weeks 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.529
 yet to come 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.180
 yes of course I have the wcs too 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.860
 has no terrans at the end 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.570
 won live best player of the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.239
 tournaments everything a worthy 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.620
 conclusion of the wcs where I mostly 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.629
 were just happy about that 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.100
 huge crowd that's what you put on 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.829
 seen the images or live stream 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.440
 has for starcraft 2 and of course i 'm 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.809
 I really hot for legacy of the void 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.309
 he the horny investor is the yield 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.410
 is that blizzard shows you 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.309
 many people have listened to you 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.649
 be june 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.180
 they become an example of micro-intensive 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.710
 is the mortal the model was simply 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.329
 Let's just say that he does not anymore 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.830
 completely in haard counter to the way 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.049
 represents, of course, one is natural 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.150
 also had for the campaign but just 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.939
 the multiplayer is redesigned there 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.530
 in arco mode there are many new things 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.930
 all information you will find 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.729
 course on master croft punkt.de 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.280
 one thing for many 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.710
 Surprising was the legacy of the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.330
 void already on january 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.400
 should at least appear in the bidder 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.409
 legacy of the void definitely one 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.479
 very big thing on the blizzcon 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.369
 for me the personal highlight 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.700
 Of course, there was still a whole 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.020
 mia amount on the one hand a blizzcon 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.000
 completely new title with that actually 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.220
 so no one really expected and 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.899
 although rover watch i dont know if theirs 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.670
 Trailer have definitely seen 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.259
 should you catch up if not 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.579
 I will definitely stay in the 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.530
 describe with link 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.360
 The trailer of the watch when you look at yourself 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.790
 because you look at the whole thing 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.710
 a pixar film is good accordingly 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.969
 Whole trader but also lovingly made 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.430
 animated and the story of course 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.649
 according to super yes what is that 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.750
 special to over watch the special 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.840
 over rogers it's the first new one 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.970
 franchise from blizzard since 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.760
 I do not know 15 years or so 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.580
 Blizzard was always starcraft warcraft 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.230
 diablo and since the 90s and so 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.780
 really something new was added 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.030
 never before and therefore is easy times 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.730
 really fat thing because the very first 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.709
 times completely new universe comes to it 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.110
 not only that not just a complete one 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.510
 new universe but a whole new one 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.799
 genre blizzard had always been far 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.340
 Title mister with warcraft and starcraft 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:37.200
 always two titles at the start 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.810
 world of warcraft and later in mmo rpg 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.459
 ever rpg games with diablo already 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.019
 although one thinks that he is more in the meantime 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.030
 direction hack n slay 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.950
 enable shooter never had blizzard 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.910
 they tried starcraft 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.709
 Ghost that was then again 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.680
 set and that is now in principle 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.480
 the first yes I do not know how sports 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.090
 shooter where blizzard dares and 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.129
 who knows blizzard know who have 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.000
 always really fat sports titles 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.260
 released 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.940
 more current example what you can 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.190
 Of course, do not forget is hard 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.989
 storm that's the card game gin yet 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.670
 let it revive and of course 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.859
 and what we have achieved 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.750
 heroes of the storm with it also a mo 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:16.319
 example like mobile now 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.579
 games blizzard only on copying but what 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.340
 some may forget 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.260
 blizzard started with that 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.450
 namely the colonel comes dota 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.590
 originally from morocco of custom map 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.060
 Of course you can talk about it now 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.010
 if that really blizzard argue 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.660
 was or the community last endes 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.819
 but it is also clear that blizzard since 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.069
 always shaped the sports landscape 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.660
 but never had a school before 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.389
 I'm sure I 'll be on everyone 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.160
 look at the case 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:42.510
 you see, it's really happening 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.099
 and I honestly do not know 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.620
 what I should play first 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.139
 final fantasy new patch new addon 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.599

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:54.000
 Updates since the blizzcon starcraft 2 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.459
 legacy of the void then comes the new one 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.109

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:05.819

 laser tech tournament to say the thing is 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.040
 only I do not really have it myself 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.590
 lots of information going on as much as it is 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.580
 on the last weekend of november that 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.040
 can you ever written 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.690

 if you do not laser anything 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.690
 I can tell you from how i 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.550
 in principle you have met your mother 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.080
 headband you have such a whole 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.290
 chest protection with different sensors 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.460

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.460
 equipped with laser 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.590
 who would have thought laser tag hits 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.390
 So someone that is 360 degrees 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.950
 possible because that is just complete 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.930
 body goes around then that's one 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.000
 so-called freckmann knows that 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.430
 other apps just play the whole thing 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.440

 description the recipe as you can see 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.960
 can be a little healthier today if we 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.940
 Now replace the chicken breast 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.710
