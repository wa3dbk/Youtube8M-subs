00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:57.289 
they'll be watching that very closely
it's<00:01:55.499> just<00:01:55.770> there's<00:01:56.009> they<00:01:56.490> want<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.789> keep<00:01:57.030> that

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
it's just there's they want to keep that

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.029 
it's just there's they want to keep that
out<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.509> bounds<00:01:57.990> because<00:01:58.170> when<00:01:58.890> you're

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
out of bounds because when you're

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.709 
out of bounds because when you're
underneath<00:01:59.340> there<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.729> you<00:02:00.060> get<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.509> term

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
underneath there and you get to the term

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.230 
underneath there and you get to the term
it<00:02:01.229> creates<00:02:01.710> havoc<00:02:01.950> before<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.700> can<00:02:02.880> get<00:02:03.060> back

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
it creates havoc before you can get back

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.919 
it creates havoc before you can get back
up<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.810> that's<00:02:04.109> a<00:02:04.259> real<00:02:04.469> good<00:02:04.500> rule<00:02:05.600> lap<00:02:06.600> times

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
up so that's a real good rule lap times

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.469 
up so that's a real good rule lap times
now<00:02:07.140> dip<00:02:07.590> below<00:02:07.859> 50<00:02:08.519> seconds<00:02:09.030> we're<00:02:09.149> getting<00:02:09.390> a

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
now dip below 50 seconds we're getting a

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.449 
now dip below 50 seconds we're getting a
little<00:02:09.629> bit<00:02:09.899> closer<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.769> what<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.069> speeds<00:02:11.340> are

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
little bit closer to what the speeds are

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.039 
little bit closer to what the speeds are
running<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:11.910> practice<00:02:12.420> now<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.629> everybody's

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
running in practice now is everybody's

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.259

up<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.319> speed<00:02:13.560> we<00:02:14.549> have<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.849> remember<00:02:15.090> that

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
up to speed we have to remember that

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.509 
up to speed we have to remember that
probably<00:02:15.900> eighty<00:02:16.230> percent<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:17.010> these<00:02:17.129> cars
