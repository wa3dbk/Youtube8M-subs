language spectrum mass and that will do

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.160 
language spectrum mass and that will do
just<00:04:02.709> fine<00:04:03.100> at<00:04:03.880> removing<00:04:04.330> chemicals<00:04:04.780> as<00:04:05.110> well

at<00:04:45.389> the<00:04:45.510> top<00:04:45.750> so<00:04:46.470> you<00:04:46.800> will<00:04:47.460> actually<00:04:47.610> see<00:04:47.910> that

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
at the top so you will actually see that

using chlorine it's not dangerous at
those<00:05:24.040> amounts<00:05:24.310> but<00:05:24.840> first<00:05:25.840> of<00:05:25.990> all<00:05:26.080> you<00:05:26.230> want

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
those amounts but first of all you want

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.870 
those amounts but first of all you want
to<00:05:26.470> conserve<00:05:26.860> your<00:05:26.890> chlorine<00:05:27.220> into<00:05:27.610> you're

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880

can damage it of course the chlorine
will<00:05:41.290> do<00:05:41.440> its<00:05:41.620> thing<00:05:41.680> to<00:05:42.160> contain<00:05:42.520> himself<00:05:42.670> but

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
will do its thing to contain himself but

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.030 
will do its thing to contain himself but
this<00:05:43.810> should<00:05:44.050> last<00:05:44.200> you<00:05:44.440> for<00:05:44.470> around<00:05:44.800> a<00:05:45.010> year

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.040 
this should last you for around a year

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.670

that that's a year and a half you use

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.340 
that that's a year and a half you use
each<00:05:49.600> day<00:05:50.580> so<00:05:51.580> you<00:05:52.060> can<00:05:52.360> go<00:05:52.570> down<00:05:52.750> in<00:05:52.810> size<00:05:53.200> of
