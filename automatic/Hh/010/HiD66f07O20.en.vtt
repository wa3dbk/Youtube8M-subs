00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:31.600
 hello to all countries there today we 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:36.220
 talking about shooting from the colt then 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:40.450
 there is m 4 1 m to how I still do not call here 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:44.170
 we will talk about the spray and so 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:47.620
 let's see i think no she not 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:51.370
 very different from 16 i.e. it is this 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.980
 shooting seems to me that everything is the same 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:59.910
 same dependence and kazgu 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:02.800
 and at 16 and in the heart so the difference 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.590
 awesome don't wait you can on ti1 mascara 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.040
 dependencies lower and shoot and generally 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:12.550
 why shoot clips on 30 rounds 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.680
 same someone will say stupidity but let's say 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.050
 so there are some moments there somewhere 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.540
 well come in handy for example when about to be 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.030
 we see that there is such a booth 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.700
 a small gap where the terrorists run 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.800
 you can shoot from here well, we are not 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.799
 we will shoot three rounds for example 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.290
 there belle there is a high probability that we 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.920
 if we shoot 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.140
 just a clamp so we take some 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.820
 point based up to about here for 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.500
 wall we see that we then 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.220
 shoot it will hit about 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.430
 go to zero 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.369
 even to the radio maybe and we start 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.170
 shoot at this point with the clamp but 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.350
 to output this clip correctly 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.780
 shooting we need to roughly understand by 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.140
 what trajectory need to shoot and how we 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.909
 would hold sight for all ammo 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.860
 tel exactly on target well let's try 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.970
 now shoot and see how 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.970
 the way we fly patron 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.710
 and here the drawing is partially like 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.810
 shooting from Kalashnikov that is the same 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:24.020
 mushroom letter t how else to call her 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.020
 here is a little different now again 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:32.250
 as we see everything goes in the same way 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.230
 now try again even here 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:40.069
 see what interesting seals only 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.069
 a little more so no weapons to me anymore 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.760
 so here we have a little bit different 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.540
 It occurs than in Kalashnikov here 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.120
 is coming 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.349
 go somewhere around 7 and 8 rounds up 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.930
 further slightly to the left 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.989
 a couple of rounds all the rest to the right and 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:02.040
 back a little bit left up so we 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:04.439
 should shoot a little bit wrong on well 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.180
 as it were the other way around if you go up 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.950
 we shoot down to the right to the left 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.739
 we will introduce sight to the similar things 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.700
 let's try to hold the scope i even 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.379
 I say in advance that I looked for this 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.569
 did not do now try with you this 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:21.239
 study that is, we started a little bit 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:27.049
 left right left more precisely we should 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.049
 lead down to the left to the left correctly 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:36.700
 After all, a little bit, we do not get right now 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:38.290
 again will do it here, you can see that 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:45.519
 accuracy is more 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:50.099
 Now for the third time we will try as you 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.099
 you see accuracy is better that is 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.790
 if we shoot these clips 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.490
 booth we will not get anyone 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.840
 let's try to shoot the booth 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.840
 correctly correctly 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:48.180
 This for example such a situation we are running 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.140
 from the nine here we sit down in order 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.820
 to check 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.760
 Well, how to take a position for defense 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.680
 getting out of the booth we saw that heels 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.480
 flashed there we went there and 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.100
 clouds like an adversary sitting and how 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.250
 50 percent of the players are some inexperienced 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.290
 they will sit and wait here bye 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.440
 the man himself will come out to them and they him 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.210
 and kill 50 percent of the remaining ones 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.470
 which are more experienced they will start 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.920
 shoot right here 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:19.830
 what basically is more correct not 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.310
 give the enemy see you and kill him 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:26.810
 first so we recall the theory 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:30.450
 firing heap at one point and start 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:33.060
 shoot let's remind again how 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:37.520
 it is about to shoot we sink to 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.520
 land and spray 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:43.800
 that is, we see how she shoots 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:46.469
 further remembered at first everyone will always 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.689
 forget where to the left of the survey right at the beginning 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:51.180
 you will take a steam bath about it where to shoot 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:52.590
 to the left and to the right up and down further it all 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.569
 will be on the machine if you play 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.939
 do more shooting on meat 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:58.650
 train and similar things and so 

00:05:56.939 --> 00:06:01.249
 let's make this shoot we kill 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.249
 this man 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.590
 we so we released one clip let 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.160
 that principle should be enough for that 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:15.100
 to kill let's see if we have enough 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.930
 this we here we see all the cartridges went 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:21.430
 about 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:24.250
 the chest level of the enemy broke through they 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.220
 something like this here standing principle 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:29.160
 his deeds that we killed ourselves 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:32.620
 so do not be afraid to sweep 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.930
 shoot train shooting accuracy and 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.420
 you will succeed in everything 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.970
 kill the party nick before you 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:44.580
 I wish you all success 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:44.580
 do not be afraid to practice everything for now
