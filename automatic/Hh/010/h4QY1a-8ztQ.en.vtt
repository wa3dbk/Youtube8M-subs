00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
highlight that I think from a UI

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.080

standpoint<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.770> actually<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.670> lot<00:00:44.910> better

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
standpoint is actually a lot better

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.090 
standpoint is actually a lot better
makes<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.870> lot<00:00:46.050> easier<00:00:46.079> if<00:00:46.530> you're<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> person

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
has quite the instant queue it's easier

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.260
