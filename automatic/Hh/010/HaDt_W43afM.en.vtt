00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
engineer feels like here's the rest of

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.350 
engineer feels like here's the rest of
garage<00:02:39.590> though<00:02:40.040> there's<00:02:40.640> junk<00:02:41.090> everywhere

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
garage though there's junk everywhere

garage though there's junk everywhere
here's<00:02:42.290> a<00:02:42.349> press<00:02:42.650> I<00:02:42.829> just<00:02:43.069> built<00:02:43.340> here's<00:02:44.030> the

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
here's a press I just built here's the

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.630 
here's a press I just built here's the
RAM<00:02:44.540> then<00:02:45.530> there's<00:02:45.739> different<00:02:45.950> things<00:02:46.459> that

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
RAM then there's different things that

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.460 
RAM then there's different things that
I've<00:02:46.849> made<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:47.390> you<00:02:47.510> can<00:02:47.659> press<00:02:47.930> stuff<00:02:48.260> out

I've made that you can press stuff out

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.500 
I've made that you can press stuff out
with<00:02:48.769> a<00:02:49.129> you've<00:02:49.549> done<00:02:49.760> some<00:02:50.030> pretty<00:02:50.239> big

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
with a you've done some pretty big

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.420 
with a you've done some pretty big
bearings<00:02:52.180> I've<00:02:53.180> bet<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:53.599> all<00:02:53.720> up<00:02:53.989> and<00:02:54.170> had<00:02:54.290> to

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
bearings I've bet it all up and had to

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.000 
bearings I've bet it all up and had to
refabricate<00:02:55.430> it<00:02:55.579> the<00:02:55.819> first<00:02:56.090> time<00:02:56.269> I<00:02:56.299> used<00:02:56.629> it

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
refabricate it the first time I used it

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.039 
refabricate it the first time I used it
so<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.129> cylinders<00:02:58.640> good<00:02:58.910> anyhow<00:03:00.040> looking<00:03:01.040> at

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
so the cylinders good anyhow looking at

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.080 
so the cylinders good anyhow looking at
is<00:03:03.049> this<00:03:03.230> rotisserie<00:03:03.980> you<00:03:04.400> know<00:03:04.640> I<00:03:04.670> got<00:03:04.970> it

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
is this rotisserie you know I got it

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.449 
is this rotisserie you know I got it
flipped<00:03:05.359> back<00:03:05.569> up<00:03:05.840> because<00:03:06.319> I<00:03:06.349> forgot<00:03:07.010> to<00:03:07.069> show

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
flipped back up because I forgot to show

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.089 
flipped back up because I forgot to show
you<00:03:07.489> one<00:03:07.849> thing<00:03:08.349> we're<00:03:09.349> gonna<00:03:09.470> have<00:03:09.560> it<00:03:09.920> be

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
you one thing we're gonna have it be

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:18.069 
you one thing we're gonna have it be
somewhat<00:03:14.349> disassembled<00:03:16.329> take<00:03:17.329> this<00:03:17.510> bolt<00:03:17.870> out

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
somewhat disassembled take this bolt out

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.430 
somewhat disassembled take this bolt out
and<00:03:18.379> I<00:03:19.280> beefed<00:03:19.760> up<00:03:20.000> this<00:03:20.269> inside<00:03:20.780> here<00:03:21.139> so<00:03:21.319> it

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
and I beefed up this inside here so it

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.819 
and I beefed up this inside here so it
goes<00:03:21.620> through<00:03:22.150> one<00:03:24.280> two<00:03:26.169> three<00:03:27.169> plates<00:03:27.650> of

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
goes through one two three plates of

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.360 
goes through one two three plates of
Steel<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:29.120> this<00:03:29.389> one's<00:03:29.630> about<00:03:29.780> 5/8<00:03:30.680> thick<00:03:30.889> and

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
Steel and this one's about 5/8 thick and

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.250 
Steel and this one's about 5/8 thick and
it's<00:03:31.489> going<00:03:31.549> to<00:03:31.730> be<00:03:31.819> all<00:03:31.970> welded<00:03:32.480> like<00:03:32.510> you

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
it's going to be all welded like you

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.879 
it's going to be all welded like you
wouldn't<00:03:33.500> believe<00:03:33.560> in<00:03:34.069> there<00:03:34.480> and<00:03:35.889> stronger

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
wouldn't believe in there and stronger

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:41.259 
wouldn't believe in there and stronger
with<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.250> removable<00:03:38.000> part<00:03:39.609> flip<00:03:40.609> it<00:03:40.760> back<00:03:40.970> up

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
with the removable part flip it back up

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
to add a couple shims in between this

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.059 
to add a couple shims in between this
area<00:05:03.830> here<00:05:04.190> and<00:05:04.430> over<00:05:04.699> here<00:05:04.729> I<00:05:05.440> found<00:05:06.440> a<00:05:06.860> piece

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:07.069 
area here and over here I found a piece

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:12.100 
area here and over here I found a piece
of<00:05:07.659> paper<00:05:08.710> right<00:05:09.710> out<00:05:09.860> of<00:05:09.889> a<00:05:10.039> phone<00:05:10.340> book<00:05:11.110> maybe

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
of paper right out of a phone book maybe

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.350 
of paper right out of a phone book maybe
somebody<00:05:12.500> you<00:05:12.560> don't<00:05:12.710> like<00:05:12.979> is<00:05:13.639> cut<00:05:14.000> up<00:05:14.030> this

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
somebody you don't like is cut up this

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.589 
somebody you don't like is cut up this
page<00:05:15.069> you<00:05:16.069> fold<00:05:16.340> it<00:05:16.550> three<00:05:16.849> times<00:05:17.180> and<00:05:17.479> then

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:17.599 
page you fold it three times and then

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:19.080 
page you fold it three times and then
fold<00:05:17.900> it<00:05:18.080> in<00:05:18.139> half<00:05:18.199> again

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
fold it in half again

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.119 
fold it in half again
tuck<00:05:20.090> the<00:05:20.270> paper<00:05:20.509> in<00:05:20.780> between<00:05:21.110> here<00:05:21.469> and<00:05:21.710> in

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:22.129 
tuck the paper in between here and in

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:24.279 
tuck the paper in between here and in
between<00:05:22.520> here<00:05:22.819> and<00:05:22.849> it<00:05:23.180> gives<00:05:23.330> you<00:05:23.569> pretty

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
between here and it gives you pretty

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.180 
between here and it gives you pretty
good<00:05:24.530> space<00:05:24.889> on<00:05:25.250> it<00:05:25.460> I<00:05:26.889> already<00:05:27.889> built<00:05:28.009> the

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
good space on it I already built the

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.180 
good space on it I already built the
prototype<00:05:28.460> this<00:05:29.060> is<00:05:29.210> the<00:05:29.360> other<00:05:29.539> end<00:05:29.840> so<00:05:30.590> it

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
prototype this is the other end so it

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.620 
prototype this is the other end so it
makes<00:05:31.370> it<00:05:31.520> a<00:05:31.550> little<00:05:31.639> easier<00:05:31.819> I<00:05:32.150> cut<00:05:32.479> the

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
makes it a little easier I cut the

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.070 
makes it a little easier I cut the
pieces<00:05:32.870> all<00:05:33.229> that<00:05:33.469> we've<00:05:33.590> assembled<00:05:33.979> already

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
pieces all that we've assembled already

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.809 
pieces all that we've assembled already
beforehand<00:05:36.080> so<00:05:37.039> that's<00:05:37.190> why<00:05:37.400> it's<00:05:37.580> kind<00:05:37.729> of

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:37.819 
beforehand so that's why it's kind of

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:40.120 
beforehand so that's why it's kind of
going<00:05:38.060> relatively<00:05:38.449> quick<00:05:38.870> and<00:05:39.349> I'm<00:05:39.590> only<00:05:39.770> tack

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
going relatively quick and I'm only tack

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:50.879 
going relatively quick and I'm only tack
weld<00:05:40.430> and<00:05:40.580> things<00:05:40.789> together

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:52.949 

you
