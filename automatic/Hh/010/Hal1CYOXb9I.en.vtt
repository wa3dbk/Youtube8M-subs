00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.540
 Friday, I read about baum cube guys 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.629
 I'm mister bound and in this video 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.300
 tutorials we will see how to play online a 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:18.220
 star bound good of course for some of 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.440
 you will be a very obvious thing though 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.660
 maybe some things can be 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.420
 interesting also because as you can 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.970
 see we are still in the version 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.520
 enrico alla so probably for 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.300
 future versions if they change a lot 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.420
 what's this 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.890
 I'll make another video anyway 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.320
 we proceed immediately we are on the screen 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.329
 let's start multiplayer 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.140
 we choose our trusted character 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.359
 mister bound and look here joint serves 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.920
 so here I write an ip these lippi 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:50.739
 from the servers where I am currently playing 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.679
 and you were clean so maybe you could 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.539
 I leave in the description that is the server in 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.409
 which the Italian community of star bound 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:02.289
 he is leaning anyway he is playing 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:04.479
 at this time the server does not have 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:07.450
 particular settings also because not 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:11.350
 they left official from the house 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.759
 star bound mother though writing 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.799
 puntonet letters and without writing 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.469
 nothing else 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.119
 we can do the youth serves of course 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:21.130
 account server plus will serve for 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:26.920
 access the server a little bit 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.490
 more specific ok joint server we are here 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.240
 boys 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.850
 ok as you can see on the server us 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.329
 we access our ship 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.909
 normally however many things that we 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:43.299
 we did maybe in the single player 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.369
 we don't have them so we should 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.899
 do it again or at this point 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.820
 create a new character for yourself 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.189
 you want or redo them with yours 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.020
 to unlock various sectors, log on 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.990
 there will also be one thing for some bugs 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.079
 surely though if I go on mine 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.329
 spaceship I have alpha beta sector e 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.189
 hicks because I have not unlocked I do not have 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.200
 beat the other bosses while some 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.689
 i had some food so it is 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.509
 just unlock them to get access 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.310
 to the areas 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.870
 then something that can be done so much 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.870
 look at all bye 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.700
 one thing you can do on a server is 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.629
 meanwhile there is a chat the two-man chat 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.480
 currently types of conversation 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.290
 when you see the planet so we are in 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.750
 public 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.780
 so i make astori 7 set public 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.579
 when we do this we are in chat 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.840
 world that is, in practice we only talk 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.400
 in the world where we are this case 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.549
 I speak in my ship the others do not 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.349
 they see what I'm writing 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:48.859
 well then another thing that you can 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:51.049
 doing is in practice adding others 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:54.049
 player at the party look then I do 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.450
 so he writes the name of a person he is 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:00.049
 online for example dj oil 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.920
 I invite him see if he accepts ours 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.489
 friend 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.340
 here it is guys dj or the perfect one 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.409
 then dj I can climb over his 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.629
 nacelle 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:19.010
 here he is, he came up to mine 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:21.349
 here it is, we say goodbye to dj or it's perfect and 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.310
 what can be done then 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:27.669
 in practice level I make choose on 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.669
 planet 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.560
 I can also go on his 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.000
 ship by clicking here and doing bintou 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.780
 ship to make it the leader o 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.370
 remove from the perfect parts only between 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.989
 quotation marks sin of the thing 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:47.989
 probably currently is that it is the 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.099
 our friend from ge oil is in this case 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.569
 or any other person 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:55.340
 obviously I'm not referring to him 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.909
 has a problem that is, in the sense we have a 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.400
 problem 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:02.510
 the privacy they can access all 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.870
 our chest can also enter 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.690
 in the safe of our spaceship 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:11.209
 and so boys are not there yet 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:15.739
 parameters to block everything 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:17.959
 here is the basic discourse e 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.030
 so nothing I wanted to tell 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.920
 so italia.net if you want to participate 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.070
