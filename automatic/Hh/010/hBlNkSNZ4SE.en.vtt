of Jimmy Graham in his office will allow

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.320 
of Jimmy Graham in his office will allow
for<00:01:16.860> more<00:01:16.979> pass<00:01:17.220> play<00:01:17.580> calling<00:01:17.850> around<00:01:18.119> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
for more pass play calling around the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.969 
for more pass play calling around the
goal<00:01:18.750> line<00:01:18.960> that's<00:01:19.409> going<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.650> lead<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.830> more

goal line that's going to lead to more

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.010 
goal line that's going to lead to more
passing<00:01:20.430> touchdowns<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.939> rust<00:01:21.119> Nelson<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.960> I

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
passing touchdowns to rust Nelson and I

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.719 
passing touchdowns to rust Nelson and I
think<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.409> will<00:01:22.500> mitigate<00:01:22.799> some<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.490> loss

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
think it will mitigate some of that loss

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.789 
think it will mitigate some of that loss
in<00:01:23.939> rushing<00:01:24.270> total<00:01:24.600> probably<00:01:25.380> won't<00:01:25.530> put<00:01:25.710> up

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
in rushing total probably won't put up

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.230 
in rushing total probably won't put up
the<00:01:25.920> same<00:01:26.100> overall<00:01:26.460> totals<00:01:26.850> but<00:01:27.030> i<00:01:27.060> still

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
the same overall totals but i still

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.819 
the same overall totals but i still
think<00:01:27.420> he'll<00:01:27.600> be<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.840> number<00:01:28.110> three<00:01:28.439> overall

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
think he'll be the number three overall

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.100 
think he'll be the number three overall
fantasy<00:01:29.610> quarterback<00:01:30.000> number<00:01:30.659> two<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.079> my

fantasy quarterback number two on my

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.590 
fantasy quarterback number two on my
