on it and be rate of fire isn't all the
way<00:03:02.790> up<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.269> should<00:03:03.629> be<00:03:03.660> decent<00:03:04.079> in<00:03:04.379> PvP<00:03:04.920> but<00:03:05.340> I

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
way up it should be decent in PvP but I

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.309 
way up it should be decent in PvP but I
