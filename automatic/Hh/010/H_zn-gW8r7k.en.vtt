Spanish also albacore imitates a nice
mullet<00:05:20.949> pattern<00:05:21.459> so<00:05:22.269> also<00:05:22.809> works<00:05:23.019> in<00:05:23.229> really

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:24.099 
mullet pattern so also works in really

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:25.589 
mullet pattern so also works in really
good<00:05:24.249> inshore<00:05:24.639> for<00:05:24.849> red<00:05:24.999> fish<00:05:25.239> but<00:05:25.569> I

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
good inshore for red fish but I

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:29.339 
good inshore for red fish but I
primarily<00:05:26.610> tend<00:05:27.610> to<00:05:27.729> pull<00:05:27.939> it<00:05:28.089> out<00:05:28.179> a<00:05:28.239> lot<00:05:28.509> when

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
primarily tend to pull it out a lot when

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:31.079 
primarily tend to pull it out a lot when
the<00:05:29.469> spanish-american<00:05:29.799> war<00:05:30.219> around<00:05:30.489> busted<00:05:30.999> a

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:36.399 
aerodynamic you can get a nice long cast

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:50.079 
and now you can always trim it shorter

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:52.859 
and now you can always trim it shorter
