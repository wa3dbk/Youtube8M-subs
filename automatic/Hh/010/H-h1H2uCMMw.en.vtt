00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:25.790 

Oh

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.170 

I'm<00:01:26.800> always<00:01:27.070> surprised<00:01:27.550> because<00:01:27.790> I<00:01:28.000> don't

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
I'm always surprised because I don't

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.840 
I'm always surprised because I don't
know<00:01:28.330> what<00:01:28.690> we'll<00:01:29.350> be<00:01:29.500> doing<00:01:29.650> next<00:01:29.950> year<00:01:30.159> or

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
know what we'll be doing next year or

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.430 
know what we'll be doing next year or
five<00:01:31.120> years<00:01:31.180> from<00:01:31.630> now<00:01:33.360> only<00:01:34.360> that<00:01:34.720> I<00:01:34.750> you<00:01:35.320> know

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
five years from now only that I you know

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.040 
five years from now only that I you know
I<00:01:35.650> can<00:01:35.950> I<00:01:36.340> can<00:01:36.610> imagine<00:01:36.850> there<00:01:37.270> always<00:01:37.570> will<00:01:37.990> be

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
I can I can imagine there always will be

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.500 
I can I can imagine there always will be
something<00:01:38.440> new<00:01:38.800> and<00:01:39.400> for<00:01:39.880> me<00:01:40.000> it<00:01:40.090> was<00:01:40.180> always<00:01:40.330> a

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
something new and for me it was always a

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.219 
something new and for me it was always a
question<00:01:40.780> you<00:01:41.440> know<00:01:42.420> why<00:01:43.420> do<00:01:43.960> we<00:01:44.080> need

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
question you know why do we need

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.219 
question you know why do we need
something<00:01:44.680> new<00:01:44.830> and<00:01:45.610> what<00:01:45.910> will<00:01:46.090> that<00:01:46.119> be<00:01:46.509> and

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
something new and what will that be and

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.980 
something new and what will that be and
I<00:01:48.090> guess<00:01:49.090> part<00:01:49.360> of<00:01:49.450> my<00:01:49.660> curiosity<00:01:50.500> is<00:01:50.680> to<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.869> do

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
I guess part of my curiosity is to to do

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.370 
I guess part of my curiosity is to to do
something<00:01:53.380> new<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.869> know<00:01:55.960> we've<00:01:56.350> been

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
something new you know we've been

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.730 
something new you know we've been
working<00:01:56.650> appearances<00:01:57.160> ever<00:01:57.340> three<00:01:58.119> years

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
working appearances ever three years

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.080 
working appearances ever three years
we've<00:01:59.740> made<00:01:59.770> all<00:02:00.100> those<00:02:00.220> incremental<00:02:00.729> changes

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
we've made all those incremental changes

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.170 
we've made all those incremental changes
to<00:02:01.330> make<00:02:01.450> it<00:02:01.810> one<00:02:01.960> big<00:02:02.140> t<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.560> then<00:02:03.340> basically

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
to make it one big t and then basically

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.240 
to make it one big t and then basically
now<00:02:04.509> you<00:02:04.570> can<00:02:04.930> take<00:02:05.229> what<00:02:05.560> you've<00:02:05.680> learned<00:02:05.710> now

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
now you can take what you've learned now

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.920 
now you can take what you've learned now
you've<00:02:06.520> got<00:02:06.729> your<00:02:06.759> mail<00:02:07.090> I've<00:02:07.450> got<00:02:07.630> your<00:02:07.720> hand

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
you've got your mail I've got your hand

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.719 
you've got your mail I've got your hand
which<00:02:08.080> bag<00:02:08.320> would<00:02:08.350> you've<00:02:08.830> got<00:02:09.039> your<00:02:09.489> tools

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
which bag would you've got your tools

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.940 
which bag would you've got your tools
and<00:02:10.119> you're<00:02:10.720> going<00:02:10.810> to<00:02:10.899> apply<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.590> more

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
and you're going to apply to more

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.310 
and you're going to apply to more
variations<00:02:12.790> of<00:02:12.910> that<00:02:12.970> so<00:02:13.660> you're<00:02:13.810> able<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.170> do

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
variations of that so you're able to do

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.040 
variations of that so you're able to do
that<00:02:14.470> nursery<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:16.000> I<00:02:16.239> think<00:02:16.630> that's<00:02:16.810> really

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
that nursery so I think that's really

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.620 
that nursery so I think that's really
what<00:02:17.260> makes<00:02:17.410> arc'teryx<00:02:18.190> special<00:02:18.640> everybody

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
what makes arc'teryx special everybody

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.880 
what makes arc'teryx special everybody
was<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.750> hard<00:02:19.989> percent<00:02:20.320> behind<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:20.739> decision

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
was a hard percent behind that decision

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.690 
was a hard percent behind that decision
and<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.970> think<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:23.050> is<00:02:23.580> reflective<00:02:24.580> of<00:02:24.610> the

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
and I think that is reflective of the

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.740 
and I think that is reflective of the
strength<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:25.030> our<00:02:25.120> tricks<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:25.480> that<00:02:25.630> that

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
strength of our tricks is that that

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.250 
strength of our tricks is that that
decision<00:02:25.989> wasn't<00:02:26.350> made<00:02:27.900> about<00:02:28.900> generating

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
decision wasn't made about generating

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.979 
decision wasn't made about generating
sales<00:02:29.500> or<00:02:29.950> making<00:02:30.700> money<00:02:30.970> or<00:02:31.180> dollars<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:31.900> was

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
sales or making money or dollars it was

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.810 
sales or making money or dollars it was
this<00:02:32.440> is<00:02:32.590> a<00:02:32.620> small<00:02:32.920> part<00:02:33.160> of<00:02:33.220> our<00:02:33.340> business<00:02:33.459> we

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
this is a small part of our business we

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.820 
this is a small part of our business we
know<00:02:34.030> where<00:02:34.209> a<00:02:34.239> large<00:02:34.420> accompanying<00:02:34.900> up<00:02:35.019> but

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
know where a large accompanying up but

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.020 
know where a large accompanying up but
it<00:02:35.950> was<00:02:36.070> made<00:02:36.250> with<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.459> true<00:02:36.670> spirit<00:02:36.970> of

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
it was made with a true spirit of

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.110 
it was made with a true spirit of
passion<00:02:37.390> that<00:02:37.510> he<00:02:37.570> said<00:02:37.840> we<00:02:38.799> said<00:02:38.980> look<00:02:39.190> if<00:02:39.670> we

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
passion that he said we said look if we

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.310 
passion that he said we said look if we
think<00:02:40.269> we<00:02:40.360> can<00:02:40.450> do<00:02:40.660> something<00:02:40.690> better<00:02:41.019> in

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
think we can do something better in

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.750 
think we can do something better in
climbing<00:02:41.590> irons<00:02:41.680> as<00:02:41.920> we're<00:02:42.070> almost<00:02:42.190> you<00:02:42.670> know

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
climbing irons as we're almost you know

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.580 
climbing irons as we're almost you know
we're<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.540> innovators<00:02:43.900> now<00:02:44.019> turn<00:02:44.200> she<00:02:44.350> roams

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
we're the innovators now turn she roams

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.110 
we're the innovators now turn she roams
obligated<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.370> go<00:02:45.489> and<00:02:45.610> do<00:02:45.670> that<00:02:45.700> we<00:02:45.940> feel

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
obligated to go and do that we feel

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.170 
obligated to go and do that we feel
compelled<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.630> do<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:48.130> think<00:02:48.459> that's

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
compelled to do it and I think that's

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.450 
compelled to do it and I think that's
that's<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.300> great<00:02:51.570> example<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:52.350> how<00:02:53.100> our<00:02:53.130> team

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
that's a great example of how our team

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.070 
that's a great example of how our team
will<00:02:53.730> rally<00:02:53.970> behind<00:02:54.150> trying<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.810> do<00:02:54.900> something

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
will rally behind trying to do something

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.960 
will rally behind trying to do something
if<00:02:55.260> they<00:02:55.350> think<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.770> right<00:02:56.010> thing<00:02:56.070> not

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
if they think is the right thing not

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.460 
if they think is the right thing not
necessarily<00:02:57.360> for<00:02:57.540> pure<00:02:57.780> business<00:02:57.960> reasons

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
necessarily for pure business reasons

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.330 
necessarily for pure business reasons
and<00:02:58.710> I<00:02:58.770> I<00:02:59.040> believe<00:02:59.490> that<00:02:59.700> i<00:03:00.710> would<00:03:01.710> say<00:03:01.980> by

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
and I I believe that i would say by

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.200 
and I I believe that i would say by
taking<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.910> idea<00:03:03.240> directly<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.140> pencil

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
taking the idea directly to the pencil

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.050 
taking the idea directly to the pencil
i'm<00:03:06.650> taking<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.920> whole<00:03:08.040> energy<00:03:08.310> taking<00:03:08.940> the

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
i'm taking the whole energy taking the

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.660 
i'm taking the whole energy taking the
mana<00:03:09.300> of<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:10.350> your<00:03:10.650> work<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.070> applying<00:03:11.520> it

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
mana of of your work and applying it

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.520 
mana of of your work and applying it
directly<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.420> material<00:03:12.930> i<00:03:13.050> think<00:03:13.440> it's

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
directly to the material i think it's

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.400 
directly to the material i think it's
important<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:15.360> curve<00:03:15.630> when<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.050> look<00:03:16.260> you

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
important the curve when you look you

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.530 
important the curve when you look you
know<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:16.590> do<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.250> curve<00:03:17.610> and<00:03:17.820> you<00:03:17.970> look<00:03:18.300> at<00:03:18.420> that

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
know you do a curve and you look at that

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.480 
know you do a curve and you look at that
curve<00:03:18.840> from<00:03:19.110> a<00:03:19.230> low<00:03:19.410> angle<00:03:19.440> you<00:03:19.920> can<00:03:20.070> see<00:03:20.280> that

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
curve from a low angle you can see that

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.760 
curve from a low angle you can see that
curve<00:03:20.850> is<00:03:21.030> perfect<00:03:21.480> you<00:03:22.200> could<00:03:22.380> sit<00:03:22.620> there

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
curve is perfect you could sit there

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.000 
curve is perfect you could sit there
with<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.130> ruler<00:03:23.660> for<00:03:24.660> 20<00:03:25.020> minutes<00:03:25.380> and<00:03:25.620> it

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
with the ruler for 20 minutes and it

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.890 
with the ruler for 20 minutes and it
would<00:03:26.160> look<00:03:26.370> exactly<00:03:26.580> like<00:03:27.030> that<00:03:27.240> there<00:03:27.780> would

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
would look exactly like that there would

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.110 
would look exactly like that there would
be<00:03:27.930> no<00:03:28.320> continuity<00:03:29.220> of<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:30.180> flow<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:32.000> even<00:03:33.000> if

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
be no continuity of a flow and even if

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.970 
be no continuity of a flow and even if
i'm<00:03:33.240> modifying<00:03:33.600> patterns<00:03:34.260> I'll<00:03:34.500> just<00:03:34.740> used

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
i'm modifying patterns I'll just used

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.500 
i'm modifying patterns I'll just used
the<00:03:35.550> knife<00:03:35.760> yeah<00:03:36.300> just<00:03:36.780> use<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.200> knife<00:03:37.410> and

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
the knife yeah just use the knife and

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.790 
the knife yeah just use the knife and
you<00:03:39.510> know<00:03:39.630> when<00:03:39.780> I<00:03:39.810> was<00:03:40.020> younger<00:03:40.230> I<00:03:40.320> enjoyed

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
you know when I was younger I enjoyed

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.180 
you know when I was younger I enjoyed
the<00:03:40.920> computer<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.490> loved<00:03:41.940> it

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:04:14.090 

but<00:03:46.190> to<00:03:46.370> me<00:03:46.520> the<00:03:46.730> value<00:03:47.209> now<00:03:47.420> is<00:03:47.690> almost<00:03:48.020> worked

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:23.540 

you

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.610
