00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.419

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:23.339
 search for the very stability of the social order 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:27.139

 group as individual kelly towards progress 2 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.620
 hence the imperative need to know in depth what constitutes the 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.600
 legal order so that with a fundamental issue in economics 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.420

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.589
 with an eye on the defense of the dignity of the person 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.460
 serving justice is something that allows us to leave a mark in time 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.910
 in the people and institutions I came as choristers when determining the tastes 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.440
 we talk about good 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.650
 which is something that we are convinced that the faculty of law 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.500
 from the University of the Savannah 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.500
 I have not formally decided on the process 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.969
 that limit us to know a little more the university and my proposal 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.710
 training lawyers with the skills to perform with 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.250
 success 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.940
 in a globalized world 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.760
 If subjects change, it is a priority for institutions 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.530
 universities beyond basic knowledge the granting of 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.260
 straight 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.180
 the management of new technologies and the mastery of two or more languages 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.140
 the graduates face a world that unify markets, societies and 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.190
 cultures through a series of social legal transformations 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.510
 economic and political 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.420
 in the university law program the savannah 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.030

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.450
 international and foreign 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:21.069
 the faculty of law opens the doors to its students 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.009
 so that during their years of study they come the best experience 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.239
