00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
so much that it's really not going to be

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.710 
so much that it's really not going to be
good<00:02:29.810> for<00:02:30.050> muffins<00:02:30.490> muffins<00:02:31.490> have<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.510> fall

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720

pizza you just add a little water to

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.530 
pizza you just add a little water to
your<00:03:01.220> flour<00:03:01.550> now<00:03:01.730> i<00:03:01.760> have<00:03:01.910> nothing<00:03:02.090> else<00:03:02.330> in

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
your flour now i have nothing else in

next only flour and water now it's going
to<00:03:06.650> be<00:03:06.740> flat<00:03:07.070> it's<00:03:07.370> not<00:03:07.550> going<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:07.760> be<00:03:07.880> a<00:03:08.020> rising

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
to be flat it's not going to be a rising

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.540 
to be flat it's not going to be a rising
thing<00:03:09.200> because<00:03:09.500> there's<00:03:09.680> water<00:03:09.980> in<00:03:10.130> it<00:03:10.400> I

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
thing because there's water in it I

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.140 
thing because there's water in it I
would<00:03:11.270> need<00:03:11.420> baking<00:03:11.900> powder<00:03:12.489> not<00:03:13.489> baking<00:03:13.820> soda

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
would need baking powder not baking soda

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.030 
would need baking powder not baking soda
baking<00:03:14.420> sodas<00:03:14.870> for<00:03:15.110> dry<00:03:15.290> stuff<00:03:15.560> like<00:03:15.709> cookies

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
baking sodas for dry stuff like cookies

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.430 
baking sodas for dry stuff like cookies
baking<00:03:16.790> powder<00:03:17.239> would<00:03:17.600> be<00:03:17.810> for<00:03:18.020> wet<00:03:18.200> stuff

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
baking powder would be for wet stuff

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.199 
baking powder would be for wet stuff
like<00:03:18.680> this<00:03:18.890> so<00:03:19.489> you<00:03:19.580> can<00:03:19.610> add<00:03:19.790> a<00:03:19.820> little<00:03:20.030> bit<00:03:20.150> of

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
like this so you can add a little bit of

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.180 
like this so you can add a little bit of
baking<00:03:20.600> powder<00:03:20.780> I<00:03:21.170> should<00:03:21.709> have<00:03:21.800> added<00:03:22.070> it

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
baking powder I should have added it

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.460 
baking powder I should have added it
with<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.520> flour<00:03:22.760> so<00:03:23.660> it<00:03:23.690> won't<00:03:23.870> mix<00:03:24.200> as<00:03:24.440> well

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
with the flour so it won't mix as well

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.280 
with the flour so it won't mix as well
right<00:03:24.830> now<00:03:28.450> okay<00:03:29.450> but<00:03:29.510> this<00:03:29.780> is<00:03:29.959> how<00:03:30.110> you're

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
right now okay but this is how you're

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.460 
right now okay but this is how you're
going<00:03:30.380> to<00:03:30.470> make<00:03:30.560> your<00:03:30.739> pizza<00:03:35.320> nothing<00:03:36.320> is

going to make your pizza nothing is

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.440 
going to make your pizza nothing is
measured<00:03:36.950> you<00:03:37.130> just<00:03:37.370> add<00:03:37.550> enough<00:03:37.850> flour<00:03:38.180> until

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
measured you just add enough flour until

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.260 
measured you just add enough flour until
it<00:03:38.750> holds<00:03:39.440> together<00:03:39.640> and<00:03:40.640> you've<00:03:40.760> got<00:03:40.910> flour

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
it holds together and you've got flour

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.210 
it holds together and you've got flour
in<00:03:41.570> your<00:03:41.720> bowl<00:03:41.989> which<00:03:42.440> is<00:03:42.590> keeping<00:03:42.980> it<00:03:43.100> from

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
in your bowl which is keeping it from

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
being too dry okay and then you need

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.550 
being too dry okay and then you need
need<00:03:46.910> a<00:03:46.940> rolling<00:03:47.390> pin<00:03:47.600> now<00:03:47.959> if<00:03:48.080> you<00:03:48.200> don't<00:03:48.350> have

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560
