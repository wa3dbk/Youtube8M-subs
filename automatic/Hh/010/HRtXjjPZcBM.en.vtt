00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
okay this is 1200 VW motor so I'd have a

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.080 
okay this is 1200 VW motor so I'd have a
bit<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.240> play<00:00:09.510> with<00:00:09.750> it<00:00:10.219> decided<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.460> try<00:00:12.000> and

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
bit of a play with it decided to try and

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.460 
bit of a play with it decided to try and
put<00:00:13.250> 1,600<00:00:14.250> barrels<00:00:14.910> on<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.420> but<00:00:16.260> with<00:00:16.379> the

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
put 1,600 barrels on it but with the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.590 
put 1,600 barrels on it but with the
1200<00:00:17.070> they're<00:00:17.160> not<00:00:17.250> like<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.430> 1300<00:00:18.150> crank<00:00:18.420> case

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
1200 they're not like a 1300 crank case

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.140 
1200 they're not like a 1300 crank case
they're<00:00:19.050> actually<00:00:19.520> smaller<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.880> they<00:00:20.970> have

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
they're actually smaller and they have

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.179 
they're actually smaller and they have
to<00:00:21.270> be<00:00:21.390> bought<00:00:21.689> out<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.740> thought<00:00:22.920> I'd<00:00:23.039> want

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
to be bought out so I thought I'd want

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.009 
to be bought out so I thought I'd want
to<00:00:23.250> spend<00:00:23.550> much<00:00:24.150> money<00:00:24.330> on<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:24.600> at<00:00:24.720> all

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
to spend much money on this at all

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.720 
to spend much money on this at all
so<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.650> decided<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.310> make<00:00:27.000> up<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.269> bit<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.599> a

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
so I decided to make up a bit of a a

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.450 
so I decided to make up a bit of a a
cutter<00:00:29.730> for<00:00:30.060> yourself<00:00:30.980> as<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.070> can<00:00:32.250> see

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
cutter for yourself as you can see

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.690 
cutter for yourself as you can see
there's<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.880> cutter<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.360> there<00:00:37.280> just<00:00:38.280> machine

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
there's the cutter in there just machine

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.660 
there's the cutter in there just machine
that<00:00:38.850> up<00:00:39.379> the<00:00:40.379> tool<00:00:40.620> steel<00:00:43.250> set<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.370> up<00:00:44.460> nice

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
that up the tool steel set it up nice

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.770 
that up the tool steel set it up nice
and<00:00:44.700> straight<00:00:45.390> right<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.469> line<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.129> all<00:00:47.250> up

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
and straight right and line it all up

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.680 
and straight right and line it all up
and<00:00:48.780> yeah<00:00:49.070> it<00:00:50.070> cuts<00:00:50.280> pretty<00:00:50.460> good<00:00:50.700> as<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.539> can

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
and yeah it cuts pretty good as you can

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:01.910 
and yeah it cuts pretty good as you can
see<00:00:56.600> as<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.660> can<00:00:57.870> see<00:00:58.199> on<00:00:58.559> there<00:01:00.649> I'm<00:01:01.649> not<00:01:01.800> too

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
see as you can see on there I'm not too

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.190 
see as you can see on there I'm not too
bad<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> job<00:01:03.260> and<00:01:04.260> it's<00:01:05.869> over<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.900> limit<00:01:06.960> of

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
bad a job and it's over the limit of

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.140 
bad a job and it's over the limit of
filler<00:01:07.439> area<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:08.250> set<00:01:08.460> up<00:01:08.580> whether<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.939> start

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
filler area to set up whether to start

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.039 
filler area to set up whether to start
we<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.570> get<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.750> pre<00:01:09.869> accurate<00:01:10.580> so<00:01:11.580> yeah<00:01:15.049> if

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
we can get it pre accurate so yeah if

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.550 
we can get it pre accurate so yeah if
I'm<00:01:16.380> going<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.740> still<00:01:16.950> use<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.280> 1200<00:01:17.820> Conrad's

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
I'm going to still use to 1200 Conrad's

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.770 
I'm going to still use to 1200 Conrad's
obviously<00:01:19.560> all<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.740> have<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.250> UM<00:01:20.780> machine

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
obviously all I have to UM machine

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.630 
obviously all I have to UM machine
beyond<00:01:22.080> those<00:01:22.290> barrels<00:01:22.740> probably<00:01:23.460> should

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
beyond those barrels probably should

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.730 
beyond those barrels probably should
mean<00:01:23.790> machine<00:01:24.330> them<00:01:24.450> at<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> bottom<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.590> make

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
mean machine them at the bottom to make

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.630 
mean machine them at the bottom to make
them<00:01:25.920> shorter<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.610> match<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.000> 1200<00:01:27.600> conroy

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
them shorter to match the 1200 conroy

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.399 
them shorter to match the 1200 conroy
wait<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.790> see<00:01:29.939> what<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.210> do<00:01:30.329> with<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.600> yet<00:01:30.930> but

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
wait and see what I do with that yet but

00:01:33.409 --> 00:05:22.060 
wait and see what I do with that yet but
here<00:01:34.409> we<00:01:34.530> go

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:29.300 

okay<00:05:24.110> that<00:05:25.110> is<00:05:25.320> pretty<00:05:26.130> successful<00:05:28.130> it's<00:05:29.130> just

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
okay that is pretty successful it's just

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.980 
okay that is pretty successful it's just
the<00:05:29.430> first<00:05:29.640> pass<00:05:30.590> and<00:05:31.590> see<00:05:31.800> that<00:05:32.010> tool<00:05:32.990> you're

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
the first pass and see that tool you're

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:42.350 
the first pass and see that tool you're
better<00:05:34.170> now<00:05:39.800> just<00:05:40.800> machined<00:05:41.220> it<00:05:41.310> down<00:05:41.520> to<00:05:42.210> that

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
better now just machined it down to that

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.880 
better now just machined it down to that
16<00:05:42.780> mil<00:05:44.030> 16<00:05:45.030> mil<00:05:45.210> in<00:05:45.330> here<00:05:45.570> take<00:05:46.200> took<00:05:46.680> it<00:05:46.800> as
