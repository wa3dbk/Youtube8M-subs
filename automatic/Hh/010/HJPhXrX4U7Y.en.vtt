our second last guy and it is
2015<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.630> boss<00:01:07.580> Megatron

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.700 

there<00:01:11.939> he<00:01:12.060> is

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.060 
and he comes with three microns so let's
put<00:01:16.799> Megatron<00:01:17.250> down<00:01:17.460> for<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> minute<00:01:18.860> and<00:01:19.860> let's

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070

you<00:04:31.150> woke<00:04:31.620> so<00:04:32.620> there<00:04:32.770> you<00:04:32.889> go<00:04:33.100> we<00:04:33.970> got<00:04:34.150> a

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
you woke so there you go we got a

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.740 
you woke so there you go we got a
Megatron<00:04:35.039> that<00:04:36.039> is<00:04:36.190> from<00:04:36.430> a<00:04:36.580> timeline<00:04:37.300> very

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
Megatron that is from a timeline very

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.279 
Megatron that is from a timeline very
similar<00:04:38.260> to<00:04:39.010> the<00:04:39.130> one<00:04:39.370> that<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:40.690> Megatron<00:04:41.139> and

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
similar to the one that the Megatron and

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.129 
similar to the one that the Megatron and
darken<00:04:41.620> and<00:04:41.770> Moon<00:04:42.060> existed<00:04:43.060> in<00:04:43.210> but<00:04:43.870> with<00:04:43.990> some

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
darken and Moon existed in but with some

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.219 
darken and Moon existed in but with some
noticeable<00:04:44.500> differences<00:04:45.210> so<00:04:46.210> we've<00:04:47.020> got

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
noticeable differences so we've got

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:52.200 
noticeable differences so we've got
Megatron<00:04:47.740> we've<00:04:48.700> got<00:04:48.880> his<00:04:49.030> three<00:04:49.590> microns<00:04:51.210> so

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
Megatron we've got his three microns so

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.990 
Megatron we've got his three microns so
let's<00:04:52.389> check<00:04:52.570> him<00:04:52.690> out<00:04:52.750> in<00:04:52.870> robot<00:04:53.139> mode<00:04:53.320> and

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
let's check him out in robot mode and

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.800 
let's check him out in robot mode and
here<00:04:55.000> he's<00:04:55.150> in<00:04:55.300> robot<00:04:55.570> mode

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
here he's in robot mode

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
here he's in robot mode
well<00:04:56.500> almost<00:04:57.700> we<00:04:58.270> saw<00:04:59.110> some<00:04:59.320> comments<00:04:59.710> online

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
well almost we saw some comments online

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.350 
well almost we saw some comments online
people<00:05:00.250> were<00:05:00.310> wondering<00:05:00.639> will<00:05:00.940> he<00:05:01.030> get<00:05:01.120> a<00:05:01.180> new

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
people were wondering will he get a new

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.000 
people were wondering will he get a new
head<00:05:01.539> wall<00:05:01.810> team<00:05:02.050> and<00:05:02.229> we<00:05:02.320> did<00:05:02.470> talk<00:05:02.650> about<00:05:02.710> in

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
head wall team and we did talk about in

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.680 
head wall team and we did talk about in
the<00:05:03.070> last<00:05:03.220> video<00:05:03.610> that<00:05:03.639> the<00:05:04.000> last<00:05:04.240> two<00:05:04.389> figures

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
the last video that the last two figures

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.710 
the last video that the last two figures
do<00:05:04.900> both<00:05:05.830> get<00:05:06.039> new<00:05:06.160> tooling<00:05:06.400> so<00:05:07.120> this<00:05:07.270> Megatron

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
do both get new tooling so this Megatron

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.170 
do both get new tooling so this Megatron
does<00:05:07.930> in<00:05:08.050> fact<00:05:08.229> have<00:05:08.770> a<00:05:08.800> new<00:05:08.950> head<00:05:09.130> mold<00:05:09.370> and<00:05:09.669> it

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
does in fact have a new head mold and it

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.930 
does in fact have a new head mold and it
was<00:05:10.360> based<00:05:10.660> on<00:05:10.930> his<00:05:11.440> appearance<00:05:12.039> in<00:05:12.669> the<00:05:12.789> movie

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
was based on his appearance in the movie

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.310 
was based on his appearance in the movie
but<00:05:13.720> also<00:05:13.780> with<00:05:14.110> kind<00:05:14.289> of<00:05:14.320> a<00:05:14.410> g1<00:05:15.000> twist<00:05:16.000> to<00:05:16.180> it

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
but also with kind of a g1 twist to it

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.750 
but also with kind of a g1 twist to it
so<00:05:17.320> with<00:05:17.440> that<00:05:17.590> we'll<00:05:18.130> go<00:05:18.220> ahead<00:05:18.250> and<00:05:18.400> take<00:05:18.700> a

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
so with that we'll go ahead and take a

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.110 
so with that we'll go ahead and take a
look<00:05:19.000> and<00:05:19.960> there<00:05:20.169> it<00:05:20.289> is

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
look and there it is

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.909 
look and there it is
Cybertron's<00:05:22.120> most<00:05:22.389> wanted<00:05:22.780> Megatron<00:05:23.260> zoom

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
Cybertron's most wanted Megatron zoom

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:27.779 
Cybertron's most wanted Megatron zoom
back<00:05:24.160> there<00:05:24.400> a<00:05:24.430> little<00:05:24.610> bit<00:05:26.400> and<00:05:27.400> then<00:05:27.550> let's

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
back there a little bit and then let's

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:30.839 
back there a little bit and then let's
bring<00:05:28.030> them<00:05:28.120> in<00:05:28.270> you<00:05:28.979> can<00:05:29.979> see<00:05:30.190> we<00:05:30.370> took<00:05:30.610> some

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
bring them in you can see we took some

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.670 
bring them in you can see we took some
visual<00:05:31.180> cues<00:05:31.210> from<00:05:31.780> both<00:05:31.930> the<00:05:32.080> movie<00:05:32.380> and<00:05:32.410> the

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
visual cues from both the movie and the

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.820 
visual cues from both the movie and the
g1

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
g1

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.950 
g1
version<00:05:35.670> of<00:05:35.730> Megatron<00:05:35.910> I<00:05:36.390> think<00:05:36.540> we<00:05:36.630> found<00:05:36.780> a

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
version of Megatron I think we found a

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.820 
version of Megatron I think we found a
really<00:05:37.080> nice<00:05:37.320> little<00:05:38.900> you<00:05:39.900> know<00:05:40.020> mix<00:05:40.530> of<00:05:40.740> the

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
really nice little you know mix of the

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.740 
really nice little you know mix of the
two<00:05:40.860> I<00:05:41.280> think<00:05:41.580> this<00:05:41.760> is<00:05:41.880> a<00:05:41.910> you<00:05:42.420> know<00:05:42.510> I<00:05:42.600> think

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
two I think this is a you know I think

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.960 
two I think this is a you know I think
it<00:05:42.900> really<00:05:43.110> kind<00:05:43.260> of<00:05:43.320> meshed<00:05:43.560> well<00:05:43.970> taking

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
it really kind of meshed well taking

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.820 
it really kind of meshed well taking
some<00:05:45.210> cues<00:05:45.480> from<00:05:45.510> both<00:05:45.840> and<00:05:46.410> there<00:05:46.680> is

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
some cues from both and there is

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.210 
some cues from both and there is
Megatron<00:05:47.190> with<00:05:48.180> always<00:05:48.390> microns<00:05:48.960> in<00:05:49.170> toe<00:05:49.350> you

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
Megatron with always microns in toe you

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.780 
Megatron with always microns in toe you
got<00:05:50.340> scalpel<00:05:50.910> up<00:05:51.030> top<00:05:51.300> here<00:05:51.600> ready<00:05:52.170> to<00:05:52.260> do<00:05:52.530> some

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
got scalpel up top here ready to do some

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.170 
got scalpel up top here ready to do some
dissecting<00:05:53.790> you<00:05:54.450> got<00:05:54.570> boombox<00:05:55.850> ready<00:05:56.850> to<00:05:57.030> do

weight a little Energon foil which of
course<00:06:04.550> is<00:06:05.550> an<00:06:05.790> homage<00:06:06.060> to<00:06:06.560> the<00:06:07.560> g1<00:06:08.510> episodes

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
course is an homage to the g1 episodes

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.450 
course is an homage to the g1 episodes
the<00:06:10.110> three-part<00:06:10.710> series<00:06:10.920> more<00:06:11.190> than<00:06:11.310> meets

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
the three-part series more than meets

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.930 
the three-part series more than meets
the<00:06:11.520> eye

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
the eye

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.390 
the eye
where<00:06:12.090> Megatron<00:06:12.450> had<00:06:12.630> the<00:06:12.780> weapon<00:06:13.110> so<00:06:14.100> it's<00:06:14.310> a

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
where Megatron had the weapon so it's a

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.210 
where Megatron had the weapon so it's a
little<00:06:14.520> a<00:06:15.030> little<00:06:15.750> shout-out<00:06:15.990> to<00:06:16.260> that<00:06:16.410> so

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
little a little shout-out to that so

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.160 
little a little shout-out to that so
we'll<00:06:17.400> have<00:06:17.490> pictures<00:06:17.730> up<00:06:18.030> of<00:06:18.180> him<00:06:18.390> and<00:06:19.050> you'll

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.170 
we'll have pictures up of him and you'll

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.750 
we'll have pictures up of him and you'll
be<00:06:19.260> able<00:06:19.320> to<00:06:19.470> see<00:06:19.560> all<00:06:19.740> the<00:06:19.860> microns<00:06:20.340> in<00:06:20.580> both

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760 
be able to see all the microns in both

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.860 
be able to see all the microns in both
robot<00:06:21.180> and<00:06:21.480> then<00:06:22.290> weapon<00:06:23.040> mode<00:06:23.750> we're<00:06:24.750> gonna

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
robot and then weapon mode we're gonna

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.220 
robot and then weapon mode we're gonna
leave<00:06:25.050> them<00:06:25.140> like<00:06:25.260> that<00:06:25.290> right<00:06:25.710> now<00:06:25.740> so<00:06:27.080> we<00:06:28.080> got

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:28.230 
leave them like that right now so we got

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.260 
leave them like that right now so we got
four<00:06:28.500> down

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
four down

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.080 
four down
we<00:06:30.270> got<00:06:30.420> one<00:06:30.720> egg<00:06:30.900> left<00:06:31.790> sitting<00:06:32.790> there<00:06:32.910> on<00:06:33.030> the

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
we got one egg left sitting there on the

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.180 
we got one egg left sitting there on the
floor<00:06:33.330> where<00:06:34.290> you<00:06:34.380> get<00:06:34.530> to<00:06:34.650> that<00:06:34.770> one<00:06:34.920> next

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
floor where you get to that one next

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:35.660 
floor where you get to that one next
week
