city you're trying to put some basic

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.040 
city you're trying to put some basic
defenses<00:00:56.250> together<00:00:56.629> but<00:00:57.629> it's<00:00:57.750> not<00:00:57.809> an<00:00:57.960> easy

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
defenses together but it's not an easy

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.820

road<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.440> go<00:00:58.790> it<00:00:59.790> isn't<00:01:00.239> um<00:01:00.629> how<00:01:01.229> difficult<00:01:01.500> is

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
road to go it isn't um how difficult is

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.310 
road to go it isn't um how difficult is
it<00:01:01.890> when<00:01:02.519> you're<00:01:02.640> designing<00:01:02.790> the<00:01:03.150> game<00:01:03.360> to<00:01:04.199> do

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
it when you're designing the game to do

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.630 
it when you're designing the game to do
in<00:01:04.589> addition<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.860> between<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.220> characters<00:01:05.339> I

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
in addition a between the characters I

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.910 
in addition a between the characters I
can<00:01:05.760> fly<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.300> drive<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:07.080> shoot<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.620> seems

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
can fly and drive and shoot it seems

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.100 
can fly and drive and shoot it seems
like<00:01:08.070> three<00:01:08.280> games<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.729> won<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.750> was<00:01:09.870> actually

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
like three games and won it was actually

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.420 
like three games and won it was actually
the<00:01:10.200> kind<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.470> primary<00:01:10.740> area<00:01:11.190> where<00:01:11.340> we

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
the kind of the primary area where we

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.070 
the kind of the primary area where we
put<00:01:11.670> our<00:01:11.880> game<00:01:12.150> design<00:01:12.420> focus<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.049> our

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
put our game design focus and our

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.050 
put our game design focus and our
philosophy<00:01:13.650> was<00:01:13.860> focus<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.909> core

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
philosophy was focus on the core

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.000 
philosophy was focus on the core
controls<00:01:15.510> about<00:01:15.750> what<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.200> expect<00:01:16.710> out<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.860> a

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
controls about what you expect out of a

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.710 
controls about what you expect out of a
third-person<00:01:17.310> shooter<00:01:17.760> and<00:01:17.909> then<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:18.479> layer

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
third-person shooter and then we layer

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.230 
third-person shooter and then we layer
transformation<00:01:19.649> into<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.310> things<00:01:21.060> like

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
transformation into that so things like

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.550 
transformation into that so things like
you<00:01:21.450> know<00:01:21.539> for<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.750> hardcore<00:01:21.960> gamer<00:01:22.289> for

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
you know for the hardcore gamer for

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.590 
you know for the hardcore gamer for
example<00:01:22.920> right<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.729> controls<00:01:24.210> for<00:01:24.390> your

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
example right the controls for your

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.660 
example right the controls for your
robot<00:01:25.229> are<00:01:25.439> exactly<00:01:25.829> the<00:01:25.979> same<00:01:26.009> as<00:01:26.310> your<00:01:26.460> hover

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
robot are exactly the same as your hover

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.010 
robot are exactly the same as your hover
mode<00:01:26.909> for<00:01:27.180> your<00:01:27.299> vehicles<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.869> was

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
mode for your vehicles and that was

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.359 
mode for your vehicles and that was
really<00:01:28.200> important<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.649> encourage<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.340> to

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
really important to encourage you to

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.429 
really important to encourage you to
transform<00:01:29.850> all<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.329> time<00:01:30.570> we<00:01:31.170> put<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
transform all the time we put the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.740 
transform all the time we put the
transform<00:01:31.859> button<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.250> l3<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.390> again<00:01:33.630> you're

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
transform button on l3 so again you're

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.940 
transform button on l3 so again you're
not<00:01:33.869> giving<00:01:34.170> up<00:01:34.289> you're<00:01:34.439> shooting<00:01:34.770> your

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
not giving up you're shooting your

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.679 
not giving up you're shooting your
camera<00:01:35.369> your<00:01:35.399> agreement<00:01:36.060> all<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.359> stuff<00:01:36.570> is

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
camera your agreement all that stuff is

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.749 
camera your agreement all that stuff is
there<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.560> layer<00:01:37.799> transformation<00:01:38.640> into

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
there you just layer transformation into

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.149 
there you just layer transformation into
your<00:01:38.880> strategy<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:39.869> how<00:01:40.439> does<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.649> fit<00:01:40.950> into

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
your strategy so how does this fit into

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.980 
your strategy so how does this fit into
the<00:01:41.430> Transformers<00:01:41.939> Universe<00:01:42.119> so

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
the Transformers Universe so

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.380 
the Transformers Universe so
transformers<00:01:43.740> has<00:01:43.950> close<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.729> 30<00:01:44.939> years<00:01:45.060> of

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
transformers has close to 30 years of

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.899 
transformers has close to 30 years of
history<00:01:45.719> comics<00:01:46.590> movies<00:01:47.070> car<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.460> all<00:01:47.670> that

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
history comics movies car to all that

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:48.950 
history comics movies car to all that
stuff<00:01:48.210> right<00:01:48.359> it<00:01:48.509> was<00:01:48.600> actually<00:01:48.929> very

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
stuff right it was actually very

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.990 
stuff right it was actually very
intimidating<00:01:49.890> property<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.490> us<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.670> work<00:01:50.789> on

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
intimidating property for us to work on

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.399 
intimidating property for us to work on
so<00:01:51.509> what<00:01:51.600> we<00:01:51.689> did<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.869> we<00:01:51.960> had<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.229> pick<00:01:52.380> a

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
so what we did is we had to pick a

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.560 
so what we did is we had to pick a
