00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.799
 Can we look at it a little classify the cells before the cells you are just the right structure 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:10.099
 Always before you study 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.240
 What cells are cells that have become something that one little classified 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:16.129
 I'll try. 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:21.289
 The frozen print is shown on page 12 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:22.100
 Therefore, in order'll explain it once you see here is undiluted cells, and eukaryotic cells 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.010
 Itjyo gotta say that 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:30.970
 1x cells 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.970
 Well, then you guys have a xf. 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:40.050
 Well, there must be some strange friends. Let's look for each one of us. 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:42.750
 1x f1 sihae What this means slip Jin x Parents real nuclear comfortable doing so 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.110
 I can summarize the features . 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.920
 I do not have a line. 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:54.149
 Now, before we talk about what Aced classification of cells as colon empty 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.600
 Yiradeunji virus Toka table once I was leukocytes red blood sperm sorting 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:02.370
 You know I think you never gave me suggest to examine and talk 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.930
 It says if there is no nuclear membrane film line with the nuclear membrane eopguyo 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.970
 Thistle organ 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.320
 There is no such thing. If you know an example to solve a cell without this 1x 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.729
 good 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:20.030
 The germs are awkward, so if you try to draw a picture of a germ 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.670
 Bacteria have cell membranes. 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:27.570
 There is a cell wall called Cell Firmware 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:34.049
 Of course, the effect of plant cells, the cells are different itguyo the cell wall components 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.070
 Yes. And in this place . Now this is the nucleic acid . This is the nucleic acid . 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.140
 now 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:43.890
 They've discovered a small river somyi do you film that Rivers State 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.869
 No , it's not a cell organelle that 's a reverse membrane. 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.799
 Itdapnida has a very simple structure 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:53.909
 Now we later learn that we would be called defensive action homeostasis 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.999
 Again when defenses contained in the other he called health 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.049
 Once a pathogen would have to talk about germs, then the picture again 

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:01.170
 I'll see. 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:05.789
 So what about geujeongdoro'll eukaryotic cells 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.049
 Your eukaryotic cells are black. 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.380
 Enjoy stacked 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:14.069
 I have a malignant organ. 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:17.420
 There are organelles surrounded by membranes 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:23.519
 Give cells gun who animals, so animal cells 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:26.940
 Plant cells, animal-drawn look once the plant requires three forms 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:32.610
 It 's a cell membrane. 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:37.140
 If you think animal cells, the genetic material is now here, now in this film dna row 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.030
 There's a genetic material in here and now it's wrapped in a membrane 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.989
 This is where the agencies are. 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:47.610
 I slowly do these things and you'll know what best 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:52.319
 What connects mitochondrial yireongeo'll hear that the yireongeot 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:56.370
 Just sseong just introduced this way anyway tube studies exist 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:03:01.410
 Huh row and town planning is visible x, we now also true of you yireongeot 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:09.049
 I 'm going to learn about the center of eukaryotic cells from now on. 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:09.049
 If you go to the eukaryotic cell once, if you share the third pool, 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:20.370
 After the protoplastion, I left my brother Brother. 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:23.790
 Projection quality Real life activity Partial life activity Living part Life 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.060
 The part where the activity takes place is not life activity. 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.060
 just 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:35.530
 This is the result of the circular activity. 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:39.640
 So what do you guys have to do with the circular Zilene? 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:46.090
 Once abroad, then the rest except nuclear 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:52.510
 Cells 7g. Looks like cell membranes. These are the ones you'll see now. 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:54.730
 After that, it is called actor or cell-opening. 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.240
 You can see things . 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:04.030
 Plasmoplasm When we look at terms in time 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:06.490
 Oh, so when you explain the protein, 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.730
 Doing the actual function of life activity 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:14.140
 For water taken in such cells 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.610
 Now these things, what we learn now, in the center of this employment * 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.430
 same 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.430
 Let's learn about these things one by one.
