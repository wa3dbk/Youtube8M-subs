00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
too

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:21.740 
too
for<00:02:14.250> enemies<00:02:14.640> out<00:02:15.180> of<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.480> ground<00:02:20.510> for<00:02:21.510> its

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
for enemies out of the ground for its

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.449 
for enemies out of the ground for its
pretty<00:02:22.080> idea<00:02:22.470> in<00:02:22.739> some<00:02:22.920> situation<00:02:23.340> you

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
pretty idea in some situation you

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.800 
pretty idea in some situation you
actually<00:02:23.760> up<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.209> use<00:02:24.599> this<00:02:25.010> Julie<00:02:26.010> dynamic<00:02:26.810> to

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
actually up to use this Julie dynamic to

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.190 
actually up to use this Julie dynamic to
go<00:02:27.959> throughout<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.440> game<00:02:29.750> it's<00:02:30.750> obvious<00:02:31.050> like

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
go throughout the game it's obvious like

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.720 
go throughout the game it's obvious like
the<00:02:31.350> graphic<00:02:31.770> something<00:02:32.069> enhance<00:02:32.370> what<00:02:32.580> other

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
the graphic something enhance what other

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.290 
the graphic something enhance what other
changes<00:02:33.620> enhancements<00:02:34.620> have<00:02:34.650> been<00:02:34.860> made<00:02:35.300> a

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
changes enhancements have been made a

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.300 
changes enhancements have been made a
graphics<00:02:37.080> actually<00:02:37.500> we<00:02:37.650> spend<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.160> lot<00:02:38.190> of

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
graphics actually we spend a lot of

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.520 
graphics actually we spend a lot of
times<00:02:38.610> we<00:02:38.790> had<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.060> redo<00:02:39.300> pretty<00:02:39.989> much<00:02:40.140> ninety

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
times we had to redo pretty much ninety

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.589 
times we had to redo pretty much ninety
percent<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.130> texture<00:02:41.459> of<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.670> game<00:02:41.850> we

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
percent of the texture of the game we

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.660 
percent of the texture of the game we
had<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.900> also<00:02:43.230> work<00:02:43.500> on<00:02:43.739> most<00:02:44.220> character

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
had to also work on most character

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.860 
had to also work on most character
models<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.930> really<00:02:46.440> improve<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.830> visual<00:02:47.100> 20

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
models to really improve the visual 20

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.120 
models to really improve the visual 20
we<00:02:48.870> are<00:02:49.050> lucky<00:02:49.170> with<00:02:49.470> beyond<00:02:49.769> good<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.069> evil

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
we are lucky with beyond good and evil

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.759 
we are lucky with beyond good and evil
because<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:51.630> original<00:02:51.690> game<00:02:52.080> was<00:02:52.350> already<00:02:52.739> a

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
because the original game was already a

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.280 
because the original game was already a
very<00:02:53.040> good<00:02:53.250> looking<00:02:53.549> game<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.030> after<00:02:54.840> is

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
very good looking game and after is

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.900 
very good looking game and after is
really<00:02:55.590> unique<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.069> know<00:02:56.100> it's<00:02:56.340> not<00:02:56.489> trying

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
really unique you know it's not trying

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.229 
really unique you know it's not trying
to<00:02:57.030> be<00:02:57.150> realistic<00:02:57.660> so<00:02:58.170> this<00:02:59.160> was<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.370> good<00:02:59.850> basis

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
to be realistic so this was a good basis

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.300 
to be realistic so this was a good basis
but<00:03:00.390> still<00:03:00.660> we<00:03:00.840> had<00:03:00.989> to<00:03:01.140> redo<00:03:01.350> most<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.220> the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
but still we had to redo most of the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.420 
but still we had to redo most of the
textures<00:03:02.670> we<00:03:02.940> had<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.269> also<00:03:03.480> add

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
textures we had to also add

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.590 
textures we had to also add
anti-aliasing<00:03:05.430> constants<00:03:08.420> although<00:03:09.420> white

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
anti-aliasing constants although white

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.309 
anti-aliasing constants although white
we<00:03:09.780> also<00:03:10.760> worked<00:03:11.760> on<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:11.970> soundtrack<00:03:12.239> so<00:03:12.959> the

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
we also worked on the soundtrack so the

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.170 
we also worked on the soundtrack so the
game<00:03:13.470> has<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.650> great<00:03:13.860> soundtrack<00:03:14.010> but<00:03:14.489> one<00:03:15.030> of

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
game has a great soundtrack but one of

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.449 
game has a great soundtrack but one of
the<00:03:15.360> drawback<00:03:16.049> of<00:03:16.080> all<00:03:16.560> gen<00:03:16.920> system<00:03:17.280> is<00:03:17.430> that

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
the drawback of all gen system is that

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.550 
the drawback of all gen system is that
you<00:03:17.760> compress<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.660> lot<00:03:18.930> so<00:03:19.109> you<00:03:19.230> are<00:03:19.350> losing

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
you compress a lot so you are losing

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.509 
you compress a lot so you are losing
quality<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:20.400> quality<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:21.890> on<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.190> next<00:03:23.340> gen

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
quality to quality and on the next gen

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.800 
quality to quality and on the next gen
we<00:03:23.760> can<00:03:23.910> actually<00:03:24.090> in<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.510> world<00:03:24.690> the

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
we can actually in the world the

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.770 
we can actually in the world the
compression<00:03:25.260> so<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.620> quality<00:03:26.090> output<00:03:27.090> in

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
compression so the quality output in

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.960 
compression so the quality output in
terms<00:03:27.840> of<00:03:28.260> Paju<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.739> really<00:03:29.280> much<00:03:29.489> better<00:03:29.760> on

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
terms of Paju is really much better on

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.180 
terms of Paju is really much better on
it<00:03:30.239> games<00:03:30.510> with<00:03:30.720> them<00:03:30.870> or<00:03:31.590> some<00:03:31.769> song<00:03:31.980> track

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
it games with them or some song track

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.180 
it games with them or some song track
like<00:03:32.340> this<00:03:32.370> it's<00:03:32.730> really<00:03:33.709> very<00:03:34.709> very<00:03:34.829> neat

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
like this it's really very very neat

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.729 
like this it's really very very neat
improvements<00:03:35.880> now<00:03:36.359> I'm<00:03:36.780> taking<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:37.230> picture<00:03:37.440> so

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
improvements now I'm taking a picture so

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.740 
improvements now I'm taking a picture so
this<00:03:37.890> is<00:03:38.010> part<00:03:38.250> of<00:03:38.370> one<00:03:38.820> original<00:03:39.299> part<00:03:39.570> of<00:03:39.690> the

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
this is part of one original part of the

this is part of one original part of the
river<00:03:40.049> at<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.590> game<00:03:40.859> is<00:03:40.890> that<00:03:41.160> you<00:03:41.310> are<00:03:41.430> not

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
river at the game is that you are not

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.390 
river at the game is that you are not
like<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.880> typical<00:03:42.030> action<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:43.440> you<00:03:43.620> owe<00:03:43.650> you

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400
