you may need to do a little work here to
unstick<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.599> ball<00:02:32.780> now<00:02:33.739> this<00:02:33.950> is<00:02:34.130> one<00:02:34.370> of

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
unstick the ball now this is one of

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.880 
unstick the ball now this is one of
those<00:02:34.640> times<00:02:35.000> when<00:02:35.510> it<00:02:35.840> must<00:02:36.170> be<00:02:36.380> overhand
