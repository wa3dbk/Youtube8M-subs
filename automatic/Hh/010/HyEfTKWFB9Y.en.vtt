00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.839
 video tutorial for you guys 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.389
 and today we are going to talk about a very 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.250
 easy very simple but a lot of people 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.240
 still searching the internet for a video 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.369
 tutorial application video so the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.390
 Miracle program that promises but not 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.010
 meet me 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.660
 so I'm going to recommend it to you today 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.910
 a program is very simple and very 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.640
 basic but first let's see how it is that 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.740
 set up a business and you will that 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.170
 control panel 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:35.820
 he will be opening hardware here 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:38.399
 editing sound and here you will have the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.070
 that are the devices that 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.540
 Record Aquino and you will see if the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.309
 hysterical mixing 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.140
 usually it will not be activated 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.930
 So you favor or activate this 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.800
 device that it will be crucial 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.780
 that this operation is to record capture 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.520
 the sound of any windows is only 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.260
 touching windows any browser 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.620
 thing he'll record 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.210
 so here the open program is already going 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.670
 being here available is important 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.830
 that you check the former agent terry who 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.689
 You just unlocked your 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:15.270
 computer windows 7 and let 's recording 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.020
 and let's take, for example, the sound of 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.560
 browser is saved here and has this 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.509
 play here of thousands but my Marruá 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.890
 This is not very good and we have to 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.760
 plate 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.130
 oh love 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.490
 We tune this property in moral 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.720
 anyway is the program here you are connected 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.720
 already recorded the listen 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.160
 I think this is where we started to 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.920
 people this music involves and there 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.080
 proof that the program runs record 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.960
 sound was being output on the 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:02.060
 windows and save very simple 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.850
 Unfortunately he has but again here. 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.830
 Anything is quick and pre-salt goes 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.380
 very simple is not save project is not 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.880
 none of this is toll-free agent 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.800

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.540
 You will choose the format I 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.490
 In case the petrecho team you want to put the 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.630
 format does not matter and will save 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.670
 the same way 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.640
 at any time it will be 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:30.230
 saving around like an okay song 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:32.959

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:50.320
 even the voice you even leave the same 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.940
 The way you catch it here, my né 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.040
