00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.710 

we<00:00:21.800> saw<00:00:22.070> having<00:00:22.430> a<00:00:22.490> pure<00:00:22.820> battery<00:00:23.330> electric

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
we saw having a pure battery electric

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.060 
we saw having a pure battery electric
vehicle<00:00:24.170> as<00:00:24.760> the<00:00:25.760> future<00:00:26.150> and<00:00:26.800> you<00:00:27.800> know<00:00:27.890> we

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
vehicle as the future and you know we

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.519 
vehicle as the future and you know we
were<00:00:28.160> diving<00:00:28.400> into<00:00:28.790> the<00:00:28.820> future<00:00:29.150> and<00:00:29.480> we<00:00:30.320> know

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
were diving into the future and we know

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.679 
were diving into the future and we know
that<00:00:30.560> gasoline<00:00:31.430> at<00:00:31.700> some<00:00:31.880> point<00:00:32.119> is<00:00:32.270> going<00:00:32.540> to

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
that gasoline at some point is going to

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.189 
that gasoline at some point is going to
be<00:00:32.950> is<00:00:33.950> going<00:00:34.070> to<00:00:34.370> run<00:00:34.550> up<00:00:34.580> and<00:00:35.030> so<00:00:35.750> we<00:00:35.930> know<00:00:36.050> we

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
be is going to run up and so we know we

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.100 
be is going to run up and so we know we
have<00:00:36.230> to<00:00:36.470> prepare<00:00:36.650> for<00:00:37.160> that<00:00:37.449> future<00:00:38.449> and<00:00:38.900> we

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
have to prepare for that future and we

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.590 
have to prepare for that future and we
know<00:00:39.350> that<00:00:39.730> environmentally<00:00:40.730> that's<00:00:41.390> where

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
know that environmentally that's where

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.660 
know that environmentally that's where
we<00:00:41.690> want<00:00:41.900> to<00:00:41.930> get<00:00:42.050> to<00:00:42.260> I<00:00:44.350> I<00:00:45.350> did<00:00:45.770> think<00:00:46.040> I'll<00:00:46.280> be

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
we want to get to I I did think I'll be

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.939 
we want to get to I I did think I'll be
honest<00:00:46.970> like<00:00:47.059> I<00:00:47.210> think<00:00:47.480> what's<00:00:48.410> gonna<00:00:48.590> change

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
honest like I think what's gonna change

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.880 
honest like I think what's gonna change
in<00:00:49.430> my<00:00:49.670> commute<00:00:50.449> what's<00:00:51.110> going<00:00:51.320> to<00:00:51.350> change<00:00:51.410> and

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
in my commute what's going to change and

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.710 
in my commute what's going to change and
how<00:00:52.820> far<00:00:53.120> I<00:00:53.149> can<00:00:53.390> get<00:00:54.160> and<00:00:55.160> so<00:00:55.520> far<00:00:55.820> are<00:00:56.329> my

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
how far I can get and so far are my

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.750 
how far I can get and so far are my
experience<00:00:57.230> has<00:00:57.410> been<00:00:57.470> very<00:00:57.890> positive<00:00:58.340> there

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
experience has been very positive there

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.900 
experience has been very positive there
hasn't<00:00:59.120> been<00:00:59.149> a<00:00:59.300> time<00:00:59.600> when<00:00:59.870> I've<00:01:00.730> wanted<00:01:01.730> to

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
hasn't been a time when I've wanted to

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.880 
hasn't been a time when I've wanted to
go<00:01:02.059> a<00:01:02.090> greater<00:01:02.540> distance<00:01:02.840> and<00:01:03.260> I<00:01:03.350> haven't<00:01:03.680> been

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
go a greater distance and I haven't been

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.980 
go a greater distance and I haven't been
able<00:01:04.100> to<00:01:04.250> so<00:01:05.059> I<00:01:05.089> think<00:01:05.239> it's<00:01:05.570> really<00:01:05.780> about

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
able to so I think it's really about

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.520 
able to so I think it's really about
just<00:01:06.340> thinking<00:01:07.340> about<00:01:07.540> what<00:01:08.540> your<00:01:09.020> regular

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
just thinking about what your regular

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.770 
just thinking about what your regular
commute<00:01:10.009> is<00:01:10.190> and<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:10.790> regular<00:01:11.180> places<00:01:11.450> that

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
commute is and the regular places that

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.270 
commute is and the regular places that
you<00:01:11.899> go<00:01:11.930> to<00:01:12.110> because<00:01:12.530> I<00:01:12.619> think<00:01:12.680> we're<00:01:13.039> pretty

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
you go to because I think we're pretty

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.940 
you go to because I think we're pretty
much<00:01:13.789> creatures<00:01:14.240> of<00:01:14.420> habit

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.340 

this<00:01:18.950> thing<00:01:19.190> you<00:01:19.580> can<00:01:19.729> plug<00:01:19.909> it<00:01:20.060> into<00:01:20.240> any<00:01:20.600> 110

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
this thing you can plug it into any 110

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.649 
this thing you can plug it into any 110
volt<00:01:21.590> outlet<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.970> infrastructure<00:01:23.479> is

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
volt outlet and the infrastructure is

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:31.859 
volt outlet and the infrastructure is
there<00:01:23.930> and<00:01:24.110> ready<00:01:24.260> to<00:01:24.409> go

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.620 

we<00:01:32.869> talked<00:01:33.110> to<00:01:33.259> students<00:01:33.649> about<00:01:33.829> being

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
we talked to students about being

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.450 
we talked to students about being
environmentally<00:01:35.630> conscious<00:01:36.380> and<00:01:36.649> doing<00:01:37.250> good

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
environmentally conscious and doing good

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.929 
environmentally conscious and doing good
things<00:01:37.700> for<00:01:37.789> the<00:01:37.969> environment<00:01:38.329> and<00:01:39.700> what<00:01:40.700> am<00:01:40.820> i

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
things for the environment and what am i

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.609 
things for the environment and what am i
doing<00:01:41.360> it<00:01:41.539> was<00:01:41.840> just<00:01:42.049> a<00:01:42.140> moment<00:01:42.470> of

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
doing it was just a moment of

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:50.319 
doing it was just a moment of
questioning<00:01:43.460> what<00:01:43.759> we<00:01:44.030> do<00:01:44.210> every<00:01:44.539> day<00:01:49.329> there's

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
questioning what we do every day there's

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.260 
questioning what we do every day there's
no<00:01:50.509> beating<00:01:50.720> driving<00:01:51.310> no<00:01:52.310> gas<00:01:52.520> I<00:01:52.789> mean<00:01:53.149> he

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
no beating driving no gas I mean he

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.719 
no beating driving no gas I mean he
can't<00:01:53.840> beat<00:01:54.020> that<00:01:54.049> so<00:01:54.740> instead<00:01:55.310> of<00:01:55.429> comparing

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
can't beat that so instead of comparing

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.520 
can't beat that so instead of comparing
all<00:01:55.970> these<00:01:56.119> fuel<00:01:56.329> efficiency<00:01:56.960> numbers<00:01:57.289> while

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
all these fuel efficiency numbers while

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:25.520 
all these fuel efficiency numbers while
zero<00:01:58.369> gases<00:01:59.860> amazing

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.160 

if<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:26.709> know<00:02:26.860> what<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.099> car<00:02:27.310> can<00:02:27.340> do<00:02:27.819> and<00:02:28.170> you

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
if you know what the car can do and you

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.430 
if you know what the car can do and you
know<00:02:29.349> that<00:02:29.739> hey<00:02:30.430> this<00:02:30.670> is<00:02:30.849> a<00:02:30.879> car<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:31.440> is

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
know that hey this is a car that is

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.910 
know that hey this is a car that is
going<00:02:32.739> to<00:02:32.830> save<00:02:33.099> me<00:02:33.129> a<00:02:33.370> lot<00:02:33.519> of<00:02:33.730> gas<00:02:34.690> money<00:02:35.019> then

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
going to save me a lot of gas money then

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.709 
going to save me a lot of gas money then
you<00:02:36.640> know<00:02:36.790> it's<00:02:36.909> it's<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.470> great<00:02:38.470> investment
