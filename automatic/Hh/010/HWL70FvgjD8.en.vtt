00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:09.509
 Yes er is Ezaki the Hello of d Con Satin No. locations 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.290
 We also wish best regards today look forward to a little talk about running today 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:13.790
 I'm sorry 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.780
 The important thing in running is abundant 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:22.640
 Well, in order to make that home first 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.750
 I want you to check it everyone I want to talk about it for a moment 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.470
 But 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:32.400
 First of all running is walking behavior 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:37.860
 The speed of the walking motion is getting faster and faster 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.740
 Speed ​​has been increased, stride width has also expanded, and body movement has become dynamic 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.910
 State 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.300
 Run it 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:50.480
 Although the example it becomes in such a movement to landing 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:51.950
 First and foremost is your normal attitude 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:58.350
 It is good to carry out 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:01:03.930
 I would like to have you check before running before running 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.570
 Please check that there is a check on Aso, but please think that there is one 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.090
 First of all 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.090
 It is this state next to the state 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:25.120
 When you are standing normally buy a weight biased to either foot 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:29.920
 Transfer looks neutral state at 50% 50% Fifty Fifty 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:36.450
 Because it is a, it is in the state which sold body a little sideways 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:40.080
 I ca n't see who is riding on the way everyone fell 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:46.590
 I 'm riding too much to the right, for example 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:50.020
 If there is a spring water from the left, there will be a collapse of the crowds 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.710
 Become easier is injury prone 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.730
 Therefore, first get to the confirmation from the side 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:01.659
 Yes there is one more 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:04.020
 I would like you to see the position of the center of gravity when standing up 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.050
 For example, I like this before kiss 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.039
 simply 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:12.259
 You may get behind too much 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.259
 So slightly back and forth 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:22.200
 It is the later I am moving 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.640
 Straight whether you are suffering from is body weight in the entire sole of the foot 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.760
 I think if you can check 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:37.030
 As a check method it will be the movement of left and right and back and forth 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:44.569
 Confirm the movement firmly The ideal form is a line perpendicular to the floor 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:48.950
 First, the animals seem to ride to the entire sole of the foot as the center of gravity was the center of gravity 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:53.980
 Please try to make the 2 and Jet Black revolution 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.980
 Thank you very much for today
