 to degrees are already two options for 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.869
 cover her with padding because she gets a 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.729
 stuffing you'll see fill with 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.369
 Wadding you are going to make a circle of another

 we were going to be all our work 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.470

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.180
 of the two since we have stuck this 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.989
 miriam let's use what are the 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.319
 accessories 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.200
 You can use ribbon lanyards and 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.390
 You are hitting surroundings, they sell it to you already 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.099
 true fact that is already sold to you 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.720
 done but to complicate us either 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.400
 there and we will do practices comes 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.890
 cutting 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.840
 we are going to give a boat of these children 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.900
 so that when people talking this 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.760
 blue rule to do with the dynamics 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.890
 then to the first person that we 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.689
 talk and tell us what it is that 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.670
 would like it to be seen for another week 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:46.909
 for children now that they will be in 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.069
 a school break that stops you from 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:50.209
 put on and tell us what thing that the 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.189
 ladies communicate with us 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.319
 someone tell you exactly what we 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.780
 say rather that they would like 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:00.409
 your son will work to give you in these 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.120
 vacations because sometimes this one they put 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.859
 there the laziness and the best thing that 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.769
 I would like you to work if that moment in 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:10.640
 38 17 404 which are the telephones of 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:13.010
 day to day to work 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:19.870
 a little while and serve look for 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.870
 they were nations with the apparatuses those 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.340
 games 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.410
 the apparatuses apparatuses those that of 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.780
 suddenly they see six things to innocents a lot 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.790
 anger here keeps putting equal 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.860
 we can put more strips if we want 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.080
 live and if not already nothing else 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.450
 we decorate on the side with what is 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.700
 our little bun 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.230
 here or if there are already very mixed parents 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.780
 what I hope what I like is that 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.340
 is to see the TV I also say 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.890
 to repeat it in his television time 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.050
 that corresponds to him in the children he gets 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.260
 in the little boat and when they finish 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.450
 play with toys for panistas 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.380
 feel so communicates this 38,000 is 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.989
 they feel 404 and they tell us that they would like 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.670
 put your child during this passing of 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.769
 way that you have to put the 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.840
 screws and raise awareness there too 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.330
 this one they are saving money that comes what 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.549
 which is the child's day season and 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.609
 we have to be happy the children we have 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:21.440
 to do something and we can help them to 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.440
 help us make crafts 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.250
 so that our beloved israel 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.529
 help us, let's put what is the 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:34.350
 silicon we put ribbon 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:37.050
 today we put the silicone back 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.910
 and look and give another touch and you put 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.639
 another ribbon of more and gives another touch 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.860
 different I like for a gift 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.139
 later we will be accompanied by jessica the candle 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.639
 that has just been mom is very beautiful 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:53.129
 because this time incident makes the 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.129
 another idea gets the diapers go 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.449
 not like suction 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:05.569
 when the baby clothes the baby too 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:08.410
 it's another option except a baby factor 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:10.030
 and good ideas I have to barbarian 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.600

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.880
 that must be they are not thinking about me 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:32.520
 things that would not have not left them 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:34.740
 understanding the announcements already fulfilled 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.520

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.520
 perfect 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.530
 but it is not salable to lose or not 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.520
 good 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:56.509
 the winner of the pot says do 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:58.189
