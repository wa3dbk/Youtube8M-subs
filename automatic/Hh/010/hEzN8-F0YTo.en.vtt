you or don't have them with fish they're

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.660 
you or don't have them with fish they're
actually<00:00:21.630> quite<00:00:21.840> easy<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.199> keep<00:00:22.500> if<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.369> try

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
actually quite easy to keep if you try

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.240 
actually quite easy to keep if you try
and<00:00:23.730> mix<00:00:23.910> them<00:00:24.119> with<00:00:24.240> fish<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:25.170> they<00:00:25.949> tend<00:00:26.189> to

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
and mix them with fish and they tend to

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.609 
and mix them with fish and they tend to
starve<00:00:26.580> because<00:00:26.910> they<00:00:27.810> can't<00:00:28.080> compete

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
starve because they can't compete

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.120 
starve because they can't compete
adequately<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.699> food<00:00:30.710> now<00:00:31.710> when<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:31.949> first

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
adequately for food now when you first

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.709 
adequately for food now when you first
get<00:00:32.369> them<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.640> need<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.850> be<00:00:33.059> prepared<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.480> feed

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
get them you need to be prepared to feed

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.620 
get them you need to be prepared to feed
them<00:00:33.840> live<00:00:33.989> brine<00:00:34.350> shrimp<00:00:34.760> then<00:00:35.760> as<00:00:36.059> they<00:00:36.450> get

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
them live brine shrimp then as they get

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.819 
them live brine shrimp then as they get
used<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.110> when<00:00:37.290> they<00:00:37.380> get<00:00:37.500> used<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.770> the

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
used to you when they get used to the

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.590 
used to you when they get used to the
aquarium<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.520> environment<00:00:39.149> then<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.329> can

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
aquarium in the environment then you can

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.850 
aquarium in the environment then you can
usually<00:00:39.719> get<00:00:39.960> them<00:00:40.079> under<00:00:40.200> frozen<00:00:40.680> brine

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
usually get them under frozen brine

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.580 
usually get them under frozen brine
shrimp<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.660> then<00:00:42.660> from<00:00:42.899> frozen<00:00:43.140> brine<00:00:43.559> shrimp

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
shrimp and then from frozen brine shrimp

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.299 
shrimp and then from frozen brine shrimp
I've<00:00:44.370> even<00:00:44.670> seen<00:00:44.850> them<00:00:44.910> go<00:00:45.149> onto<00:00:45.390> pellets<00:00:46.309> and

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
I've even seen them go onto pellets and

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.299 
I've even seen them go onto pellets and
when<00:00:47.550> they're<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:48.000> frozen<00:00:48.629> or<00:00:49.020> dry<00:00:49.800> food

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
when they're on frozen or dry food

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.020 
when they're on frozen or dry food
they're<00:00:50.550> extremely<00:00:51.030> easy<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.420> look<00:00:51.570> after<00:00:53.030> if

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
they're extremely easy to look after if

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.340 
they're extremely easy to look after if
possible<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.600> want<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.780> try<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.050> feed<00:00:55.170> them<00:00:55.289> a

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
possible you want to try and feed them a

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.229 
possible you want to try and feed them a
couple<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.649> times<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.980> day<00:00:56.010> because<00:00:56.969> they<00:00:57.090> are<00:00:57.210> a

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
couple of times a day because they are a

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.750 
couple of times a day because they are a
grazing<00:00:57.780> animal<00:00:58.079> they<00:00:58.170> will<00:00:58.350> pluck<00:00:58.710> my<00:00:59.399> arms

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
grazing animal they will pluck my arms

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.069 
grazing animal they will pluck my arms
all<00:00:59.879> organisms<00:01:00.180> out<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.719> water

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
all organisms out of the water

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.860 
all organisms out of the water
pretty<00:01:01.920> much<00:01:02.070> all<00:01:02.280> day<00:01:02.309> long<00:01:02.760> with<00:01:03.660> their

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
pretty much all day long with their

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.149 
pretty much all day long with their
snout<00:01:04.379> they<00:01:04.650> basically<00:01:04.949> suck<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.519> food<00:01:05.760> in

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
snout they basically suck the food in

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.789 
snout they basically suck the food in
the<00:01:08.159> male<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.880> one<00:01:09.150> with<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> pouch<00:01:09.710> so<00:01:10.710> if

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
the male is the one with the pouch so if

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.710 
the male is the one with the pouch so if
you<00:01:10.890> see<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> big<00:01:11.310> fleshy<00:01:11.610> pouch<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.479> front

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
you see a big fleshy pouch on the front

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.929 
you see a big fleshy pouch on the front
wake<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:12.990> guy<00:01:13.200> here<00:01:13.500> it's<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.460> male<00:01:14.700> if

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
wake this guy here it's a male if

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.520 
wake this guy here it's a male if
there's<00:01:15.150> no<00:01:15.299> fleshy<00:01:15.630> pouch<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.380> one

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
there's no fleshy pouch like that one

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.910 
there's no fleshy pouch like that one
then<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.610> female<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.780> when<00:01:19.500> they<00:01:19.650> breed

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
then it's a female and when they breed

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.620 
then it's a female and when they breed
the<00:01:20.100> female<00:01:20.460> deposits<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:21.060> eggs<00:01:21.210> into<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
the female deposits the eggs into the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.320 
the female deposits the eggs into the
male's<00:01:21.810> pouch<00:01:22.549> where<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.670> male<00:01:23.909> actually

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
male's pouch where the male actually

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.719 
male's pouch where the male actually
raises<00:01:24.780> them<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.140> then<00:01:26.040> when<00:01:26.520> they're<00:01:26.700> ready

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
raises them and then when they're ready

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.819 
raises them and then when they're ready
the<00:01:27.270> male<00:01:27.540> will<00:01:27.750> do<00:01:27.869> little<00:01:28.080> convulse<00:01:28.530> and

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
the male will do little convulse and

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.249 
the male will do little convulse and
shoot<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:31.579> little<00:01:32.579> babies<00:01:33.570> into<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
shoot the little babies into the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.100 
shoot the little babies into the
environment<00:01:35.360> so<00:01:36.360> I'm<00:01:36.600> they're<00:01:36.840> actually

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
environment so I'm they're actually

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.999 
environment so I'm they're actually
quite<00:01:37.259> easy<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.890> breed<00:01:39.409> now<00:01:40.409> every<00:01:40.770> now<00:01:40.890> and

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
quite easy to breed now every now and

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.310 
quite easy to breed now every now and
then<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.189> male<00:01:41.369> also<00:01:41.700> gets<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.060> can<00:01:43.049> get<00:01:43.259> a

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
then the male also gets a can get a

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.109 
then the male also gets a can get a
little<00:01:43.799> air<00:01:43.950> bubble<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.310> its<00:01:44.460> pouch<00:01:44.700> which<00:01:44.939> can

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
little air bubble in its pouch which can

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.969 
little air bubble in its pouch which can
easily<00:01:45.240> be<00:01:45.479> massaged<00:01:45.990> out<00:01:46.350> most<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.950> time

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
easily be massaged out most of the time

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.080 
easily be massaged out most of the time
it's<00:01:49.979> good<00:01:50.159> if<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.280> do<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> protein

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
it's good if you do have a protein

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.389 
it's good if you do have a protein
skimmer<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.689> tank<00:01:51.920> what<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.040> protein

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
skimmer on the tank what the protein

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.289 
skimmer on the tank what the protein
skimmer<00:01:53.579> does<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.390> suck<00:01:55.140> out<00:01:55.350> any<00:01:56.119> it's<00:01:57.119> the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
skimmer does is suck out any it's the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.660 
skimmer does is suck out any it's the
protein<00:01:57.630> skimmer<00:01:57.810> there<00:01:58.250> and<00:01:59.250> what<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.610> will

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
protein skimmer there and what that will

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.490 
protein skimmer there and what that will
do<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.119> bubble<00:02:00.960> up<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:02.840> remove<00:02:03.840> any<00:02:04.020> waste<00:02:04.290> out

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
do is bubble up and remove any waste out

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.440 
do is bubble up and remove any waste out
of<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.680> water<00:02:04.860> by<00:02:05.340> bonding<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.030> waste<00:02:06.240> with

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
of the water by bonding the waste with

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.020 
of the water by bonding the waste with
oxygen<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.829> also<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.160> would<00:02:08.280> have<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:09.000> know

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
oxygen it's also you would have you know

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.449 
oxygen it's also you would have you know
half<00:02:09.599> decent<00:02:10.080> water<00:02:10.229> flow<00:02:10.500> with<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.190> bit<00:02:11.370> of

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
half decent water flow with a bit of

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.070 
half decent water flow with a bit of
surface<00:02:11.700> agitation

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
surface agitation

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.580 
surface agitation
so<00:02:13.740> see<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.070> way<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.310> waters<00:02:14.610> agitating

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
so see the way the waters agitating

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.960 
so see the way the waters agitating
that's<00:02:16.590> what<00:02:16.740> gives<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.070> water<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.370> oxygen<00:02:17.400> I

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
that's what gives the water the oxygen I

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.970 
that's what gives the water the oxygen I
prefer<00:02:18.900> not<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.110> have<00:02:19.290> bubbles<00:02:19.680> with<00:02:19.860> them

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
prefer not to have bubbles with them

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.980 
prefer not to have bubbles with them
because<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:20.940> think<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.180> encourages<00:02:21.840> that

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
because I think that encourages that

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.160 
because I think that encourages that
being<00:02:22.200> caught<00:02:22.410> in<00:02:22.560> their<00:02:22.710> pouch<00:02:23.930> put<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:25.020> bit<00:02:25.140> of

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
being caught in their pouch put a bit of

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.800 
being caught in their pouch put a bit of
coral<00:02:25.470> sand<00:02:25.650> on<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.920> bottom<00:02:26.300> a<00:02:27.300> bit<00:02:27.510> of

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
coral sand on the bottom a bit of

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.980 
coral sand on the bottom a bit of
decoration<00:02:28.080> for<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.680> coral<00:02:29.010> for<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.490> fish<00:02:29.670> -

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
decoration for the coral for the fish -

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:36.130 
decoration for the coral for the fish -
for<00:02:30.990> them<00:02:31.110> for<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.560> seahorse<00:02:31.950> -<00:02:34.430> link<00:02:35.430> on<00:02:35.640> to

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
for them for the seahorse - link on to

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.050 
for them for the seahorse - link on to
so<00:02:37.140> this<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.470> dead<00:02:37.680> coral<00:02:38.070> which<00:02:38.460> is<00:02:38.490> obviously

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
so this is dead coral which is obviously

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.380 
so this is dead coral which is obviously
perfect<00:02:39.710> live<00:02:40.710> rocks<00:02:40.980> good<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:42.210> have<00:02:42.300> to

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
perfect live rocks good and you have to

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.910 
perfect live rocks good and you have to
be<00:02:42.480> very<00:02:42.600> careful<00:02:43.020> what<00:02:43.110> corals<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.620> put<00:02:43.800> with

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
be very careful what corals you put with

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.650 
be very careful what corals you put with
them<00:02:44.070> because<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.820> don't<00:02:44.940> want<00:02:45.240> them<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.540> get

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
them because you don't want them to get

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.440 
them because you don't want them to get
stung<00:02:45.930> by<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.170> corals<00:02:46.910> so<00:02:47.910> corals<00:02:48.240> aren't

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
stung by the corals so corals aren't

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.110 
stung by the corals so corals aren't
always<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.630> good<00:02:48.870> idea<00:02:49.140> with<00:02:49.260> them<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:50.120> there's

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
always a good idea with them and there's

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.520 
always a good idea with them and there's
very<00:02:51.330> limited<00:02:51.540> fish<00:02:51.960> you<00:02:52.110> can<00:02:52.230> have<00:02:52.380> with

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
very limited fish you can have with

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.380 
very limited fish you can have with
these<00:02:52.710> guys<00:02:52.950> generally<00:02:53.880> things<00:02:54.240> like

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
these guys generally things like

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.890 
these guys generally things like
pipefish<00:02:55.430> mandarin<00:02:56.430> fish<00:02:56.990> are<00:02:57.990> an<00:02:58.230> option

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.680 

and<00:03:02.200> other<00:03:02.739> than<00:03:02.890> that<00:03:03.010> you<00:03:03.250> just<00:03:03.280> keep<00:03:04.120> proper

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
and other than that you just keep proper

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.559 
and other than that you just keep proper
water<00:03:04.870> quality<00:03:05.260> you<00:03:05.980> can't<00:03:06.879> have<00:03:07.000> tropical<00:03:07.209> or

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
water quality you can't have tropical or

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.869 
water quality you can't have tropical or
cold<00:03:07.810> water<00:03:07.989> species<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:09.340> tropicals<00:03:09.790> are

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
cold water species so tropicals are

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.220 
cold water species so tropicals are
easier<00:03:10.180> because<00:03:10.360> it's<00:03:10.599> easier<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:10.959> control

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
easier because it's easier to control

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.350 
easier because it's easier to control
the<00:03:11.950> warmer<00:03:12.220> temperature<00:03:12.670> than<00:03:12.819> it<00:03:12.909> is<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.239> get
