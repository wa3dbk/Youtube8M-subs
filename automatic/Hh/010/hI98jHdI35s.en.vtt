let's<00:02:24.270> take<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.450> cheap<00:02:24.720> shortcut<00:02:25.500> here<00:02:25.770> with

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
let's take a cheap shortcut here with

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.070 
let's take a cheap shortcut here with
over<00:02:26.490> again<00:02:27.000> my<00:02:27.120> brother<00:02:27.180> can<00:02:27.450> see<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:27.959> he's

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
over again my brother can see it so he's

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.900 
over again my brother can see it so he's
probably<00:02:28.230> going<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.650> take<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:28.920> as<00:02:29.010> well<00:02:29.280> two

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
probably going to take it as well two

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.460 
probably going to take it as well two
minutes<00:02:30.270> sort<00:02:30.600> of<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.750> goal<00:02:30.959> we<00:02:31.110> can<00:02:31.140> try<00:02:31.410> and

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
minutes sort of a goal we can try and

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.810 
minutes sort of a goal we can try and
get<00:02:31.709> four<00:02:31.950> here<00:02:32.100> I<00:02:32.130> reckon<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.459> because<00:02:32.640> people

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
get four here I reckon it because people

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.610 
get four here I reckon it because people
eat<00:02:33.240> is<00:02:33.390> around<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.840> two-minute<00:02:34.290> mark<00:02:34.320> we've
