everyone<00:00:04.859> welcome<00:00:05.339> back<00:00:05.370> today<00:00:06.180> I've<00:00:06.270> been

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
everyone welcome back today I've been

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.270 
everyone welcome back today I've been
actually<00:00:06.660> asked<00:00:06.930> by<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.170> char<00:00:07.560> on<00:00:07.740> terms<00:00:07.980> of<00:00:08.160> the

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
actually asked by a char on terms of the

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.620 
actually asked by a char on terms of the
blueprints<00:00:08.700> that<00:00:08.730> there<00:00:09.000> might<00:00:09.179> be<00:00:09.240> some

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
blueprints that there might be some

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.770 
blueprints that there might be some
issues<00:00:10.019> in<00:00:10.260> terms<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.070> blueprints<00:00:11.519> that

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:11.780 
issues in terms of the blueprints that

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.450 
issues in terms of the blueprints that
being<00:00:12.780> some<00:00:13.290> bugs<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.799> did<00:00:13.950> take<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.219> look<00:00:14.370> at

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
being some bugs and I did take a look at

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.220 
being some bugs and I did take a look at
it<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:14.849> seems<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.240> char<00:00:15.450> yet<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:16.049> does

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
it and it seems the char yet it does

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.290 
it and it seems the char yet it does
seem<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.619> there<00:00:16.890> is<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.010> bug<00:00:17.220> so<00:00:17.910> when<00:00:18.119> you<00:00:18.210> do

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
seem that there is a bug so when you do

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.750 
seem that there is a bug so when you do
click<00:00:18.480> manage<00:00:18.779> blueprint<00:00:19.430> I'm<00:00:20.430> just<00:00:20.550> going<00:00:20.699> to

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
click manage blueprint I'm just going to

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.679 
click manage blueprint I'm just going to
go<00:00:20.850> through<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.240> everybody<00:00:21.539> else

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
go through it so everybody else

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:22.849 
go through it so everybody else
understands<00:00:22.109> how<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.320> works<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.710> then

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
understands how this works and then

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.679 
understands how this works and then
we're<00:00:22.980> going<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.130> get<00:00:23.250> into<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.550> details<00:00:23.939> so

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
we're going to get into the details so

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.240 
we're going to get into the details so
you're<00:00:25.050> obviously<00:00:25.289> going<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.560> have<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> maximum

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
you're obviously going to have a maximum

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.220 
you're obviously going to have a maximum
allocation<00:00:26.820> each<00:00:27.240> blueprint<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.869> course<00:00:28.080> has

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
allocation each blueprint of course has

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.500 
allocation each blueprint of course has
different<00:00:28.529> phases<00:00:28.710> now<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.789> each<00:00:30.240> phase<00:00:30.480> of

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
different phases now on each phase of

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.880 
different phases now on each phase of
course<00:00:30.810> has<00:00:30.960> different<00:00:31.260> requirements<00:00:31.349> and

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
course has different requirements and

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.010 
course has different requirements and
the<00:00:32.009> amount<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.250> tokens<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.700> require<00:00:33.059> for<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
the amount of tokens you require for the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.049 
the amount of tokens you require for the
blueprint<00:00:34.410> itself<00:00:34.739> now<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.850> amount

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
blueprint itself now this is the amount

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.170 
blueprint itself now this is the amount
of<00:00:36.239> resources<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.440> can<00:00:37.559> maximum<00:00:38.190> allocate<00:00:38.730> to

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
of resources you can maximum allocate to

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.049 
of resources you can maximum allocate to
the<00:00:40.079> blueprint<00:00:40.500> itself<00:00:40.829> as<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:41.940> see

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
the blueprint itself as you can see

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.150 
the blueprint itself as you can see
currently<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.629> can<00:00:43.079> only<00:00:43.320> allocate<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
currently I can only allocate it the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.560 
currently I can only allocate it the
only<00:00:44.280> one<00:00:44.550> that's<00:00:44.730> missing<00:00:44.879> as<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.270> do<00:00:45.390> see

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
only one that's missing as you do see

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.029 
only one that's missing as you do see
the<00:00:45.690> rest<00:00:45.809> are<00:00:46.020> finished<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.500> can<00:00:46.890> only

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
the rest are finished I can only

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.979 
the rest are finished I can only
allocate<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> maximum<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.300> ten<00:00:48.660> skilled

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
allocate a maximum of ten skilled

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.420 
allocate a maximum of ten skilled
workers<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:50.000> my<00:00:51.620> 20s<00:00:52.620> skilled<00:00:52.980> workers<00:00:53.399> a

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
workers to my 20s skilled workers a

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.939 
workers to my 20s skilled workers a
blueprint<00:00:53.969> for<00:00:54.270> Phase<00:00:54.480> three<00:00:54.739> again<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.890> is

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
blueprint for Phase three again this is

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.910 
blueprint for Phase three again this is
really<00:00:56.160> weird<00:00:56.340> because<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.629> did<00:00:58.199> haven't

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
really weird because I did haven't

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.650 
really weird because I did haven't
really<00:00:58.980> paid<00:00:59.190> attention<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.730> much<00:00:59.969> but<00:01:00.239> I

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
really paid attention to it much but I

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.939 
really paid attention to it much but I
would<00:01:01.199> presume<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.829> maximum

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
would presume that the maximum

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.640 
would presume that the maximum
allocation<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.699> would<00:01:03.210> be<00:01:03.359> twenty<00:01:03.719> as<00:01:03.870> i<00:01:04.589> do

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
allocation I would be twenty as i do

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.649 
allocation I would be twenty as i do
have<00:01:04.890> 20<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.400> but<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.970> might<00:01:06.180> be<00:01:06.210> because<00:01:06.420> a

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
have 20 here but that might be because a

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.090 
have 20 here but that might be because a
percentage<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.229> its<00:01:07.380> already<00:01:07.710> complete

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
percentage of its already complete

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.399 
percentage of its already complete
that's<00:01:08.369> why<00:01:08.520> there<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.180> reduced<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:09.869> it

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
that's why there it is reduced but it

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.660 
that's why there it is reduced but it
still<00:01:10.650> seems<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.979> little<00:01:11.070> bit<00:01:11.220> odd<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.460> i

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
still seems a little bit odd that i

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.219 
still seems a little bit odd that i
can't<00:01:11.909> allocate<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.420> maximum<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.110> have

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
can't allocate the maximum that you have

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.109 
can't allocate the maximum that you have
here<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.590> technically<00:01:13.979> how<00:01:14.700> much<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.030> can

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
here so technically how much you can

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.850 
here so technically how much you can
allocate<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.689> actual<00:01:16.020> blueprint<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.530> here<00:01:16.740> so

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
allocate the actual blueprint is here so

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.649 
allocate the actual blueprint is here so
always<00:01:17.040> look<00:01:17.280> at<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> numbers<00:01:17.850> here<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.270> this

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
always look at the numbers here and this

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.240 
always look at the numbers here and this
is<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.930> maximum<00:01:19.320> i<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.380> allocate<00:01:19.860> as<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.100> can

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
is the maximum i can allocate as you can

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.649 
is the maximum i can allocate as you can
see<00:01:20.400> i<00:01:20.430> can<00:01:20.580> only<00:01:20.790> allocate<00:01:21.180> ten<00:01:21.390> skilled

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
see i can only allocate ten skilled

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.690 
see i can only allocate ten skilled
workers<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.560> there's<00:01:22.770> no<00:01:22.890> point<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.189> importing

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
workers so there's no point in importing

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.760 
workers so there's no point in importing
or<00:01:23.820> building<00:01:24.180> my<00:01:24.750> skilled<00:01:25.049> workers<00:01:25.380> more<00:01:25.590> than

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
or building my skilled workers more than

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.149 
or building my skilled workers more than
10<00:01:26.009> tokens<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.600> i'll<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:27.840> make<00:01:28.200> 10<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.890> i<00:01:28.979> can

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
10 tokens so i'll just make 10 and i can

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.219 
10 tokens so i'll just make 10 and i can
only<00:01:29.250> allocate<00:01:29.790> 10<00:01:30.150> which<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> pretty

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
only allocate 10 which is a pretty

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.260 
only allocate 10 which is a pretty
ironic<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:31.829> even<00:01:32.070> if<00:01:32.159> i<00:01:32.250> do<00:01:32.310> import<00:01:32.759> as<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.150> do

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
ironic so even if i do import as you do

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.700 
ironic so even if i do import as you do
see<00:01:33.479> let<00:01:33.689> me<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:33.930> take<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.079> look<00:01:34.200> at<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.380> tab<00:01:34.560> i

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
see let me just take a look at the tab i

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.830 
see let me just take a look at the tab i
do<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:35.040> passed<00:01:35.430> passengers<00:01:36.180> skilled

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
do have passed passengers skilled

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.810 
do have passed passengers skilled
workers<00:01:37.170> 0<00:01:37.409> but<00:01:37.680> let's<00:01:37.890> say<00:01:38.040> if<00:01:38.159> i<00:01:38.250> do<00:01:38.310> import

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
workers 0 but let's say if i do import

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.640 
workers 0 but let's say if i do import
it<00:01:39.150> won't<00:01:39.600> show<00:01:39.810> up<00:01:39.930> at<00:01:40.079> all<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.409> i<00:01:40.439> presume

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
it won't show up at all so i presume

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.020 
it won't show up at all so i presume
this<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.009> what's<00:01:41.220> happening<00:01:41.369> with<00:01:41.700> your

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
this is what's happening with your

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.340 
this is what's happening with your
importing<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> skilled<00:01:42.869> workers<00:01:43.110> which<00:01:43.259> I

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
importing the skilled workers which I

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.050 
importing the skilled workers which I
told<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.740> do<00:01:43.829> which<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.009> correct<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.939> do

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
told you to do which is correct you do

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.280 
told you to do which is correct you do
import<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.810> stuff<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.259> need

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
import the stuff that you need

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.050 
import the stuff that you need
especially<00:01:46.680> when<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.070> have<00:01:47.220> what<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.700> do<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.970> I

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
especially when you have what I do is I

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.910 
especially when you have what I do is I
important<00:01:48.420> money<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:49.049> town<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.649> needed

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
important money to town that I needed

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.620 
important money to town that I needed
from<00:01:50.040> from<00:01:50.280> my<00:01:50.399> money<00:01:50.549> town<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.000> then<00:01:51.450> from

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
from from my money town and then from

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.969 
from from my money town and then from
that<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:52.049> import<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.470> resources<00:01:52.860> from

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
that I just import to resources from

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.469 
that I just import to resources from
Omnicorp<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.610> substantially<00:01:54.090> much<00:01:54.270> quicker

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
Omnicorp it substantially much quicker

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.149 
Omnicorp it substantially much quicker
and<00:01:54.689> easier<00:01:54.780> then<00:01:55.560> building<00:01:55.950> up<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
and easier then building up the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.980 
and easier then building up the
resources<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:56.790> your<00:01:56.820> town<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.329> support<00:01:57.450> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
resources in your town to support the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.010 
resources in your town to support the
actual<00:01:58.610> blueprint<00:01:59.610> but<00:02:00.299> again<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.840> my

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
actual blueprint but again this is my

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.359 
actual blueprint but again this is my
opinion<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.590> know<00:02:01.710> if<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.890> want<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.100> build<00:02:02.250> it

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
opinion you know if you want to build it

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.270 
opinion you know if you want to build it
go<00:02:03.299> ahead<00:02:03.479> as<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.780> do<00:02:03.930> see<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.140> did<00:02:04.380> import<00:02:04.740> now

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
go ahead as you do see I did import now

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.069 
go ahead as you do see I did import now
the<00:02:05.340> passengers<00:02:05.939> passengers<00:02:06.390> i<00:02:06.420> have<00:02:06.659> 9<00:02:06.869> but

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
the passengers passengers i have 9 but

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.589 
the passengers passengers i have 9 but
it<00:02:07.560> doesn't<00:02:07.860> show<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.250> technically<00:02:08.700> the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
it doesn't show so technically the

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.930 
it doesn't show so technically the
assigned<00:02:09.929> tokens<00:02:10.259> only<00:02:10.560> catches<00:02:11.009> when<00:02:11.550> your

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
assigned tokens only catches when your

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.309 
assigned tokens only catches when your
actual

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
actual

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.470 
actual
you<00:02:13.739> can<00:02:13.890> say<00:02:14.040> maximum<00:02:14.489> tokens<00:02:14.819> is<00:02:14.909> above<00:02:15.150> the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
you can say maximum tokens is above the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.059 
you can say maximum tokens is above the
requirements<00:02:16.319> so<00:02:16.439> for<00:02:16.620> example<00:02:16.680> I've

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
requirements so for example I've

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.819 
requirements so for example I've
allocated<00:02:17.280> 10<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.989> maximum<00:02:19.349> allocation<00:02:19.739> is

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
allocated 10 the maximum allocation is

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.309 
allocated 10 the maximum allocation is
10<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.219> that's<00:02:20.400> why<00:02:20.579> it<00:02:20.639> won't<00:02:21.060> detect<00:02:21.930> the

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
10 so that's why it won't detect the

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.080 
10 so that's why it won't detect the
additional<00:02:22.769> nine<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.159> I<00:02:23.219> have<00:02:23.370> if<00:02:23.670> the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
additional nine that I have if the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.809 
additional nine that I have if the
maximum<00:02:24.659> allocation<00:02:25.079> was<00:02:25.200> 19<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:26.459> would<00:02:26.639> show

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
maximum allocation was 19 it would show

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.330 
maximum allocation was 19 it would show
me<00:02:26.969> the<00:02:27.090> additional<00:02:27.510> nine<00:02:27.959> tokens<00:02:28.439> year<00:02:28.709> so

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
me the additional nine tokens year so

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.920 
me the additional nine tokens year so
this<00:02:29.730> is<00:02:29.760> practically<00:02:30.209> it<00:02:30.329> in<00:02:30.480> terms<00:02:30.659> of<00:02:30.810> the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
this is practically it in terms of the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.690 
this is practically it in terms of the
blueprint<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.439> yes<00:02:31.829> I<00:02:32.099> do<00:02:32.159> believe<00:02:32.459> it's<00:02:32.639> a

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
blueprint and yes I do believe it's a

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.209 
blueprint and yes I do believe it's a
bug<00:02:32.879> now<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.930> could<00:02:34.109> be<00:02:34.170> one<00:02:34.500> above<00:02:34.769> as<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.040> did

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:35.219 
bug now it could be one above as I did

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:37.190 
bug now it could be one above as I did
say<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.609> it<00:02:36.329> might<00:02:36.510> be<00:02:36.659> because<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:37.019> do<00:02:37.170> have

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
say to it might be because you do have

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.530 
say to it might be because you do have
maybe<00:02:37.530> percentage<00:02:38.010> complete<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.639> that's<00:02:39.299> why

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
maybe percentage complete and that's why

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.659 
maybe percentage complete and that's why
it<00:02:39.599> doesn't<00:02:40.079> assign<00:02:40.379> 20<00:02:40.919> tokens<00:02:41.280> which<00:02:41.430> it

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:41.669 
it doesn't assign 20 tokens which it

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:43.879 
it doesn't assign 20 tokens which it
should<00:02:41.939> actually<00:02:42.209> say<00:02:42.719> I'm<00:02:43.230> confused<00:02:43.709> why

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
should actually say I'm confused why

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.119 
should actually say I'm confused why
that<00:02:44.159> isn't<00:02:44.340> happening<00:02:44.489> or<00:02:44.939> or<00:02:45.599> I<00:02:45.829> do<00:02:46.829> have<00:02:47.099> a

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
that isn't happening or or I do have a

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.330 
that isn't happening or or I do have a
third<00:02:48.030> sort<00:02:48.419> of<00:02:48.569> explanation<00:02:49.379> for<00:02:49.919> this<00:02:50.069> why

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
third sort of explanation for this why

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.330 
third sort of explanation for this why
it<00:02:50.400> might<00:02:50.790> be<00:02:50.969> like<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.269> maybe<00:02:52.129> they<00:02:53.129> put<00:02:53.310> a

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
it might be like this maybe they put a

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.619 
it might be like this maybe they put a
limit<00:02:53.519> of<00:02:53.669> how<00:02:53.849> much<00:02:53.969> you<00:02:54.120> can<00:02:54.239> actually

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
limit of how much you can actually

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.170 
limit of how much you can actually
import<00:02:55.469> the<00:02:55.829> tokens<00:02:56.310> which<00:02:56.639> you<00:02:56.760> can<00:02:56.879> assign

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
import the tokens which you can assign

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.520 
import the tokens which you can assign
to<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.629> blueprints<00:02:58.019> maybe<00:02:58.169> you<00:02:58.260> can<00:02:58.379> only

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
to the blueprints maybe you can only

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.500 
to the blueprints maybe you can only
import<00:02:58.889> fifty<00:02:59.579> percent<00:02:59.849> of<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.180> tokens

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
import fifty percent of the tokens

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.179 
import fifty percent of the tokens
required<00:03:00.840> for<00:03:01.019> blueprints<00:03:01.439> you<00:03:01.889> know<00:03:02.010> but<00:03:02.159> I

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189 
required for blueprints you know but I

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:03.379 
required for blueprints you know but I
don't<00:03:02.370> think<00:03:02.430> that's<00:03:02.639> true<00:03:02.819> because<00:03:03.090> in<00:03:03.269> my

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
don't think that's true because in my

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:04.699 
don't think that's true because in my
other<00:03:03.540> town<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:03.810> literally<00:03:04.260> imported

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
other town I literally imported

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.649 
other town I literally imported
everything<00:03:04.829> you<00:03:05.519> know<00:03:05.639> fifty<00:03:06.000> oil<00:03:06.180> forty

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
everything you know fifty oil forty

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.449 
everything you know fifty oil forty
manufacturing<00:03:07.379> you<00:03:07.500> know<00:03:07.620> when<00:03:08.099> I<00:03:08.129> was<00:03:08.250> doing

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
manufacturing you know when I was doing

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.949 
manufacturing you know when I was doing
it<00:03:08.519> for<00:03:08.730> my<00:03:08.849> agriculture<00:03:09.419> town<00:03:09.629> which<00:03:09.780> had

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
it for my agriculture town which had

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.110 
it for my agriculture town which had
really<00:03:10.290> really<00:03:10.379> massive<00:03:10.859> blueprints<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:11.909> I<00:03:11.939> do

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
really really massive blueprints so I do

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.339 
really really massive blueprints so I do
believe<00:03:12.389> this<00:03:12.540> is<00:03:12.659> a<00:03:12.689> bug<00:03:12.900> for<00:03:13.049> some<00:03:13.230> odd

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
believe this is a bug for some odd

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.800 
believe this is a bug for some odd
reason<00:03:13.639> the<00:03:14.639> actual<00:03:15.000> maximum<00:03:15.359> allocation

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
reason the actual maximum allocation

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.499 
reason the actual maximum allocation
doesn't<00:03:16.079> count<00:03:16.769> or<00:03:17.340> isn't<00:03:18.090> equal<00:03:18.299> to<00:03:18.449> the

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:18.509 
doesn't count or isn't equal to the

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:20.149 
doesn't count or isn't equal to the
actual<00:03:18.629> number<00:03:18.900> acquired<00:03:19.290> here<00:03:19.650> by<00:03:19.829> the<00:03:19.889> phase

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
actual number acquired here by the phase

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.640 
actual number acquired here by the phase
three<00:03:20.989> unfortunately<00:03:21.989> these<00:03:22.139> have<00:03:22.439> finished

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
three unfortunately these have finished

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.550 
three unfortunately these have finished
so<00:03:22.949> I<00:03:23.569> couldn't<00:03:24.569> take<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.900> look<00:03:25.139> at<00:03:25.259> the<00:03:25.530> other

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
so I couldn't take a look at the other

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.710 
so I couldn't take a look at the other
numbers<00:03:25.979> by<00:03:26.129> yeah<00:03:26.310> this<00:03:26.909> pretty<00:03:27.329> much<00:03:27.419> does

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
numbers by yeah this pretty much does

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.420 
numbers by yeah this pretty much does
confirm<00:03:27.989> what<00:03:28.169> you<00:03:28.290> did<00:03:28.439> say<00:03:28.620> it<00:03:28.829> seems<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.400> be

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
confirm what you did say it seems to be

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.949 
confirm what you did say it seems to be
a<00:03:29.519> little<00:03:29.639> bit<00:03:29.819> bugged<00:03:30.000> out<00:03:30.150> well<00:03:30.359> all<00:03:30.780> you

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
a little bit bugged out well all you

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.030 
a little bit bugged out well all you
have<00:03:31.079> to<00:03:31.199> reduce<00:03:31.409> look<00:03:31.620> at<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.739> maximum

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
have to reduce look at the maximum

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.509 
have to reduce look at the maximum
allocation<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:32.669> I<00:03:33.739> just<00:03:34.739> import<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.400> the

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
allocation and I just import to the

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.129 
allocation and I just import to the
number<00:03:35.759> in<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.060> maximum<00:03:36.599> allocation<00:03:36.989> don't

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
number in the maximum allocation don't

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.420 
number in the maximum allocation don't
even<00:03:37.290> bother<00:03:37.409> looking<00:03:37.620> at<00:03:37.859> this<00:03:37.979> because<00:03:38.250> it

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
even bother looking at this because it

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.740 
even bother looking at this because it
doesn't<00:03:38.699> seem<00:03:38.819> to<00:03:38.970> be<00:03:39.060> equaled<00:03:39.329> out<00:03:39.419> to<00:03:39.599> that

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
doesn't seem to be equaled out to that

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.689 
doesn't seem to be equaled out to that
so<00:03:40.229> just<00:03:40.439> import<00:03:40.829> the<00:03:40.889> maximum<00:03:41.250> allocation

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
so just import the maximum allocation

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:43.640 
so just import the maximum allocation
here<00:03:41.909> make<00:03:42.449> sure<00:03:42.479> you<00:03:42.720> have<00:03:42.840> surplus<00:03:43.290> as<00:03:43.439> I<00:03:43.470> did

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
here make sure you have surplus as I did

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.050 
here make sure you have surplus as I did
mention<00:03:43.859> make<00:03:44.099> sure<00:03:44.250> that<00:03:44.489> this<00:03:44.579> number<00:03:44.790> is

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
mention make sure that this number is

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.809 
mention make sure that this number is
equal<00:03:45.689> to<00:03:46.049> this<00:03:46.139> number<00:03:46.470> here<00:03:46.709> so<00:03:47.310> once<00:03:47.549> you<00:03:47.699> do

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
equal to this number here so once you do

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.759 
equal to this number here so once you do
have<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.569> surplus<00:03:48.959> then<00:03:49.259> you<00:03:49.439> should<00:03:49.650> be

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
have that surplus then you should be

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.530 
have that surplus then you should be
able<00:03:49.919> to<00:03:50.220> it<00:03:50.639> should<00:03:50.819> pop<00:03:50.970> up<00:03:51.030> here<00:03:51.329> and<00:03:51.389> you

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
able to it should pop up here and you

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.729 
able to it should pop up here and you
should<00:03:51.689> be<00:03:51.810> able<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:52.109> then<00:03:52.229> drag<00:03:52.439> it<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:52.650> drop

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
should be able to then drag it and drop

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.860 
should be able to then drag it and drop
it<00:03:52.889> into<00:03:53.189> the<00:03:53.340> allocation<00:03:53.909> and<00:03:54.030> assign<00:03:54.720> the

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
it into the allocation and assign the

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.879 
it into the allocation and assign the
token<00:03:55.229> so<00:03:55.500> that's<00:03:56.219> pretty<00:03:56.639> much<00:03:56.729> it<00:03:57.769> now<00:03:58.769> of

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
token so that's pretty much it now of

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.259 
token so that's pretty much it now of
course<00:03:58.919> keep<00:03:59.519> in<00:03:59.639> mind<00:03:59.669> you<00:03:59.909> don't<00:04:00.000> have<00:04:00.150> to

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
course keep in mind you don't have to

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.539 
course keep in mind you don't have to
obviously<00:04:00.389> assign<00:04:00.810> all<00:04:00.989> ten<00:04:01.310> you<00:04:02.310> don't<00:04:02.459> have

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
obviously assign all ten you don't have

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.249 
obviously assign all ten you don't have
to<00:04:02.639> sign<00:04:02.819> all<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.239> tokens<00:04:03.719> that<00:04:03.959> you<00:04:04.139> can

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:04.259 
to sign all the tokens that you can

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:06.679 
to sign all the tokens that you can
maximally<00:04:05.030> allocate<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.299> actual<00:04:06.599> a

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:06.689 
maximally allocate to the actual a

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:08.390 
maximally allocate to the actual a
blueprint<00:04:07.229> as<00:04:07.439> you<00:04:07.530> do<00:04:07.650> see<00:04:07.829> I<00:04:07.859> don't<00:04:08.099> have<00:04:08.250> the

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
blueprint as you do see I don't have the

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.339 
blueprint as you do see I don't have the
maximum<00:04:08.759> allocated<00:04:09.239> here<00:04:09.419> you<00:04:09.900> can<00:04:10.139> assign

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
maximum allocated here you can assign

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:11.839 
maximum allocated here you can assign
obviously<00:04:10.739> less<00:04:10.919> I<00:04:11.039> could<00:04:11.189> assign<00:04:11.400> just<00:04:11.639> one

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
obviously less I could assign just one

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.990 
obviously less I could assign just one
as<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.590> one<00:04:13.590> for<00:04:13.799> my<00:04:13.919> skilled<00:04:14.189> and<00:04:14.489> as<00:04:14.789> you<00:04:14.879> do

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
as a one for my skilled and as you do

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.490 
as a one for my skilled and as you do
see<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.209> did<00:04:15.389> assign<00:04:15.629> a<00:04:15.659> minimum<00:04:16.019> before<00:04:16.139> it<00:04:16.409> was

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
see I did assign a minimum before it was

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.860 
see I did assign a minimum before it was
one<00:04:16.739> that's<00:04:16.979> why<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.870> percentage

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
one that's why the the percentage

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.300 
one that's why the the percentage
complete<00:04:19.079> was<00:04:19.289> only<00:04:19.440> 35<00:04:19.829> while<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.190> other

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
complete was only 35 while the other

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.009 
complete was only 35 while the other
ones<00:04:20.459> are<00:04:20.549> to<00:04:20.669> put<00:04:20.789> literally<00:04:21.329> nearly<00:04:21.570> maximum

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
ones are to put literally nearly maximum

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.920 
ones are to put literally nearly maximum
now<00:04:22.560> also<00:04:22.770> for<00:04:23.550> some<00:04:23.699> odd<00:04:23.849> reason<00:04:23.880> I<00:04:24.389> did

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
now also for some odd reason I did

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.600 
now also for some odd reason I did
complete<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.289> other<00:04:25.529> ones<00:04:25.710> as<00:04:25.889> it<00:04:26.250> does<00:04:26.370> seem

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
complete the other ones as it does seem

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.170 
complete the other ones as it does seem
to<00:04:26.639> be<00:04:26.760> a<00:04:26.880> little<00:04:26.969> bit

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
to be a little bit

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.140 
to be a little bit
buggy<00:04:27.360> and<00:04:27.660> if<00:04:27.810> i<00:04:27.930> do<00:04:27.990> just<00:04:28.320> remove<00:04:28.650> these<00:04:29.150> and

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
buggy and if i do just remove these and

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.560 
buggy and if i do just remove these and
i<00:04:30.210> click<00:04:30.419> assign<00:04:30.720> token<00:04:31.169> and<00:04:31.800> i<00:04:31.919> go<00:04:32.070> back<00:04:32.570> and

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
i click assign token and i go back and

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.439 
i click assign token and i go back and
they<00:04:33.690> do<00:04:33.810> finally<00:04:34.229> vanish<00:04:34.650> so<00:04:35.240> when<00:04:36.240> you<00:04:36.330> do

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
they do finally vanish so when you do

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.600 
they do finally vanish so when you do
finish<00:04:36.720> one<00:04:36.930> stage<00:04:37.229> and<00:04:37.530> you<00:04:38.070> go<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.430> next

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
finish one stage and you go to the next

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.909 
finish one stage and you go to the next
stage<00:04:39.020> some<00:04:40.020> of<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.259> resources<00:04:40.560> that<00:04:40.800> you

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
stage some of the resources that you

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.379 
stage some of the resources that you
have<00:04:41.009> left<00:04:41.280> in<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.460> previous<00:04:41.729> stage<00:04:41.910> do<00:04:42.180> stay

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
have left in the previous stage do stay

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.090 
have left in the previous stage do stay
assigned<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:42.900> it<00:04:43.020> so<00:04:43.440> if<00:04:43.530> you<00:04:43.650> don't<00:04:43.740> want<00:04:43.830> free

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
assigned to it so if you don't want free

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.469 
assigned to it so if you don't want free
up<00:04:44.190> the<00:04:44.310> resources<00:04:44.940> because<00:04:45.360> you're

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
up the resources because you're

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:46.550 
up the resources because you're
importing<00:04:45.750> them<00:04:45.990> and<00:04:46.110> you're<00:04:46.199> paying<00:04:46.350> money

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
importing them and you're paying money

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.499 
importing them and you're paying money
for<00:04:46.650> them<00:04:46.919> it's<00:04:47.610> so<00:04:47.729> good<00:04:47.910> to<00:04:47.940> remove<00:04:48.270> them<00:04:48.389> and

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
for them it's so good to remove them and

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.029 
for them it's so good to remove them and
assign<00:04:48.780> it<00:04:48.810> again<00:04:49.139> just<00:04:49.350> so<00:04:49.410> you<00:04:49.560> assign<00:04:49.830> their

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
assign it again just so you assign their

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.909 
assign it again just so you assign their
required<00:04:50.370> you<00:04:51.120> can<00:04:51.150> say<00:04:51.479> a<00:04:51.889> requirement<00:04:52.889> for

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
required you can say a requirement for

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.550 
required you can say a requirement for
this<00:04:53.160> do<00:04:53.520> see<00:04:53.699> now<00:04:53.820> it's<00:04:53.970> 40<00:04:54.150> so<00:04:54.780> I<00:04:54.810> have

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
this do see now it's 40 so I have

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.350 
this do see now it's 40 so I have
unallocated<00:04:55.979> the<00:04:56.520> additional<00:04:56.940> resources

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
unallocated the additional resources

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.879 
unallocated the additional resources
that<00:04:57.509> are<00:04:57.570> needed<00:04:57.690> for<00:04:57.810> other<00:04:58.080> ones<00:04:58.259> now<00:04:58.800> I'm

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
that are needed for other ones now I'm

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.800 
that are needed for other ones now I'm
going<00:04:58.979> to<00:04:59.070> stop<00:04:59.250> importing<00:04:59.729> them<00:04:59.880> and<00:05:00.120> if<00:05:00.330> by

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
going to stop importing them and if by

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.360 
going to stop importing them and if by
any<00:05:00.960> chance<00:05:01.020> I'm<00:05:01.410> actually<00:05:01.650> producing<00:05:02.280> those

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
any chance I'm actually producing those

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.159 
any chance I'm actually producing those
additional<00:05:02.759> resources<00:05:03.210> I'm<00:05:03.780> going<00:05:03.990> to<00:05:04.080> delete

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
additional resources I'm going to delete

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.950 
additional resources I'm going to delete
them<00:05:04.470> oh<00:05:04.590> and<00:05:04.860> before<00:05:05.430> I<00:05:05.610> go<00:05:05.820> I<00:05:06.000> presume<00:05:06.870> it

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
them oh and before I go I presume it

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.480 
them oh and before I go I presume it
what<00:05:07.080> you're<00:05:07.199> saying<00:05:07.410> you<00:05:07.530> did<00:05:07.680> import<00:05:08.070> as<00:05:08.280> I

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
what you're saying you did import as I

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.240 
what you're saying you did import as I
did<00:05:08.669> show<00:05:08.820> you<00:05:08.880> here<00:05:09.150> it<00:05:09.300> is<00:05:09.419> import<00:05:09.750> nine

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
did show you here it is import nine

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.110 
did show you here it is import nine
additional<00:05:11.250> so<00:05:11.370> for<00:05:11.550> example<00:05:11.610> now<00:05:11.970> i'm

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
additional so for example now i'm

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.029 
additional so for example now i'm
importing<00:05:12.360> 19<00:05:12.930> you<00:05:13.080> can<00:05:13.229> say<00:05:13.380> in<00:05:13.470> some<00:05:13.650> way<00:05:13.800> and

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
importing 19 you can say in some way and

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.129 
importing 19 you can say in some way and
a<00:05:14.520> 10<00:05:14.699> of<00:05:14.789> them<00:05:14.940> are<00:05:15.120> assigned<00:05:15.479> to<00:05:15.780> the<00:05:15.900> maximum

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
a 10 of them are assigned to the maximum

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:17.810 
a 10 of them are assigned to the maximum
allocation<00:05:16.650> and<00:05:16.770> why<00:05:17.039> it's<00:05:17.250> not<00:05:17.370> assigning

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
allocation and why it's not assigning

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.960 
allocation and why it's not assigning
the<00:05:17.910> other<00:05:18.030> nine<00:05:19.220> as<00:05:20.220> you<00:05:20.400> do<00:05:20.520> see<00:05:20.669> it's<00:05:20.759> bugged

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
the other nine as you do see it's bugged

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.120 
the other nine as you do see it's bugged
out<00:05:21.120> now<00:05:21.300> if<00:05:21.780> by<00:05:22.500> any<00:05:22.650> chance<00:05:22.710> you're

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
out now if by any chance you're

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.620 
out now if by any chance you're
importing<00:05:23.460> the<00:05:23.669> actual<00:05:23.910> resource<00:05:24.300> it<00:05:24.479> means

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
importing the actual resource it means

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.850 
importing the actual resource it means
the<00:05:24.720> maximum<00:05:24.870> allocation<00:05:25.440> I<00:05:25.500> don't<00:05:25.620> know<00:05:25.680> for

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
the maximum allocation I don't know for

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.999 
the maximum allocation I don't know for
example<00:05:25.949> you<00:05:26.340> needed<00:05:27.380> manufacturing<00:05:28.380> okay

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
example you needed manufacturing okay

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.000 
example you needed manufacturing okay
and<00:05:29.240> the<00:05:30.240> manufacturing<00:05:30.930> it's<00:05:31.380> showing<00:05:31.860> you

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
and the manufacturing it's showing you

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.820 
and the manufacturing it's showing you
let's<00:05:32.190> say<00:05:32.310> 10<00:05:32.580> and<00:05:32.849> you're<00:05:33.510> importing<00:05:34.020> the

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
let's say 10 and you're importing the

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.040 
let's say 10 and you're importing the
manufacturing<00:05:35.580> 10<00:05:35.820> let's<00:05:36.060> go<00:05:36.180> to<00:05:36.240> freight<00:05:36.570> and

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
manufacturing 10 let's go to freight and

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.540 
manufacturing 10 let's go to freight and
you're<00:05:37.229> importing<00:05:37.500> manufacturing<00:05:38.250> 10<00:05:38.430> you

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
you're importing manufacturing 10 you

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.520 
you're importing manufacturing 10 you
have<00:05:38.699> a<00:05:38.729> 10<00:05:38.970> here<00:05:39.240> but<00:05:39.810> it's<00:05:39.960> not<00:05:40.020> showing<00:05:40.349> and

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
have a 10 here but it's not showing and

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.750 
have a 10 here but it's not showing and
available<00:05:40.830> tokens<00:05:41.159> then<00:05:41.280> he<00:05:41.370> adds<00:05:41.490> bugged

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
available tokens then he adds bugged

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.610 
available tokens then he adds bugged
because<00:05:42.449> they're<00:05:42.810> literally<00:05:43.050> it<00:05:43.229> should<00:05:43.409> show

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
because they're literally it should show

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.560 
because they're literally it should show
and<00:05:43.889> you're<00:05:44.280> available<00:05:44.580> tokens<00:05:45.060> which<00:05:45.360> means

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
and you're available tokens which means

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:46.909 
and you're available tokens which means
then<00:05:45.690> you<00:05:45.780> can<00:05:45.900> drag<00:05:46.020> and<00:05:46.169> drop<00:05:46.320> it<00:05:46.590> for<00:05:46.740> the

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
then you can drag and drop it for the

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:49.339 
then you can drag and drop it for the
allocation<00:05:47.430> so<00:05:47.639> I<00:05:47.820> hope<00:05:48.720> that<00:05:48.810> didn't<00:05:49.139> happen

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:49.349 
allocation so I hope that didn't happen

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.480 
allocation so I hope that didn't happen
to<00:05:49.409> you<00:05:49.470> if<00:05:49.590> you<00:05:49.650> did<00:05:49.800> that<00:05:49.830> it's<00:05:50.130> bug<00:05:50.280> because

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
to you if you did that it's bug because

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.189 
to you if you did that it's bug because
literally<00:05:50.820> it<00:05:50.970> should<00:05:51.120> show<00:05:51.300> it<00:05:51.539> should<00:05:52.020> show

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 
literally it should show it should show

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.710 
literally it should show it should show
it<00:05:52.409> should<00:05:52.889> show<00:05:53.099> the<00:05:53.310> maximum<00:05:53.909> allocate<00:05:54.690> a

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
it should show the maximum allocate a

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.540 
it should show the maximum allocate a
token<00:05:55.080> so<00:05:55.260> and<00:05:55.590> no<00:05:55.949> matter<00:05:56.099> how<00:05:56.310> much<00:05:56.460> you

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
token so and no matter how much you

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.600 
token so and no matter how much you
import<00:05:56.880> as<00:05:57.030> if<00:05:57.599> it<00:05:57.840> reaches<00:05:58.199> the<00:05:58.320> number<00:05:58.610> here

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
import as if it reaches the number here

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.159 
import as if it reaches the number here
it<00:05:59.820> should<00:05:59.970> show<00:06:00.150> up<00:06:00.180> and<00:06:00.449> available<00:06:00.659> tokens

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
it should show up and available tokens

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:02.779 
it should show up and available tokens
if<00:06:01.320> you<00:06:01.710> have<00:06:01.800> zero<00:06:02.130> here<00:06:02.340> then<00:06:02.520> you<00:06:02.610> don't

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789 
if you have zero here then you don't

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:04.189 
if you have zero here then you don't
need<00:06:02.909> it<00:06:03.030> so<00:06:03.570> all<00:06:03.720> you<00:06:03.750> got<00:06:03.930> to<00:06:04.020> do<00:06:04.080> is<00:06:04.110> just

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 
need it so all you got to do is just

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:05.600 
need it so all you got to do is just
import<00:06:04.710> the<00:06:04.800> tokens<00:06:05.130> that<00:06:05.159> you<00:06:05.310> have<00:06:05.430> in<00:06:05.520> the

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
import the tokens that you have in the
