you obviously can't see his face very
clearly<00:00:52.690> and<00:00:53.230> if<00:00:53.320> you<00:00:53.440> listen<00:00:53.620> to<00:00:53.800> the<00:00:53.980> guy<00:00:54.159> it

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
clearly and if you listen to the guy it

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:56.549 
clearly and if you listen to the guy it
says<00:00:54.879> that<00:00:55.059> just<00:00:55.269> takes<00:00:55.479> one<00:00:55.750> take<00:00:56.019> remain<00:00:56.350> but

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.380 
there where the arrows pointing there's
actually<00:01:17.710> blood<00:01:18.039> so<00:01:18.490> they<00:01:18.670> didn't<00:01:18.970> shoot<00:01:19.240> him

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
actually blood so they didn't shoot him

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.700 
actually blood so they didn't shoot him
in<00:01:19.509> the<00:01:19.539> head<00:01:19.659> um<00:01:20.350> it<00:01:21.250> wasn't<00:01:21.520> really<00:01:22.090> any

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
in the head um it wasn't really any

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.350 
in the head um it wasn't really any
quote<00:01:23.710> he<00:01:24.220> could<00:01:24.460> have<00:01:24.580> died<00:01:24.759> from<00:01:24.789> it<00:01:25.179> but

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
quote he could have died from it but

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.960 
quote he could have died from it but
then<00:01:26.020> if<00:01:26.140> you<00:01:26.229> noticed<00:01:26.619> they<00:01:26.830> pour<00:01:27.069> gas<00:01:27.340> on<00:01:27.369> you

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
then if you noticed they pour gas on you

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.380 
then if you noticed they pour gas on you
but<00:01:28.390> not<00:01:28.569> as<00:01:28.810> much<00:01:29.080> as<00:01:29.140> they<00:01:29.470> do<00:01:29.530> on<00:01:29.920> ghosts<00:01:30.670> and

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
but not as much as they do on ghosts and

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.440 
but not as much as they do on ghosts and
I<00:01:31.960> mean<00:01:32.380> ghosts<00:01:32.920> may<00:01:33.369> have<00:01:33.640> lived<00:01:34.030> through

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
I mean ghosts may have lived through

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.050 
I mean ghosts may have lived through
this<00:01:34.630> but<00:01:35.319> let's<00:01:35.740> go<00:01:36.009> take<00:01:36.280> another<00:01:36.310> look<00:01:36.850> at

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
this but let's go take another look at

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.870 
this but let's go take another look at
mw3<00:01:37.720> so<00:01:38.709> this<00:01:38.860> clip<00:01:39.009> you're<00:01:39.159> seeing<00:01:39.429> I<00:01:39.610> just

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
wanted to show you guys the very

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.620 
wanted to show you guys the very
beginning<00:01:41.530> of<00:01:41.950> that<00:01:42.130> clip<00:01:42.190> and<00:01:42.880> I<00:01:43.240> just<00:01:43.420> wanted

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
beginning of that clip and I just wanted

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.569 
beginning of that clip and I just wanted
to<00:01:43.750> show<00:01:44.020> you<00:01:44.049> that<00:01:44.350> that<00:01:44.380> guy<00:01:44.710> it<00:01:45.100> doesn't

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
to show you that that guy it doesn't

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.370 
to show you that that guy it doesn't
show<00:01:45.820> much<00:01:46.060> of<00:01:46.240> that<00:01:46.360> guy<00:01:46.539> and<00:01:46.869> I<00:01:46.899> really<00:01:47.229> do

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
show much of that guy and I really do

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.050 
show much of that guy and I really do
not<00:01:47.530> know<00:01:47.710> who<00:01:47.860> he<00:01:47.979> is<00:01:48.159> he<00:01:48.640> doesn't<00:01:48.939> look

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
not know who he is he doesn't look

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.999 
not know who he is he doesn't look
familiar<00:01:49.270> so<00:01:49.780> I'm<00:01:49.930> thinking<00:01:50.259> maybe<00:01:50.289> that<00:01:50.799> is

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
familiar so I'm thinking maybe that is

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.700 
familiar so I'm thinking maybe that is
ghost<00:01:51.880> without<00:01:52.090> his<00:01:52.450> mask<00:01:52.689> on<00:01:52.869> underwater<00:01:53.469> but

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
ghost without his mask on underwater but

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.289 
ghost without his mask on underwater but
tell<00:01:54.159> me<00:01:54.250> what<00:01:54.369> you<00:01:54.490> guys<00:01:54.609> think<00:01:54.670> about<00:01:54.939> ghosts
