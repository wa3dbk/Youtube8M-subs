00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
master now I'm you'll see this later but

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.939 
master now I'm you'll see this later but
i'll<00:00:15.120> explain<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.780> way<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:16.049> i<00:00:16.080> played<00:00:16.379> right

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
i'll explain the way that i played right

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.429 
i'll explain the way that i played right
now<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.760> I'd<00:00:17.940> start<00:00:18.210> every<00:00:18.480> round<00:00:18.720> with<00:00:19.109> all<00:00:19.320> of

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
now so I'd start every round with all of

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.650 
now so I'd start every round with all of
the<00:00:19.560> windows<00:00:19.740> boarded<00:00:20.070> up<00:00:20.310> then<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.210> would

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
the windows boarded up then I would

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.540 
the windows boarded up then I would
prepare<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.170> two<00:00:22.350> nearest<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.920> arisaka

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
prepare the two nearest to the arisaka

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.960 
prepare the two nearest to the arisaka
until<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.689> ones<00:00:24.869> at<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.050> back<00:00:25.289> breach<00:00:25.970> at

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
until the ones at the back breach at

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.820 
until the ones at the back breach at
that<00:00:27.210> point<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.570> would<00:00:27.630> maybe<00:00:28.050> make<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.380> cut<00:00:28.650> back

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
that point I would maybe make a cut back

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.070 
that point I would maybe make a cut back
or<00:00:28.859> two<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.250> then<00:00:29.400> move<00:00:30.330> towards<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.840> mule

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.200 
things that I'm gonna talk about in a
few<00:01:54.780> seconds<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.229> um<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.430> all<00:01:56.670> just

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
few seconds so um this is all just

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.149 
few seconds so um this is all just
opinion<00:01:57.810> though<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.170> not<00:01:58.259> stuff<00:01:58.799> like<00:01:58.920> you

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
opinion though it's not stuff like you

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.690 
opinion though it's not stuff like you
have<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.399> agree<00:01:59.640> with<00:01:59.729> or<00:02:00.030> anything<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:01.700> yeah

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
have to agree with or anything so yeah

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.670 
have to agree with or anything so yeah
you<00:02:02.909> can<00:02:03.119> think<00:02:03.570> about<00:02:03.689> whatever<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.320> want<00:02:04.530> to

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
you can think about whatever you want to

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.100 
you can think about whatever you want to
so<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.670> first<00:02:05.909> point<00:02:06.149> for<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.450> person<00:02:06.869> who<00:02:06.960> is

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
so the first point for a person who is

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.699 
so the first point for a person who is
good<00:02:07.590> at<00:02:07.799> zombies<00:02:07.829> I'd<00:02:08.670> say<00:02:08.910> would<00:02:09.629> be

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
good at zombies I'd say would be

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.210 
good at zombies I'd say would be
survival<00:02:10.709> and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
survival and

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.550 
survival and
um<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.570> this<00:02:12.900> should<00:02:13.110> be<00:02:13.260> pretty<00:02:13.410> obvious

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
um this is this should be pretty obvious

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.000 
um this is this should be pretty obvious
for<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.670> purpose<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.690> game<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.620> be

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
for you the purpose of the game is to be

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.480 
for you the purpose of the game is to be
able<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.460> survive<00:02:17.820> in<00:02:18.120> this<00:02:18.390> waves<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.870> zombies

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
able to survive in this waves of zombies

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.240 
able to survive in this waves of zombies
so<00:02:20.690> being<00:02:21.690> able<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.170> survive<00:02:22.440> in<00:02:22.740> this<00:02:22.980> waves

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
so being able to survive in this waves

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.040 
so being able to survive in this waves
of<00:02:23.460> zombies<00:02:23.750> it's<00:02:24.750> good<00:02:25.170> see<00:02:25.680> my<00:02:25.830> logic<00:02:26.190> it's

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
of zombies it's good see my logic it's

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.340 
of zombies it's good see my logic it's
pretty<00:02:28.050> obvious<00:02:28.620> now<00:02:29.300> what<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:30.330> mean<00:02:30.540> by<00:02:30.600> being

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
pretty obvious now what I mean by being

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.320 
pretty obvious now what I mean by being
able<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.590> survive<00:02:31.920> means<00:02:32.400> being<00:02:32.880> able<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.210> do

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
able to survive means being able to do

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.460 
able to survive means being able to do
something<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.930> point<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.320> it's

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
something to the point that it's

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.640 
something to the point that it's
repetitive<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.600> that<00:02:36.600> I'd<00:02:36.870> say<00:02:37.230> that's<00:02:37.350> like

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
repetitive and that I'd say that's like

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.730 
repetitive and that I'd say that's like
about<00:02:37.890> round<00:02:38.340> 50<00:02:39.060> response<00:02:39.600> do<00:02:39.870> they<00:02:40.620> don't

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
about round 50 response do they don't

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.190 
about round 50 response do they don't
max<00:02:41.070> out<00:02:41.280> on<00:02:41.430> 50<00:02:41.760> but<00:02:41.970> um<00:02:42.150> they're<00:02:42.630> pretty

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
max out on 50 but um they're pretty

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.070 
max out on 50 but um they're pretty
close<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.650> maxed<00:02:43.950> out<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.720> yeah<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:45.900> should

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
close to maxed out and yeah that should

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.840 
close to maxed out and yeah that should
name<00:02:46.200> table<00:02:46.560> 2<00:02:46.740> that<00:02:47.280> means<00:02:47.310> pretty<00:02:47.760> much

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
name table 2 that means pretty much

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.570 
name table 2 that means pretty much
being<00:02:48.209> able<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.750> do<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.170> strategy<00:02:49.860> properly

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
being able to do a strategy properly

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.540 
being able to do a strategy properly
consistently<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:52.250> next<00:02:53.250> thing<00:02:53.370> I'd<00:02:53.520> say

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
consistently and next thing I'd say

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.740 
consistently and next thing I'd say
would<00:02:54.000> be<00:02:54.030> endurance<00:02:54.959> endurance<00:02:55.350> is<00:02:56.750> pretty

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
would be endurance endurance is pretty

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.390 
would be endurance endurance is pretty
much<00:02:57.810> survival<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.770> next<00:02:59.010> level<00:02:59.310> because

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
much survival to the next level because

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.670 
much survival to the next level because
survival<00:03:00.000> requires<00:03:00.330> endurance<00:03:01.020> if<00:03:01.380> you<00:03:01.500> want

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
survival requires endurance if you want

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.100 
survival requires endurance if you want
to<00:03:01.860> survive<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.490> have<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.970> be<00:03:03.060> able<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.420> endure

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
to survive you have to be able to endure

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.860 
to survive you have to be able to endure
longer<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:05.150> being<00:03:06.150> able<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.390> do<00:03:06.480> something<00:03:06.690> to

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
longer and being able to do something to

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.500 
longer and being able to do something to
say<00:03:07.020> more<00:03:07.310> impressive<00:03:08.310> than<00:03:08.490> round<00:03:08.820> 50cc<00:03:09.270> like

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
say more impressive than round 50cc like

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.800 
say more impressive than round 50cc like
round<00:03:09.750> 100<00:03:10.350> or<00:03:10.500> something<00:03:10.830> that<00:03:11.610> is<00:03:11.910> being

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
round 100 or something that is being

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.729 
round 100 or something that is being
able<00:03:13.050> to<00:03:13.200> endure<00:03:13.620> more<00:03:14.190> than<00:03:14.370> survive<00:03:14.610> and

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
able to endure more than survive and

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.080 
able to endure more than survive and
yeah<00:03:16.739> that<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:17.160> also<00:03:17.430> includes<00:03:17.730> being<00:03:17.910> able

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
yeah that that also includes being able

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.910 
yeah that that also includes being able
to<00:03:18.180> hold<00:03:18.360> your<00:03:18.570> concentration<00:03:19.080> over<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.680> longer

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
to hold your concentration over a longer

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.060 
to hold your concentration over a longer
period<00:03:20.040> of<00:03:20.340> time<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:21.660> be<00:03:21.810> patient<00:03:22.320> because

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
period of time and to be patient because

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.449 
period of time and to be patient because
our<00:03:23.400> patients<00:03:23.850> is<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.540> part<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:25.019> zombies<00:03:25.459> the

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
our patients is a part of zombies the

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.790 
our patients is a part of zombies the
actual<00:03:27.300> point<00:03:27.480> of<00:03:27.660> zombies<00:03:28.050> not<00:03:28.320> not

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
actual point of zombies not not

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.220 
actual point of zombies not not
something<00:03:29.160> like<00:03:29.280> no<00:03:29.580> man's<00:03:29.790> land<00:03:29.880> or<00:03:30.239> first

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
something like no man's land or first

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
something like no man's land or first
frame<00:03:31.380> problems<00:03:31.709> just<00:03:31.800> like<00:03:31.980> you<00:03:32.100> see<00:03:32.220> here

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
frame problems just like you see here

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.300 
frame problems just like you see here
now<00:03:33.150> dodging<00:03:34.140> it's<00:03:34.380> my<00:03:34.500> next<00:03:34.739> point<00:03:34.860> sort<00:03:35.220> of

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
now dodging it's my next point sort of

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.030 
now dodging it's my next point sort of
thing<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:36.290> this<00:03:37.290> has<00:03:37.530> a<00:03:37.560> lot<00:03:37.769> to<00:03:37.920> do<00:03:38.010> with

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
thing and this has a lot to do with

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.509 
thing and this has a lot to do with
reaction<00:03:38.790> time<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:39.140> decision<00:03:40.140> making<00:03:40.519> so

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
reaction time and decision making so

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.430 
reaction time and decision making so
like<00:03:41.850> thinking<00:03:42.450> whether<00:03:42.690> it'd<00:03:43.019> be<00:03:43.140> smart<00:03:43.410> to

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
like thinking whether it'd be smart to

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.740 
like thinking whether it'd be smart to
go<00:03:43.620> through<00:03:43.890> a<00:03:43.920> gap<00:03:44.160> of<00:03:44.310> 2<00:03:44.549> zombies<00:03:45.000> or<00:03:45.239> to<00:03:45.480> drag

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
go through a gap of 2 zombies or to drag

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.660 
go through a gap of 2 zombies or to drag
them<00:03:45.900> out<00:03:45.989> then<00:03:46.230> go<00:03:46.530> around<00:03:46.769> them<00:03:47.010> or<00:03:47.250> by<00:03:47.459> can't

cut<00:03:47.910> back<00:03:48.090> is<00:03:48.299> an<00:03:48.570> example<00:03:48.930> of<00:03:49.080> that<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:49.560> now

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
cut back is an example of that and now

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.890 
cut back is an example of that and now
that<00:03:50.580> also<00:03:50.790> means<00:03:50.970> being<00:03:51.030> able<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.390> do<00:03:51.510> trains

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
that also means being able to do trains

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.770 
that also means being able to do trains
in<00:03:52.140> less<00:03:52.410> than<00:03:52.620> convenient<00:03:53.220> places<00:03:53.700> which<00:03:54.540> is

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
in less than convenient places which is

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.650 
in less than convenient places which is
literal<00:03:55.350> dodging<00:03:55.860> and<00:03:56.150> something<00:03:57.150> like<00:03:57.269> the

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
literal dodging and something like the

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.590 
literal dodging and something like the
keynote<00:03:58.110> stage<00:03:58.680> is<00:03:58.980> pretty<00:03:59.730> convenient<00:04:00.239> but

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
keynote stage is pretty convenient but

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.990 
keynote stage is pretty convenient but
this<00:04:01.410> video<00:04:01.680> here<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.310> mountain<00:04:02.790> room<00:04:02.880> only

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
this video here the mountain room only

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.910 
this video here the mountain room only
thing<00:04:03.239> shows<00:04:03.510> a<00:04:03.690> video<00:04:04.260> of<00:04:04.380> something<00:04:04.620> that<00:04:04.769> is

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
thing shows a video of something that is

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.520 
thing shows a video of something that is
less<00:04:05.610> than<00:04:05.660> convenient<00:04:06.660> for<00:04:07.019> training<00:04:07.410> and

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
less than convenient for training and

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.789 
less than convenient for training and
still<00:04:08.430> is<00:04:08.549> possible<00:04:09.000> but<00:04:09.290> it<00:04:10.290> takes<00:04:10.590> more

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
still is possible but it takes more

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.920 
still is possible but it takes more
ability<00:04:11.400> in<00:04:11.519> someone<00:04:11.850> like<00:04:12.000> running<00:04:12.450> flop

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
ability in someone like running flop

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.130 
ability in someone like running flop
around<00:04:13.080> ascension<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:14.540> I'd<00:04:15.540> say<00:04:15.690> dodging

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
around ascension and I'd say dodging

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.780 
around ascension and I'd say dodging
also<00:04:16.410> includes<00:04:16.709> being<00:04:16.919> able<00:04:17.160> to<00:04:17.280> screen<00:04:17.549> shake

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
also includes being able to screen shake

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.060 
also includes being able to screen shake
but<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.269> lot<00:04:18.600> of<00:04:18.630> people<00:04:18.750> don't<00:04:19.169> understand<00:04:19.919> or

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
but a lot of people don't understand or

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.580 
but a lot of people don't understand or
don't<00:04:20.250> think<00:04:20.549> that<00:04:20.669> does<00:04:20.820> anything<00:04:21.090> so<00:04:21.359> I

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
don't think that does anything so I

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.690 
don't think that does anything so I
wouldn't<00:04:22.590> really<00:04:22.680> consider<00:04:22.860> that<00:04:23.250> too<00:04:23.430> much

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
wouldn't really consider that too much

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.970 
wouldn't really consider that too much
now<00:04:24.630> I'm<00:04:24.780> next<00:04:25.380> thing<00:04:25.500> I'd<00:04:25.620> say<00:04:25.650> would<00:04:25.950> be

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
now I'm next thing I'd say would be

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.760 
now I'm next thing I'd say would be
understanding<00:04:26.970> and<00:04:27.000> knowledge<00:04:27.510> and<00:04:28.050> not<00:04:28.650> by

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
understanding and knowledge and not by

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.580 
understanding and knowledge and not by
understanding<00:04:29.490> I<00:04:29.670> mean<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.540> game<00:04:30.780> mechanics

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
understanding I mean the game mechanics

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.560 
understanding I mean the game mechanics
so<00:04:32.220> something<00:04:32.640> like<00:04:32.670> you<00:04:33.150> know<00:04:33.180> and

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
so something like you know and

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.000 
so something like you know and
understand<00:04:34.140> what<00:04:34.440> will<00:04:34.530> happen<00:04:34.590> to<00:04:34.950> you

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
understand what will happen to you

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.550 
understand what will happen to you
before<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.760> thing<00:04:35.970> happens<00:04:36.450> you<00:04:36.660> know<00:04:37.380> this

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
before the thing happens you know this

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.740 
before the thing happens you know this
mostly<00:04:37.860> involves<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.430> spawn<00:04:38.730> system<00:04:39.030> knowing

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
mostly involves the spawn system knowing

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.540 
mostly involves the spawn system knowing
where<00:04:40.080> zombies<00:04:40.350> will<00:04:40.710> spawn<00:04:40.950> depending<00:04:41.430> on

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
where zombies will spawn depending on

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.380 
where zombies will spawn depending on
where<00:04:41.760> you<00:04:41.910> are<00:04:41.940> on<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.330> map<00:04:42.510> and<00:04:44.150> yeah<00:04:45.150> but

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
where you are on the map and yeah but

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.330 
where you are on the map and yeah but
that's<00:04:45.720> really<00:04:45.900> that<00:04:46.170> and<00:04:46.440> by<00:04:46.620> knowledge<00:04:47.100> I'd

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
that's really that and by knowledge I'd

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.690 
that's really that and by knowledge I'd
mean<00:04:48.560> mostly<00:04:49.560> small<00:04:49.980> things<00:04:50.250> in<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.550> game

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
mean mostly small things in the game

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.490 
mean mostly small things in the game
like<00:04:50.970> knowing<00:04:51.510> how<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:51.900> make<00:04:52.110> zombies

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
like knowing how to make zombies

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.470 
like knowing how to make zombies
teleport<00:04:53.070> instead<00:04:53.340> of<00:04:53.430> respawn<00:04:53.790> on<00:04:53.970> five<00:04:54.180> when

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
teleport instead of respawn on five when

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.080 
teleport instead of respawn on five when
using<00:04:54.780> the<00:04:54.900> elevator<00:04:55.050> and<00:04:55.880> timing<00:04:56.880> the

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
using the elevator and timing the

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.430 
using the elevator and timing the
electric<00:04:57.450> craps<00:04:57.690> to<00:04:57.930> kill<00:04:58.080> a<00:04:58.110> group<00:04:58.320> of

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
electric craps to kill a group of

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.980 
electric craps to kill a group of
zombies<00:04:58.590> according<00:04:59.310> to<00:04:59.570> when<00:05:00.570> it's<00:05:00.780> about<00:05:00.930> to

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
zombies according to when it's about to

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
zombies according to when it's about to
turn<00:05:01.260> off<00:05:01.440> or<00:05:01.650> something<00:05:01.980> and<00:05:02.960> yeah<00:05:03.960> so<00:05:04.680> I

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
turn off or something and yeah so I

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.400 
turn off or something and yeah so I
guess<00:05:05.340> some<00:05:05.940> more<00:05:06.060> knowledge<00:05:06.450> would<00:05:06.570> be<00:05:06.720> basic

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
guess some more knowledge would be basic

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.980 
guess some more knowledge would be basic
map<00:05:08.190> alejo<00:05:08.490> knowledge<00:05:08.910> because<00:05:09.150> you<00:05:09.810> need<00:05:09.960> to

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
map alejo knowledge because you need to

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.530 
map alejo knowledge because you need to
know<00:05:10.200> the<00:05:10.350> map<00:05:10.500> before<00:05:10.800> you<00:05:11.130> can<00:05:11.340> do<00:05:11.880> well<00:05:12.090> that

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
know the map before you can do well that

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.050 
know the map before you can do well that
that's<00:05:12.870> pretty<00:05:13.230> obvious<00:05:13.740> I'd<00:05:14.100> say<00:05:14.280> now<00:05:14.970> the

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
that's pretty obvious I'd say now the

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.030 
that's pretty obvious I'd say now the
next<00:05:15.150> two<00:05:15.480> things<00:05:15.750> are<00:05:15.960> only<00:05:16.230> for<00:05:16.680> co-op

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
next two things are only for co-op

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.480 
next two things are only for co-op
really<00:05:17.600> so<00:05:18.620> reviving<00:05:19.620> being<00:05:19.980> able<00:05:20.190> to<00:05:20.280> revive

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
really so reviving being able to revive

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.880 
really so reviving being able to revive
teammates<00:05:21.090> in<00:05:21.300> every<00:05:21.750> type<00:05:22.110> of<00:05:22.140> situation

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
teammates in every type of situation

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.100 
teammates in every type of situation
that<00:05:23.070> means<00:05:23.490> plan<00:05:24.120> on<00:05:24.270> how<00:05:24.540> you'll<00:05:24.780> get<00:05:24.960> the

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
that means plan on how you'll get the

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.050 
that means plan on how you'll get the
other<00:05:25.140> player<00:05:25.530> by<00:05:25.740> taking<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.490> forward<00:05:26.850> for

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
other player by taking the forward for

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.950 
other player by taking the forward for
example<00:05:27.510> or<00:05:27.810> um<00:05:28.650> using<00:05:29.130> I<00:05:29.550> guess<00:05:30.060> skill<00:05:30.690> or

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
example or um using I guess skill or

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.960 
example or um using I guess skill or
doing<00:05:31.170> something<00:05:31.410> like<00:05:31.640> revived<00:05:32.640> while

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
doing something like revived while

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.290 
doing something like revived while
walking<00:05:33.300> which<00:05:33.810> is<00:05:34.040> 365<00:05:35.040> if<00:05:35.490> you're<00:05:35.850> familiar

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
walking which is 365 if you're familiar

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.830 
walking which is 365 if you're familiar
with<00:05:36.720> the<00:05:37.170> term<00:05:37.410> that<00:05:37.800> sounds<00:05:38.160> really<00:05:38.490> fancy

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
with the term that sounds really fancy

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.110 
with the term that sounds really fancy
um<00:05:39.840> but<00:05:40.260> yeah<00:05:40.440> next<00:05:41.040> thing<00:05:41.160> would<00:05:41.340> be<00:05:41.490> teamwork

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
um but yeah next thing would be teamwork

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.490 
um but yeah next thing would be teamwork
so<00:05:42.540> not<00:05:43.320> being<00:05:43.620> selfish<00:05:44.220> is<00:05:44.430> I<00:05:45.300> mean<00:05:46.200> I<00:05:46.320> don't

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
so not being selfish is I mean I don't

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.930 
so not being selfish is I mean I don't
know<00:05:46.620> many<00:05:46.770> people<00:05:47.160> that<00:05:47.190> would<00:05:47.430> actually<00:05:47.610> do

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
know many people that would actually do

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.290 
know many people that would actually do
this<00:05:48.120> but<00:05:48.360> say<00:05:49.260> taking<00:05:49.920> kills<00:05:50.190> from<00:05:50.520> another

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
this but say taking kills from another

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.270 
this but say taking kills from another
player<00:05:51.600> when<00:05:51.840> they<00:05:51.930> need<00:05:52.110> points<00:05:52.530> or<00:05:52.740> killing

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
player when they need points or killing

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.650 
player when they need points or killing
