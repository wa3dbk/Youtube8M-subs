00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.670
 everything went well from looking with 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.040
 stands here when viewed from the site 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.740
 how much did this game contain 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.390
 such dangerous moments for the team 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.430
 when could u have something to buy with it 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.980
 I think I am good 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.990
 tuned in after the new year a few 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.150
 of the day we had a rest we miss hockey 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.490
 left and the more full stadium most 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.590
 the first seconds we knew that 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.480
 Yaroslavl plays very quickly aggressively 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.010
 so you had to be ready for the start and 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.190
 that what we had today one of 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.200
 best games of the season and previously profitable 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.550
 today a lot because you can 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:49.059
 potential c last game that I did not 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:53.640
 I think that in the last match I think that 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:56.410
 we will play at all as you play 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.449
 good festive mood ahead 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.390
 christmas so i think the whole country 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.500
 resting we see that hockey go on 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.729
 all cities are sold out 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.400
 many children therefore gaze going into that 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.330
 episode when you have people here 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.890
 so that for some reason you will not go it 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.710
 offered travels hockey 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.040
 no one wants to give in to it we 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.200
 We love that can be as long as we are now to 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.030
 betrayed break results honored 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.330
 insulting exercise mouths and cisco very 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.800
 good teams can already say that 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.110
 teams and the new coach is already a hotel is a friend 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.600
 to a friend, everyone understood everything, and the team 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.690
 will perform the installation here as I specified yes 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.580
 I think that with each game we add and 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.340
 it's impossible to play all the time without mistakes and 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.160
 we are not robots so I want to cancel 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.740
 our goalkeeper who is very confident 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.840
 plays and gives us strength and gives us 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.720
 opportunity to beat somewhere through whom 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.760
 we know that he can save us therefore 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.660
 I repeat again today to the end 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.729
 beat it worked the game was like skin a 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.860
 here is a surge of performance past 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.500
 matches a festive mood 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.440
 important 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.020
 yes no but where could she have gone just me 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.700
 it seems we have a little Iran we wrote that we 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.330
 playing some kind of wrong one just wanted u 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.770
 we were variable with us i think that in 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.050
 a game that is very much constructive 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.630
 knows what he is doing and together we will 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.600
 so we will create moments 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.959
 because skill and ahead of us 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.959
 to file
