00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.340
 for decades radiotherapy as monotherapy a few commonly 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.030
 combination with chemotherapy and or surgery has been part of the 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.900
 official trafficking protocols 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.100
 your goal in accordance with the official scientific philosophy 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.620
 tumor and cancer is the destruction of tumor cells by 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.530
 application of ionizing radiation on the tumor area similar to 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.090
 of the x-rays but of higher energy in order to reduce the tumor before the 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.090
 surgery or to finish with the remaining cell treats 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.060
 also the cases of tumors considered unapproachable or 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.020
 resistant to chemotherapy 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.780
 according to its defenders radiation is able to alter the genetic material 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.950
 of cancer cells preventing their growth and reproduction 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.290
 however the theory becomes more complicated its clinical application 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.570
 by the healthy tissues are altered albeit although it is supposed greater 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.160
 resilience 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.150
 besides causing a long list of side effects 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.770
 especially a decrease in defenses 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.060
 the emergence of new diseases potentially dangerous to life 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.060
 even some new metastasis cases 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.580
 well in the karolinska hospital of stockholm lonko love radiotherapists 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.790
 hungry song 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.710
 would develop an apparatus that would lead to so-called therapy 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.200
 Stereotaxic 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.170
 allowing ravier a tumor inside the body achieving that they do not know few 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.930
 Sessions 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.440
 without affecting neither the skin nor the cells 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.760
 z of a painless and ambulatory high precision non-invasive technique colombia 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.230
 Thousands of patients have been treated with a percentage of tumor control 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.240
 that exceeds 90 percent 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.660
 can obey what you have to finish 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.910
 dose intensity for example in conventional radiotherapy is the 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.130
 network tolerance the adjacent healthy tissue for this reason can not manage 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.260
 high doses to score to change excessively this healthy tissue that 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.040
 difference of these technique in the village difference surgery be quiet 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:39.140
 physics are directed these shocks rays these traditions to the tumor itself with what 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.949
 which one 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:43.629
 the adjacent tissue is not taken into account and if it can be won 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:48.319
 I attended to click that dose trip to kill the tumor requires a very dose 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.409
 high without side effects the device allows to locate and treat tumors 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.249
 using a linear accelerator 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:57.159
 that was designed in the aforementioned karolinska 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:02.260
 where it has been used chemically no less than since 1991 and where from 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.059
 then they have been treated with this technique more than 3000 tumor 50% of 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:10.549
 those located in lungs and 25% in the liver 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.839
 likewise sandra all mediastinal cancer pancreas glands 

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:17.459
 adrenal financial optometry courses most metastasis 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.439
 derived from primary tumors but tumors have also been treated 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.329
 primary considered inappropriate 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.939
 lung cancer pulled pancreas and certain arches but of course 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:30.259
 answering the question yes biniez in in this division 

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:32.589
 earlier left start 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:36.790
 Of the carcinogenic activity the states of course would be much 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:41.729
 Closer spectacular because you could drop the disease by 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:46.489
 complete even in advanced stages but when the tumor is 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.729
 located for example talking about lung cancer does not matter 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:54.229
 Racist localized stage can be completely eradicated 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.419
 the range of similar controls 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.669
 ValdÃ©s scalpel bed used for the treatment of intracranial lesions 

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:04.199
 in fact the receipts in the field of the radiator are less than 10% 

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:07.929
 his own moment would also explain his conference 

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:11.539
 Panama 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.749
 because we are going to achieve 

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:16.879
