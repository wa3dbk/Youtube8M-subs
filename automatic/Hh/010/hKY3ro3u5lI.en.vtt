life is good not really actually the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.000 
life is good not really actually the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
part that it comes with is attached to

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.160 
part that it comes with is attached to
another<00:00:23.070> one<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.460> have<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.670> paint<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.630> not

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
another one you have to paint and not

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.150 
another one you have to paint and not
only<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.490> you<00:00:26.490> have<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.760> run<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.359> wires<00:00:28.160> all

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
only that you have to run the wires all

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.389 
only that you have to run the wires all
the<00:00:29.640> way<00:00:30.230> in<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.289> back<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.650> Jeep<00:00:31.830> which

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
the way in the back of the Jeep which

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.760 
the way in the back of the Jeep which
means<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.790> have<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.969> take<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.210> apart<00:00:33.540> so

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
means you have to take this apart so

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.350 
means you have to take this apart so
that<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:35.070> can<00:00:35.309> take<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:38.460> back<00:00:38.610> lights<00:00:38.910> off<00:00:39.120> in

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
that you can take the back lights off in

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.369 
that you can take the back lights off in
that<00:00:39.690> hole<00:00:39.840> little<00:00:39.989> bezel

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
that hole little bezel

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.760 
that hole little bezel
and<00:00:40.770> not<00:00:41.219> only<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.670> but<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.379> don't<00:00:43.379> think<00:00:43.620> it's

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
and not only that but I don't think it's

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.840 
and not only that but I don't think it's
light<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.160> here<00:00:46.010> but<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.070> also<00:00:47.129> means<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.640> have

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
light in here but it also means you have

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.439 
light in here but it also means you have
to<00:00:48.000> take<00:00:48.239> apart<00:00:49.190> almost<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.370> entire<00:00:50.879> freaking

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
to take apart almost the entire freaking

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.920 
to take apart almost the entire freaking
Japan<00:00:52.129> and<00:00:53.129> run<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.579> wires<00:00:54.530> up<00:00:55.579> down<00:00:56.690> all<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
Japan and run the wires up down all the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.869 
Japan and run the wires up down all the
way<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.230> front<00:00:58.530> I'm<00:00:59.309> going<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.579> have<00:00:59.730> to

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
way to the front I'm going to have to

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.420 
way to the front I'm going to have to
take<00:01:00.090> out<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.960> glovebox<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.800> little<00:01:02.190> bit

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
take out the glovebox a little bit

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.240 
take out the glovebox a little bit
behind<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.559> little<00:01:04.559> radio<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.890> hook<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.189> up

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
behind that little radio to hook it up

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.390 
behind that little radio to hook it up
behind<00:01:05.430> there<00:01:05.700> go<00:01:05.970> through<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.299> firewall<00:01:06.810> and

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
behind there go through the firewall and

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.719 
behind there go through the firewall and
in<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.700> hood<00:01:08.880> hook<00:01:09.659> up<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.049> different<00:01:10.350> spot

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
in the hood hook up to a different spot

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.560 
in the hood hook up to a different spot
so<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.630> proving<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.170> be<00:01:13.200> quite<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:14.570> mess

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
so this is proving to be quite a mess

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.030 
so this is proving to be quite a mess
here's<00:01:16.290> all<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> parts<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.070> car<00:01:17.750> just

which I'll just jb weld back on
and<00:02:06.220> other<00:02:07.060> than<00:02:07.150> that<00:02:07.240> though<00:02:08.190> everything's

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
and other than that though everything's

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.260 
and other than that though everything's
going<00:02:09.399> pretty<00:02:09.490> good<00:02:10.620> so<00:02:11.620> there<00:02:11.860> it<00:02:11.980> is<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:13.120> be

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270
