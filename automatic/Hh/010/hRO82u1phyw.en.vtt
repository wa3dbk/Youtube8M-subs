00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.790
(Wes Bunn) Hello everyone and welcome. My name is Wes Bunn and I am a Technical Writer

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.700
here at Epic Games. Over the next several videos, we are going to be working together

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.400
to build our very own 3rd person game entirely from scratch. So starting with just some FBX

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.320
assets, we will go through the import process here together to get those assets inside Unreal

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.579
Engine 4. Then, we will build everything else that we need around that to get our character

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:33.170
up and running around in our level here. So this video series is aimed at beginners. So

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.570
if you are new to Unreal Engine 4 and would like to learn how to get your own characters

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.210
into the editor and playable then this is the video series for you.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.929
I did want to mention that we are using Unreal Engine version 4.8 for the purposes of this

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:51.749
video series. So with that, let's actually take a look at the finished project here.

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:55.320
So if I jump into the editor here and hit Play, we will show you what it is we are going

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.879
to try to create here together. So you can see we have our character here who is idling.

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.140
I can rotate a camera around him, which is pretty standard for any 3rd person game having

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:12.689
a follow camera, essentially. So we can independently control that. We can also use the WASD keys

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.720
to run around with our character. We can go back to an idle state. So we will show you

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.659
how to set this up to get your character running around inside your game. Then, we can also

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.939
jump with our character here. We can jump to different heights. So we can jump from

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.860
here, we can jump there, we can jump all the way down here like so. So we will show you

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.979
how to set that up as well. You can also see as our character is running around, he is

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.310
kicking up a little bit of dust here which is kind of cool. So we will show you

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.420
how to set up this particle effect that occurs whenever the player is running. So we will

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.210
do that towards the end of the video. First things first, we need to get our character

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.430
up and running before we do anything else. Then, we will also show you how to do some punches

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.640
with a character. (Laughter) Now these punches aren't the greatest looking, but it gets the

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.810
job done and it shows you how you can set this up. Or I can do like one punch at a time,

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.780
or I can hold it down and do multiple punches. I can also punch and run at the same time.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.720
So if in your game you have a character that you want to run and shoot, or run and reload

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.410
this will show you how to set that up. Our character can also punch stuff because that

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.110
is cool. Look at that. Get out of here. So, that is what it is we want to create here

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.410
together; this is the end result. There are a lot of systems that come into play here

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.890
and work together that we are going to have to touch upon. So I wanted to run through

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.090
those really quickly to kind of show you what it is we are going to be covering and give

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.070
you a brief description on what they are before we get into them. So as you can see, we have

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.850
a lot to cover. So starting from the top here to the bottom, the first thing that we are going

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:51.710
to be taking a look at is the importing process and how you can get your FBX assets into Unreal

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.450
Engine 4 and start working with them. From there, we are going to be taking a look at

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.120
Skeleton assets: what they are, how they work, as well as some things to keep in mind when

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.690
sharing Skeletons between characters. From there, we are going to take a look at Persona

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.310
which is the animation tool inside Unreal Engine 4. Then, we will talk about how to properly

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.060
set up inputs on a character; so how to go into your Project Settings and add the inputs

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.740
that you need so that you can use them later. This will include setups for gamepads, touch

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.530
controls, as well as the standard PC controls or mouse and keyboard style controls. We are

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.710
then going to look at Blend Spaces and show a way that you can blend between multiple

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.980
animations based on really a variety of factors, but we are going to do it based on the speed

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.200
of the character. So you can go from like an idle state into a walk, into a run, and transition

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.160
between all three states smoothly. From there, we are going to take a look at Animation Blueprints.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.450
This is how you get the data from the game or from the Character Blueprint, which is

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.230
another topic for discussion, and take that data and essentially transition that into

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.320
the final animation that your character is actually doing. From there, we are going to take a

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:08.350
look at State Machines, which are a way that you can create sort of a flow chart or a graph

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.260
of all the different states or things that your character is going to be doing, and smoothly

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.009
move between them and set up rules to transition in between each state. A lot more information

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:22.289
will be coming on that when we actually get to that video. It is sort of a beast of a topic, so

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:28.020
it is going to have its own video once we get to that later in the series. Then as I

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.460
mentioned, we are going to take a look at setting up a Character Blueprint and not only

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.120
that, but we will look at how a Character Blueprint is different than a Pawn Blueprint. For a lot of people

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.639
who are just getting into Unreal Engine 4, particularly if you had a history in UDK or

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.210
Unreal Engine 3, a lot of folks don't really know which of those two to begin with when

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.289
setting up a character (a Pawn or a Character Blueprint). So we are going to talk about

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:55.150
that and help clarify some things and why you may want to choose one over the other.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.930
So as you can see, we have a lot to cover but we will try to break up these videos into

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.699
bite sized chunks so that it is more easily digestible. But ultimately, our end goal is to

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.430
get all the way back to here so that we have a playable character that can run around,

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.800
jump, and punch. So that is going to do it for this video. In the next video, we will

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.300
show you where you can get your hands on some of the assets that we will be using for the purposes

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.680
of this series. In that video, we will start the FBX import process. Thank you so much

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.000
and we will see you in the next video.
