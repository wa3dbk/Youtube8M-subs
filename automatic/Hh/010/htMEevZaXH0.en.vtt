these little real skinny ones here and
those<00:05:18.669> end<00:05:19.030> up<00:05:19.180> going<00:05:19.569> kind<00:05:19.840> of<00:05:19.900> in<00:05:20.020> this

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
those end up going kind of in this

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:27.290 
those end up going kind of in this
section<00:05:20.409> here<00:05:20.879> so<00:05:21.879> if<00:05:22.060> you've<00:05:22.270> got<00:05:24.509> spot<00:05:25.509> here

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
section here so if you've got spot here

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.080 
section here so if you've got spot here
run<00:05:28.300> that<00:05:28.509> over<00:05:29.069> and<00:05:30.069> velcro<00:05:30.340> it<00:05:30.610> down<00:05:30.819> to<00:05:30.969> the

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
run that over and velcro it down to the

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.909 
run that over and velcro it down to the
side<00:05:31.360> and<00:05:31.689> then<00:05:32.289> the<00:05:34.199> other<00:05:35.199> one<00:05:35.349> will<00:05:35.650> kind<00:05:35.860> of

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
side and then the other one will kind of

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:43.140 
side and then the other one will kind of
go<00:05:36.039> in<00:05:36.189> there<00:05:36.340> the<00:05:36.460> same<00:05:36.639> way<00:05:41.789> down<00:05:42.789> in<00:05:42.969> there

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
go in there the same way down in there

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.909 
go in there the same way down in there
and<00:05:43.360> that<00:05:43.599> would<00:05:43.780> protect<00:05:43.960> the<00:05:44.349> top<00:05:44.590> of

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
and that would protect the top of

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:46.559 
and that would protect the top of
whatever<00:05:45.340> you<00:05:45.610> have<00:05:45.789> in<00:05:45.939> here<00:05:45.969> from<00:05:46.300> getting

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:46.569 
whatever you have in here from getting

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:48.390 
whatever you have in here from getting
squished<00:05:46.930> if<00:05:47.139> something<00:05:47.439> got<00:05:47.590> sat<00:05:47.830> down<00:05:48.009> or

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
squished if something got sat down or

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.550 
squished if something got sat down or
you<00:05:49.000> set<00:05:49.240> the<00:05:49.360> bag<00:05:49.509> over<00:05:49.750> and<00:05:49.990> it<00:05:50.050> flipped<00:05:50.379> over

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
you set the bag over and it flipped over

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.110 
you set the bag over and it flipped over
and<00:05:50.740> smack<00:05:51.129> on<00:05:51.340> to<00:05:51.430> the<00:05:51.520> ground<00:05:51.759> this<00:05:51.939> would

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
and smack on to the ground this would

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.459 
and smack on to the ground this would
give<00:05:52.240> you<00:05:52.330> some<00:05:52.539> extra<00:05:52.629> padding<00:05:53.110> here<00:05:53.259> and

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:53.469 
give you some extra padding here and

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:55.439 
give you some extra padding here and
because<00:05:54.129> it's<00:05:54.310> two<00:05:54.460> pieces<00:05:54.639> you<00:05:55.029> can<00:05:55.060> still

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
because it's two pieces you can still

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.059 
because it's two pieces you can still
just<00:05:55.599> push<00:05:55.810> them<00:05:55.930> aside<00:05:56.050> and<00:05:56.469> gain<00:05:56.590> access<00:05:56.770> to

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:57.069 
just push them aside and gain access to

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:00.379 
just push them aside and gain access to
what's<00:05:57.400> in<00:05:57.550> the<00:05:57.610> bag<00:05:57.789> here<00:05:58.080> so<00:05:59.080> it's<00:05:59.349> kind<00:05:59.590> of<00:05:59.680> a

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
what's in the bag here so it's kind of a

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.610 
what's in the bag here so it's kind of a
cool<00:06:01.389> little<00:06:01.569> setup<00:06:01.900> how<00:06:02.110> you<00:06:02.169> can<00:06:02.379> make<00:06:02.469> it

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
cool little setup how you can make it

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.080 
cool little setup how you can make it
modular<00:06:03.039> and<00:06:03.099> put<00:06:03.310> whatever<00:06:03.460> padding<00:06:03.969> you

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
modular and put whatever padding you

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.629 
modular and put whatever padding you
want<00:06:04.300> in<00:06:04.479> there<00:06:04.719> you<00:06:05.560> can<00:06:05.710> put<00:06:05.889> the<00:06:05.979> whole<00:06:06.340> full

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639

want in there you can put the whole full
kit<00:06:06.879> in<00:06:07.000> there<00:06:07.379> you<00:06:08.379> could<00:06:08.529> only<00:06:08.680> put<00:06:08.979> that

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:09.129
