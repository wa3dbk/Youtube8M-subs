actually<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.579> paper<00:01:50.579> on<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:50.909> plastic

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
actually on the paper on that plastic

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:59.620 
actually on the paper on that plastic
plastic<00:01:54.829> plastic<00:01:57.380> whatever<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.590> protector

then<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:02.570> actually<00:02:03.570> truly<00:02:03.990> don't<00:02:04.229> know<00:02:04.380> how<00:02:04.680> to

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
then I actually truly don't know how to

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.400 
then I actually truly don't know how to
do<00:02:05.009> with<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.280> device<00:02:05.700> and

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
do with this device and

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.190 
do with this device and

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
so all these have the hdmi USB ports

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.350 
so all these have the hdmi USB ports
what<00:02:11.350> you<00:02:11.440> guys<00:02:11.590> told<00:02:11.830> me<00:02:11.980> so<00:02:12.850> all<00:02:13.000> looks<00:02:13.240> good

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
what you guys told me so all looks good

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.020 
what you guys told me so all looks good
but<00:02:13.890> look<00:02:14.890> at<00:02:15.069> your<00:02:15.220> model<00:02:15.580> number<00:02:15.819> which<00:02:16.000> you

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
but look at your model number which you

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.880 
but look at your model number which you
supplied<00:02:16.569> you<00:02:16.780> probably<00:02:17.319> might<00:02:17.500> be<00:02:17.680> knowing

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
supplied you probably might be knowing

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.360 
supplied you probably might be knowing
it<00:02:18.990> if<00:02:19.990> I<00:02:20.140> should<00:02:20.380> have<00:02:20.560> been<00:02:20.709> done<00:02:20.890> some<00:02:21.160> kind

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
it if I should have been done some kind

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.190 
it if I should have been done some kind
of<00:02:21.430> quality<00:02:21.880> control<00:02:22.209> before<00:02:22.480> sending<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:23.050> to

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
of quality control before sending it to

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.470 
of quality control before sending it to
me<00:02:23.319> instead<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.430> making<00:02:24.880> it<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.060> figure<00:02:25.360> out

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
me instead of making it to figure out

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.020 
me instead of making it to figure out
how<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.840> works<00:02:26.080> so<00:02:26.920> I'm<00:02:27.040> really<00:02:27.430> quite<00:02:27.730> not

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
how it works so I'm really quite not

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.840 
how it works so I'm really quite not
