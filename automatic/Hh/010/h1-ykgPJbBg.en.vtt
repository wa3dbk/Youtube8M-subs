00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:08.960
 hello welcome to a new tutorial 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.419
 crafts for all today we are going to 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.900
 make crepe paper flowers for the day 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:13.900
 of the mother 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:22.900
 and materials that we will need 4 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.760
 colored crepe paper boxes a 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.100
 colored crepe paper rectangle 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.100
 different green crepe paper 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.140
 with the plastic 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.860
 scissors 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.860
 and coarse stick 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.559
 let's start 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.719
 we take the single color paper what 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.030
 we had and we 're going to cut it 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.539
 half with one of the halves we are going to 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.539
 make a roll 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.620
 we take a little glue 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.540
 and we are going to place the bonito on the tip 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:10.870
 of the snap stick and with the other 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:13.900
 half of the paper we will cover the 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.180
 we'll pass it on paper 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.140
 that covers the little ball and we're going to 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.140
 screw on the stick 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.420
 in this way we will fix it as if 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.630
 it was a latch the beginning of the 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.630
 flower 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.490
 now let's take the 4 rectangles 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.130
 remaining of crepe paper of different 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.160
 we are going to accommodate them 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.160
 others 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.250
 in this way 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.670
 once this is done we are going to double the 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.630
 rectangles in half 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.320
 in this way and we are going to cut back on 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.320
 triangle shape 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.879
 on one side and the other 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.350
 in this way when we open what 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.950
 we cut out we're going to find that we 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.370
 they were diamond 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.750
 let's see the diamonds we're going to take and 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.670
 from the wide part we are going to wrinkle 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.060
 towards the other end we are going to do or 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.160
 wrinkles or creases in this way and 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.860
 when we reach the end to seal 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.709
 as a kind of knot let's turn 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.170
 one side down this 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.950
 way 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.950
 it would be more or less like this 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.940
 let's see it again we take the diamond 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:59.000
 and we are going to make folds or wrinkles 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.300
 those from one end of the part to the other 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.300
 wide 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.530
 and we are going to turn 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.530
 in this way 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.069
 as to seal the folds the same 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.400
 let's do with the 4 pieces of paper 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.400
 crepe 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.080
 we take the brooch stick and with the 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.730
 part of the tip 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.440
 and we are going to make a hole in the 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.130
 center of each of the petals that 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.130
 we just form 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.970
 trying to take in the hole all 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.970
 the folded pieces of paper 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.829
 to 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:51.400
 once done this let's put a little 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:54.030
 glue on the base of latch 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.030
 this way 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.430
 and we are going to start 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.980
 to thread the petals on the stick 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.230
 let's try to pass a little bit 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.010
 over the paper of the previous color 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:13.849
 that we put in this way we arrange 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.470
 the petals we put some glue 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.330
 at the base 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:24.420
 and we went to the next 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:24.420
 we insert it, we take it up 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:29.370
 we arrange it a little bit we put glue 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.260
 and we go on 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.680
 the same thing we're going to do with the four 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.680
 petals 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:45.420
 let's go to the last one putting a little 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:50.420
 glue we are going to insert the stick in 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.420
 the last petal and we upload it 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.470
 we arrange the petals a little 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.800
 put them out instead 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.900
 and we take green crepe paper from 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.240
 which we are going to cut a strip more or less 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.830
 2 centimeters 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.670
 let's put glue on the base of 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:12.190
 the flower in this way and we're going to 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.970
 start twisting the green crepe paper 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.970
 on the stick 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.530
 we start from the base of the flower here 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.590
 we hit it well and we started to give 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:30.820
 turns to turn the stick and so paper 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.820
 green is twisting 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.990
 once we are reaching the end 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:47.130
 let's cut out the strip and to close it 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:50.100
 we're going to stick it in the end we put 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.870
 a little bit of glue and we continue 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.289
 twisting until it stays stuck or 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.330
 glued 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:57.520
 and ready in this way would not be 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.410
 finished our flower 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:05.410
 Here I show you a new combination 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:08.789
 of colors I hope you liked it and 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.789
 See you next craft
