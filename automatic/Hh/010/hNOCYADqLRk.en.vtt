hit<00:03:20.129> play<00:03:20.639> the<00:03:20.760> campaign<00:03:20.940> too<00:03:21.329> much<00:03:21.479> I<00:03:21.629> can

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
hit play the campaign too much I can

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.530 
hit play the campaign too much I can
tell<00:03:22.019> you<00:03:22.109> the<00:03:22.169> full<00:03:22.319> difference<00:03:22.970> but<00:03:23.970> as<00:03:24.180> you

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
tell you the full difference but as you

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.719 
tell you the full difference but as you
can<00:03:24.659> see<00:03:24.840> in<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.079> back<00:03:25.650> there<00:03:25.949> is<00:03:26.099> some<00:03:26.579> of<00:03:26.669> the

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:26.729 
can see in the back there is some of the

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:32.080 
can see in the back there is some of the
campaign<00:03:27.419> action<00:03:28.189> and<00:03:29.189> I<00:03:30.150> think<00:03:30.479> you<00:03:31.409> can<00:03:31.590> play

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
campaign action and I think you can play

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.879 
campaign action and I think you can play
co-op<00:03:33.090> campaign<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:34.459> um<00:03:36.590> actually<00:03:37.590> no<00:03:37.799> you

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
co-op campaign and um actually no you

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.129 
co-op campaign and um actually no you
can<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:38.579> cannot<00:03:38.849> play<00:03:39.000> co-op<00:03:39.359> campaign<00:03:39.689> any

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
can you cannot play co-op campaign any

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.129 
can you cannot play co-op campaign any
of<00:03:40.319> these<00:03:40.439> i'm<00:03:40.620> pretty<00:03:40.859> sure<00:03:41.150> but<00:03:42.150> nothing

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
of these i'm pretty sure but nothing

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.509 
of these i'm pretty sure but nothing
quite<00:03:43.199> our<00:03:43.500> ward<00:03:43.739> not<00:03:43.949> talking<00:03:44.220> about<00:03:44.310> that

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
quite our ward not talking about that

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:45.740 
quite our ward not talking about that
game<00:03:44.669> but<00:03:44.819> i<00:03:44.879> think<00:03:45.030> that's<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.299> only<00:03:45.329> one<00:03:45.629> you

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
game but i think that's the only one you

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.860 
game but i think that's the only one you
can<00:03:45.900> play<00:03:46.019> co-op<00:03:46.560> campaign<00:03:46.829> but<00:03:47.669> i'm<00:03:48.389> not<00:03:48.659> too

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
can play co-op campaign but i'm not too

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.979 
can play co-op campaign but i'm not too
sure<00:03:48.900> about<00:03:49.079> that<00:03:49.409> to<00:03:49.560> check<00:03:49.769> on<00:03:49.889> that<00:03:50.930> way<00:03:51.930> you

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
sure about that to check on that way you

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.119 
sure about that to check on that way you
can<00:03:52.139> see<00:03:52.229> in<00:03:52.319> the<00:03:52.409> back<00:03:52.560> they<00:03:52.709> show<00:03:52.859> some<00:03:53.040> of

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
can see in the back they show some of

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.619 
can see in the back they show some of
the<00:03:53.189> game<00:03:53.340> play<00:03:54.000> off<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.449> campaign<00:03:55.349> and<00:03:56.629> yeah

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
the game play off the campaign and yeah

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.289 
the game play off the campaign and yeah
it's<00:03:57.780> pretty<00:03:57.900> much<00:03:58.049> all<00:03:58.290> for<00:03:58.609> that<00:03:59.609> comparison

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
it's pretty much all for that comparison

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.509 
it's pretty much all for that comparison
I<00:04:00.560> left<00:04:01.560> out<00:04:01.680> a<00:04:01.739> lot<00:04:01.799> of<00:04:02.040> stuff<00:04:02.220> like<00:04:02.400> the

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
I left out a lot of stuff like the

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.399 
I left out a lot of stuff like the
killstreaks<00:04:03.269> and<00:04:03.569> all<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.959> guns<00:04:04.290> and

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
killstreaks and all the guns and

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.050 
killstreaks and all the guns and
everything<00:04:04.530> just<00:04:04.919> because<00:04:05.609> I<00:04:05.729> want<00:04:05.909> to<00:04:05.970> go

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
everything just because I want to go

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.460 
everything just because I want to go
through<00:04:06.329> all<00:04:06.449> that<00:04:06.479> takes<00:04:06.900> too<00:04:07.079> long<00:04:07.109> but

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
through all that takes too long but

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.809 
through all that takes too long but
they'll<00:04:07.620> just<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:07.919> main<00:04:08.069> comparison<00:04:08.699> between
