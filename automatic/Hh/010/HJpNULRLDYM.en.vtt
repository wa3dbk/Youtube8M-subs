all websites are going to be run off of
this<00:00:24.779> main<00:00:25.230> code<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.119> perhaps<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.359> know

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
this main code and perhaps you know

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.980 
this main code and perhaps you know
collaborate<00:00:29.490> if<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.820> may<00:00:30.029> with<00:00:30.330> other<00:00:30.630> codes

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
collaborate if you may with other codes

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.049 
collaborate if you may with other codes
to<00:00:31.260> make<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.560> but<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.279> main<00:00:32.520> part<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.940> its

just HTM that's fine HTML and HTML go

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.580 
just HTM that's fine HTML and HTML go
through<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.230> same<00:02:19.560> exact<00:02:19.950> thing<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:21.410> you<00:02:22.410> can

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
through the same exact thing and you can

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.260 
through the same exact thing and you can
look<00:02:22.800> up<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:22.980> differences<00:02:23.459> online<00:02:23.850> but<00:02:24.060> they

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
look up the differences online but they

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.750 
look up the differences online but they
are<00:02:24.450> very<00:02:24.720> small<00:02:24.990> and<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.769> doesn't<00:02:25.800> matter<00:02:26.550> so

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
are very small and it doesn't matter so

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
just don't be confused if you see an HTM

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.810 
just don't be confused if you see an HTM
document<00:02:30.150> over<00:02:30.510> an<00:02:30.600> HTML<00:02:31.260> go<00:02:31.459> all<00:02:32.459> right<00:02:32.670> so

let's<00:02:33.000> run<00:02:33.239> this<00:02:33.390> arm<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:34.290> we'll<00:02:34.709> be<00:02:34.890> greeted

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
let's run this arm and we'll be greeted

f5<00:04:56.660> alright<00:04:57.660> and<00:04:57.840> we<00:04:58.500> would<00:04:58.620> think<00:04:58.830> that<00:04:58.950> it

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
f5 alright and we would think that it

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.590 
f5 alright and we would think that it
would<00:04:59.220> go<00:04:59.430> over<00:04:59.610> here<00:04:59.970> you<00:05:00.180> know<00:05:00.270> we<00:05:00.420> think

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
would go over here you know we think

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.150 
would go over here you know we think
it'd<00:05:00.780> be<00:05:00.810> in<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.080> middle<00:05:01.380> but<00:05:01.530> that's<00:05:01.710> not<00:05:02.010> the

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
it'd be in the middle but that's not the

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.400 
it'd be in the middle but that's not the
case

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
case

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.040 
case
everything<00:05:04.580> like<00:05:05.580> say<00:05:05.850> before<00:05:06.210> needs<00:05:06.690> to<00:05:06.870> have

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
everything like say before needs to have

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.100 
everything like say before needs to have
a<00:05:07.260> tag<00:05:07.560> to<00:05:07.770> tell<00:05:07.950> it<00:05:08.040> what<00:05:08.190> to<00:05:08.310> do<00:05:08.900> so<00:05:09.900> you<00:05:09.960> have

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
a tag to tell it what to do so you have

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.200 
a tag to tell it what to do so you have
freedom<00:05:10.650> in<00:05:10.800> this<00:05:11.160> notepad<00:05:11.430> to<00:05:11.790> put<00:05:11.970> stuff

example<00:05:26.570> you<00:05:27.570> can<00:05:27.750> just<00:05:28.020> have<00:05:28.400> this<00:05:29.400> and<00:05:29.790> we

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
example you can just have this and we

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.380 
example you can just have this and we
can<00:05:29.970> have<00:05:30.090> this<00:05:30.740> tabbed<00:05:31.740> over<00:05:31.920> here<00:05:32.490> and<00:05:32.850> down

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
can have this tabbed over here and down

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.000 
can have this tabbed over here and down
and<00:05:34.140> then<00:05:34.830> spaced<00:05:35.370> out<00:05:36.260> and<00:05:37.260> we<00:05:37.470> can<00:05:37.620> even<00:05:37.770> have

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
and then spaced out and we can even have

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:45.840 
and then spaced out and we can even have
some<00:05:38.220> more<00:05:38.400> words<00:05:38.550> over<00:05:38.790> here

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.510 

all<00:05:46.850> right<00:05:46.970> and<00:05:47.560> you<00:05:48.560> might<00:05:48.830> think<00:05:49.160> you<00:05:49.370> know

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
all right and you might think you know

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.040 
all right and you might think you know
that<00:05:49.670> these<00:05:49.880> would<00:05:50.030> be<00:05:50.180> all<00:05:50.270> spaced<00:05:50.600> out<00:05:50.810> but

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
that these would be all spaced out but

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.740 
that these would be all spaced out but
when<00:05:51.230> we<00:05:51.430> refresh<00:05:52.430> this<00:05:52.760> or<00:05:53.000> when<00:05:53.120> we<00:05:53.270> close<00:05:53.570> it

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
when we refresh this or when we close it

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.380 
when we refresh this or when we close it
and<00:05:53.870> double-click<00:05:54.260> it<00:05:54.470> again<00:05:55.150> we<00:05:56.150> see<00:05:56.360> that

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
and double-click it again we see that

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.450 
and double-click it again we see that
everything<00:05:57.020> is<00:05:57.140> back<00:05:57.350> together<00:05:57.530> and<00:05:57.890> the<00:05:58.310> only

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
everything is back together and the only

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.060 
everything is back together and the only
difference<00:05:58.760> you<00:05:59.660> know<00:05:59.750> it'll<00:06:00.230> only<00:06:00.410> add<00:06:00.590> in

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
difference you know it'll only add in

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.460 
difference you know it'll only add in
one<00:06:01.340> space<00:06:01.790> difference<00:06:02.510> between<00:06:02.960> all<00:06:03.200> of<00:06:03.230> them

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
one space difference between all of them

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.680 
one space difference between all of them
so<00:06:04.430> just<00:06:04.700> make<00:06:04.880> sure<00:06:04.910> as<00:06:05.210> we're<00:06:05.390> going<00:06:05.540> through

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
so just make sure as we're going through

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.890 
so just make sure as we're going through
you'll<00:06:06.050> realize<00:06:06.680> that<00:06:07.010> okay<00:06:07.640> that<00:06:08.630> we're

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
you'll realize that okay that we're

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.530 
you'll realize that okay that we're
going<00:06:09.050> to<00:06:09.110> need<00:06:09.320> you<00:06:10.280> know<00:06:10.340> Center<00:06:11.090> aligned

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.540 
going to need you know Center aligned

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.210 
going to need you know Center aligned
you<00:06:11.840> know<00:06:11.990> to<00:06:12.050> get<00:06:12.320> some<00:06:12.560> in<00:06:12.770> the<00:06:12.860> center<00:06:13.160> of

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
you know to get some in the center of

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.910 
you know to get some in the center of
the<00:06:13.340> page<00:06:13.550> and<00:06:13.700> all<00:06:13.880> that<00:06:14.060> kind<00:06:14.270> of<00:06:14.330> stuff<00:06:14.920> but

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:15.920 
the page and all that kind of stuff but

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.770 
the page and all that kind of stuff but
that's<00:06:16.130> the<00:06:16.310> basics<00:06:16.670> on<00:06:16.820> the<00:06:16.970> formatting<00:06:17.630> of

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
that's the basics on the formatting of

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.230 
that's the basics on the formatting of
just<00:06:18.200> is<00:06:18.410> the<00:06:18.650> code<00:06:19.490> that<00:06:19.520> you<00:06:19.760> need<00:06:19.850> to<00:06:20.090> know

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
just is the code that you need to know

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.920 
just is the code that you need to know
like<00:06:20.960> safe<00:06:21.320> you<00:06:22.250> know<00:06:22.700> these<00:06:22.970> eight<00:06:23.210> tags<00:06:23.600> and

like safe you know these eight tags and

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.320 
like safe you know these eight tags and
the<00:06:24.770> order<00:06:25.100> that<00:06:25.130> they're<00:06:25.460> in<00:06:25.640> right<00:06:25.850> now<00:06:26.060> and

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
the order that they're in right now and

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.760 
the order that they're in right now and
the<00:06:27.170> spacing<00:06:27.710> and<00:06:27.860> stuff<00:06:28.550> does<00:06:28.760> not<00:06:28.790> matter<00:06:29.770> so

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
the spacing and stuff does not matter so

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.550 
the spacing and stuff does not matter so
