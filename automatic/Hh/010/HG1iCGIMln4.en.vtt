00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.990 
closer I'll give you a rundown of what's
going<00:00:26.070> on<00:00:27.890> so<00:00:28.890> what<00:00:29.070> we're<00:00:29.189> looking<00:00:29.220> at<00:00:29.550> inside

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
going on so what we're looking at inside

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
going on so what we're looking at inside
for<00:00:30.330> plants<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:31.099> these<00:00:32.480> live<00:00:33.480> plants<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:33.960> I

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
for plants is these live plants that I

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.209 
for plants is these live plants that I
have<00:00:34.170> sitting<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:34.890> cut<00:00:35.670> cups<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.469> suction

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
have sitting in cut cups I have suction

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.049 
have sitting in cut cups I have suction
cups<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:39.210> handle<00:00:39.510> on<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.719> back<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.309> inside<00:00:41.309> I

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
cups to handle on the back and inside I

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.160 
cups to handle on the back and inside I
have<00:00:43.070> them<00:00:44.070> weighed<00:00:44.309> down<00:00:44.340> with<00:00:44.940> some<00:00:45.899> rocks

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
have them weighed down with some rocks

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.959 
have them weighed down with some rocks
at<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> bottom<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:47.070> that's<00:00:47.910> stuffing<00:00:48.570> too<00:00:49.969> to

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
at the bottom and that's stuffing too to

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.350 
at the bottom and that's stuffing too to
hold<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.300> plant<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:53.250> reason<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.610> did

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
hold the plant in so the reason I did

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.220 
hold the plant in so the reason I did
that<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:56.340> fish<00:00:56.699> will<00:00:57.420> not<00:00:57.480> go

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
that is so that the fish will not go

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.680 
that is so that the fish will not go
after<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.620> rocks<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.340> cup<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.059> start

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
after the rocks in the cup and start

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.770 
after the rocks in the cup and start
spitting<00:01:00.960> them<00:01:01.170> out<00:01:01.320> everywhere<00:01:02.449> as<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.629> can

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
spitting them out everywhere as you can

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.530 
spitting them out everywhere as you can
notice<00:01:04.049> here<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> bare<00:01:06.180> bottom

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
notice here that this is a bare bottom

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.660 
notice here that this is a bare bottom
tank<00:01:06.570> which<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.590> good<00:01:07.799> for<00:01:07.950> flowerhorns

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
tank which is good for flowerhorns

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.429 
tank which is good for flowerhorns
brings<00:01:09.210> their<00:01:09.420> colors<00:01:09.659> out<00:01:09.869> better<00:01:10.140> and

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
brings their colors out better and

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.950 
brings their colors out better and
obviously<00:01:11.189> it's<00:01:11.549> easy<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.000> maintain<00:01:12.150> and

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.670 

that's<00:01:15.960> always<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.170> good<00:01:16.290> thing

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
that's always a good thing

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.179 
that's always a good thing
so<00:01:17.549> for<00:01:18.509> filtration<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.290> tank<00:01:19.560> I've

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
so for filtration on this tank I've

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.010 
so for filtration on this tank I've
definitely<00:01:20.430> gone<00:01:21.090> home<00:01:21.979> for<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> high<00:01:23.580> quality

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
definitely gone home for a high quality

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.920 
definitely gone home for a high quality
filtration<00:01:25.020> system<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.610> went<00:01:26.610> with<00:01:26.729> an<00:01:26.880> fx5<00:01:27.540> on

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
filtration system I went with an fx5 on

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.749 
filtration system I went with an fx5 on
the<00:01:28.920> right<00:01:29.610> side<00:01:29.909> here

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
and then I went with or at the rina xp3

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.700

on the left side

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.470 
on the left side
it's<00:01:41.710> quite<00:01:41.860> a<00:01:41.890> lot<00:01:42.070> of<00:01:42.160> filtration<00:01:42.670> for<00:01:42.910> this

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
it's quite a lot of filtration for this

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.200 
it's quite a lot of filtration for this
size<00:01:43.750> tank<00:01:44.200> but<00:01:45.160> I<00:01:45.190> find<00:01:45.460> it's<00:01:45.610> excellent<00:01:46.000> I

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
size tank but I find it's excellent I

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.540 
size tank but I find it's excellent I
also<00:01:46.330> put<00:01:46.630> in<00:01:46.720> a<00:01:46.930> jet<00:01:47.320> just<00:01:47.950> to<00:01:48.100> keep<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.370> water

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
also put in a jet just to keep the water

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.480 
also put in a jet just to keep the water
flow<00:01:48.880> going<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:50.740> know<00:01:50.860> around<00:01:51.190> the<00:01:51.310> base<00:01:51.460> of

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
flow going you know around the base of

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:59.190 
flow going you know around the base of
the<00:01:51.700> tank<00:01:54.870> so<00:01:55.870> if<00:01:56.200> I<00:01:56.320> step<00:01:56.530> back<00:01:56.740> again<00:01:58.200> you'll

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
the tank so if I step back again you'll

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.010 
the tank so if I step back again you'll
see<00:01:59.500> that<00:02:00.370> I<00:02:00.430> have<00:02:00.490> plants<00:02:01.030> on<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.540> top<00:02:01.750> as

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
see that I have plants on the top as

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.040 
see that I have plants on the top as
well<00:02:02.080> so<00:02:02.940> let<00:02:03.940> me<00:02:04.000> give<00:02:04.180> you<00:02:04.300> a<00:02:04.330> rundown<00:02:04.540> of<00:02:04.720> how

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
well so let me give you a rundown of how

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.370 
well so let me give you a rundown of how
that's<00:02:05.290> set<00:02:05.590> up<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:07.210> xp3<00:02:07.660> on<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:08.200> left

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
that's set up so the xp3 on the left

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.190 
that's set up so the xp3 on the left
here<00:02:08.680> I<00:02:08.860> have<00:02:09.610> actually<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.090> output<00:02:10.200> running

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
here I have actually the output running

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.460 
here I have actually the output running
right<00:02:11.440> into<00:02:11.740> this<00:02:12.030> gardening<00:02:13.030> trough<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:16.440> got<00:02:17.440> a

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
right into this gardening trough I got a

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.530 
right into this gardening trough I got a
closer<00:02:17.740> look<00:02:18.100> so<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.400> can<00:02:18.670> see<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.090> water<00:02:19.300> is

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
closer look so you can see the water is

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.740 
closer look so you can see the water is
sitting<00:02:19.960> right<00:02:20.290> at<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.520> black<00:02:21.940> mark<00:02:22.330> which<00:02:22.660> I

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
sitting right at that black mark which I

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.270 
sitting right at that black mark which I
put<00:02:22.960> there<00:02:23.200> just<00:02:23.560> so<00:02:23.710> I<00:02:23.740> could<00:02:23.830> have<00:02:23.980> a<00:02:24.070> gauge

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
put there just so I could have a gauge

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.180 
put there just so I could have a gauge
of<00:02:24.580> what<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:24.940> levels<00:02:25.270> are<00:02:25.420> doing<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:26.190> you'll

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
of what the levels are doing and you'll

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.720 
of what the levels are doing and you'll
see<00:02:27.490> there's<00:02:27.820> a<00:02:27.880> drain<00:02:28.180> there<00:02:29.640> with<00:02:30.640> the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
see there's a drain there with the

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.850 
see there's a drain there with the
filter<00:02:31.030> which<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:31.720> kind<00:02:32.020> of<00:02:32.080> perfect<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:32.710> this

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
filter which is kind of perfect and this

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
normal fish rocks fish tank rocks and

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.600 
normal fish rocks fish tank rocks and
these<00:02:49.870> pots<00:02:50.200> they're<00:02:50.860> just<00:02:51.040> what<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.310> plants

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
these pots they're just what the plants

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.430 
these pots they're just what the plants
came<00:02:51.790> in<00:02:52.000> from<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.270> store<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:52.840> they<00:02:53.290> have

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
came in from the store and they have

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.870 
came in from the store and they have
holes<00:02:53.709> in<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:53.950> bottom<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.310> I<00:02:54.400> put<00:02:54.580> some<00:02:54.610> balls

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
holes in the bottom and I put some balls

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.660 
holes in the bottom and I put some balls
on<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.090> side<00:02:55.120> so<00:02:55.600> that<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.830> water<00:02:57.190> can<00:02:57.310> run

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
on the side so that the water can run

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.530 
on the side so that the water can run
through<00:02:58.150> so<00:02:59.080> my<00:02:59.770> one<00:02:59.920> concern<00:03:00.160> with<00:03:00.580> having

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
through so my one concern with having

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.180 
through so my one concern with having
these<00:03:01.660> plants<00:03:02.230> watered<00:03:02.650> this<00:03:03.040> way<00:03:05.010> was<00:03:06.010> some

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
these plants watered this way was some

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.550 
these plants watered this way was some
overflow<00:03:06.489> so<00:03:07.090> if<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.570> water<00:03:08.140> ever<00:03:08.350> does

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
overflow so if the water ever does

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.890 
overflow so if the water ever does
really<00:03:08.800> reach<00:03:09.100> above<00:03:09.760> a<00:03:09.820> breach<00:03:10.360> that<00:03:10.390> line<00:03:10.870> I

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
really reach above a breach that line I

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.750 
really reach above a breach that line I
guess

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
guess

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.229 
guess
you<00:03:12.760> know<00:03:12.880> I<00:03:13.120> put<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:13.390> hole<00:03:13.600> in<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.900> side<00:03:14.080> there

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
you know I put a hole in the side there

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.310 
you know I put a hole in the side there
for<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.300> water<00:03:16.480> to<00:03:16.690> come<00:03:16.870> out

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
for the water to come out

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.250 
for the water to come out
just<00:03:18.040> for<00:03:18.220> safety<00:03:18.580> measures<00:03:18.930> other<00:03:19.930> than<00:03:20.110> that

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
just for safety measures other than that

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.900 
just for safety measures other than that
I<00:03:20.650> don't<00:03:20.739> see<00:03:20.980> anything<00:03:21.160> really<00:03:21.370> going<00:03:21.700> wrong

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
I don't see anything really going wrong

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.949 
I don't see anything really going wrong
with<00:03:22.120> it<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:23.610> as<00:03:24.610> I<00:03:24.730> said<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:25.150> drain<00:03:25.390> is<00:03:25.600> there

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
with it and as I said the drain is there

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.060 
with it and as I said the drain is there
and<00:03:26.200> I'll<00:03:26.350> show<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:26.590> what<00:03:26.709> it<00:03:26.800> looks<00:03:26.950> like

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
and I'll show you what it looks like

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.809 
and I'll show you what it looks like
coming<00:03:27.280> out

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
coming out

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.119 
coming out
saw<00:03:27.999> it<00:03:28.239> into<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.629> tank<00:03:30.180> it<00:03:31.180> goes<00:03:31.650> so<00:03:32.650> this<00:03:33.010> is

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
saw it into the tank it goes so this is

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.500 
saw it into the tank it goes so this is
really<00:03:33.340> great<00:03:33.549> because<00:03:33.609> it<00:03:33.909> obviously<00:03:34.239> breaks

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
really great because it obviously breaks

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.030 
really great because it obviously breaks
the<00:03:34.659> surface<00:03:34.870> of<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.230> water<00:03:35.409> again

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
the surface of the water again

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.699 
the surface of the water again
creating<00:03:36.939> bubbles<00:03:37.090> and<00:03:37.989> bringing<00:03:38.349> air<00:03:38.469> down

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
creating bubbles and bringing air down

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.780 
creating bubbles and bringing air down
into<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.159> tank<00:03:40.109> there's<00:03:41.109> Fred<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.489> flower

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
into the tank there's Fred the flower

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.740 
into the tank there's Fred the flower
horn<00:03:46.139> so<00:03:47.310> on<00:03:48.310> this<00:03:48.459> side<00:03:48.730> you'll<00:03:49.389> see<00:03:49.480> that

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
horn so on this side you'll see that

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.970 
horn so on this side you'll see that
I've<00:03:49.870> done<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.109> same<00:03:50.319> but<00:03:50.560> with<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.769> bio

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
I've done the same but with the bio

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.709 
I've done the same but with the bio
wheel<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.489> small<00:03:51.819> one<00:03:52.000> I<00:03:52.030> just<00:03:52.150> put<00:03:52.329> some<00:03:52.450> plants

wheel a small one I just put some plants

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:54.449 
wheel a small one I just put some plants
in<00:03:52.930> it<00:03:53.109> there's<00:03:53.409> obviously<00:03:53.709> no<00:03:53.859> bio<00:03:54.040> wheel<00:03:54.280> on

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
in it there's obviously no bio wheel on

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.720 
in it there's obviously no bio wheel on
this<00:03:54.639> side<00:03:54.939> I<00:03:54.969> don't<00:03:55.180> need<00:03:55.419> it

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
this side I don't need it

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:04.800 
this side I don't need it
just<00:03:57.730> get<00:03:57.879> in<00:03:57.939> the<00:03:57.999> way<00:03:58.150> and<00:04:00.329> I'm<00:04:01.329> running<00:04:01.900> a<00:04:03.810> t5

this is the third step to to completion
of<00:05:03.729> excellent<00:05:04.090> filtration<00:05:04.240> so<00:05:05.280> plants<00:05:06.280> do<00:05:06.430> the

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
of excellent filtration so plants do the

step the mechanical filters can they

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:12.779 
step the mechanical filters can they
remove<00:05:08.710> all<00:05:08.889> the<00:05:09.070> other<00:05:09.190> stuff<00:05:09.970> that<00:05:10.740> the<00:05:11.789> you
