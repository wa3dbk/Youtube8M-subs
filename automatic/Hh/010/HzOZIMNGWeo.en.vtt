00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
controllers of course they're pretty

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.299 
controllers of course they're pretty
dirty<00:00:26.029> so<00:00:26.480> I'm<00:00:27.230> going<00:00:27.410> to<00:00:27.470> take<00:00:27.619> those<00:00:27.800> and<00:00:28.099> get

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:28.309 
dirty so I'm going to take those and get

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:30.790 
dirty so I'm going to take those and get
them<00:00:28.460> steamed<00:00:29.329> and<00:00:29.570> cleaned<00:00:30.230> up<00:00:30.349> before<00:00:30.500> we

make sure we don't have any wear points

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.889 
make sure we don't have any wear points
we<00:00:45.649> were<00:00:45.710> very<00:00:45.859> careful<00:00:46.190> taking<00:00:46.670> them<00:00:46.789> off<00:00:46.899> and

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
we were very careful taking them off and

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.090 
we were very careful taking them off and
we've<00:00:48.050> protected<00:00:48.260> things<00:00:48.739> with<00:00:48.920> fire

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
we've protected things with fire

we've protected things with fire
blankets<00:00:49.609> and<00:00:49.730> so<00:00:49.909> on<00:00:50.059> when<00:00:50.210> we<00:00:50.269> were<00:00:50.359> cutting

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
blankets and so on when we were cutting

blankets and so on when we were cutting
them<00:00:50.780> off<00:00:50.899> but<00:00:51.260> I<00:00:51.530> also<00:00:51.859> want<00:00:52.070> to<00:00:52.100> make<00:00:52.249> sure

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
them off but I also want to make sure

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.919 
them off but I also want to make sure
that<00:00:52.519> there<00:00:52.699> were<00:00:52.789> no<00:00:52.820> wear<00:00:53.149> marks<00:00:53.510> from<00:00:53.690> just

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
that there were no wear marks from just

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.599 
that there were no wear marks from just
when<00:00:54.109> the<00:00:54.199> truck<00:00:54.379> would<00:00:54.530> be<00:00:54.679> use<00:00:54.920> I'll<00:00:55.460> show

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:55.609 
when the truck would be use I'll show

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:58.239 
when the truck would be use I'll show
you<00:00:55.699> something<00:00:56.030> that<00:00:56.149> I<00:00:56.179> found<00:00:56.359> upfront<00:00:57.249> so

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:58.249

here's one thing that I found while

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.670 
here's one thing that I found while
looking<00:01:00.170> at<00:01:00.319> the<00:01:00.530> wiring<00:01:00.979> harnesses<00:01:05.350> in<00:01:06.350> fact

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
looking at the wiring harnesses in fact

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.980 
looking at the wiring harnesses in fact
to<00:01:06.800> be<00:01:06.890> done<00:01:07.100> so<00:01:07.850> I<00:01:07.880> found<00:01:08.150> this<00:01:08.330> for<00:01:08.570> a<00:01:08.660> harness

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
to be done so I found this for a harness

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.080 
to be done so I found this for a harness
and<00:01:09.410> it<00:01:09.470> said<00:01:09.680> aware<00:01:09.890> mark<00:01:10.160> this<00:01:10.370> was<00:01:10.640> facing

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
and it said aware mark this was facing

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.210 
and it said aware mark this was facing
in<00:01:11.210> towards<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:11.660> frame<00:01:11.960> as<00:01:12.590> you<00:01:12.710> can<00:01:12.860> see<00:01:13.010> that

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
in towards the frame as you can see that

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.780 
in towards the frame as you can see that
the<00:01:14.680> more<00:01:15.680> right<00:01:15.920> through<00:01:16.130> to<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.280> wires<00:01:16.520> but

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
the more right through to the wires but

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.250 
the more right through to the wires but
if<00:01:16.880> you<00:01:16.970> look<00:01:17.090> really<00:01:17.120> carefully<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:18.050> wires

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
if you look really carefully the wires

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.530 
if you look really carefully the wires
are<00:01:19.100> all<00:01:19.340> okay<00:01:19.700> so<00:01:19.760> we'll<00:01:20.000> be<00:01:20.150> able<00:01:20.300> to<00:01:20.390> wrap

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
are all okay so we'll be able to wrap

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.330 
are all okay so we'll be able to wrap
that<00:01:20.720> back<00:01:20.960> up<00:01:21.170> really<00:01:21.380> well<00:01:21.590> see<00:01:21.860> what<00:01:22.010> up<00:01:22.130> and

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
that back up really well see what up and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.520 
that back up really well see what up and
they<00:01:22.970> won't<00:01:23.120> have<00:01:23.180> anything<00:01:23.510> to<00:01:23.660> do<00:01:23.780> that

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.800

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
valve this is going to be routed down to

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.330 
valve this is going to be routed down to
the<00:02:21.330> axle<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.830> get<00:02:23.040> us<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.370> right<00:02:23.520> right

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
the axle to get us to the right right

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.979 
the axle to get us to the right right
one<00:02:26.340> other<00:02:26.489> thing<00:02:26.730> we've<00:02:26.880> done<00:02:27.090> this<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:27.959> the

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
one other thing we've done this is the

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.370 
one other thing we've done this is the
auto<00:02:28.260> grease<00:02:28.590> or<00:02:28.800> supply<00:02:29.160> here<00:02:29.660> going<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.870> the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
auto grease or supply here going to the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.110 
auto grease or supply here going to the
right<00:02:31.560> side<00:02:31.860> on<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.400> left<00:02:32.610> side<00:02:32.790> you'll<00:02:33.060> see

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
right side on the left side you'll see

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.509 
right side on the left side you'll see
that<00:02:33.450> underneath<00:02:33.769> we've<00:02:34.769> capped<00:02:35.130> off<00:02:35.340> the

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
that underneath we've capped off the

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.500 
that underneath we've capped off the
greasers<00:02:35.910> because<00:02:36.540> we've<00:02:36.720> got<00:02:36.840> one<00:02:36.959> less<00:02:37.140> axle

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
greasers because we've got one less axle

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.170 
greasers because we've got one less axle
while<00:02:39.510> working<00:02:39.720> on<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.930> littler<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:41.150> thought<00:02:42.150> I

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
while working on a littler I thought I

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.790 
while working on a littler I thought I
would<00:02:42.390> mention<00:02:42.570> a<00:02:43.040> practice<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.220> mine<00:02:44.459> is<00:02:44.790> to

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
would mention a practice of mine is to

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.550 
would mention a practice of mine is to
replace<00:02:46.800> Airlines<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:52.110> other<00:02:52.290> ones<00:02:52.470> that

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
replace Airlines so other ones that

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.650 
replace Airlines so other ones that
we've<00:02:52.709> taken<00:02:52.860> off<00:02:53.190> here<00:02:53.459> there's<00:02:54.090> quite<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.480> bit

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
we've taken off here there's quite a bit

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.800 
we've taken off here there's quite a bit
of<00:02:54.750> where<00:02:56.239> looks<00:02:57.239> like<00:02:57.360> they're<00:02:57.540> starting<00:02:57.780> to

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
of where looks like they're starting to

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.720 
of where looks like they're starting to
show<00:02:57.930> their<00:02:58.170> age<00:02:58.230> bit<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:58.920> it's<00:02:59.430> been<00:02:59.579> my

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
show their age bit so it's been my

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.900 
show their age bit so it's been my
practice<00:03:00.269> that<00:03:00.299> I<00:03:00.780> replace<00:03:01.680> all<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.340> lines<00:03:02.549> I

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
practice that I replace all the lines I

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.319 
practice that I replace all the lines I
like<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.329> do<00:03:04.549> just<00:03:05.549> to<00:03:05.670> make<00:03:05.700> sure<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.180> the
