00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.319
 in fishing on canvas glasses is not easy 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.540
 safety story 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.450
 as the fly flies in the face 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.019
 angler once every three seconds so 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:23.910
 when fishing on canvas they need glasses 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:26.010
 always wear different glasses 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.279
 have different properties but for 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.140
 anglers need glasses with so 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.820
 called the polarization effect 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.920
 which remove glare from the water 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.809
 let's do an experiment as far as 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.159
 is strong and polarization properties 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.260
 points costa company is behind me 

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:44.159
 camera that shoots video he 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.030
 removes the river 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:51.870
 Now we will give a picture which 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.829
 the camera takes off just now i 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.149
 take off myself 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.149
 costa glasses and bring them to the lens 

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:13.460
 see how the picture changes again 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.460
 I have now removed my glasses from a new one 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.509
 Here is an example of a video camera, we could 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.439
 make sure how high 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.240
 polarization properties of these points 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.520
 same thing while fishing 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.570
 every time we look at the water under 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.180
 different angles 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.220
 costa glasses remove excess glare and 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.860
 help us see more clearly 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.740
 picture of what is happening under water that is 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.520
 we are already starting to see algae starting 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.070
 see fish underwater terrain and thereby 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.209
 they certainly help us fishing and 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.850
 are such an essential element 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:55.799
 The cost of the firm was organized in 1983 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.310
 year professional fishing 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.860
 species 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.750
 who wanted to create high glasses 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.069
 levels that would protect not only from 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.149
 the sun we possessed high 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:07.440
 polarizing effect from now on 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.140
 the company began to occupy the leading 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.100
 position in the market of production of this 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.230
 products and reached the highest 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.569
 level in the production of points 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.370
 sun polarization for 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.870
 fishing 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.230
 what are the requirements of the angler impose 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.359
 Kachkom first is that the glasses should 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.840
 to be comfortable they should not put pressure on 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:32.700
 head is not bow not on the nose when 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.700
 this they should lie tightly on the face and 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.769
 cover from side light 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.959
 the second is the presence of a positional effect 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:44.700
 3 this UV protection 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.980
 also costa glasses have a good corr 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.470
 bore cover is a very useful thing 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.549
 is such a neoprene 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.120
 strap that helps keep your glasses on 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.519
 the neck 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.730
 thereby we can free our hands 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.590
 This is especially necessary when we tie 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.859
 fly at dusk 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.200
 in the evening at night and in glasses simply 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:10.829
 it is inconvenient cannot be done exactly 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.190
 so he casts here 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:18.049
 neoprene straps they are very comfortable 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.049
 Costa glasses are a worthy choice.
