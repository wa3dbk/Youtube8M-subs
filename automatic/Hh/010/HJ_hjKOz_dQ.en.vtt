main<00:00:46.469> library<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:47.760> let's<00:00:47.910> imagine<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.420> this

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
main library but let's imagine that this

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.720 
main library but let's imagine that this
where<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.770> says<00:00:49.920> number<00:00:50.039> six<00:00:50.370> here<00:00:50.550> let's

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
where it says number six here let's

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.360 
where it says number six here let's
imagine<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.420> says<00:00:51.660> top<00:00:51.989> 40<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:53.309> you

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
imagine that that says top 40 so you

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.510 
imagine that that says top 40 so you
would<00:00:53.550> include<00:00:53.789> all<00:00:54.030> your<00:00:54.180> top<00:00:54.390> 40<00:00:54.780> songs

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
would include all your top 40 songs

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.330 
would include all your top 40 songs
beginning<00:00:56.520> with<00:00:56.640> 60<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.120> 80<00:00:57.270> BPM<00:00:57.780> 80<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.320> 90<00:00:58.680> 90

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
beginning with 60 to 80 BPM 80 to 90 90

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.479 
beginning with 60 to 80 BPM 80 to 90 90
to<00:00:59.430> 95<00:01:00.050> 96<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.230> 100<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.710> on<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.160> forth

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
to 95 96 to 100 so on and so forth

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.640 
to 95 96 to 100 so on and so forth
through<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.449> BPM<00:01:03.870> range<00:01:04.140> okay<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.450> you<00:01:06.450> would

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
through the BPM range okay and you would

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.380 
through the BPM range okay and you would
repeat<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.710> with<00:01:08.040> each<00:01:08.250> genre<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.939> music<00:01:09.030> so

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
repeat that with each genre of music so

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.719 
repeat that with each genre of music so
you'd<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:09.659> one<00:01:09.810> for<00:01:09.990> top<00:01:10.140> forty<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.729> another

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
you'd have one for top forty and another

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.000 
you'd have one for top forty and another

only folders I would not suggest that
you<00:01:19.460> arrange<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.700> BPM<00:01:21.060> order<00:01:21.479> because<00:01:21.720> it

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
you arrange in BPM order because it

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.770 
you arrange in BPM order because it
would<00:01:21.990> really<00:01:22.409> do<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.740> no<00:01:22.860> good<00:01:22.890> as<00:01:23.220> country

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
mentioned this before in different

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.240 
mentioned this before in different
videos<00:01:36.049> it's<00:01:37.049> not<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> good<00:01:37.380> idea<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.680> mix

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
videos it's not a good idea to mix

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.950 
videos it's not a good idea to mix
country<00:01:38.640> music<00:01:38.939> because<00:01:39.210> country<00:01:39.570> folk<00:01:39.750> don't

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
country music because country folk don't

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.550 
country music because country folk don't
appreciate<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.939> BPM<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.780> make<00:01:43.320> no

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
appreciate it so the the BPM is make no

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.160 
appreciate it so the the BPM is make no
difference<00:01:44.100> it's<00:01:44.520> just<00:01:44.700> song<00:01:44.880> selection<00:01:45.390> but

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
difference it's just song selection but

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.990 
difference it's just song selection but
a<00:01:46.200> good<00:01:46.470> way<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.680> arrange<00:01:47.040> your<00:01:47.100> folders<00:01:47.520> make

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
a good way to arrange your folders make

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.370 
a good way to arrange your folders make
this<00:01:48.149> video<00:01:48.630> short<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:48.990> sweet<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.439> by<00:01:50.280> BPM<00:01:51.380> so

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
this video short and sweet is by BPM so

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.649 
this video short and sweet is by BPM so
again<00:01:52.649> let's<00:01:53.159> imagine<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.670> as<00:01:53.850> top<00:01:54.090> 40<00:01:54.420> here

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
again let's imagine this as top 40 here

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.230 
again let's imagine this as top 40 here
and<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.439> would<00:01:55.560> simply<00:01:55.770> arrange<00:01:56.340> them<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:56.790> BPM

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
and you would simply arrange them in BPM

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.450 
and you would simply arrange them in BPM
order<00:01:58.100> BPM<00:01:59.100> order<00:01:59.840> or<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:02.159> would<00:02:02.250> do<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
order BPM order or and you would do the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.060 
order BPM order or and you would do the
same<00:02:02.670> for<00:02:02.850> each<00:02:02.939> genre<00:02:02.969> music<00:02:03.600> hip-hop

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
same for each genre music hip-hop

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.889 
same for each genre music hip-hop
old-school<00:02:05.070> top<00:02:05.909> 40<00:02:06.329> etc<00:02:07.170> etc<00:02:07.700> freestyle

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
old-school top 40 etc etc freestyle

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.910 
old-school top 40 etc etc freestyle
however<00:02:09.899> many<00:02:10.080> folders<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.560> want<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.770> make

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
however many folders you want to make

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.710 
however many folders you want to make
it's<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.160> good<00:02:11.340> way<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.489> arrange<00:02:11.940> them<00:02:12.180> it's

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
it's a good way to arrange them it's

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.770 
it's a good way to arrange them it's
also<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.170> good<00:02:13.349> idea

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
also a good idea

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.050 
also a good idea
to<00:02:14.530> do<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.770> same<00:02:15.040> thing<00:02:15.280> on<00:02:15.400> your<00:02:15.520> main<00:02:15.730> hard
