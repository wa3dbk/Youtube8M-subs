00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
highly anabolic and you put on weight

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.719 
highly anabolic and you put on weight
man<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.450> just<00:01:06.570> would<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.340> get<00:01:08.340> strong<00:01:08.700> and

man you just would just get strong and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.940 
man you just would just get strong and
you<00:01:09.060> just<00:01:09.240> get<00:01:09.420> huge<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.290> when<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.619> went<00:01:10.860> off

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
you just get huge and when you went off

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.929 
you just get huge and when you went off
you<00:01:11.400> shrunk<00:01:11.729> back<00:01:11.909> down<00:01:13.729> creatine<00:01:14.729> ethyl

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939

ester<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:16.020> compared<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:17.540> an<00:01:18.540> ax<00:01:18.600> bar

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
ester I compared that to like an ax bar

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.789 
ester I compared that to like an ax bar
Anna<00:01:20.000> bar<00:01:21.000> was<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> highly<00:01:21.900> anabolic<00:01:22.820> drug

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
Anna bar was a highly anabolic drug

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.649 
Anna bar was a highly anabolic drug
which<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:26.189> would<00:01:26.369> put<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.670> quality<00:01:27.299> size

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
which you would put on quality size

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.890 
which you would put on quality size
quality<00:01:28.409> muscle<00:01:29.090> you<00:01:30.090> wouldn't<00:01:30.420> blow<00:01:30.689> it

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
quality muscle you wouldn't blow it

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.020 
quality muscle you wouldn't blow it
wouldn't<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.350> any<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.369> know<00:01:32.400> oily

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
wouldn't have any of the you know oily

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.060 
wouldn't have any of the you know oily
skin<00:01:33.479> or<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> testicle<00:01:34.380> shrinkage<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.009> all

skin or the testicle shrinkage and all
that<00:01:35.280> other<00:01:35.430> stuff<00:01:35.900> so<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.520> lot<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.549> people<00:01:38.729> that

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
that other stuff so a lot of people that

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.149 
that other stuff so a lot of people that
didn't<00:01:39.900> want<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.110> get<00:01:40.259> super<00:01:40.590> big<00:01:40.799> would<00:01:40.979> take

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
didn't want to get super big would take

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.740 
didn't want to get super big would take
an<00:01:41.369> ax<00:01:41.430> bar<00:01:41.729> or<00:01:41.939> they're<00:01:42.119> cutting<00:01:42.509> they<00:01:42.630> would

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
an ax bar or they're cutting they would

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.440 
an ax bar or they're cutting they would
take<00:01:42.930> an<00:01:43.110> ax<00:01:43.140> bar<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:44.159> keep<00:01:44.369> them<00:01:44.640> solid<00:01:45.240> cuz

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
take an ax bar to keep them solid cuz

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.109 
take an ax bar to keep them solid cuz
when<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.750> get<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.990> gains<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.439> went<00:01:47.340> off<00:01:47.460> you

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
when you get the gains you went off you

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.620 
when you get the gains you went off you
keep<00:01:48.390> them<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.049> that's<00:01:49.770> how<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:49.979> compared

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
keep them so that's how I compared

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.950 
keep them so that's how I compared

I<00:02:13.709> didn't<00:02:14.250> know<00:02:14.310> what<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.849> expect<00:02:15.480> so<00:02:16.200> I

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
I didn't know what to expect so I

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.430 
I didn't know what to expect so I
started<00:02:16.650> out<00:02:16.709> just<00:02:16.739> taking<00:02:17.220> two<00:02:17.370> tabs<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.849> day

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
started out just taking two tabs a day

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.130 
started out just taking two tabs a day
for<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:20.569> forced<00:02:21.569> week<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:23.959> within<00:02:24.959> a<00:02:25.110> couple

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
for the forced week and within a couple

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.680 
for the forced week and within a couple
days<00:02:25.560> man<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.010> could<00:02:26.700> feel<00:02:26.909> a<00:02:26.940> total<00:02:27.299> difference

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
days man I could feel a total difference

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.030 
days man I could feel a total difference
and<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.799> wasn't<00:02:29.069> a<00:02:29.220> placebo<00:02:29.700> effect<00:02:30.030> because<00:02:31.040> I

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
and it wasn't a placebo effect because I

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.149 
and it wasn't a placebo effect because I
had<00:02:32.849> more<00:02:33.060> energy<00:02:33.319> to<00:02:34.319> go<00:02:34.470> along<00:02:34.709> in<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:34.950> gym

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
had more energy to go along in the gym

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.710 
had more energy to go along in the gym
and<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.489> got<00:02:35.640> actually<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.030> little<00:02:36.269> bit<00:02:36.390> stronger

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
and I got actually a little bit stronger

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.649 
and I got actually a little bit stronger
and<00:02:37.129> I<00:02:38.129> was<00:02:38.250> looking<00:02:38.940> up<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.120> lot<00:02:39.269> of<00:02:39.360> stuff<00:02:39.540> and

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
and I was looking up a lot of stuff and

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:40.759 
and I was looking up a lot of stuff and
I'm<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.900> might<00:02:40.140> have<00:02:40.260> had<00:02:40.319> a<00:02:40.379> creatine

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
I'm I might have had a creatine

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.940 
I'm I might have had a creatine
deficiency<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.879> take<00:02:42.599> a<00:02:42.629> water<00:02:42.959> pill<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.590> I

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
deficiency I take a water pill so I I

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.770 
deficiency I take a water pill so I I
piss<00:02:44.340> out<00:02:44.489> a<00:02:44.519> lot<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.730> vitamins<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.569> minerals

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
piss out a lot of vitamins and minerals

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.300 
piss out a lot of vitamins and minerals
and<00:02:46.170> all<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.410> other<00:02:46.560> stuff<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:47.069> it<00:02:47.160> probably

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
and all that other stuff so it probably

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.729 
and all that other stuff so it probably
pees<00:02:47.700> out<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:48.030> creatine<00:02:48.769> so<00:02:51.440> that's<00:02:52.440> for<00:02:52.650> my

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
pees out the creatine so that's for my

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.130 
pees out the creatine so that's for my
high<00:02:52.859> blood<00:02:53.040> pressure<00:02:53.370> but<00:02:54.000> when<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:54.900> start

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
high blood pressure but when I start

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.530 
high blood pressure but when I start
taking<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:56.730> know<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.940> creatine<00:02:57.390> ethyl

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
taking the you know the creatine ethyl

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.440 
taking the you know the creatine ethyl
ester<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.319> then<00:02:59.159> I<00:02:59.340> went<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.640> three<00:02:59.909> tabs<00:03:00.180> a

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
ester and then I went to three tabs a

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.920 
ester and then I went to three tabs a
day<00:03:01.190> I<00:03:02.190> stayed<00:03:03.000> on<00:03:03.030> that<00:03:03.359> for<00:03:03.599> like<00:03:03.720> two<00:03:03.750> weeks

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930
