less stress for people commuting I'm

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.749 
less stress for people commuting I'm
sure<00:01:12.299> there<00:01:12.630> will<00:01:12.659> be<00:01:12.869> some<00:01:13.759> difficulties

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
sure there will be some difficulties

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.719 
sure there will be some difficulties
that<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.000> don't<00:01:15.270> anticipate<00:01:16.130> at<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.460> point

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
that we don't anticipate at this point

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.289 
that we don't anticipate at this point
but<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:19.170> appears<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.649> me<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:20.299> self-driving

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
but it appears to me that self-driving

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.830 
but it appears to me that self-driving
cars<00:01:21.689> are<00:01:21.960> likely<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:23.060> work<00:01:24.060> their<00:01:24.329> way<00:01:24.479> into

cars are likely to work their way into

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.249 
cars are likely to work their way into
our<00:01:25.350> lives<00:01:25.770> more<00:01:26.460> quickly<00:01:26.789> than<00:01:27.210> people<00:01:28.020> might

our lives more quickly than people might
have<00:01:28.289> thought<00:01:28.439> just<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.100> couple<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.520> years<00:01:29.759> ago

have thought just a couple of years ago
they<00:01:30.990> represent<00:01:32.659> one<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.960> many<00:01:34.229> examples<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:35.130> a

larger trim that you alluded to I write

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.270 
larger trim that you alluded to I write
about<00:01:38.789> robo<00:01:39.329> sourcing<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.990> new<00:01:40.259> level<00:01:41.189> of

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
another quick example there is a new

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.570 
another quick example there is a new
algorithm<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:23.700> some<00:02:23.970> law<00:02:24.240> firms<00:02:24.630> are

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
algorithm that some law firms are

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.700 
algorithm that some law firms are
beginning<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.760> use<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:27.810> makes<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.470> possible

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
beginning to use that makes it possible

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.330 
beginning to use that makes it possible
for<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.250> single<00:02:29.850> first-year<00:02:30.540> lawyer<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:31.860> do<00:02:32.070> as

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
for a single first-year lawyer to do as

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.870 
for a single first-year lawyer to do as
much<00:02:32.700> research<00:02:32.730> as<00:02:33.440> used<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.530> require<00:02:34.880> 500

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
much research as used to require 500

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.420 
much research as used to require 500
first-year<00:02:36.750> lawyers<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:38.100> number<00:02:38.370> of

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
first-year lawyers and the number of

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.810 
first-year lawyers and the number of
mistakes<00:02:38.790> goes<00:02:39.210> way<00:02:39.570> down<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:41.250> legal

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
mistakes goes way down so the legal

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.930 
mistakes goes way down so the legal
research<00:02:42.210> again<00:02:42.930> like<00:02:43.260> driving<00:02:43.740> a<00:02:43.830> car<00:02:44.070> is<00:02:44.310> an

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
research again like driving a car is an

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.020 
research again like driving a car is an
example<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.750> work<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.680> we<00:02:47.520> would<00:02:47.700> have<00:02:47.820> all

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
example of work that we would have all

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.960 
example of work that we would have all
thought<00:02:48.440> wasn't<00:02:49.440> going<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.740> be<00:02:49.830> replaced<00:02:50.310> by

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
thought wasn't going to be replaced by

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.080 
thought wasn't going to be replaced by
computers<00:02:51.810> very<00:02:52.050> quickly<00:02:52.290> but<00:02:53.070> it<00:02:53.340> now<00:02:53.880> is

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
computers very quickly but it now is

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.510 
computers very quickly but it now is
being<00:02:54.420> replaced<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.440> lots<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.280> other<00:02:56.430> things

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
being replaced and lots of other things

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.120 
being replaced and lots of other things
are<00:02:56.910> too
