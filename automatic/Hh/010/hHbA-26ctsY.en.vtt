00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
people think about data and about

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.610 
people think about data and about
storage<00:01:38.120> so<00:01:38.420> that<00:01:38.600> you<00:01:39.080> know<00:01:39.170> they<00:01:39.320> stopped

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
storage so that you know they stopped

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.080 
storage so that you know they stopped
thinking<00:01:39.979> of<00:01:40.070> it<00:01:40.159> as<00:01:40.250> just<00:01:40.280> something<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:41.000> be

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
thinking of it as just something to be

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.360 
thinking of it as just something to be
passively<00:01:41.540> stored<00:01:41.990> away<00:01:42.140> it's<00:01:42.950> something

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
passively stored away it's something

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.180 
passively stored away it's something
that<00:01:43.550> is<00:01:43.820> dynamic<00:01:44.210> and<00:01:44.750> living<00:01:45.200> and<00:01:45.500> can<00:01:46.070> be
