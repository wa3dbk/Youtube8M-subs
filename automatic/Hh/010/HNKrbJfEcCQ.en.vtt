00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
machine here is a three speed machine so

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.620 
machine here is a three speed machine so
Lister<00:01:33.200> British<00:01:33.619> machine<00:01:34.039> and<00:01:34.609> it's<00:01:35.450> got<00:01:35.600> a

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
Lister British machine and it's got a

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.310 
Lister British machine and it's got a
solid<00:01:35.810> drop<00:01:36.200> tube<00:01:36.469> on<00:01:36.619> it<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.749> then<00:01:38.749> this<00:01:38.929> had

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
solid drop tube on it and then this had

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.679 
solid drop tube on it and then this had
touches<00:01:39.710> onto<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.039> handpiece<00:01:40.549> it's<00:01:41.539> got<00:01:41.659> a

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
touches onto the handpiece it's got a

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.020 
touches onto the handpiece it's got a
worm<00:01:41.929> drive<00:01:42.259> on<00:01:42.679> the<00:01:43.009> attachment<00:01:43.490> here<00:01:43.609> so<00:01:43.939> we

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
worm drive on the attachment here so we

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.239 
worm drive on the attachment here so we
can<00:01:44.179> just<00:01:44.359> put<00:01:44.570> that<00:01:44.689> on<00:01:44.859> turn<00:01:45.859> the<00:01:45.920> machine<00:01:46.219> on

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:46.249
