00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.980
 Raquel a politically comedian 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.380
 incorrect and that why 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.960
 I do not know, I guess it's the humor that 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.670
 I really like that we already have a lot 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.739
 nonsense with this correction 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.590
 Politics has happened I think 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.300
 if we are also in a country where 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.340
 you say one thing that most do not 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.739
 like does not like socially then in 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.839
 private tell us what he likes and he 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.739
 they jump a lot then they do not 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:02.379
 like black humor is racist 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.239
 but totally I do not think that humor 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.369
 Black has his audience and I understand that 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.810
 there are people who do not like it but 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.520
 we must also recognize that we are in 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.830
 a society or a little bit hypocritical is 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.210
 say we say a joke for example of 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.649
 irene villa in public and is a 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.539
 outrageous but who has not counted 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.280
 never a joke or have you heard him tell a 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:21.340
 friend in a group you consider that 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.950
 a certain dose of violence is necessary 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.610
 for the education of children for 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.740
 adult life noses that life there is that 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.780
 kind of things there have to be if you 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.420
 I am sincere to me I would like that although 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.119
 it was not necessary or to be seen in the 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.460
 day to day but yes it is true that there 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.990
 violence and I always defend the same 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.100
 I'm funny, so the things that 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.900
 I do not like 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.610
 exists with them to denounce 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.740
 complaints for example racism to a 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.020
 racist joke from my point of view 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.340
 person means that I do not like it 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.770
 the race upside down is mayor was 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.509
 initiating that racism is a form of 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.979
 realize first we laugh and then 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.509
 you think about saying I fled what 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.149
 I just laughed and then it's when you 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.549
 you think about the problem the humor can 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:07.930
 be a way to transform society 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:09.300
 somehow you do not have to 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.860
 transform it would be a hecatomb 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.330
 alc치zar see and is always the same is 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.519
 much harder to make laugh than to do 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.680
 cry of organisms but good 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.300
 we are a minor genre and we are not well 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.000
 seen as clowns 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.220
 sir that comedians are comics that follow 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.130
 being seen more are very badly seen 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:33.200
 anal about everything there is also much much 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.630
 problem at the time of when a woman 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.800
 sos is the comic we have many 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.810
 problems when it comes to bars 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.760
 contract us and that why then because 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.620
 they say that the woman does not really like 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.000
 done and started the monologues well I do 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.320
 three played joke very beast how much 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.730
 people are laughing I say that the 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.260
 woman we do not make fun but both 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.940
 are laughing at the scripts in the 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.910
 access to bars and ravines or to whom 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.080
 Look for thick and thin are the 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.510
 best friends are juan and dami치n 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.040
 hierarchs and ravines and are the 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.420
 writers also very good almost all 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.150
 they usually make them we lie down 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.560
 one hand and such but almost everyone knows 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.350
 do them and we are very many 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.110
 screenwriters like that 14 or 15 and screenwriter 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.480
 mogoll칩n but it is a daily program with 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.220
 many things many sections and 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.100
 when you were an official of 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.990
 library 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.290
 how could you be silent so long 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:23.439
 there the library can not be 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.900
 they would be studying their creations in the 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:27.189
 silence of the library in the 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.019
 library the truth is that it seems not 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:31.269
 but we have a lot of work does not give you 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.500
 time to nothing to stop I have always 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.269
 seen the libraries as a bit of 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.310
 supermarkets of books in the sense 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.200
 that go with the trolleys or I work 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.780
 once in a supermarket and you have to 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.780
 place you have to replenish truth in the 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.670
 Supermarket 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.020
 If you see it, I love working 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.430
 library anyway today the 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.400
 library is evolving a lot no longer 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.440
 it is merely a site 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.690
 let's expose books catch 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.280
 with the new technologies you can do 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.500
 a mogoll칩n of things in a library 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.390
 is to consult ancient funds are they 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.120
 digitizing and it's a way to access 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.030
 to them because 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.129
 touch a book to better the 17th century 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.390
 quite complicated not but then by 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:15.140
 example the paper is always there 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.280
 let's say that with electronics the 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.979
 supports vary 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:23.120
 there was a lot and the paper is the same paper 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:24.710
 of five centuries ago now has good 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.880
 has not changed enough has changed 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:31.910
 quite the role of now but it gets 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.410
 most relevant will be yellow before and if 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.680
 you do they will continue here talking about 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:40.460
 paper in the dealer I think that 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.930
 In addition, the technique advances so much that 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.030
 He does not tell you to get ready tomorrow 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.949
 some glasses and there we are reading the 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.100
 books I think it's going to be the future of 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.900
 do you like to read to you as it is 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.580
 complicated the other day I said that the 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.610
 Quixote seems boring and gave me 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.990
 a lot of criticism but I do not think 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.330
 understood well what he said we are 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.690
 talking about entertainment literature and 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.699
 I am very comic of current novel and 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.870
 for example yes I like classics 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:06.830
 that I think do not go out of style as 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.420
 shakespeare 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.430
 spirit you take the same one in your 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.160
 comedies and remains to be 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.950
 increased something owner baby 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.780
 the july verne july verne is also you 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.430
 you take a book of july verne and you follow 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.800
 enjoying what is not boring and 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.020
 Tedious to read read porn is boring 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.760
 it's better the frank movie is 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.090
 practice but she directly since 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.620
 you put yourself do not know today the one who has not done 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.340
 a lot of damage in the relationships of 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.250
 partner 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.860
 porn buenos aires where I think that 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.050
 is everything as it is worldwide in all 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.270
 perfect bodies all sizes 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.190
 impressive and then comes the pure 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.810
 reality and perfect bodies and sizes 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.810
 awesome it seems to me mind that they pass 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.569
 the monologists also 6 and 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:56.189
 idealization of reality 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:59.219
 realization I suppose that each one more than 

00:05:56.189 --> 00:06:01.000
 perform we will be critical we see carry 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:06.950
 to the dark point 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.840
 above all dark point of criticizing and of 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.270
 things that everyone use it 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.250
 take out the bad lace for realms and 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.790
 rajoy because they live produces us so much 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.420
 laugh let's go 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.980
 it's not that it does not produce but it 's true that 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.250
 many jokes are made with rajoy 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:27.280
 mariano etc well I think they are made 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:30.220
 jokes with all the politicians but 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.480
 Rajoy seems to have earned it a 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:35.810
 little bit more free 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.340
 but I do not know I think at the end 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.750
 we do it with everyone, it does not matter 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.830
 that was mariano rajoy was 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.230
 whoever we would be doing 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.180
 jokes and nothing else also took 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.110
 a few jokes took a lot 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.300
 and it's more 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.920
 Hitler before becoming what he 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.170
 converted was the jester they were laughing 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.400
 all cartoonists of his day that is 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.900
 that I believe in the end when a person 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.030
 is there 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.220
 in the spotlight you always have to do 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.720
 jokes says a friend of mine john 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.010
 I made it from the communicators of 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.600
 television but euros or you can 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.960
 extend to politicians says that if not 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.160
 you are bleu doll you can not work in 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.190
 television is to say that you are going to make a 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.930
 doll of yours and then recognize everything 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.760
 himself is going to make his hitler doll and 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.380
 It is well known that the shoemaker 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.910
 He also has a very bl칠 doll face 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.910
 when people do not laugh like that 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:23.270
 first thing that happens to you because you feel that 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:25.430
 It's land, totally swallow me, what are the 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:28.460
 Rachel's strategies when a 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:30.890
 moment before that audience in order that 

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.180
 sometimes sometimes happens sometimes happens besides 

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.060
 the committee says it has never happened 

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:37.280
 that lies 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:40.099
 that silence if it still does not happen anymore 

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.770
 what they are very good is good for us 

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:44.930
 It's a long time I just have my tricks and 

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:47.090
 I see that simply the subject that I am 

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.440
 touching step to another and if not 

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.909
 fancy the monologue for whatever 

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.340
 then try to improvise with 

00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:55.370
 them to make games that swim that 

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:58.539
 caution friend leads and see you in 

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.539
 the next goal
