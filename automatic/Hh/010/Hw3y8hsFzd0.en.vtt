00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
contrast to color kind of goes a long

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.219 
contrast to color kind of goes a long
ways<00:01:02.329> so<00:01:03.329> here<00:01:03.510> they're<00:01:03.630> still<00:01:03.810> going<00:01:04.079> with

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
ways so here they're still going with

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.590 
ways so here they're still going with
that<00:01:04.379> darker<00:01:04.710> green<00:01:04.920> kind<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.339> top<00:01:08.570> there<00:01:09.570> you

and if you've seen other videos where
i've<00:01:30.180> used<00:01:30.450> use<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> comb<00:01:31.409> for<00:01:31.440> stripes<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.190> is

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
i've used use a comb for stripes this is

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.880 
i've used use a comb for stripes this is
the<00:01:32.370> same<00:01:32.790> technique<00:01:33.330> here<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:34.320> can<00:01:34.500> use<00:01:34.680> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the same technique here you can use the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.760 
the same technique here you can use the
stencil<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.370> you<00:01:35.580> have<00:01:35.729> stripes<00:01:36.060> cut<00:01:36.299> into

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.260 

and<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:40.920> make<00:01:41.070> sure<00:01:41.250> if<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.610> do<00:01:41.790> use<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> comb

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
and just make sure if you do use a comb

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.000 
and just make sure if you do use a comb
to<00:01:42.420> wipe<00:01:42.570> off<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.080> the<00:01:43.350> side<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.740> was<00:01:43.860> just

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
to wipe off the the side that was just

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.010 
to wipe off the the side that was just
previously<00:01:44.490> done<00:01:44.700> otherwise<00:01:45.030> it'll<00:01:45.390> kind<00:01:45.930> of

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
previously done otherwise it'll kind of

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.380 
previously done otherwise it'll kind of
smudge<00:01:46.610> smear<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.790> side<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.150> the<00:01:48.210> bait

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
smudge smear on the side of the bait

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.920 
smudge smear on the side of the bait
that<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.350> opposite<00:01:49.680> side<00:01:49.890> here<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.840> now<00:01:51.840> I'm

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
that the opposite side here so now I'm

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.320 
that the opposite side here so now I'm
going<00:01:52.080> to<00:01:52.170> go<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.650> just<00:01:52.799> kind<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.130> blend

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
going to go and just kind of blend

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.690 

then<00:02:55.349> I<00:02:55.440> always<00:02:55.650> heat<00:02:55.860> set<00:02:56.069> it<00:02:56.220> before<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.610> take

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
then I always heat set it before I take

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.630 
then I always heat set it before I take
the<00:02:57.030> masking<00:02:57.480> off<00:02:57.630> to<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.989> scale<00:02:58.459> so<00:02:59.459> they

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
the masking off to the scale so they

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.729 
the masking off to the scale so they
kind<00:03:00.060> of<00:03:00.120> see<00:03:00.299> it<00:03:00.420> kind<00:03:01.230> of<00:03:01.260> hard<00:03:01.380> to<00:03:01.470> see

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
kind of see it kind of hard to see

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.229 
kind of see it kind of hard to see
doesn't<00:03:02.489> really<00:03:02.610> come<00:03:02.790> into<00:03:02.819> focus<00:03:03.150> very<00:03:03.510> well

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
doesn't really come into focus very well

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.690 
doesn't really come into focus very well
the<00:03:06.239> gold<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:07.709> gold<00:03:07.739> kind<00:03:08.130> of<00:03:08.190> pops<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.519> little

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
the gold the gold kind of pops a little

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.610 
the gold the gold kind of pops a little
more<00:03:08.819> after<00:03:09.030> clear<00:03:09.690> coats<00:03:09.900> been<00:03:10.049> applied<00:03:10.319> to<00:03:10.349> I

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
the bottom where the green kind of went

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.309 
the bottom where the green kind of went
down<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.239> sides<00:03:18.480> which<00:03:18.780> just<00:03:18.930> kind<00:03:19.049> of<00:03:19.140> add<00:03:19.290> a
