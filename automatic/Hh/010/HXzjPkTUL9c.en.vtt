work your way back further course many
more<00:02:20.660> people<00:02:20.960> could<00:02:21.140> have<00:02:21.260> fit<00:02:21.410> this<00:02:21.560> but

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
more people could have fit this but

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.470 
more people could have fit this but
Jesus<00:02:22.070> had<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.640> know<00:02:22.730> much<00:02:22.970> more<00:02:23.000> credentials

Abraham to David are fourteen

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.430 
Abraham to David are fourteen

generations<00:02:48.200> I<00:02:48.890> think<00:02:49.160> he<00:02:49.220> wrote<00:02:49.370> that<00:02:49.550> really

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
generations I think he wrote that really

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.640 
generations I think he wrote that really
just<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.060> help<00:02:50.180> people<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.750> memorize<00:02:51.380> that

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
just to help people to memorize that

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.470 
just to help people to memorize that
because<00:02:52.340> there<00:02:52.520> are<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:52.640> few<00:02:52.850> folks<00:02:53.090> missing

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
because there are a few folks missing

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.510 
because there are a few folks missing
actually<00:02:53.870> from<00:02:54.170> Jesus<00:02:54.500> genealogy<00:02:54.770> here<00:02:55.370> and

it's not exactly 14 in every case that's

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.070 
it's not exactly 14 in every case that's
not<00:02:58.550> important<00:02:59.000> that<00:02:59.150> doesn't<00:02:59.510> help<00:02:59.660> us<00:02:59.870> to

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
not important that doesn't help us to

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.750 
not important that doesn't help us to
make<00:03:00.110> disciples<00:03:00.560> so<00:03:01.070> we're<00:03:01.430> not<00:03:01.520> going<00:03:01.670> to

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
Joseph was called in Scripture inspired

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.320 
Joseph was called in Scripture inspired
by<00:04:49.510> the<00:04:49.570> Holy<00:04:49.780> Spirit<00:04:50.260> a<00:04:50.380> righteous<00:04:51.100> man<00:04:51.330> we

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
by the Holy Spirit a righteous man we

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.150 
by the Holy Spirit a righteous man we
think<00:04:52.570> of<00:04:52.660> a<00:04:52.780> righteous<00:04:53.260> man<00:04:53.290> as<00:04:53.680> someone<00:04:54.010> who

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
think of a righteous man as someone who

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.180 
think of a righteous man as someone who
keeps<00:04:54.880> the<00:04:55.270> law<00:04:55.450> down<00:04:55.930> to<00:04:56.200> the<00:04:56.350> last<00:04:56.590> jot<00:04:57.010> and

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
keeps the law down to the last jot and

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.610 
keeps the law down to the last jot and
tittle<00:04:57.370> we<00:04:57.940> know<00:04:58.150> that<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.600> law<00:04:58.780> of<00:04:58.810> Moses<00:04:59.440> in

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
tittle we know that the law of Moses in

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.670 
tittle we know that the law of Moses in
the<00:04:59.650> Book<00:05:00.070> of<00:05:00.190> Leviticus<00:05:00.250> it<00:05:01.150> required

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
the Book of Leviticus it required

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.290 
the Book of Leviticus it required
adulteresses<00:05:02.680> and<00:05:02.919> adulterers<00:05:03.430> to<00:05:03.760> be<00:05:03.910> stoned

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
adulteresses and adulterers to be stoned

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.530 
adulteresses and adulterers to be stoned
and<00:05:04.630> that's<00:05:04.930> what<00:05:05.140> Joseph<00:05:05.950> assumed<00:05:06.550> having<00:05:07.419> no

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
and that's what Joseph assumed having no

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.000 
and that's what Joseph assumed having no
better<00:05:07.720> knowledge<00:05:07.930> that<00:05:08.290> she<00:05:08.320> was<00:05:08.590> guilty<00:05:08.800> of

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
better knowledge that she was guilty of

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.480 
better knowledge that she was guilty of
and<00:05:09.340> so<00:05:09.880> he<00:05:10.030> had<00:05:10.350> every<00:05:11.350> legal<00:05:11.830> right<00:05:12.010> to

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
and so he had every legal right to

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.310 
and so he had every legal right to
expose<00:05:13.390> her<00:05:13.690> and<00:05:13.930> to<00:05:14.590> demand<00:05:14.890> the<00:05:15.610> penalty<00:05:16.120> of

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
expose her and to demand the penalty of

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.110 
expose her and to demand the penalty of
what<00:05:17.320> the<00:05:17.470> law<00:05:17.650> prescribed<00:05:18.310> we<00:05:18.790> don't<00:05:18.910> really

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
what the law prescribed we don't really

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.320 
what the law prescribed we don't really
know<00:05:19.450> if<00:05:19.720> the<00:05:20.320> Jews<00:05:20.590> were<00:05:20.620> even<00:05:21.220> keeping<00:05:22.150> those

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
know if the Jews were even keeping those

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.850 
know if the Jews were even keeping those
kind<00:05:22.660> of<00:05:22.750> prescriptions<00:05:23.350> and<00:05:23.530> stoning

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
kind of prescriptions and stoning

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.440 
kind of prescriptions and stoning
adulterers<00:05:24.100> and<00:05:24.580> adulteresses<00:05:24.730> but

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
adulterers and adulteresses but

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.360 
adulterers and adulteresses but
nevertheless<00:05:25.690> he<00:05:26.380> didn't<00:05:26.710> want<00:05:26.919> to<00:05:27.040> see<00:05:27.220> her

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
nevertheless he didn't want to see her

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.560 
nevertheless he didn't want to see her
disgraced<00:05:27.850> because<00:05:28.690> he<00:05:29.140> was<00:05:29.290> a<00:05:29.320> righteous<00:05:30.010> man

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
disgraced because he was a righteous man

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.300 
disgraced because he was a righteous man
and<00:05:31.570> so<00:05:31.750> we<00:05:32.080> get<00:05:32.260> a<00:05:32.290> little<00:05:32.500> insight<00:05:33.280> into

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
and so we get a little insight into

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.430 
and so we get a little insight into
righteousness<00:05:34.030> here<00:05:34.690> that<00:05:34.930> I<00:05:34.960> think<00:05:35.320> is

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
righteousness here that I think is

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.960 
righteousness here that I think is
really<00:05:35.470> interesting<00:05:37.320> righteousness<00:05:38.320> doesn't

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
really interesting righteousness doesn't

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.170 
really interesting righteousness doesn't
necessarily<00:05:39.970> want<00:05:40.330> sin<00:05:41.080> to<00:05:41.380> be<00:05:41.410> exposed

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
necessarily want sin to be exposed

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.530 
necessarily want sin to be exposed
righteousness<00:05:43.180> still<00:05:43.870> is<00:05:44.229> motivated<00:05:45.010> by<00:05:45.010> love

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540 
righteousness still is motivated by love

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.570 
righteousness still is motivated by love
we<00:05:46.540> know<00:05:46.660> that<00:05:46.810> God<00:05:47.050> is<00:05:47.410> righteous<00:05:48.190> right

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
we know that God is righteous right

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.370 
we know that God is righteous right
there's<00:05:48.880> nobody<00:05:49.240> more<00:05:49.300> righteous<00:05:49.960> than<00:05:49.990> God

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
there's nobody more righteous than God

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.820 
there's nobody more righteous than God
