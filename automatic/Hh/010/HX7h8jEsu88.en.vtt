the<00:00:57.870> best<00:00:57.949> audit<00:00:58.949> better<00:00:59.280> than<00:00:59.780> rather<00:01:00.780> than

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
the best audit better than rather than

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.950 
the best audit better than rather than
better<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.640> best<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.089> can<00:01:03.239> be<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.600> think

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
better the best that we can be I think

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.540 
better the best that we can be I think
that<00:01:04.080> for<00:01:04.199> teachers<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.769> also<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.339> very

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
that for teachers is also that is very

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.950 
that for teachers is also that is very
personal<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.090> very<00:01:06.270> unique<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> sense

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
personal it's very unique in the sense

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.779 
personal it's very unique in the sense
that<00:01:07.259> nobody<00:01:08.190> can<00:01:08.400> move<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.820> way<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.149> you<00:01:09.300> do

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:13.789 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:16.639 

every<00:01:14.789> obstacle<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.930> stepping<00:01:16.259> stone

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
every obstacle is that stepping stone

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.650 
every obstacle is that stepping stone
which<00:01:16.860> allows<00:01:17.160> you<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.670> leave<00:01:17.850> farther<00:01:18.509> and

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
which allows you to leave farther and

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.910 
which allows you to leave farther and
greater<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.140> catch<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.590> higher<00:01:19.800> edge<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:22.770> way

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
greater to catch the higher edge the way

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.840 
greater to catch the higher edge the way
in<00:01:22.979> which<00:01:23.160> you<00:01:23.360> see<00:01:24.360> obstacles<00:01:25.520> rather<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:26.700> an

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
in which you see obstacles rather as an

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.669 
in which you see obstacles rather as an
obstacle<00:01:27.000> or<00:01:27.450> more<00:01:27.780> than<00:01:27.899> ops+<00:01:28.320> rather<00:01:28.530> an

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
obstacle or more than ops+ rather an

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:29.660 
obstacle or more than ops+ rather an
opportunity

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
opportunity

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.340 
opportunity
something<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.240> will<00:01:30.390> help<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.840> develop

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
something that will help you develop

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.380 
something that will help you develop
yourself<00:01:31.680> stronger<00:01:32.520> mentally<00:01:32.909> physically

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
yourself stronger mentally physically

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.790 
yourself stronger mentally physically
spiritually<00:01:33.890> to

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
spiritually to

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.000 
spiritually to
lose<00:01:36.250> yourself<00:01:36.400> up<00:01:36.820> to<00:01:36.970> the<00:01:37.030> next<00:01:37.210> step<00:01:40.950> yeah<00:01:41.950> I

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
lose yourself up to the next step yeah I

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.980 
lose yourself up to the next step yeah I
guess<00:01:42.280> it's<00:01:42.820> very<00:01:43.090> hard<00:01:43.330> to<00:01:43.390> understand<00:01:43.840> hard

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
guess it's very hard to understand hard

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.810 
guess it's very hard to understand hard
work<00:01:44.230> in<00:01:44.350> practice<00:01:44.590> but<00:01:44.980> it's<00:01:45.130> just<00:01:45.280> that<00:01:45.460> idea

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
work in practice but it's just that idea

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.460 
work in practice but it's just that idea
of<00:01:45.940> really<00:01:46.180> embracing<00:01:46.720> every<00:01:46.900> obstacle<00:01:47.170> for

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
of really embracing every obstacle for

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.390 
of really embracing every obstacle for
what<00:01:47.620> it<00:01:47.710> is

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
what it is

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.990 
what it is
out<00:01:50.150> of<00:01:50.330> that<00:01:50.950> it's<00:01:51.950> all<00:01:52.250> going<00:01:52.460> to<00:01:52.490> be<00:01:52.550> lessons

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
out of that it's all going to be lessons

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.270 
out of that it's all going to be lessons
are<00:01:53.180> gonna<00:01:53.480> be<00:01:53.540> possible<00:01:53.960> whatever<00:01:54.380> positive

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
are gonna be possible whatever positive

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.440 
are gonna be possible whatever positive
to<00:01:55.370> negative<00:01:55.400> the<00:01:55.760> experience<00:01:56.210> it's<00:01:56.330> all

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
to negative the experience it's all

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.720 
to negative the experience it's all
going<00:01:56.600> to<00:01:56.660> people<00:01:56.960> put<00:01:57.740> a<00:01:57.770> good<00:01:58.040> ultimate
