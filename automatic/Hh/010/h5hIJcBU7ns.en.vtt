okay<00:00:06.540> you<00:00:06.600> two<00:00:07.200> brought<00:00:07.500> up<00:00:07.710> today<00:00:08.639> we're

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
okay you two brought up today we're

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.910 
okay you two brought up today we're
going<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:09.059> look<00:00:09.269> at<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.900> I<00:00:10.230> five<00:00:10.830> Intel<00:00:12.349> 35<00:00:13.349> 70

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
going to look at the I five Intel 35 70

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.519 
going to look at the I five Intel 35 70
k<00:00:14.219> so<00:00:15.179> there<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:15.630> right<00:00:15.750> there<00:00:15.990> i<00:00:16.500> 535<00:00:17.490> 70<00:00:18.150> k

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
k so there it is right there i 535 70 k

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.950 
k so there it is right there i 535 70 k
this<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.710> for<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.920> LGA<00:00:20.310> 1155<00:00:21.060> socket<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:21.840> this

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
this is for the LGA 1155 socket so this

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.950 
this is for the LGA 1155 socket so this
is<00:00:22.080> their<00:00:22.230> newest<00:00:22.619> process<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.750> which<00:00:24.750> is

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
is their newest process of of which is

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.130 
is their newest process of of which is
code<00:00:25.230> named<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.650> ivy<00:00:26.160> bridge<00:00:26.599> so<00:00:27.599> it's<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.840> 22

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
code named the ivy bridge so it's a 22

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.380 
code named the ivy bridge so it's a 22
nanometer<00:00:28.769> process<00:00:29.179> and<00:00:30.859> it's<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:32.369> multi<00:00:33.270> up

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
nanometer process and it's a multi up

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.959 
nanometer process and it's a multi up
mr.<00:00:33.870> latest<00:00:34.969> processor<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.180> year<00:00:37.760> we<00:00:38.760> get<00:00:38.879> it

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
mr. latest processor a year we get it

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.459 
mr. latest processor a year we get it
we're<00:00:39.390> going<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.570> open<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.870> here<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.320> it's

small Ashley the box is the smallest box
of<00:01:19.140> had<00:01:19.439> yet<00:01:19.710> for<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> processor<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:21.299> here's

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
of had yet for a processor so here's

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.880 
of had yet for a processor so here's
your<00:01:21.869> chip<00:01:23.689> now<00:01:24.689> there<00:01:25.140> should<00:01:25.170> check<00:01:25.650> their

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
your chip now there should check their

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.539 
your chip now there should check their
it<00:01:26.700> sink<00:01:27.000> came<00:01:27.210> out<00:01:27.390> but<00:01:27.540> there's<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.930> chip<00:01:28.549> so

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
it sink came out but there's the chip so

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.370 
it sink came out but there's the chip so
as<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:29.970> see<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.329> says<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.750> there<00:01:30.960> it's<00:01:31.170> got

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
as we can see it says on there it's got

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.550 
as we can see it says on there it's got
the<00:01:31.470> code<00:01:31.680> name<00:01:31.890> for<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.340> made<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.759> malaysia

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
the code name for it made in malaysia

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.149 
the code name for it made in malaysia
3.4<00:01:34.560> gigahertz<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.840> four<00:01:36.840> cores<00:01:37.140> with<00:01:37.979> no

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.499 
3.4 gigahertz and four cores with no
hyper-threading<00:01:39.380> so<00:01:41.180> we're<00:01:42.180> going<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.390> get

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
hyper-threading so we're going to get

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.010 
hyper-threading so we're going to get
that<00:01:42.689> installed<00:01:43.110> pretty<00:01:43.500> soon<00:01:44.570> ok<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.630> that's

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
that installed pretty soon ok so that's
