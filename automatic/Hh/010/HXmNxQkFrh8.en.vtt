00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.980
 and 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.270
 hello guys how are you today I bring you 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.870
 some curiosities of frozen fever fiore 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.870
 frozen 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.690
 this is my second video of some 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.250
 curiosities and videos and well then 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.930
 some that I found watching the short 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.180
 but I do not know if anyone has noticed 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.690
 I think some yes but some do not 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.690
 I know 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.500
 apparently it seems that nobody yet 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.910
 go against the error 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.579
 and they are two errors 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.850
 that I found in the movie watching the 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.590
 favorite short of mine and well then I would 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.170
 I wanted to tell them so that 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.970
 you know and I hope that you do not 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.729
 occupy and do not walk it saying in 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.860
 another video because this I found it if 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.110
 they read it against you first good that 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.460
 it's your decision but if I found it and 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.460
 I copied what does not work 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.690
 and they are going to matter and good is important so 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.620
 do not do what I want 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.620
 and well, well 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:38.660
 are two mistakes that I realized and but 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.400
 after I saw three times the short say 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.390
 I realized but when it was my first 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.390
 I did not notice anything 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.340
 and well, these are the mistakes 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.399
 one 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.399
 First 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.800
 when the sneezing shamans are born new 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.210
 snowmen 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:06.360
 which wave calls them little brothers good those 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.970
 little bugs the guard said guys these 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:14.040
 little snowmen that he transforms 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:17.790
 when she sneezes for her magic those 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:22.100
 dolls after they go outside they go to the 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.780
 palace after they go outside the castle 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.360
 these are snowmen made of 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.760
 pure snow 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.130
 They are very tiny but they are still 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.300
 made of snow so 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.300
 and I would ask myself 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.800
 and here goes my answer 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.680
 because rays do not melt is a 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.069
 snow equipment 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.500
 and well, you already know about 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.740
 what 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.230
 because these dolls that are not due 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:58.050
 melt are equal tail and are 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:02.120
 directly to the sun and do not melt 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.459
 that's my curiosity I do not know why 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.830
 not this way to criticize disney but 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.560
 because Disney's makes the best 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.900
 movies but what happens is that no 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.110
 I understand why these dolls do not 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.840
 melts maybe my conclusion is because 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.900
 maybe these merits are not 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.989
 divided because they are under the power of 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:30.220
 elsa maybe or are in the castle and 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:30.220
 they are cold I do not know something like that 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.099
 or maybe 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.050
 anything else but I do not understand why 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.760
 how good this is my first publicity 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:49.380
 that I have the second 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:52.440
 hello, you already have a cloud 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:57.140
 staff here we see that the ftc does not the 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.140
 has in some parts nothing comes out 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:05.319
 personal cloud that he was given frozen 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.319
 in the first the first movie 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.380
 the lively staff that he left sorry 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:15.680
 He led the staff held in New 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:20.229
 personal so that I could live without 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.229
 without ice and that's why 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.410
 It's very weird 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:30.010
 do not appear after or could also 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:33.120
 be because the pse to the best is next 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.120
 of the edge can 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.240
 transform again even if it happens what 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.240
 what happens will melt melt 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.730
 and good 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.430
 and then those are my conclusions that 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.430
 you are one hundred 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.900
 meeting 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.479
 they are mixed conclusions nothing more 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.129
 because those are the only ones that I found 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:10.860
 nothing more 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:10.860
 and good soon now theories 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.449
 so 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:20.009
 without registering and like it because 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.009
 next video there are going to be theories
