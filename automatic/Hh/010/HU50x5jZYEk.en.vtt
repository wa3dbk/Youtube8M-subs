as<00:00:00.539> we<00:00:00.750> saw<00:00:00.930> in<00:00:01.110> previous<00:00:01.260> video<00:00:01.829> we<00:00:02.159> can<00:00:02.220> use

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
as we saw in previous video we can use

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.579 
as we saw in previous video we can use
surface<00:00:02.879> controller<00:00:03.360> it<00:00:04.200> during<00:00:04.560> one

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
surface controller it during one

domains<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:08.160> each<00:00:08.790> one<00:00:09.090> gives<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.510> series<00:00:09.929> of

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
domains and each one gives a series of

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.220 
domains and each one gives a series of
options<00:00:10.679> that<00:00:10.889> we<00:00:11.010> can<00:00:11.190> set<00:00:11.490> accordingly<00:00:12.230> in

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
options that we can set accordingly in

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.279 
options that we can set accordingly in
one<00:00:13.530> dimensional<00:00:14.160> time<00:00:14.370> we<00:00:15.120> will<00:00:15.269> have<00:00:15.480> faced

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
video we're going to see what actually

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.020 
video we're going to see what actually
these<00:00:30.900> auctions<00:00:31.650> doing<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.550> let's<00:00:32.700> see<00:00:32.820> what<00:00:32.850> I

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
these auctions doing so let's see what I

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.959 
these auctions doing so let's see what I
got<00:00:33.059> here<00:00:33.600> have<00:00:34.230> an<00:00:34.380> array<00:00:34.710> then<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.579> single

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
got here have an array then the single

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.930 
got here have an array then the single
box<00:00:36.210> with<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.600> 15<00:00:36.989> modifier<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:38.579> fear

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
box with a 15 modifier and it's fear

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.810 
box with a 15 modifier and it's fear
that<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.510> could<00:00:39.540> just<00:00:39.840> cut<00:00:40.110> half<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.070> using

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
that it could just cut half of it using

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.470 
that it could just cut half of it using
heavy<00:00:42.690> poly<00:00:43.020> modifier<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.860> then<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.579> away<00:00:45.270> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
heavy poly modifier and then I away the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.900 
heavy poly modifier and then I away the
box<00:00:45.750> using<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.350> transfer<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:46.950> property<00:00:47.250> and

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
box using the transfer of property and

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.139 
box using the transfer of property and
the<00:00:48.570> surface<00:00:48.989> controller<00:00:49.500> now<00:00:50.250> i'm<00:00:50.850> going<00:00:51.059> to

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
the surface controller now i'm going to

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.810 
the surface controller now i'm going to
deform<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.750> box<00:00:52.280> by<00:00:54.739> assigning<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.460> surface

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
deform the box by assigning the surface

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.979 
deform the box by assigning the surface
controller<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.809> each<00:00:58.050> control<00:00:58.590> point<00:00:59.809> so<00:01:00.809> we

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
controller of each control point so we

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.590 
controller of each control point so we
just<00:01:01.140> need<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.530> dry<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.829> surface<00:01:02.129> controller

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.700 

we<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:06.810> use<00:01:07.020> instance<00:01:08.150> and<00:01:09.260> let's<00:01:10.260> pick<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
we can use instance and let's pick the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.990 
we can use instance and let's pick the
sphere<00:01:12.590> most<00:01:13.590> efficient<00:01:14.100> system<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.610> from<00:01:14.820> one

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
sphere most efficient system in from one

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.289 
sphere most efficient system in from one
dimensional<00:01:15.600> drawing<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:17.490> set<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
dimensional drawing and to set the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.570 
dimensional drawing and to set the
offsets<00:01:18.810> we're<00:01:19.380> just<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.979> use<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
offsets we're just going to use the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.300 
offsets we're just going to use the
sub-object<00:01:21.000> controller<00:01:21.979> leave<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.220> your

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
sub-object controller leave it to your

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.859 
sub-object controller leave it to your
channel<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:25.580> is<00:01:26.580> usually<00:01:26.820> I'll<00:01:27.390> take<00:01:27.630> all<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
channel and is usually I'll take all the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.200 
channel and is usually I'll take all the
properties<00:01:29.150> each<00:01:30.150> box<00:01:30.600> has<00:01:30.900> been<00:01:31.020> deformed

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
properties each box has been deformed

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.010 
properties each box has been deformed
according<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.450> faces<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.670> sphere<00:01:36.020> and

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
according to the faces of the sphere and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.020 
according to the faces of the sphere and
it<00:01:37.170> follows<00:01:37.880> face<00:01:38.880> normal<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:40.290> each<00:01:40.439> point

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
it follows face normal in each point

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.530 
it follows face normal in each point
because<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.619> you'll<00:01:43.619> get<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> gap<00:01:44.540> between

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
because of that you'll get a gap between

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.200 
because of that you'll get a gap between
each<00:01:46.140> tool<00:01:46.680> boxes<00:01:47.299> since<00:01:48.299> these<00:01:48.829> corners<00:01:49.829> a

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
each tool boxes since these corners a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.660 
each tool boxes since these corners a
projecting<00:01:51.210> fault<00:01:51.860> apparently<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.130> avoid

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
projecting fault apparently to avoid

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.660 
projecting fault apparently to avoid
normal<00:01:54.270> vector<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.259> face<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.920> because

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
normal vector of that face and because

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.910 
normal vector of that face and because
these<00:01:57.060> two<00:01:57.420> are<00:01:57.450> removing<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.380> skin<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.680> same

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
these two are removing the skin the same

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.120 
these two are removing the skin the same
direction<00:01:59.719> get<00:02:00.719> distance<00:02:01.290> as<00:02:01.590> they<00:02:01.829> proved

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
direction get distance as they proved

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.990 
direction get distance as they proved
far<00:02:02.399> away<00:02:02.640> from<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
far away from the

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.020 
far away from the
surface<00:02:05.000> so<00:02:05.900> to<00:02:06.230> emphasize<00:02:06.740> that<00:02:07.070> there's

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
surface so to emphasize that there's

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.220 
surface so to emphasize that there's
five<00:02:09.490> minutes<00:02:10.490> for<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.210> thickness<00:02:11.870> of<00:02:12.050> the

five minutes for the thickness of the
bottom<00:02:13.600> and<00:02:15.010> you<00:02:16.010> can<00:02:16.280> see<00:02:16.490> now<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.700> gap

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
bottom and you can see now the gap

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.420 
bottom and you can see now the gap
between<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.690> office<00:02:18.080> if<00:02:18.710> you<00:02:18.890> would<00:02:19.040> like<00:02:19.160> to

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
between the office if you would like to

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.650 
between the office if you would like to
get<00:02:20.120> these<00:02:20.420> points<00:02:21.020> in<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.230> same<00:02:21.520> waiter<00:02:22.660> then

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
get these points in the same waiter then

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.010 
get these points in the same waiter then
here<00:02:24.230> we<00:02:24.260> need<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.740> choose<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.130> vertex<00:02:25.880> as<00:02:26.120> the

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
here we need to choose the vertex as the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.520 
here we need to choose the vertex as the
normal<00:02:27.520> vector<00:02:28.520> so<00:02:29.090> if<00:02:29.210> the<00:02:29.360> four<00:02:29.660> corners<00:02:30.440> of

what normal which is the normal vector

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.230 
what normal which is the normal vector
at<00:02:35.990> that<00:02:36.350> vertex<00:02:36.860> these<00:02:37.280> corners<00:02:37.910> going<00:02:38.150> to

at that vertex these corners going to

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.530 
at that vertex these corners going to
meet<00:02:38.450> in<00:02:38.780> one<00:02:39.110> point<00:02:39.560> so<00:02:40.459> let's<00:02:40.700> try<00:02:40.970> that<00:02:41.209> you

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
meet in one point so let's try that you

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.370 
meet in one point so let's try that you

here and let's see what happens is where

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.070 
here and let's see what happens is where
it<00:02:59.120> is<00:02:59.330> same<00:02:59.750> for<00:02:59.930> these<00:03:01.750> these<00:03:02.750> patches

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
it is same for these these patches

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.970 
it is same for these these patches
around<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.739> corner<00:03:04.300> so<00:03:05.300> which<00:03:06.170> is<00:03:06.350> for<00:03:06.650> our

surface controller here and it will

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.210 
surface controller here and it will
simply<00:03:09.980> change<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:10.850> surface<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.720> box

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
simply change the surface to the box

things<00:03:55.280> work<00:03:55.640> this<00:03:55.850> is<00:03:56.030> outside<00:03:57.010> to<00:03:58.010> get<00:03:58.130> these

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
things work this is outside to get these

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.640 
things work this is outside to get these
edges<00:03:59.260> in<00:04:00.260> right<00:04:00.560> angle<00:04:01.329> so<00:04:02.329> for<00:04:03.019> that<00:04:03.200> you<00:04:03.260> can

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
edges in right angle so for that you can

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.650 
edges in right angle so for that you can
use<00:04:03.860> the<00:04:04.160> normal<00:04:04.840> vector<00:04:05.840> an<00:04:06.110> edge

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
use the normal vector an edge

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.290 
use the normal vector an edge
which<00:04:08.660> actually<00:04:08.990> get<00:04:09.560> 16<00:04:10.160> the<00:04:10.400> normal<00:04:10.880> vector

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
which actually get 16 the normal vector

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.890 
which actually get 16 the normal vector
of<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:11.600> vertices<00:04:12.050> and<00:04:12.980> it<00:04:13.130> gives<00:04:13.400> you<00:04:13.900> the

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
of the vertices and it gives you the

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.270 
of the vertices and it gives you the
straight<00:04:15.320> angle<00:04:15.800> for<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:16.310> corner<00:04:16.850> of<00:04:16.880> ages<00:04:17.390> so

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
straight angle for the corner of ages so

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.270 
straight angle for the corner of ages so
that's<00:04:19.280> about<00:04:19.490> the<00:04:19.870> choose<00:04:20.870> new<00:04:21.200> motion<00:04:21.590> in

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
that's about the choose new motion in

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.370 
that's about the choose new motion in
one<00:04:22.550> dimension<00:04:22.760> or<00:04:23.420> dominant<00:04:23.990> surface

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
one dimension or dominant surface

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.100 
one dimension or dominant surface
control<00:04:24.830> and<00:04:25.130> remember<00:04:26.120> that<00:04:26.390> works<00:04:26.630> only<00:04:26.870> for
