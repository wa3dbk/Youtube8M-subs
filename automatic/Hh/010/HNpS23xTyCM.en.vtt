of mind and an estate of capability we

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.810 
of mind and an estate of capability we
didn't<00:01:42.410> look<00:01:42.500> much<00:01:42.740> different<00:01:42.770> to<00:01:43.310> that<00:01:43.430> way

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
didn't look much different to that way

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.580 
didn't look much different to that way
it<00:01:43.880> looks<00:01:44.090> now<00:01:44.180> I<00:01:44.360> don't<00:01:44.690> think<00:01:44.990> you<00:01:45.260> know<00:01:45.410> that

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
it looks now I don't think you know that

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.240 
it looks now I don't think you know that
what<00:01:46.550> I<00:01:46.700> would<00:01:46.850> always<00:01:47.390> look<00:01:47.660> for<00:01:47.960> on<00:01:48.680> a<00:01:48.710> strap

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
what I would always look for on a strap

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.980 
what I would always look for on a strap
was<00:01:49.460> a<00:01:49.490> maple<00:01:49.910> neck<00:01:49.940> that<00:01:50.270> had<00:01:50.420> been<00:01:50.810> worn<00:01:51.080> out

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
was a maple neck that had been worn out

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.270 
was a maple neck that had been worn out
you<00:01:53.990> know<00:01:54.110> that<00:01:54.290> was<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:54.590> thing<00:01:54.770> if<00:01:54.890> it<00:01:55.010> looked

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
you know that was the thing if it looked

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.570 
you know that was the thing if it looked
brand-new<00:01:55.820> that<00:01:56.390> it<00:01:56.509> was<00:01:56.630> obviously<00:01:57.460> you<00:01:58.460> know

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
brand-new that it was obviously you know

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.310 
brand-new that it was obviously you know
it<00:01:58.729> was<00:01:58.850> like<00:01:58.970> a<00:01:59.030> restaurant<00:01:59.509> there's<00:01:59.990> lots<00:02:00.170> of

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
it was like a restaurant there's lots of

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.870 
it was like a restaurant there's lots of
people<00:02:00.500> in<00:02:00.740> there<00:02:00.979> you<00:02:01.160> know<00:02:01.310> he's<00:02:01.520> got<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.729> be

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
people in there you know he's got to be

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.350 
people in there you know he's got to be
good<00:02:02.060> food<00:02:02.330> so<00:02:03.190> I<00:02:04.190> just<00:02:04.640> thought<00:02:04.790> if<00:02:04.970> it<00:02:05.060> had

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
good food so I just thought if it had

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.359 
good food so I just thought if it had
all<00:02:05.540> those<00:02:05.780> kind<00:02:06.140> of<00:02:06.200> worn-out<00:02:06.619> patches<00:02:07.190> it

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
all those kind of worn-out patches it

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.699 
all those kind of worn-out patches it
meant<00:02:07.610> that<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:08.780> had<00:02:08.810> been<00:02:09.140> you<00:02:09.500> know

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
meant that it had been you know

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.330 
meant that it had been you know
well<00:02:10.280> favored<00:02:10.790> so<00:02:11.480> that<00:02:12.020> would<00:02:12.260> this<00:02:12.860> probably

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
well favored so that would this probably

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.100 
well favored so that would this probably
would<00:02:13.550> have<00:02:13.640> pretty<00:02:14.090> much<00:02:14.180> been<00:02:14.360> what<00:02:14.930> that

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
would have pretty much been what that

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.729 
would have pretty much been what that
what<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:15.380> was<00:02:15.500> like<00:02:15.709> when<00:02:15.980> I<00:02:16.010> bought<00:02:16.310> it<00:02:16.340> and

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
what it was like when I bought it and

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.670 
what it was like when I bought it and
and<00:02:18.739> I<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:19.489> know<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.670> go<00:02:19.880> back<00:02:20.120> to<00:02:20.680> why

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
and I and you know to go back to why

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.990 
and I and you know to go back to why
that<00:02:21.980> would<00:02:22.190> be<00:02:22.459> is<00:02:22.520> that<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:22.970> know<00:02:23.090> I<00:02:23.120> saw

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
that would be is that you know I saw

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.760 
that would be is that you know I saw

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
those records that he made it sounded

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.360
