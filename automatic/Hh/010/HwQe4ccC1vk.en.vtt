handy gate ramp out of the boxes and set
out<00:00:53.230> you'll<00:00:54.010> notice<00:00:54.400> that<00:00:54.610> the<00:00:55.500> hardware<00:00:56.500> and

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
out you'll notice that the hardware and

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.920 
out you'll notice that the hardware and
all<00:00:57.129> the<00:00:57.160> pieces<00:00:57.519> are<00:00:57.879> clearly<00:00:58.300> marked<00:00:58.690> as<00:00:58.839> to

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
all the pieces are clearly marked as to

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.329 
all the pieces are clearly marked as to
what<00:00:59.140> they<00:00:59.290> are<00:00:59.470> so<00:00:59.860> when<00:01:00.070> we're<00:01:00.190> going

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
what they are so when we're going

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.189 
what they are so when we're going
through<00:01:00.460> our<00:01:00.640> owners<00:01:01.089> manual<00:01:01.510> it'll<00:01:02.080> be

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
through our owners manual it'll be

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:16.760 
through our owners manual it'll be
easier<00:01:02.710> to<00:01:03.100> set<00:01:03.280> it<00:01:03.370> up<00:01:03.460> on<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.699> truck

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.020 

all<00:01:17.770> right<00:01:17.890> now<00:01:18.010> that<00:01:18.160> we<00:01:18.220> got<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.520> handy<00:01:18.820> gate

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
all right now that we got the handy gate

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.420 
all right now that we got the handy gate
ramp<00:01:19.450> assembled<00:01:20.200> we're<00:01:20.860> gonna<00:01:20.950> go<00:01:21.160> ahead<00:01:21.280> and

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
ramp assembled we're gonna go ahead and

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.400 
ramp assembled we're gonna go ahead and
get<00:01:22.180> ready<00:01:22.330> to<00:01:22.510> load<00:01:22.810> and<00:01:22.930> unload<00:01:23.020> some

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
get ready to load and unload some

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.920 
get ready to load and unload some
machines<00:01:24.720> first<00:01:25.720> thing<00:01:25.870> we<00:01:25.960> want<00:01:26.140> to<00:01:26.200> do<00:01:27.930> take

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
machines first thing we want to do take

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:49.080 
machines first thing we want to do take
off<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.260> safety<00:01:29.410> clips<00:01:47.760> the<00:01:48.760> thing<00:01:48.910> is<00:01:49.000> that

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
off the safety clips the thing is that

00:01:49.090 --> 00:02:03.510 
off the safety clips the thing is that
safety<00:01:49.510> latches<00:01:49.720> on<00:01:50.020> it

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:49.580 

so<00:02:04.520> it<00:02:04.640> flowed<00:02:04.850> up<00:02:04.970> some<00:02:05.120> machines

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:04:06.600 

Oh<00:03:07.430> bad

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.670 

all<00:04:07.570> right<00:04:07.720> so<00:04:07.840> we<00:04:07.960> learned<00:04:08.170> that<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:08.380> Handy

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
all right so we learned that the Handy

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.470 
all right so we learned that the Handy
gate<00:04:08.860> ramp<00:04:09.130> works<00:04:09.460> great<00:04:09.700> for<00:04:09.730> almost<00:04:10.090> every

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
gate ramp works great for almost every

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.480 
gate ramp works great for almost every
application<00:04:10.980> one<00:04:11.980> of<00:04:12.100> the<00:04:12.160> things<00:04:12.370> that

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
application one of the things that

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.300 
application one of the things that
doesn't<00:04:12.670> work<00:04:12.880> so<00:04:13.060> great<00:04:13.270> for<00:04:13.510> is<00:04:13.750> Lowell

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
doesn't work so great for is Lowell

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.360 
doesn't work so great for is Lowell
motorcycles<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:16.200> ATVs<00:04:17.200> with<00:04:17.739> plows<00:04:17.950> on<00:04:18.250> them

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
motorcycles and ATVs with plows on them

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.069 
motorcycles and ATVs with plows on them
but<00:04:18.459> some<00:04:18.670> of<00:04:18.760> that<00:04:18.850> could<00:04:19.060> be<00:04:19.090> because<00:04:19.359> this

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
but some of that could be because this

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.010 
but some of that could be because this
ramp<00:04:20.410> is<00:04:20.590> on<00:04:20.799> a<00:04:21.130> one-ton<00:04:21.790> truck<00:04:21.840> which<00:04:22.840> is

springs a real stiff the lower the truck
sits<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:27.640> better<00:04:27.670> the<00:04:27.970> angle<00:04:28.390> and<00:04:28.540> you'll<00:04:28.630> be

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
sits the better the angle and you'll be

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.290 
sits the better the angle and you'll be
able<00:04:28.840> to<00:04:28.990> get<00:04:29.140> the<00:04:29.230> lower<00:04:29.470> profile<00:04:30.460> machines

able to get the lower profile machines

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.920 
able to get the lower profile machines
up<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.990> ramp<00:04:33.270> when<00:04:34.270> we<00:04:34.420> were<00:04:34.540> putting<00:04:34.750> the

them the ramp up that holding it at

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.590 
them the ramp up that holding it at
certain<00:05:23.380> pivot<00:05:23.860> points<00:05:24.250> makes<00:05:25.210> it<00:05:25.360> a<00:05:25.419> whole

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
certain pivot points makes it a whole

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.180 
certain pivot points makes it a whole
lot<00:05:25.630> easier<00:05:26.850> and<00:05:27.850> then<00:05:28.000> once<00:05:28.210> the<00:05:29.040> once<00:05:30.040> it's
