00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
guys like the basics but I have a

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.740 
guys like the basics but I have a
feeling<00:00:12.809> I'm<00:00:13.110> gonna<00:00:13.259> balls<00:00:13.559> up<00:00:14.240> these<00:00:15.240> are<00:00:15.660> the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
feeling I'm gonna balls up these are the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.480 
feeling I'm gonna balls up these are the
new<00:00:15.870> blocks<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.680> because<00:00:17.340> I'm<00:00:17.490> using<00:00:19.400> too<00:00:20.400> many

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
new blocks I because I'm using too many

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.609 
new blocks I because I'm using too many
items<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:23.660> I'm<00:00:24.660> feeling<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.320> they're<00:00:25.529> gonna

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
items and I'm feeling that they're gonna

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.580 
items and I'm feeling that they're gonna
put<00:00:25.710> space<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.550> something<00:00:26.970> or<00:00:27.199> heaven<00:00:28.199> because

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
put space in something or heaven because

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.890 
put space in something or heaven because
and<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.760> know<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.029> sounds<00:00:30.269> kind<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.480> odd<00:00:30.660> but

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
and I know that sounds kind of odd but

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.950 
and I know that sounds kind of odd but
uh<00:00:31.520> basically<00:00:32.520> someone<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:33.059> reddit<00:00:33.480> found<00:00:33.750> out

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
uh basically someone on reddit found out

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.170 
uh basically someone on reddit found out
that<00:00:34.110> when<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.500> win<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> world<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.550> created<00:00:36.000> now

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
that when you win a world is created now

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.720 
that when you win a world is created now
it<00:00:36.480> does<00:00:36.719> three<00:00:37.230> dimensions<00:00:37.829> not<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
it does three dimensions not to the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.280 
it does three dimensions not to the
first<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.210> mentioned<00:00:39.600> before<00:00:39.690> was<00:00:40.050> just<00:00:40.230> a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
first I mentioned before was just a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.600 
first I mentioned before was just a
normal<00:00:40.559> world<00:00:40.680> like<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.190> then<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
normal world like this and then the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.389 
normal world like this and then the
nether<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.329> maybe<00:00:42.870> who<00:00:43.200> knows<00:00:43.379> there<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:44.129> new

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
nether so maybe who knows there is a new

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.060 
nether so maybe who knows there is a new
way<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.239> teleport<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.140> different<00:00:46.680> dimension

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
way to teleport to a different dimension

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.479 
way to teleport to a different dimension

on<00:01:20.340> for<00:01:20.670> them<00:01:20.790> basically<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.810> for

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
on for them basically this is for

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.170 
on for them basically this is for
brewing<00:01:22.409> potions<00:01:22.680> now<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.250> believe<00:01:23.820> how<00:01:24.060> it

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
brewing potions now I believe how it

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.969 
brewing potions now I believe how it
works<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:25.490> put<00:01:26.869> hold<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.200> believe<00:01:28.829> you

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
works is you put hold on I believe you

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:29.870 
works is you put hold on I believe you
put<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.490> there

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
put that there

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.660 
put that there
and<00:01:30.180> then<00:01:30.630> for<00:01:31.200> example<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.950> would<00:01:32.009> have<00:01:32.340> never

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
and then for example I would have never

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.980 
and then for example I would have never
walked<00:01:33.000> there<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.229> then<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.680> goes<00:01:35.280> round

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
walked there and then it goes round

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.300 
walked there and then it goes round
comes<00:01:36.990> down<00:01:37.170> there<00:01:37.350> anyway<00:01:37.619> we'll<00:01:38.159> have<00:01:38.280> a

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
comes down there anyway we'll have a

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.399 
comes down there anyway we'll have a
look<00:01:38.490> for<00:01:38.610> them<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.720> an<00:01:39.960> enchantment

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
look for them this is an enchantment

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.639 
look for them this is an enchantment
