in the photos here

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.230 
in the photos here
they<00:00:16.410> do<00:00:16.470> need<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.920> repaint<00:00:17.400> but<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.699> good

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
they do need to repaint but a good

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.670 
they do need to repaint but a good
structural<00:00:18.660> condition<00:00:19.170> but<00:00:19.350> do<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.560> need

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
structural condition but do you need

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.830 
structural condition but do you need
repainting<00:00:19.920> if<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.970> can<00:00:21.180> please<00:00:21.420> watch<00:00:21.660> this

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
repainting if you can please watch this

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.660 
repainting if you can please watch this
on<00:00:22.020> high-definition<00:00:22.289> mode<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.340> can<00:00:23.550> get

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
on high-definition mode so you can get

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.340 
on high-definition mode so you can get
an<00:00:23.760> idea<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.269> condition<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.080> paint

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
an idea of the condition of the paint

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.679 
an idea of the condition of the paint
and<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:26.460> we<00:00:26.580> have<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.849> four<00:00:27.060> wheels<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.480> course

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
and so we have the four wheels of course

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.510 
and so we have the four wheels of course
one<00:00:27.960> two<00:00:28.380> three<00:00:28.920> four<00:00:29.429> 14<00:00:30.240> by<00:00:30.480> 5.5<00:00:31.320> JJ's<00:00:31.920> with<00:00:32.489> a

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
one two three four 14 by 5.5 JJ's with a

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.350 
one two three four 14 by 5.5 JJ's with a
plus<00:00:32.880> 35<00:00:33.980> upset<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.219> APCD<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.320> 114<00:00:38.120> 0.34<00:00:39.120> hull

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
plus 35 upset and APCD of 114 0.34 hull

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.299 
plus 35 upset and APCD of 114 0.34 hull
as<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.989> can<00:00:40.140> see<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> photo<00:00:40.649> here<00:00:40.920> for

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
as you can see in the photo here for

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.369 
as you can see in the photo here for
haul<00:00:41.520> wheels<00:00:41.790> we'll<00:00:42.510> go<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.690> some<00:00:42.899> close-ups

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
haul wheels we'll go to some close-ups

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.139 
haul wheels we'll go to some close-ups
the<00:00:44.040> first<00:00:44.969> two<00:00:45.239> here<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.640> if<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:47.940> note

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
the first two here so if you can note

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.900 
the first two here so if you can note
the<00:00:48.180> addition<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.289> paint<00:00:49.610> this<00:00:50.610> wheel

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
the addition of the paint this wheel

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.180 
the addition of the paint this wheel
compared<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> other<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.899> quite<00:00:52.140> faded<00:00:52.440> so

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
compared to the other is quite faded so

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.279 
compared to the other is quite faded so
they<00:00:53.309> do<00:00:53.370> need<00:00:53.670> repainting<00:00:54.289> structurally

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
they do need repainting structurally

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.920 
they do need repainting structurally
sound<00:00:55.559> few<00:00:56.309> little<00:00:56.579> minor<00:00:56.730> box<00:00:57.120> around<00:00:57.719> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
sound few little minor box around the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.720 
sound few little minor box around the
rims<00:00:58.440> where<00:00:58.680> they<00:00:58.800> might<00:00:58.949> have<00:00:58.980> just<00:00:59.430> touched

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
rims where they might have just touched

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.819 
rims where they might have just touched
against<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.239> curb<00:01:00.570> there<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.500> few<00:01:01.680> little

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
against the curb there so a few little

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.039 
against the curb there so a few little
marks<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.730> are<00:01:02.789> generally<00:01:03.510> very<00:01:03.719> tidy

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
marks that are generally very tidy

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.609 
marks that are generally very tidy
structurally<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:05.400> do<00:01:05.640> need<00:01:05.820> repainting<00:01:06.000> and

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
structurally but do need repainting and

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.410 
structurally but do need repainting and
the<00:01:07.619> other<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:08.130> close<00:01:08.820> for<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.060> other<00:01:09.210> two

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the other to close for the other two

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.670 
the other to close for the other two
wheels<00:01:09.720> again<00:01:10.520> some<00:01:11.869> little<00:01:12.869> marks<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.500> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
wheels again some little marks on the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.499 
wheels again some little marks on the
paint<00:01:13.920> some<00:01:14.549> very<00:01:14.760> very<00:01:14.970> minor<00:01:15.210> surface

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
paint some very very minor surface

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.600 
paint some very very minor surface
corrosion<00:01:15.900> probably<00:01:16.650> road<00:01:16.920> salt<00:01:17.250> corrosion

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
corrosion probably road salt corrosion

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.240 
corrosion probably road salt corrosion
but<00:01:18.390> again<00:01:18.659> structurally<00:01:19.350> sound<00:01:19.590> good

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
but again structurally sound good

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.480 
but again structurally sound good
condition<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.049> this<00:01:22.049> little<00:01:22.380> room<00:01:22.560> here<00:01:22.979> we

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
condition and this little room here we

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.160 
condition and this little room here we
need<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.850> zoom<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.049> here<00:01:26.659> you<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.840> see<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
need to zoom in on here you can see the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.719 
need to zoom in on here you can see the
edge<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.770> probably<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.130> worst<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.549> it

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
edge this is probably the worst of it

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.640 
edge this is probably the worst of it
where<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.360> touched<00:01:30.570> against<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.110> curb<00:01:31.380> and

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
where it is touched against the curb and

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.580 
where it is touched against the curb and
ever<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.400> small<00:01:32.700> dent<00:01:33.090> right<00:01:33.720> there<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.560> you

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
ever so small dent right there so you

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.580 
ever so small dent right there so you
can<00:01:34.799> see<00:01:34.920> also<00:01:35.100> make<00:01:35.369> out<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> Formula<00:01:36.119> One

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
can see also make out the Formula One

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.350 
can see also make out the Formula One
Formula<00:01:37.590> One<00:01:37.799> logo<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.820> side<00:01:39.030> they're

Formula One logo on the side they're

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.870 
Formula One logo on the side they're
made<00:01:39.659> by<00:01:39.689> Watanabe<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.740> Japan<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.759> is

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
made by Watanabe of Japan so this is

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.639 
made by Watanabe of Japan so this is
sort<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.090> Japanese<00:01:42.299> wheels<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:45.500> close-up<00:01:46.500> of

sort of Japanese wheels and close-up of

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.580 
sort of Japanese wheels and close-up of
the<00:01:47.280> corrosion<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.600> can<00:01:48.720> see<00:01:48.930> only<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
the corrosion you can see only on the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.560 
the corrosion you can see only on the
surface<00:01:50.040> there<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.790> just<00:01:51.180> needs<00:01:51.360> repainting

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
surface there so just needs repainting

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.609
