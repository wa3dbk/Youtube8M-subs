00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
something like that and it's also

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.320 
something like that and it's also
touchscreen<00:02:06.860> so<00:02:07.310> that<00:02:07.490> makes<00:02:07.670> everything<00:02:07.970> way

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
touchscreen so that makes everything way

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.810 
touchscreen so that makes everything way
better<00:02:08.769> but<00:02:09.769> it<00:02:09.860> does<00:02:10.010> make<00:02:10.160> things<00:02:10.220> confusing

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
better but it does make things confusing

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.550 
better but it does make things confusing
when<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:11.540> are<00:02:11.690> trying<00:02:11.930> to<00:02:11.989> point<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.380> show

someone something but does auto rotate

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.039 
someone something but does auto rotate
and<00:02:15.680> everything<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:16.280> this<00:02:17.180> does<00:02:17.510> have<00:02:17.840> a

about<00:02:20.420> this<00:02:20.630> that<00:02:20.690> I<00:02:20.900> do<00:02:21.049> not<00:02:21.290> like<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:22.010> is

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
about this that I do not like it is

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.940 
about this that I do not like it is
silver<00:02:24.410> on<00:02:24.620> white<00:02:25.780> sometimes<00:02:26.780> in<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.230> dark<00:02:27.260> it

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
silver on white sometimes in the dark it

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.550 
silver on white sometimes in the dark it
has<00:02:28.100> to<00:02:28.250> be<00:02:28.340> really<00:02:28.700> dark<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:29.269> get<00:02:29.450> there<00:02:29.750> but

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
has to be really dark to get there but

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.100 
has to be really dark to get there but
that<00:02:31.160> is<00:02:31.190> one<00:02:31.579> major<00:02:31.760> concern<00:02:32.360> for<00:02:32.390> me<00:02:32.720> because

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
that is one major concern for me because

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.110 
that is one major concern for me because
I'm<00:02:33.410> always<00:02:33.650> staying<00:02:34.010> up<00:02:34.160> all<00:02:34.340> night<00:02:34.400> doing

all my homework silver and white do not
match<00:02:37.850> maybe<00:02:38.630> if<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:38.930> was<00:02:39.049> black<00:02:39.320> or<00:02:39.530> something

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
doing some homework it does not keep up

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.199 
doing some homework it does not keep up
with<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.370> Sun<00:03:02.580> just<00:03:03.480> like<00:03:04.110> my<00:03:04.260> oneplus<00:03:04.620> one

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
with the Sun just like my oneplus one

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.780 
with the Sun just like my oneplus one
does<00:03:06.209> as<00:03:06.420> well<00:03:06.600> I<00:03:06.870> wish<00:03:07.770> there<00:03:07.920> were<00:03:08.040> the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
does as well I wish there were the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.390 
does as well I wish there were the
screens<00:03:09.120> brightness<00:03:09.540> could<00:03:09.959> be<00:03:10.080> more<00:03:10.350> but<00:03:11.160> at

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
screens brightness could be more but at

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.309 
screens brightness could be more but at
the<00:03:11.519> moment<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:12.000> is<00:03:12.030> not<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.630> greatest<00:03:12.870> screen

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
the moment it is not the greatest screen

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.440 
the moment it is not the greatest screen
ever<00:03:13.590> I<00:03:13.950> am<00:03:14.640> thinking<00:03:14.940> of<00:03:14.970> getting<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.300> loan

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
ever I am thinking of getting a loan

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.660 
ever I am thinking of getting a loan
over<00:03:15.599> Y<00:03:15.870> 50<00:03:16.290> but<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.069> don't<00:03:17.310> play<00:03:17.489> that<00:03:17.519> much

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
over Y 50 but I don't play that much

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.570 
over Y 50 but I don't play that much
games<00:03:18.420> so<00:03:18.810> I<00:03:19.080> don't<00:03:19.470> see<00:03:19.590> why<00:03:19.739> that<00:03:19.769> would<00:03:20.100> I

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
games so I don't see why that would I

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.009 
games so I don't see why that would I
don't<00:03:20.819> see<00:03:20.970> why<00:03:21.090> that<00:03:21.120> would<00:03:21.450> be<00:03:21.569> a<00:03:21.600> problem

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
don't see why that would be a problem

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:28.430 
don't see why that would be a problem
and<00:03:23.360> one<00:03:24.360> thing<00:03:24.540> about<00:03:24.720> this<00:03:24.930> is<00:03:25.140> that<00:03:27.319> on<00:03:28.319> the

computer on the left hand side you can

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.350 
computer on the left hand side you can
see<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.739> charging<00:03:41.220> port<00:03:41.519> right<00:03:41.819> there<00:03:41.850> at<00:03:42.239> the

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
see the charging port right there at the

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.970 
see the charging port right there at the
very<00:03:42.540> end<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:43.019> next<00:03:43.260> that<00:03:43.440> is<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.739> best

very end and next that is the best
speaker<00:03:44.459> add-on<00:03:45.150> so<00:03:45.420> you<00:03:45.480> can<00:03:45.630> put<00:03:45.780> that<00:03:45.930> in

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
speaker add-on so you can put that in

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.350 
speaker add-on so you can put that in
next<00:03:46.650> that<00:03:46.950> is<00:03:47.069> the<00:03:47.220> Gigabit<00:03:47.640> Ethernet<00:03:47.819> and

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
next that is the Gigabit Ethernet and

next is the hdmi output source and next

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.020 
next is the hdmi output source and next
to<00:03:51.690> that<00:03:51.720> you<00:03:51.930> have<00:03:51.959> two<00:03:52.260> 3.0<00:03:52.859> USBs<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.700> you
