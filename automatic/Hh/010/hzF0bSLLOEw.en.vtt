from that first so you can reinstall the
operating<00:02:26.370> system<00:02:27.090> on<00:02:27.150> those<00:02:28.760> there's<00:02:29.760> lots

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
operating system on those there's lots

operating system on those there's lots
of<00:02:30.150> options<00:02:30.360> there<00:02:30.750> USB<00:02:31.470> hard<00:02:31.710> drives

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
of options there USB hard drives

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.020

just<00:02:33.150> bleep<00:02:33.300> floppy<00:02:33.660> drives<00:02:34.170> if<00:02:34.470> drives<00:02:35.250> so

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
just bleep floppy drives if drives so

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.220 
just bleep floppy drives if drives so
anyway<00:02:36.270> we're<00:02:36.480> just<00:02:36.630> going<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.810> leave<00:02:36.960> it<00:02:37.110> as

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
anyway we're just going to leave it as

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.920 
anyway we're just going to leave it as
cd-rom<00:02:37.950> so<00:02:38.310> we<00:02:38.490> can<00:02:38.700> reinstall<00:02:39.030> our<00:02:39.360> operating

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
cd-rom so we can reinstall our operating

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.600 
cd-rom so we can reinstall our operating
system<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.300> select<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:42.990> here<00:02:43.380> we<00:02:43.590> have

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.260 

boot<00:02:47.610> device

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
boot device

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.900 
boot device
so<00:02:48.690> first<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.290> cd-rom<00:02:49.680> second<00:02:50.610> will<00:02:50.730> be<00:02:50.880> a

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
so first the cd-rom second will be a

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.570 
so first the cd-rom second will be a
hard<00:02:51.209> disk<00:02:51.480> right<00:02:52.160> once<00:02:53.160> we<00:02:53.310> have<00:02:53.459> an
