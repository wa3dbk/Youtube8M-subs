00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.600 
album I wanted to make a very optimistic
sounding<00:00:10.590> record<00:00:11.900> for<00:00:12.900> whatever<00:00:13.019> reason<00:00:13.620> it's

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
sounding record for whatever reason it's

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.680 
sounding record for whatever reason it's
much<00:00:14.880> easier<00:00:15.360> for<00:00:15.599> me<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:16.080> sort<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.850> write<00:00:17.850> sort

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
much easier for me to sort of write sort

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.010 
much easier for me to sort of write sort
of<00:00:18.779> sad<00:00:19.670> melancholy<00:00:20.670> sort<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.270> melodies<00:00:21.689> it's

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
of sad melancholy sort of melodies it's

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.029 
of sad melancholy sort of melodies it's
just<00:00:22.199> natural<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.119> so<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.630> wanted<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.320> kind<00:00:26.010> of

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
just natural and so I wanted to kind of

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.620 
just natural and so I wanted to kind of
play<00:00:26.220> against<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.760> little<00:00:27.060> bit<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.390> see

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
play against that a little bit and see

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.599 
play against that a little bit and see
what<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.840> could<00:00:27.990> come<00:00:28.140> up<00:00:28.289> with<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.800> it's<00:00:28.920> it

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
what I could come up with and it's it

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.150 
what I could come up with and it's it
can<00:00:29.760> be<00:00:29.849> quite<00:00:30.060> hard<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.420> write<00:00:30.750> an<00:00:31.710> optimistic

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
can be quite hard to write an optimistic

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.709 
can be quite hard to write an optimistic
song<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.759> doesn't<00:00:32.910> fall<00:00:33.180> over<00:00:33.239> into

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
song that doesn't fall over into

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.639 
song that doesn't fall over into
melodrama<00:00:35.120> so<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.149> consider<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.200> challenge

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
melodrama so I consider the challenge

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.389 
melodrama so I consider the challenge
and<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:39.530> when<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.559> started<00:00:40.860> putting<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.129> record

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399

not<00:02:06.520> like<00:02:06.729> mixed<00:02:07.509> in<00:02:07.659> a<00:02:07.750> studio<00:02:08.080> or<00:02:08.379> anything

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
not like mixed in a studio or anything

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.160 
not like mixed in a studio or anything
it's<00:02:09.009> like<00:02:09.069> really<00:02:09.519> raw<00:02:09.700> sounding<00:02:10.360> which<00:02:11.050> I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
it's like really raw sounding which I

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.619 
it's like really raw sounding which I
really<00:02:11.379> like<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.040> so<00:02:12.459> I'm<00:02:12.940> thinking<00:02:13.300> that

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
really like it and so I'm thinking that

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.330 
really like it and so I'm thinking that
maybe<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.930> next<00:02:14.050> record<00:02:14.440> might<00:02:14.590> sound<00:02:14.950> more

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
maybe the next record might sound more

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.990 
maybe the next record might sound more
like<00:02:15.550> that<00:02:16.000> where<00:02:16.269> it's<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:17.849> lot<00:02:18.849> more

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
like that where it's a lot more

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.190 
like that where it's a lot more
imperfect<00:02:19.420> that's<00:02:19.750> what<00:02:19.840> we<00:02:19.900> were<00:02:19.989> talking

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
imperfect that's what we were talking

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.289 
imperfect that's what we were talking
about<00:02:20.230> before<00:02:20.410> yeah<00:02:21.250> well<00:02:21.489> I<00:02:21.519> haven't<00:02:21.730> figured

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
about before yeah well I haven't figured

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.440 
about before yeah well I haven't figured
out<00:02:22.420> like<00:02:22.750> any<00:02:23.650> sort<00:02:23.920> of<00:02:24.040> overarching<00:02:24.700> concept

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
out like any sort of overarching concept

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.410 
out like any sort of overarching concept
that<00:02:25.660> would<00:02:25.840> make<00:02:26.019> sense<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.560> really<00:02:27.420> start

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
that would make sense to really start

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.289 
that would make sense to really start
putting<00:02:28.569> a<00:02:28.750> record<00:02:29.049> together<00:02:29.790> it's<00:02:30.790> more<00:02:31.030> just

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
putting a record together it's more just

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.300 
putting a record together it's more just
as<00:02:31.660> I<00:02:31.810> was<00:02:31.930> saying<00:02:32.170> just<00:02:32.349> writing<00:02:32.950> songs<00:02:33.220> for

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
as I was saying just writing songs for

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.580 
as I was saying just writing songs for
fun<00:02:33.579> without<00:02:33.819> trying<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.870> guide<00:02:35.019> them<00:02:35.319> at<00:02:35.410> all

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
fun without trying to guide them at all

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.259 
fun without trying to guide them at all
and<00:02:37.079> it's<00:02:38.079> opened<00:02:38.470> up<00:02:38.620> you<00:02:39.370> know<00:02:39.489> some

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
and it's opened up you know some

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.650 
and it's opened up you know some
possibilities<00:02:41.049> of<00:02:41.260> thought<00:02:41.440> about<00:02:41.709> maybe

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
possibilities of thought about maybe

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.170 
possibilities of thought about maybe
reaching<00:02:43.660> out<00:02:44.049> to<00:02:44.500> some<00:02:45.400> rappers<00:02:45.790> I<00:02:45.910> enjoy

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
reaching out to some rappers I enjoy

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.130 
reaching out to some rappers I enjoy
that<00:02:46.450> maybe<00:02:46.630> we<00:02:46.720> could<00:02:46.810> do<00:02:46.930> some

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
that maybe we could do some

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.009 
that maybe we could do some
collaborations<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.340> I<00:02:48.670> like<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.660> idea<00:02:49.959> of

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
collaborations and I like the idea of

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.289 
collaborations and I like the idea of
not<00:02:50.500> jumping<00:02:50.890> straight<00:02:51.190> into<00:02:51.310> doing<00:02:52.150> another

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
not jumping straight into doing another

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.509 
not jumping straight into doing another
washed-out<00:02:52.690> record<00:02:53.140> because<00:02:53.349> it<00:02:54.099> can<00:02:54.220> be<00:02:54.340> very

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
washed-out record because it can be very

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:55.920 
washed-out record because it can be very
time<00:02:54.730> intensive<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.510> once<00:02:55.630> the<00:02:55.750> ball<00:02:55.900> starts

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
time intensive and once the ball starts

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.520 
time intensive and once the ball starts
rolling<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:57.640> know<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:58.180> can<00:02:58.299> easily<00:02:58.480> kind<00:02:59.379> of

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
rolling you know you can easily kind of

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.680 
rolling you know you can easily kind of
set<00:02:59.709> aside<00:02:59.739> two<00:03:00.190> years<00:03:00.519> of<00:03:00.760> touring<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:01.599> all

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
set aside two years of touring and all

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.500 
set aside two years of touring and all
that<00:03:01.930> so<00:03:02.349> I<00:03:02.650> really<00:03:03.099> do<00:03:03.220> enjoy<00:03:03.340> it

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
that so I really do enjoy it

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.650 
that so I really do enjoy it
mainly<00:03:05.140> because<00:03:05.670> for<00:03:06.670> me<00:03:06.900> it's<00:03:07.900> really<00:03:08.049> hard

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
mainly because for me it's really hard

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.059 
mainly because for me it's really hard
putting<00:03:10.660> melodies<00:03:11.139> together<00:03:11.380> so<00:03:11.769> it's<00:03:11.889> nice

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
putting melodies together so it's nice

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.580 
putting melodies together so it's nice
having<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:13.060> melody<00:03:13.569> there<00:03:13.750> from<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.049> start<00:03:14.350> to

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
having a melody there from the start to

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.809 
having a melody there from the start to
sort<00:03:14.799> of<00:03:14.859> build<00:03:14.920> around<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:17.130> that<00:03:18.130> said<00:03:18.430> I'm<00:03:18.549> a

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
sort of build around and that said I'm a

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.699 
sort of build around and that said I'm a
little<00:03:19.389> bit<00:03:19.510> picky<00:03:19.810> about<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:22.209> song<00:03:22.450> I<00:03:23.109> just

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
little bit picky about the song I just

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.000 
little bit picky about the song I just
want<00:03:23.829> to<00:03:23.889> make<00:03:24.040> sure<00:03:24.069> that<00:03:24.700> it<00:03:24.850> works<00:03:25.780> you<00:03:26.380> know

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
want to make sure that it works you know

and that melody especially

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.369 
and that melody especially
on<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:33.760> mobi<00:03:34.030> track<00:03:34.269> was<00:03:34.510> just<00:03:34.750> perfect<00:03:35.260> you
