battery power optimum zerotree on the

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:02.789 
battery power optimum zerotree on the
bench<00:01:00.580> then<00:01:00.879> we<00:01:01.059> can<00:01:01.720> drive<00:01:01.989> the<00:01:02.260> injector

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:02.799 
bench then we can drive the injector

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:07.890 
bench then we can drive the injector
with<00:01:03.129> mmz<00:01:03.699> retrieve<00:01:04.119> or<00:01:04.420> coil<00:01:04.780> and<00:01:05.080> diesel<00:01:06.900> and

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
with mmz retrieve or coil and diesel and

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.960 
with mmz retrieve or coil and diesel and
this<00:01:08.260> so<00:01:08.530> this<00:01:08.560> will<00:01:08.860> allow<00:01:08.979> us<00:01:09.130> to<00:01:09.310> test<00:01:09.700> the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
this so this will allow us to test the

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.020 
this so this will allow us to test the
spray<00:01:10.240> pattern<00:01:10.540> the<00:01:11.470> injector<00:01:12.400> open<00:01:12.909> and

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
spray pattern the injector open and

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.899 
spray pattern the injector open and
pressure<00:01:13.270> and<00:01:13.930> also<00:01:14.920> we<00:01:15.189> can<00:01:15.340> check<00:01:15.520> the<00:01:15.729> leak

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
pressure and also we can check the leak

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.570 
pressure and also we can check the leak
battery<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:18.460> we<00:01:18.490> select<00:01:19.090> injectors<00:01:20.400> coil<00:01:21.400> or

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
battery so we select injectors coil or

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.550 
battery so we select injectors coil or
piezo<00:01:22.000> so<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.540> one<00:01:22.689> we're<00:01:22.810> testing<00:01:23.320> is<00:01:23.439> the

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
piezo so the one we're testing is the

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.770 
piezo so the one we're testing is the
coil<00:01:23.950> -<00:01:24.610> injector<00:01:25.380> enter<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:27.400> I<00:01:27.570> know<00:01:28.570> as<00:01:28.689> you

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
coil - injector enter so I know as you

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.569 
coil - injector enter so I know as you
can<00:01:28.840> see<00:01:29.079> you<00:01:29.229> can<00:01:29.409> view<00:01:29.619> you<00:01:30.070> can<00:01:30.249> view<00:01:30.280> all

the tests for the tightness test you can

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.910 
the tests for the tightness test you can
insert<00:02:04.150> the<00:02:04.360> opening<00:02:04.870> pressure<00:02:05.140> when<00:02:05.710> when

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
insert the opening pressure when when

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.410 
insert the opening pressure when when
your<00:02:06.070> test<00:02:06.310> injector<00:02:06.790> and<00:02:06.880> see<00:02:07.030> what<00:02:07.210> pressure

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
your test injector and see what pressure

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.740 
your test injector and see what pressure
is<00:02:07.690> automatically<00:02:08.560> in<00:02:08.830> here<00:02:09.100> and<00:02:09.850> say<00:02:10.030> okay<00:02:10.600> or

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
is automatically in here and say okay or

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.070 
is automatically in here and say okay or
not<00:02:10.899> okay<00:02:10.960> for<00:02:11.350> spray<00:02:11.890> pattern<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.930> then

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
not okay for spray pattern and so then

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.410 
not okay for spray pattern and so then
you<00:02:14.200> can<00:02:14.350> print<00:02:14.560> this<00:02:14.800> say<00:02:15.580> if<00:02:15.700> this<00:02:15.880> too<00:02:16.180> short

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
you can print this say if this too short

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.760 
you can print this say if this too short
across<00:02:16.690> tomorrow<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:18.420> also<00:02:19.420> then<00:02:19.780> here<00:02:20.560> you

as you can see it type tons of here - it
goes<00:02:44.680> over<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.040> Russian<00:02:45.580> stage<00:02:45.880> tightness

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
goes over to a Russian stage tightness

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.650 
goes over to a Russian stage tightness
test<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:47.640> open<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:48.760> pressure<00:02:48.970> test

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
test and open and pressure test

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.570 
test and open and pressure test
like<00:02:50.290> for<00:02:50.500> example<00:02:50.530> in<00:02:50.950> Oakland<00:02:51.370> pressure

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
like for example in Oakland pressure

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.220 
like for example in Oakland pressure
tells<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.060> bring<00:02:52.270> it<00:02:52.390> up<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:54.090> 201

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
tells you bring it up to 201

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.170 
tells you bring it up to 201
milliseconds<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.739> said<00:02:57.070> to<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.280> frequency<00:02:57.940> of

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
milliseconds and said to a frequency of

1<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.570> 3<00:02:58.600> Hertz<00:02:59.050> and<00:02:59.440> tested<00:02:59.860> for<00:03:00.040> 40<00:03:00.280> seconds

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
1 to 3 Hertz and tested for 40 seconds

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.680 
1 to 3 Hertz and tested for 40 seconds
okay<00:03:03.190> so<00:03:03.250> first<00:03:03.549> module<00:03:03.940> due<00:03:04.330> date<00:03:04.510> will<00:03:04.660> you

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
okay so first module due date will you

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.990 
okay so first module due date will you
do<00:03:04.900> good<00:03:05.230> flush<00:03:05.560> Russian<00:03:06.400> stage<00:03:08.220> so<00:03:09.220> main

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
do good flush Russian stage so main

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.830 
do good flush Russian stage so main
injection<00:03:10.630> I<00:03:12.030> was<00:03:13.030> telling<00:03:13.330> us<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.570> part

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
injection I was telling us the part

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.050 
injection I was telling us the part
number<00:03:14.260> of<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.860> very<00:03:15.130> pressure<00:03:15.430> sensor<00:03:15.940> to

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
number of the very pressure sensor to

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.940 
number of the very pressure sensor to
use<00:03:16.209> and<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.540> hand<00:03:16.720> pump<00:03:16.930> so<00:03:17.260> that's<00:03:17.500> that<00:03:17.799> is

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
use and the hand pump so that's that is

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.240 
use and the hand pump so that's that is
the<00:03:17.980> one<00:03:18.190> where<00:03:18.400> he<00:03:18.519> wasn't<00:03:18.870> my<00:03:19.870> center<00:03:22.890> now<00:03:23.890> so

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
the one where he wasn't my center now so

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.190 
the one where he wasn't my center now so
I'm<00:03:24.580> flushing<00:03:24.970> stage<00:03:25.360> first<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:25.870> bring<00:03:26.019> it<00:03:26.110> to

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
I'm flushing stage first and bring it to

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.740 
I'm flushing stage first and bring it to
3-under<00:03:26.620> par<00:03:26.880> opening<00:03:27.880> frequency<00:03:28.510> of<00:03:28.600> 1

3-under par opening frequency of 1
millisecond<00:03:29.560> which<00:03:29.799> was<00:03:30.010> okay<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:31.360> we<00:03:31.510> bring

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
millisecond which was okay and we bring

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.580 
millisecond which was okay and we bring
it<00:03:31.780> up<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:33.209> 10<00:03:34.209> Hertz

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.860 

okay<00:03:38.590> I'm<00:03:39.100> just<00:03:39.460> stopped<00:03:39.940> and<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.330> just<00:03:40.510> just

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
okay I'm just stopped and you just just

00:03:40.870 --> 00:04:06.120 
okay I'm just stopped and you just just
press<00:03:41.080> here<00:04:03.180> so<00:04:04.180> that's<00:04:04.360> just<00:04:04.540> that<00:04:05.130> flush

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
press here so that's just that flush

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.250 
press here so that's just that flush
flush<00:04:06.760> and<00:04:06.970> stage<00:04:07.210> and<00:04:07.510> it's<00:04:07.600> just<00:04:07.780> gonna<00:04:07.960> play

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
flush and stage and it's just gonna play

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.790 
flush and stage and it's just gonna play
me<00:04:08.440> later

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
me later

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.520 
me later
I'm<00:04:09.100> Prime<00:04:09.670> and<00:04:09.850> I<00:04:09.970> promote<00:04:10.600> injector<00:04:13.530> then

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
I'm Prime and I promote injector then

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.039 
I'm Prime and I promote injector then
you<00:04:14.710> can<00:04:14.860> also<00:04:15.010> do<00:04:15.310> a<00:04:15.390> tightness<00:04:16.390> tightness

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
you can also do a tightness tightness

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.240 
you can also do a tightness tightness
test<00:04:19.290> so<00:04:20.290> like<00:04:20.440> I<00:04:20.470> said<00:04:20.680> you<00:04:20.920> bring<00:04:21.130> the

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
test so like I said you bring the

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.630 
test so like I said you bring the
pressure<00:04:21.459> up<00:04:21.700> to<00:04:21.730> about<00:04:22.030> 500<00:04:22.420> bar<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:24.250> minimum

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
pressure up to about 500 bar the minimum

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.140 
pressure up to about 500 bar the minimum
pressure<00:04:24.790> of<00:04:25.060> 200<00:04:25.270> bar<00:04:26.430> so<00:04:27.430> your<00:04:27.610> time<00:04:27.880> how

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
pressure of 200 bar so your time how

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.420 
pressure of 200 bar so your time how
long<00:04:28.180> it<00:04:28.420> takes<00:04:28.570> the<00:04:29.140> pressure<00:04:29.290> to<00:04:29.800> drop<00:04:30.040> four

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
long it takes the pressure to drop four

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.660 
long it takes the pressure to drop four
five<00:04:30.670> hundred<00:04:30.940> to<00:04:31.330> two<00:04:31.480> hundred<00:04:31.510> bar<00:04:32.160> and<00:04:33.160> it

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
five hundred to two hundred bar and it

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:39.270 
five hundred to two hundred bar and it
should<00:04:34.540> be<00:04:34.630> a<00:04:34.660> minimum<00:04:34.840> of<00:04:35.200> ten<00:04:35.440> seconds<00:04:38.280> then

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
should be a minimum of ten seconds then

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.010 
should be a minimum of ten seconds then
the<00:04:39.430> next<00:04:39.670> another<00:04:39.970> test<00:04:40.300> we<00:04:40.510> can<00:04:40.660> do<00:04:40.750> then<00:04:40.990> is

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
the next another test we can do then is

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.770 
the next another test we can do then is
the<00:04:41.260> open<00:04:41.650> and<00:04:41.800> pressure<00:04:42.210> and<00:04:43.210> we'll<00:04:43.480> do<00:04:43.570> this

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
the open and pressure and we'll do this

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.340 
the open and pressure and we'll do this
now<00:04:44.020> so<00:04:44.350> we<00:04:45.250> bring<00:04:45.460> to<00:04:45.810> bring<00:04:46.810> the<00:04:46.900> pressure<00:04:47.110> up

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
now so we bring to bring the pressure up

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.700 
now so we bring to bring the pressure up
to<00:04:47.470> two<00:04:47.620> hundred<00:04:47.650> power<00:04:48.540> the<00:04:49.540> optimal<00:04:50.290> opening

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
to two hundred power the optimal opening

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.160 
to two hundred power the optimal opening
one<00:04:50.950> millisecond<00:04:51.730> so<00:04:52.030> this<00:04:52.210> set<00:04:52.510> to<00:04:52.660> that<00:04:52.810> and

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
one millisecond so this set to that and

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.490 
one millisecond so this set to that and
a<00:04:53.290> frequency<00:04:53.860> of<00:04:53.890> 1<00:04:54.160> to<00:04:54.370> 3<00:04:54.400> Hertz<00:04:55.410> will<00:04:56.410> you

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
a frequency of 1 to 3 Hertz will you

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.530 
a frequency of 1 to 3 Hertz will you
just<00:04:56.680> turn<00:04:56.890> the<00:04:57.100> Hertz

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.550 

3<00:05:01.540> Hertz<00:05:01.810> and<00:05:02.410> do<00:05:02.890> this<00:05:03.010> for<00:05:03.250> 5<00:05:03.460> seconds<00:05:04.060> so<00:05:04.560> I

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
3 Hertz and do this for 5 seconds so I

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.330 
3 Hertz and do this for 5 seconds so I
press<00:05:05.860> Start

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
press Start

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.020 
press Start
yeah

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.939 

with<00:05:12.030> pumps<00:05:12.780> turn<00:05:13.080> off<00:05:13.229> the<00:05:13.349> pressure<00:05:13.590> slowly

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
with pumps turn off the pressure slowly

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.950 
with pumps turn off the pressure slowly
see<00:05:14.610> when<00:05:14.819> injector<00:05:15.300> opens<00:05:17.479> as<00:05:18.479> you<00:05:18.630> can<00:05:18.780> see

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
see when injector opens as you can see

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.939 
see when injector opens as you can see
it<00:05:19.080> start<00:05:19.440> oh<00:05:20.270> just<00:05:21.270> like<00:05:21.889> somewhere<00:05:22.889> between

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
it start oh just like somewhere between

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:41.830 
it start oh just like somewhere between
a<00:05:23.250> hundred<00:05:23.490> and<00:05:23.940> he<00:05:24.720> hits<00:05:25.110> two<00:05:25.349> on<00:05:25.530> the<00:05:25.680> bar

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.300 

then<00:05:42.840> another<00:05:43.139> test<00:05:43.500> where<00:05:43.770> you<00:05:43.830> can<00:05:44.009> do<00:05:44.130> we

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
then another test where you can do we

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.600 
then another test where you can do we
can<00:05:44.430> just<00:05:44.610> check<00:05:45.210> the<00:05:45.389> spray<00:05:45.659> pattern<00:05:46.550> so<00:05:47.550> if

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
can just check the spray pattern so if

00:05:47.610 --> 00:06:03.379 
can just check the spray pattern so if
you<00:05:47.699> can<00:05:47.849> zoom<00:05:47.880> in<00:05:48.300> so<00:05:48.690> many<00:05:48.870> others<00:06:02.210> that's<00:06:03.210> it

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:03.389 
you can zoom in so many others that's it

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:04.790 
you can zoom in so many others that's it
then<00:06:03.569> so<00:06:03.780> we<00:06:03.930> can<00:06:04.080> fill<00:06:04.289> in<00:06:04.440> all<00:06:04.620> the<00:06:04.770> details

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
then so we can fill in all the details

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.070 
then so we can fill in all the details
of<00:06:05.430> the<00:06:05.580> injector<00:06:06.060> here<00:06:06.240> a<00:06:06.300> part<00:06:06.599> number<00:06:06.659> and

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
of the injector here a part number and

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.159 
of the injector here a part number and
print<00:06:07.289> it<00:06:07.440> off<00:06:08.569> may<00:06:09.569> be<00:06:09.630> said<00:06:09.870> then<00:06:10.050> you<00:06:10.139> have

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
print it off may be said then you have

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.409 
print it off may be said then you have
instructions<00:06:10.740> for<00:06:11.099> each<00:06:11.550> type<00:06:11.819> of<00:06:11.849> injector

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
instructions for each type of injector

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.749 
instructions for each type of injector
so<00:06:12.599> this<00:06:12.750> is<00:06:12.840> the<00:06:12.930> bosch<00:06:13.110> kind<00:06:13.979> of<00:06:14.190> cone

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 
so this is the bosch kind of cone

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.029 
so this is the bosch kind of cone
injector<00:06:15.270> if<00:06:15.930> we<00:06:16.110> keep<00:06:16.259> scrolling<00:06:16.530> down<00:06:16.889> when

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 
injector if we keep scrolling down when

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:20.899 
injector if we keep scrolling down when
you<00:06:17.130> have<00:06:17.280> the<00:06:17.490> Delphi<00:06:18.500> injector<00:06:19.500> test<00:06:20.340> test
