00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.970
 beauty with natural products but there is 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.070
 a little surprise for you 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.780
 let's see what I combined ed 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.119
 here I am in the kitchen today I will prepare a 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.100
 lipstick or big lights of dawn da da 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.449
 colored the ingredients to give the 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.970
 color to yours the same gloss 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.199
 lip glosses are powder pigments 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.170
 compact or loose powder or 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.880
 you can even choose a blush 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.860
 while for the texture choose or a 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.300
 lipstick in this case I chose a 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.879
 neutral color so you can 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.800
 change and vary at will the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.500
 lip balm or a lip gloss 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.670
 depending on your preferences and 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.440
 day 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.570
 let's make a colored lip balm since 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.010
 we combine business with pleasant things 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.610
 we have lips with both a thesis and 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.870
 moisturized and put it inside the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.449
 your undergarment is a very pretty thing 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.680
 to do is then have a container with 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.750
 the cork in this way you can 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.390
 just bring in your purse 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.610
 the easiest choice is to 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.970
 take a loose powder pigment 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.470
 because naturally it is ready and will be 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.840
 just my choice there 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.369
 we complicate life but wanting if not 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.799
 you have a pigment like this you can 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.060
 take a plus or an eye shadow like 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.830
 we just said 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.510
 and in this way picked up some 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:30.300
 produced with a small spatula 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.230
 even with the back of the tweezers 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.670
 put it inside yours 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:37.500
 believe container but I wanted something 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.040
 more colorful then chose this 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.770
 beautiful fuchsia and precisely it is a mix 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.920

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.460
 the wave put as much as you want 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:56.460
 depending on how much you want to sell 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:58.320
 intense if you combine it so that you 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.060
 dissolve like the pigment inside the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.110
 Our lip balm of the changes color 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.240

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.410
 like the one of the eyeshadow I'll put on 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.360
 inside your container 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.490

 because you can create it like I did 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.250
 with different pigments then create 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.560
