00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.350
 consists of seventy five lessons and 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.280

 theoretical and practical materials 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.740
 also homework 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.359
 after studying each lesson chess 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.730
 should play one two games with 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.920
 rival or with a chess program on 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.619
 corresponding to the third grade level 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.119
 the difficulty in part 1 of the program is almost 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.450
 half the training time is set aside 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.649
 tactics and it is no coincidence 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.809
 beginner chess player is very important 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.790
 own a tactical weapon to be able to 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.950
 find hidden opportunities to understand 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.290
 enemy designs ingeniously 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.180
 creative conduct miter spire many 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.820
 outstanding chess players were at the beginning 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.829
 his way of sports tactics and only 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.649
 then successfully mastered the subtleties 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.420
 positional game in section 1 of the academic 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.949
 plan contains lessons in which 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.140
 sufficiently disassembled 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.020
 elementary concepts necessary for 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.270
 chess game tactics in the training section 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.400
 the plan precedes the end section 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.710
 I think it is necessary to clarify this 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.330
 location there is an opinion that in 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.080
 first need to learn 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.970
 endgame 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.010
 and then metro spire and debut 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.900
 really important walls spire for 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.330
 mastering a chess game is very great 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.460
 exactly the ending in our course to them 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.350
 given a lot of time give the opportunity 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.750
 concepts master the basic elements and 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.430
 techniques however here you can 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.619
 refer to the authority of capablanca 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.659
 who writes chess games in the textbook 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.250
 that most playing chess 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.740
 first of all interested 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.869
 combinations and direct attacks on the king 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.759
 as the chess player intensifies 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.409
 he becomes interested in others. 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.060
 moments of the game so that 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.729
 to interest a novice chess player 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.860
 show him the beauty of the combinations section 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.590
 tactic is located in our course in front 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.570
 end section as regards debut 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.369
 We believe the stages are deeply flawed. 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.740
 introduce novice chess players to 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.969
 variants of different beginnings since this 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.290
 the method is not conducive to development 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.600
 autonomy 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.719
 more importantly by introducing students to the general 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.729
 principles lessons 11 12 further

 his personality in the game is open 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.300
 semi open and closed and start 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.220
 lesson goal in 7175 on material 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.140
 specially selected games played 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.180
 any debut show how to 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.220
 work on studying it which 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.390
 the most typical plans stem from 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.370
 this construction 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.230
 a few words about the practical part 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.390
 classes as we said after 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.069
 every lesson novice chess player

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.069
 modern teaching methods allow 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.260
 use computer and chess 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.970

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.840
 errors and unused opportunities 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.150
 it is very important that the student try to 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.610
