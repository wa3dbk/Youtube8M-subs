00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.879
 Hello everyone, I will introduce you to the 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.870
 droid complaint ' plus 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.790
 it is a simple yet useful application 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.250
 today the android notification is based 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.900
 in English depending on the program you 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.789
 send color may vary but still 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.240
 when I received these messages 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.449
 Only the led is not enough. I'll show you. 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.289
 an example without using the program as it is 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.289
 android today 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:50.290
 How can you see a winking woman? 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:53.680
 in this case it is the gecoc blue led arrangement but 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.440
 So, who did the message that I sent 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.830
 I do not know how to know, I have to do this. 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.830
 process 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:09.190
 wake up the cell phone in my case 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:14.619
 unlock down the bar 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:16.509
 notice and see who saw if I want 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.750
 I can interact with the person by clicking 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.750
 on 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.390
 this process is very slow than the 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.770
 application does makes it all 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.580
 automatic 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:36.060
 I'll show you first, let's go. 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.060
 Look for it I did not complete the place tour 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.950
 the name of the program is droid I notified a 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.450
 plus 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.990
 there are many notification programs 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.330
 google play today but this is the 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.830
 differential because it is very light and 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.909
 interacts directly with the 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.909
 android notification 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.740
 I already have here droid notified plans 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.990
 this android symbol with the message 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.990
 among which over 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.649
 click install 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.769
 he has less than 43 heads to open 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.349
 first of all you need to activate 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.280
 an application that is the first option 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.739
 on here 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:40.430
 the application is disabled, click 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:42.410
 I'll go to the droid services 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:54.410
 I notified chance off 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:56.900
 Let's get him out of here. 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:02.660
 now i will select the application either 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:06.010
 monitor it is in the applications that 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.010
 have installed on your device 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.620
 facebook gmail gmail 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.590
 these three are enough 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:28.110
 I have another option now that the 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.560
 from censor not connect up in the pocket 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.840
 this is very important to leave activated 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:39.180
 because it 's too annoying to turn on the 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.920
 Your Pocket Display Notification Projects 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.620
 I'll leave it disabled for us. 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.310
 test it later activated for us 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:50.190
 to check the difference between 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.680
 identify what is interesting you 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.750
 do not want from 11 to 9 in the morning that is 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.540
 configured that I can change 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.630
 I do not want the appliance to handle this 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:04.020
 interval can configure 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:07.460
 connected screen time by leaving the 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.460
 default which are ten seconds 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.750
 that alone is enough for the program 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.890
 to function 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.890
 I'll show you 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.030
 as of the notification 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.510
 she received the notice he exhibited the 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.210
 notification 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.630
 even with the device locked by password 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.960
 It will be ten seconds and will go out 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.960
 screen 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:05:01.900
 I'll send again even blocked 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.680
 With password you can interact more 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.680
 you can not unlock the device without 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.580
 just click to enter your 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.130
 interact 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.280
 you must enter the password by question 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.280
 of security 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:25.440
 another interesting feature is the 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.440
 gesture notification 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.710
 gesture notification 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:33.700
 it prevents it from turning on 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:36.760
 when you are not present 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:41.430
 for this it is necessary to leave this option 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.430
 activated display gesture notification 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.950
 now when you receive a message 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:56.110
 it will only turn on the device if you 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:58.420
 spend the night over the sensor 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:04.350
 I'll show you already receive the message is 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:04.350
 flashing oled to go over 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:15.030
 ok so he avoids getting up 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:17.610
 no taboos and this is the same process 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.680
 for 10 seconds and it turns off lock 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.650
 phone again 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.360
 Good, this is it, I hope you guys 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.960
 have enjoyed 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.960
 See you
