00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.659
 and me 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.180
 you have to spend less than gestha 56 stratum 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.530
 today I bring you a boyfriend for the channel and 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.600
 good guys today I bring you a small 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.759
 how to make a character tutorial 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.099
 zombie in gta 5 in the new generation 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.349
 whether a character transferred from 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.849
 a console from the old generation or 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.800
 be a new character created you know 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.939
 that you have this option to create bonds 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.590
 of vital character a little more 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.540
 In detail, well, let's go 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.880
 start and in the origins we will choose 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.010
 from mother to isabella and father to noa 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.870
 let's try to get a zombie or 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.730
 something similar to the closest thing to a 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.440
 zombie is worth how ugly it is in the 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.940
 like we are going to put everything towards the 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.320
 side of the mother to the left the 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.910
 skin tone well then here you can 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.320
 play to your liking you can make a 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.149
 black zombie although good a zombie of 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.640
 normal a little bit so pale and so on 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.170
 let's put the skin tone almost to 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.050
 stop to the left we will leave a 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.269
 little bit to get to the top then in 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.489
 traits look good here we have several 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.899
 front or nose options are worth and 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.550
 we can move down with the 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.710
 joystick that little ball that there is and we can 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.059
 get a change in the good front 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.880
 Well, what we are going to do here is 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.800
 leave it down to the left that 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.480
 we got a zombie face a little 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.400
 pissed that is ideal 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.170
 then in eyes we will leave it in eyes 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.460
 great to notice that we can put 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.670
 small or large so we leave 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.980
 big nose we leave it then up 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.510
 to the left is as you have seen 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.150
 that you leave it and the profile of the nose 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.830
 down to the left then the form of 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.990
 the nose so good here we can see a 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.150
 Also to see what noses 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.280
 like more all this is indicative then 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.780
 you can already do it to your liking but 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.610
 well I say more or less as it would be 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.920
 well this is the shape of the nose the 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.710
 let's leave in the middle then what they are 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.150
 the cheekbones we are going to leave them down to the 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.220
 left 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.410
 Well, I think that so, too, 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.360
 cheeks to the left of all the 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.940
 thin lips is to say on the left the 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.400
 everything also the jaw up to the 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.850
 left the profile of the chin down to 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.350
 the right one and well then we have the 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.730
 chin shape that is up to the 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.920
 right and good we will have completed 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.920
 the features section then in 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.899
 appearance let's put a shave 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.340
 personally, I would do it with a 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.050
 male character since we can 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.760
 remove the shirt and we can get 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.830
 a better zombie you can do it with 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.320
 the feminine but good with the masculine 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.970
 I think it looks a lot better so 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.920
 good in hair you already know shaved hurry 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.209
 and the color, well, you can put it on 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.280
 color that you want but good I 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.020
 would prefer the truth the second color of 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.810
 the left that looks pretty good 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.459
 then in the eyebrows we are going to leave them in 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.130
 neglected as you see here to 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.010
 continuation in facial hair we are not going 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.260
 to put absolutely nothing in spots of 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.910
 his skin will put severe acne 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.410
 I think it's pretty good they fixed 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.140
 the opacity that I have below also 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.350
 dejais worth wrinkle in the Geriatric 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.180
 skin tone on polka dot totem 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.209
 texas let's give it for all parties 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.670
 in the cracked skin the color of the 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.109
 eyes in light gray the makeup of the 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.269
 eyes let's leave it in desolate and 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:01.549
 fix then that we can move what is 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.840
 opacity and good I have put it to 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.239
 one hundred percent that I think is 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.060
 pretty good like that with paint like this 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.310
 as if it had run and then in 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.889
 lipstick we are going to put smudged a 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.750
 color so normalillo is ok and we're going to 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.489
 play with opacity and opacity is 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.980
 has put as much as it seems like a 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.019
 little blood roll although good in blood 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.549
 obviously but good and it's already 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.959
 we have the character the only thing that 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.209
 we have to do is enter the mode 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.950
 online remove the shirt you can 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.480
 put on the shorts that I give you the 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.489
 You can wear it as you wish 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.290
 but well I personally the truth 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.859
 I think a fam and is quite 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.500
 better in plan as I would say in plan 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.939
 well without t-shirts and others worth while 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.970
 it would be ideal if we could 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:45.670
 get clothes 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.470
 for clothes torn clothes full of blood and 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.360
 others and now I will explain a 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.640
 small detail more that you can add 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.250
 to our character so that it is no longer 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.990
 goes more if it comes out and if they press the 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.060
 select button that is something goes out the menu 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.980
 of interaction and others are worth you go 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.620
 where he puts the humor option and 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.360
 you put burdened and you will see what opens the 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.760
 mouth and close your eyes as you will see 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.040
 right now and the truth is that there is a 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.350
 quite interesting effect to me so 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.640
 least I like how it looks and in the way 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.110
 of walking that you already know is a new 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.049
 option that they have put here in the new 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.790
 then you are going to put camps 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.010
 of the bar to walk like a gangster 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.890
 although good as I told you everything 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.950
 this is totally indicative what can you 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.900
 put to your liking but good I more 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.630
 or so I think that way is 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.910
 quite pretty well the truth that 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.669
 there is a good enough zombie 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.350
 realistic and so get that 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.730
 some friend hit a couple of shots or what 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.040
 that is in the body and others are going to 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.530
 get the touch of blood already 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.830
 the zombie is missing and it's going to be the 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.870
 plus 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.160
 set here as it puts player humor 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.180
 what you have told us we put it in 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.370
 overwhelmed and I know 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.530
 with such a pissed face we're going 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.780
 of a face that I really do not 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.430
 I would approach a person like that and the 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.440
 way of caster walking which is the one 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.820
 I have commented to you so nothing more guys 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.590
 just that I hope you liked it already 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.270
