hey guys it's kilometer and today I have

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.460 
hey guys it's kilometer and today I have
something<00:00:02.190> super<00:00:02.879> cool<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.149> show<00:00:03.300> you<00:00:03.360> guys

something super cool to show you guys
you<00:00:04.470> can<00:00:04.589> probably<00:00:04.740> guess<00:00:04.859> what<00:00:05.040> it<00:00:05.130> is<00:00:05.190> by<00:00:05.310> the

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
you can probably guess what it is by the

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.430 
you can probably guess what it is by the
title<00:00:05.910> of<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.029> video<00:00:06.180> but<00:00:06.899> I<00:00:06.960> was<00:00:07.109> typing<00:00:07.259> in

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
title of the video but I was typing in

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.750 
title of the video but I was typing in
seeds<00:00:07.680> randomly<00:00:08.099> last<00:00:08.309> night<00:00:08.460> because<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.730> was

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
seeds randomly last night because I was

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.120 
seeds randomly last night because I was
really<00:00:09.090> bored<00:00:09.300> had<00:00:09.420> nothing<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.780> do<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.139> what

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
really bored had nothing to do and what

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.730 
really bored had nothing to do and what
I<00:00:11.160> came<00:00:11.340> across<00:00:11.460> was<00:00:11.990> super<00:00:12.990> cool<00:00:13.170> first<00:00:13.559> off

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
I came across was super cool first off

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.010 
I came across was super cool first off
though<00:00:14.009> there's<00:00:14.639> this<00:00:14.820> huge<00:00:15.330> Mountain<00:00:15.719> biome

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
though there's this huge Mountain biome

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.050 
though there's this huge Mountain biome
in<00:00:16.170> this<00:00:16.289> world<00:00:16.500> it's<00:00:17.369> got<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.580> bunch<00:00:17.970> of

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
in this world it's got a bunch of

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.939 
in this world it's got a bunch of
different<00:00:18.180> waterfalls<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.560> few<00:00:19.740> Lava

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
different waterfalls and a few Lava

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.279 
different waterfalls and a few Lava
Falls<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.550> it's<00:00:20.789> really<00:00:21.000> cool<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.539> also<00:00:22.170> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
Falls to it's really cool and also the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.590 
Falls to it's really cool and also the
swamp<00:00:22.590> by<00:00:22.740> um<00:00:22.890> it's<00:00:23.070> like<00:00:23.160> underwater<00:00:24.060> which<00:00:24.449> I

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
swamp by um it's like underwater which I

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.000 
swamp by um it's like underwater which I
don't<00:00:24.900> normally<00:00:25.050> see<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:25.619> much<00:00:25.769> well<00:00:25.980> I

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
don't normally see that much well I

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.410 
don't normally see that much well I
guess<00:00:26.189> it's<00:00:26.369> common<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.910> don't<00:00:27.060> know<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.269> thought

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
guess it's common I don't know I thought

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.419 
guess it's common I don't know I thought
it's<00:00:27.570> kind<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.720> cool<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.320> included<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.769> but

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
it's kind of cool so I included that but

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.339 
it's kind of cool so I included that but
anyway<00:00:29.550> more<00:00:30.000> importantly<00:00:30.420> though<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.810> found<00:00:31.289> a

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
anyway more importantly though I found a

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.470 
anyway more importantly though I found a
triple<00:00:31.769> surface<00:00:32.189> spawner<00:00:32.460> which<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.270> actually

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
triple surface spawner which is actually

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.600 
triple surface spawner which is actually
really<00:00:34.079> crazy<00:00:34.440> because<00:00:34.649> finding<00:00:35.130> one<00:00:35.340> surface

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
really crazy because finding one surface

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.549 
really crazy because finding one surface
spawner<00:00:35.850> alone<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.390> rare<00:00:36.600> but<00:00:37.110> finding<00:00:37.380> three

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
spawner alone is rare but finding three

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.459 
spawner alone is rare but finding three
of<00:00:37.710> them<00:00:37.800> together<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:39.140> can't<00:00:40.140> even<00:00:40.230> explain

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
of them together is I can't even explain

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.420 
of them together is I can't even explain
that<00:00:40.710> but<00:00:41.370> anyway<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.820> seed<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.329> sub<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.890> kill

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
that but anyway the seed is sub to kill

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.520 
that but anyway the seed is sub to kill
oh<00:00:44.460> now<00:00:44.940> no<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.809> not<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.989> troll<00:00:46.289> I'm<00:00:46.469> a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
oh now no this is not a troll I'm a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.720 
oh now no this is not a troll I'm a
hundred<00:00:46.680> percent<00:00:46.800> series<00:00:47.250> with<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.550> I

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
hundred percent series with this I

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.279 
hundred percent series with this I
literally<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.300> type<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.140> is

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
literally just type this in and this is

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.840 
literally just type this in and this is
what<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.440> got<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.309> what<00:00:50.399> you're<00:00:50.489> gonna<00:00:50.550> do<00:00:50.760> is

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
what I got so what you're gonna do is

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.729 
what I got so what you're gonna do is
you're<00:00:50.879> gonna<00:00:51.180> spawn<00:00:51.510> first<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.110> think<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
you're gonna spawn first I think in the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.959 
you're gonna spawn first I think in the
south<00:00:52.920> part<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.219> map<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.399> might<00:00:53.670> spawn

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
south part of the map you might spawn

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.069 
south part of the map you might spawn
somewhere<00:00:54.329> else<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.660> don't<00:00:54.809> really<00:00:54.899> know<00:00:55.050> how

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
somewhere else I don't really know how

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.080 
somewhere else I don't really know how
the<00:00:55.230> spawning<00:00:55.500> works<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.070> game<00:00:56.280> yet<00:00:56.430> but

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
the spawning works in this game yet but

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.920 
the spawning works in this game yet but
you'll<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:57.329> want<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.539> head<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.750> north

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
you'll just want to head to the north

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.209 
you'll just want to head to the north
part<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> map<00:00:58.530> you'll<00:00:58.800> see<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.039> on<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
part of the map you'll see it on the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.729 
part of the map you'll see it on the
screen<00:00:59.250> right<00:00:59.640> about<00:00:59.850> now<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.559> you'll<00:01:01.559> see<00:01:01.710> a

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
screen right about now and you'll see a

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.319 
screen right about now and you'll see a
village<00:01:02.070> there<00:01:02.250> too<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.730> that's<00:01:02.940> how<00:01:03.149> you'll

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
village there too so that's how you'll

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.509 
village there too so that's how you'll
know<00:01:03.359> it's<00:01:03.660> around<00:01:04.170> there<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.339> first

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
know it's around there and the first

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.260 
know it's around there and the first
thing<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.729> you're<00:01:05.790> going<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.970> see<00:01:06.090> here

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
thing that you're going to see here

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.550 
thing that you're going to see here
isn't<00:01:06.450> exactly<00:01:06.810> neighboring<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> other

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
isn't exactly neighboring the other

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.410 
isn't exactly neighboring the other
spawners<00:01:07.920> what<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.310> mean<00:01:08.490> it's<00:01:08.610> within<00:01:08.760> like<00:01:09.000> 15

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
spawners what I mean it's within like 15

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.600 
spawners what I mean it's within like 15
blocks<00:01:09.840> may<00:01:10.110> be<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:10.590> close<00:01:11.040> enough<00:01:11.070> and

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
blocks may be so it's close enough and

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.609 
blocks may be so it's close enough and
the<00:01:12.510> other<00:01:12.659> two<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.930> course<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.290> was<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.439> bigger

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
the other two of course it was a bigger

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.929 
the other two of course it was a bigger
one<00:01:13.799> right<00:01:13.830> there<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.250> then<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.369> smaller<00:01:14.700> one

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
one right there and then a smaller one

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.370 
one right there and then a smaller one
and<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.720> little<00:01:15.869> crack<00:01:16.170> right<00:01:16.320> there

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
and that little crack right there

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.899 
and that little crack right there
they're<00:01:16.680> right<00:01:16.830> next<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.070> each<00:01:17.130> other<00:01:17.280> but

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
they're right next to each other but

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:18.830 
they're right next to each other but
they're<00:01:18.119> pretty<00:01:18.299> much<00:01:18.360> all<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.720> same

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
they're pretty much all in the same

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.240 
they're pretty much all in the same
general<00:01:19.110> area<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.470> that's<00:01:19.530> really<00:01:19.830> nice<00:01:19.950> and

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
general area so that's really nice and

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.980 
general area so that's really nice and
first<00:01:21.060> off<00:01:21.240> what<00:01:21.360> we're<00:01:21.450> going<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.630> go<00:01:21.750> over<00:01:21.780> is

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
first off what we're going to go over is

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.390 
first off what we're going to go over is
that<00:01:22.020> third<00:01:22.439> spawner<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:22.950> just<00:01:23.220> mentioned

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
that third spawner that I just mentioned

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.520 
that third spawner that I just mentioned
and<00:01:23.729> once<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.540> dig<00:01:24.689> out<00:01:24.810> all<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.140> sand<00:01:25.380> where

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
and once you dig out all that sand where

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.870 
and once you dig out all that sand where
you're<00:01:25.619> going<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.799> find<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.070> one<00:01:26.250> large<00:01:26.430> chest

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
you're going to find is one large chest

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.280 
you're going to find is one large chest
and<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.570> chest<00:01:27.780> doesn't<00:01:27.930> really<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.259> much

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
and the chest doesn't really have much

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.109 
and the chest doesn't really have much
in<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.680> since<00:01:28.890> most<00:01:29.159> chest<00:01:29.490> downton<00:01:29.880> spawner

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
in it since most chest downton spawner

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.730 
in it since most chest downton spawner
so<00:01:30.329> that's<00:01:30.479> kind<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.720> lame<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.200> guess<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.590> get<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
so that's kind of lame I guess you get a

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.230 
so that's kind of lame I guess you get a
saddle<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.159> every<00:01:32.340> chest<00:01:32.579> though<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.150> can

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
saddle in every chest though so you can

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.420 
saddle in every chest though so you can
write<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.420> pig<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:34.530> once<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.890> roof<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.189> over

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
write a pig but once you roof it over

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.760 
write a pig but once you roof it over
and<00:01:35.759> there's<00:01:36.329> no<00:01:36.689> sunlight<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.500> know<00:01:37.619> to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
and there's no sunlight in you know to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.890 
and there's no sunlight in you know to
set<00:01:37.950> spider<00:01:38.220> spawn<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:38.759> one<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.150> spiders

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
set spider spawn in this one and spiders

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.969 
set spider spawn in this one and spiders
aren't<00:01:40.020> really<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.290> useful<00:01:40.439> since<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.860> only

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
aren't really that useful since I only

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.639 
aren't really that useful since I only
drop<00:01:41.340> string<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.479> spider's<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.170> I'm<00:01:43.409> not<00:01:43.590> sure

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
drop string in a spider's I I'm not sure

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.289 
drop string in a spider's I I'm not sure
if<00:01:43.829> that's<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.130> game<00:01:44.310> yet<00:01:44.490> but<00:01:44.759> it's

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
if that's in the game yet but it's

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.359 
if that's in the game yet but it's
pretty<00:01:45.450> useless<00:01:45.689> anyway<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.890> second<00:01:47.280> one

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
pretty useless anyway but the second one

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.830 
pretty useless anyway but the second one
here<00:01:47.610> spawned<00:01:47.939> skeletons<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.720> with

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
here spawned skeletons and with

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.230 
here spawned skeletons and with
skeletons<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.409> can<00:01:49.590> rarely<00:01:50.220> they<00:01:50.759> drop<00:01:51.000> bows

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
skeletons you can rarely they drop bows

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.719 
skeletons you can rarely they drop bows
but<00:01:51.540> mostly<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.960> drop<00:01:52.170> arrows<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.860> some

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
but mostly the drop arrows and some

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.399 
but mostly the drop arrows and some
bones<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.509> can<00:01:54.810> make<00:01:54.899> bone<00:01:55.079> meal<00:01:55.259> out<00:01:55.380> of

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
bones so you can make bone meal out of

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.289 
bones so you can make bone meal out of
that<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:56.549> course<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.850> pretty<00:01:57.090> much<00:01:57.119> get

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
that and of course you pretty much get

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.730 
that and of course you pretty much get
unlimited<00:01:57.659> arrows<00:01:57.899> if<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.140> make<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.290> trap<00:01:58.590> out

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
unlimited arrows if you make a trap out

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.319 
unlimited arrows if you make a trap out
of<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:58.950> that's<00:01:59.159> really<00:01:59.430> nice<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.790> there's

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
of this that's really nice and there's

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.819 
of this that's really nice and there's
also<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.600> large<00:02:00.750> chest<00:02:01.079> in<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.320> one<00:02:01.500> too<00:02:01.649> but

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
also a large chest in this one too but

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.020 
also a large chest in this one too but
there's<00:02:01.950> not<00:02:02.100> much<00:02:02.310> there's<00:02:02.579> some<00:02:02.700> iron<00:02:02.909> in

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
there's not much there's some iron in

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.880 
there's not much there's some iron in
there<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.930> that's<00:02:04.079> pretty<00:02:04.320> much<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.560> so

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
there but that's pretty much it so

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.679 
there but that's pretty much it so
that's<00:02:05.130> kind<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.340> lame<00:02:05.490> again<00:02:05.790> but<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.600> the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
that's kind of lame again but in the

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.419 
that's kind of lame again but in the
third<00:02:06.930> spawner<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.439> get<00:02:07.590> two<00:02:07.829> small<00:02:08.099> chest

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
third spawner you get two small chest

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.850 
third spawner you get two small chest
and<00:02:08.700> again<00:02:09.300> nothing<00:02:09.690> in<00:02:09.810> these<00:02:09.929> but<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:10.679> is

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
and again nothing in these but this is

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.839 
and again nothing in these but this is
cool<00:02:11.069> though<00:02:11.190> because<00:02:11.340> this<00:02:11.489> will<00:02:11.610> spawn

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
cool though because this will spawn

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.010 
cool though because this will spawn
zombies<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:13.050> may<00:02:13.170> be<00:02:13.230> thinking<00:02:13.470> why

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
zombies and you may be thinking why

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.690 
zombies and you may be thinking why
zombies<00:02:14.350> cool<00:02:14.560> it's<00:02:14.830> they<00:02:15.310> just<00:02:15.490> drop<00:02:15.670> the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
zombies cool it's they just drop the

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.780 
zombies cool it's they just drop the
rotten<00:02:16.090> flesh<00:02:16.330> which<00:02:16.630> is<00:02:16.750> poisonous<00:02:17.380> but<00:02:18.340> it's

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
rotten flesh which is poisonous but it's

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
rotten flesh which is poisonous but it's
cool<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.090> because<00:02:19.240> if<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.390> think<00:02:19.420> about<00:02:19.630> it

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
cool it because if you think about it

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.870 
cool it because if you think about it
all<00:02:20.320> three<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.680> these<00:02:20.800> spawners<00:02:21.070> spawned<00:02:21.670> the

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
all three of these spawners spawned the

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.430 
all three of these spawners spawned the
three<00:02:22.060> different<00:02:22.300> types<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.540> mobs<00:02:22.750> zombies

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
three different types of mobs zombies

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.740 
three different types of mobs zombies
skeletons<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.340> spiders<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:24.730> what<00:02:25.510> I<00:02:25.570> think

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
skeletons and spiders and what I think

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.880 
skeletons and spiders and what I think
would<00:02:25.810> be<00:02:25.930> really<00:02:25.960> cool<00:02:26.350> is<00:02:26.470> if<00:02:26.590> you've<00:02:26.710> made

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
would be really cool is if you've made

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.680 
would be really cool is if you've made
one<00:02:27.160> giant<00:02:27.550> mob<00:02:27.700> trap<00:02:27.910> out<00:02:28.090> of<00:02:28.210> all<00:02:28.390> three<00:02:28.600> of

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
one giant mob trap out of all three of

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.170 
one giant mob trap out of all three of
these<00:02:28.870> so<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:29.530> funnel<00:02:29.980> each<00:02:30.100> mob<00:02:30.370> using<00:02:30.970> water

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
these so you funnel each mob using water

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.210 
these so you funnel each mob using water
into<00:02:31.450> one<00:02:31.630> big<00:02:31.870> area<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.470> then<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:32.980> get<00:02:33.070> all

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
into one big area and then you get all

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.800 
into one big area and then you get all
their<00:02:33.370> drops<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:33.880> that<00:02:33.970> just<00:02:34.210> be<00:02:34.390> amazing

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
their drops and that just be amazing

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:35.850 
their drops and that just be amazing
because<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.050> pretty<00:02:35.260> much<00:02:35.350> got<00:02:35.530> all<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.710> mob

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
because you pretty much got all the mob

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.560 
because you pretty much got all the mob
drops<00:02:36.100> you<00:02:36.250> need<00:02:36.430> so<00:02:37.060> that'd<00:02:37.180> be<00:02:37.300> pretty<00:02:37.450> cool

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
drops you need so that'd be pretty cool

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.750 
drops you need so that'd be pretty cool
if<00:02:37.870> someone<00:02:38.170> did<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.490> but<00:02:39.490> if<00:02:39.610> you<00:02:39.670> guys
