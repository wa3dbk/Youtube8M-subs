this particular case is that he was born
with<00:02:05.939> this<00:02:06.060> congenital<00:02:06.810> abnormality<00:02:07.469> which

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
with this congenital abnormality which

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.490 
with this congenital abnormality which
means<00:02:07.860> unlike<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:09.050> who<00:02:10.050> can<00:02:10.259> fully

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
straight now elbows he can only

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.260 
straight now elbows he can only

abnormality he was born like that so
it's<00:02:20.160> slightly<00:02:20.490> no<00:02:20.760> vent<00:02:21.060> it's<00:02:21.360> not<00:02:21.570> really<00:02:21.810> a

out and come home really it's an if you
benefit<00:03:31.770> well<00:03:31.920> it's<00:03:32.010> an<00:03:32.160> advantage<00:03:32.580> anyhow

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
benefit well it's an advantage anyhow

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.870 
benefit well it's an advantage anyhow
it's<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.600> massive<00:03:33.990> advantage<00:03:34.290> ordinarily<00:03:35.250> this

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
it's a massive advantage ordinarily this

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.120 
it's a massive advantage ordinarily this
would<00:03:35.940> be<00:03:36.120> a<00:03:36.390> potential<00:03:36.780> problem<00:03:36.930> but<00:03:37.320> as<00:03:37.800> far

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
would be a potential problem but as far

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.980 
would be a potential problem but as far
as<00:03:38.250> he's<00:03:38.460> concerned<00:03:38.550> he's<00:03:39.330> using<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:39.840> his

normalities or the tests that we saw

normalities or the tests that we saw
that<00:04:38.430> he<00:04:38.550> was<00:04:38.760> having<00:04:38.970> all<00:04:39.389> that<00:04:39.780> really<00:04:40.230> looks

that he was having all that really looks

that he was having all that really looks
as<00:04:40.590> though<00:04:40.620> it<00:04:40.860> hurts<00:04:41.100> I<00:04:41.340> know<00:04:41.639> it<00:04:41.790> doesn't<00:04:42.000> but

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
as though it hurts I know it doesn't but

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.909 
as though it hurts I know it doesn't but
these<00:04:42.750> sort<00:04:42.960> of<00:04:42.990> tests<00:04:43.260> what<00:04:43.410> would<00:04:43.560> they<00:04:43.650> Ella

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
these sort of tests what would they Ella

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.890 
these sort of tests what would they Ella
straight<00:04:44.280> do<00:04:44.430> you<00:04:44.520> think<00:04:44.790> what<00:04:45.389> the<00:04:45.540> tests<00:04:45.750> for

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
straight do you think what the tests for

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.870 
straight do you think what the tests for
specifically<00:04:46.620> illustrate<00:04:47.070> would<00:04:47.220> be<00:04:47.370> how<00:04:47.639> far

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
specifically illustrate would be how far

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.850 
specifically illustrate would be how far
the<00:04:48.060> wrist<00:04:48.210> itself<00:04:48.630> could<00:04:48.870> actually<00:04:48.900> be<00:04:49.380> going

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
the wrist itself could actually be going

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.390 
the wrist itself could actually be going
and<00:04:50.130> as<00:04:51.030> to<00:04:51.930> whether<00:04:52.110> what<00:04:52.530> he's<00:04:52.740> doing<00:04:53.100> is

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
and as to whether what he's doing is

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.580 
and as to whether what he's doing is
illegal<00:04:53.660> throw<00:04:54.660> and<00:04:54.930> I<00:04:55.080> think<00:04:55.440> that's

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
illegal throw and I think that's

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.830 
illegal throw and I think that's
specifically<00:04:56.220> focusing<00:04:56.820> on<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:57.330> angle<00:04:57.750> of

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
specifically focusing on the angle of

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.890 
specifically focusing on the angle of
the<00:04:58.139> elbow<00:04:58.560> specifically<00:04:59.430> just<00:05:00.360> to<00:05:00.480> ensure

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
the elbow specifically just to ensure

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.140 
the elbow specifically just to ensure
that<00:05:01.050> he's<00:05:01.290> not<00:05:01.590> chucking<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.640> ball<00:05:02.820> he's

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
that he's not chucking the ball he's

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.880 
that he's not chucking the ball he's
when<00:05:03.450> it's<00:05:03.570> illegal<00:05:03.840> Bowl<00:05:04.169> and<00:05:04.410> he's<00:05:04.560> clearly

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
when it's illegal Bowl and he's clearly

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.460 
when it's illegal Bowl and he's clearly
he's<00:05:05.280> been<00:05:05.460> cleared<00:05:05.700> both<00:05:06.480> in<00:05:06.720> Hong<00:05:06.990> Kong<00:05:07.020> and

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
he's been cleared both in Hong Kong and

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.520 
he's been cleared both in Hong Kong and
Australia<00:05:07.919> by<00:05:08.550> a<00:05:08.580> biomechanical<00:05:09.240> analyst<00:05:10.050> but

Australia by a biomechanical analyst but

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.930 
Australia by a biomechanical analyst but
when<00:05:10.680> you<00:05:10.770> look<00:05:10.919> at<00:05:11.040> it<00:05:11.160> it's<00:05:11.280> amazing<00:05:11.340> what

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
when you look at it it's amazing what

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.860 
when you look at it it's amazing what
he's<00:05:12.060> doing<00:05:12.330> this<00:05:12.570> really<00:05:13.470> obscure

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870
