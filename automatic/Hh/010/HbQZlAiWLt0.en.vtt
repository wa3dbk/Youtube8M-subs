00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.900
 ah 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.650
 How about youtube friends the speaker 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.750
 Dotcom today I bring you another 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.610
 video tutorial showing them all 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.500
 users who still do not know how 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.870
 install dot d files in our 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.610
 device good then let's start what 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.170
 what is with this video the first thing that 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.730
 we have to keep in mind is to have in 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.309
 our device made with jailbreak 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.809
 either in any version also 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.420
 we need to have what the file is 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.220
 point d on our desk and also 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.989
 Finally, we need to have a 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.030
 program to be able to transfer this 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.800
 file to our device 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.200
 I in my case use what is this 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.230
 iphone box application since it is very 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.270
 important and does not occupy much resources what 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.250
 that is a good computer we are going to 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.949
 execute it what is this program I what 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.930
 I have here open and once you 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.450
 you have it executed is going to 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.310
 leave what is this window here here 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.830
 we are going to address what is the file 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.890
 system and we are going to address what is 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.070
 the next route that is bar 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.020
 and mobiles in here we are going to copy what 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.659
 that is the point file that we 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.100
 that we are going to install I have it in the 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.590
 desk so I'm going to move a 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.270
 little window and here as I have it 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.350
 I'm sorry only what we're going to do 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.450
 is that 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.450
 and click and drag them to the 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.070
 window well once done that as 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.900
 you will appreciate here abajito came out what 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.950
 which is a bar and suddenly it 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.350
 He disappeared 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.900
 good here here was watch that we did not 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.850
 will show the process that is being 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.350
 making the transfer and the file 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.270
 very heavy is going to take a couple of 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.680
 minutes but like this team despite 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.530
 about 4 megabytes 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.420
 the transfer was super fast 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.000
 we will appreciate as you can see here 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.290
 I already have what is the file point and 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.140
 Now what we are going to do is close 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.200
 this program I am going to pass the video 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.209
 so that to be able to put my device 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.950
 on the computer and you can 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.320

 computer and we 're going to go to 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.209

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.600
 device as I said earlier this 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.820
 application we can find it in the 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.350
 report font yacht dotcom and what is the 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.780
 program that we have used to be able 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.790
 transfer this file point of view to 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.600
 our device we can find what 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.050
 what is the indec 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:47.210
 in the description of the video well here 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:49.250
 in what is live aid we are going to 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.470
 direct to the route in which we 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.440
 we put what is the file point of 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.900
 that is mobile bar and here it will appear 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.690
 what is the file that we just 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.360
 introduce and we will come out as a 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.720
 rap point file is not going to come out as 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.670

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.230
 click on it we will select it and not 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.110

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.760
 to give where it says installer here goes to 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.640
 start to settle what is the 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.790

 it can be any number and once 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.569
 have finished the position we can give 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.749
