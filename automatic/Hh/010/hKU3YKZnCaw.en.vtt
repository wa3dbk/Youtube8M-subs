here<00:02:55.200> as<00:02:55.379> the<00:02:55.620> Gundam<00:02:56.010> age<00:02:56.129> they<00:02:56.489> had<00:02:56.700> more

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:56.939 
here as the Gundam age they had more

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:58.429 
here as the Gundam age they had more
kits<00:02:57.269> so<00:02:57.480> when<00:02:57.629> people<00:02:57.780> were<00:02:57.959> choosing<00:02:58.139> their

top<00:02:58.620> five<00:02:58.829> it<00:02:59.040> makes<00:02:59.579> sense<00:02:59.760> that<00:02:59.939> there'd<00:03:00.090> be

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
top five it makes sense that there'd be

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.879 
top five it makes sense that there'd be
