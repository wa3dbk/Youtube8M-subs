00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:16.460
 fabulous thanks for joining me 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:20.359
 again and this time we're going to see 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.000
 a set from the collection of lego escobedo 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:25.760
 is the first in the numbering of 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.369
 this new collection and it's called the 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.800
 mystery of the museum's mummy is 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.780
 quite teeny and usually the 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.860
 little sets bring enough mini 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:40.550
 figures and is the special thing about those sets and 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:43.250
 let's start ferro and as always 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.309
 let's know the specifications of 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:51.140
 This set is recommended from 5 to 12 years old 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:53.750
 the number of haiti is 75 900 this is 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.680
 the first set in the numbering I discovered 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:01.700
 the title is the mystery of the mummy of 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.090
 museum includes 110 pieces there we have the 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.700
 cover page 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.070
 here we see the reverse is a being 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.500
 tiny but the truth is that it looks 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.500
 pretty father and let's see how he feels 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:37.550
 we have a date 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.640
 and let's start 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.850
 our first character is here and here 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.490
 we are seeing that in his hand he brings a 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.609
 brochure with information of the exhibition 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.170
 of the mummy of anca already saw that those 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:00.170
 diamonds have the sign of 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.360
 interrogation because they are lost and 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.969
 Now that we do the set we're going to 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.330
 see if we find them hidden in some 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:10.970
 side if you think that this is already 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.760
 exactly the same as what we saw in the 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.310
 mystery machine then it's not like that 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.370
 we are seeing the images of the 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.280
 different faces both figures bring 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.980
 different expressions even though the 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.019
 clothing is exactly the same and in 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.629
 images we saw also this 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.750
 figure of sagi has a second change 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:36.440
 of expression let's move on to the next one here 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.840
 we have to discover that the position and 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.209
 all the mold of the mini figure is equal 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.090
 which we saw in the mystery machine 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.940
 only his expression changes there we see that 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.370
 the eyes have a slight change is not 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.940
 very remarkable but in the end it 's 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.180
 different 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.820
 and above all that smile we see in the 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.670
 face discussed is what changes in 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:02.570
 this set let's go now to see the 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.060
 anca harmony feeling there we have to 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.820
 the mummy of anca that actually 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.370
 the doctor calls an agile he is a 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.230
 researcher who was during the 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.740
 time where they found the mummy of 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.750
 anca he is very ambitious and he takes that 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.600
 Mummy costume to cheat everyone 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.530
 because he's really looking for a 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.420
 coin that will take you to a diamond 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.340
 secret and let's see what is your 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.850
 true face 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.010
 that's the face of this malefactor we 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.580
 to remove the headdress a bit so that 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.760
 you can appreciate it a little more there and 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.370
 while touring I tell them that this 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.270
 character also came out in the cartoon 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.280
 and the chapter where that title came out 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:52.010
 eskubide and the mummy so now we are going 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.440
 to know being fully armed 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.830
 to see what you think 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.410
 Well, as you are seeing, we already have 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:03.710
 fully armed we see all this 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.600
 structure there is a hidden character is not 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.240
 he will mention them to see who is given 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.340
 he is a very famous person 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.890
 of the ego but here we are seeing all the 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.560
 construction this is like the inside 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.200
 denounced where is the exhibition of the 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.959
 mummy is why the part here 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.020
 up we found these lights here is 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.930
 the sarcophagus here some hieroglyphics and 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.530
 some ornaments these horns that are 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.170
 here we can upload and download them and 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:37.670
 there is also a secret compartment 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:41.810
 down here where we can hide the 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:46.130
 mummy jewelry these jewelry we can 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:48.950
 place them there also to decorate the 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.840
 sarcophagus of memory and well I think that 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.230
 more you see is wrong while you are 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:58.130
 appreciating the exposure of the mummy of 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:00.950
 anca scooby you detect a delicious smell 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:04.040
 around here he goes in search of 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.740
 xavi leaves running behind scooby and already 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.890
 they saw what the smell of 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.860
 scooby well it's this hamburger that's 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:16.430
 hanging on the top then 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:19.730
 between xavi and scooby they make equipment for 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:23.600
 reach for the hamburger and look at what 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:26.270
 happened and here comes running here to 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.840
 discover what they have done and now they know 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:33.680
 who are in trouble so let's move on to 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:36.950
 conclusion of the video because it disappeared 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:40.460
 the manic ego the fantastic one of the 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.980
 mystery of the mummy of the museum is a being 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:46.130
 that in spite of being tiny I also 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.260
 liked it's not going to take 510 stars 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.360
 but the truth is that for the size it 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.060
 They deserve the 5 stars but can not 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.180
 be this way this time we are going to give 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.880
 four stars email and regarding the 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:03.270
 mini favorite figure without a doubt goes
