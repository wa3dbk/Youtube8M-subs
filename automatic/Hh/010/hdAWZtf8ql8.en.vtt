thing<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.450> destroy<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.930> pretty

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
thing is that this destroy is pretty

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.469 
thing is that this destroy is pretty
much<00:01:16.680> any<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.400> these<00:01:17.520> their<00:01:18.030> face<00:01:18.210> up<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
much any of these their face up on the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.800 
much any of these their face up on the
field<00:01:18.540> but<00:01:18.869> do<00:01:19.049> watch<00:01:19.290> out<00:01:19.530> for<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.159> card

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
field but do watch out for this card

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.990 
field but do watch out for this card
because<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.080> pretty<00:01:22.200> much<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.409> night<00:01:22.650> beam

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
because this is pretty much a night beam

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.100 
because this is pretty much a night beam
you<00:01:24.000> can't<00:01:24.210> really<00:01:24.330> change<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.780> unless<00:01:24.960> you

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
you can't really change it unless you

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.420 
you can't really change it unless you
chain<00:01:25.380> like<00:01:25.530> another<00:01:25.770> card<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.159> then<00:01:26.250> Jane

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
chain like another card and then Jane

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.320 
chain like another card and then Jane
that<00:01:26.640> but<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.880> mean<00:01:27.060> that's<00:01:27.150> really

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
that but I mean that's really

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.600 
that but I mean that's really
complicated<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.229> most<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.040> time<00:01:29.220> that's<00:01:29.460> not

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
complicated and most the time that's not

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.520 
complicated and most the time that's not
going<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.850> happen<00:01:29.939> but<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.869> mean<00:01:31.079> still<00:01:31.320> really

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
going to happen but I mean still really

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.050 
going to happen but I mean still really

these on the field and if they don't

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.220 
these on the field and if they don't
then<00:02:48.330> you're<00:02:48.450> pretty<00:02:48.600> much<00:02:48.720> already<00:02:49.020> in<00:02:49.200> a

winning position anyway but I mean

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.990 
winning position anyway but I mean
overworked<00:02:52.470> it's<00:02:52.830> a<00:02:52.920> trap<00:02:53.160> dark<00:02:53.370> hole<00:02:53.490> trap

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
overworked it's a trap dark hole trap

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.280

guess<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.940> macro<00:03:08.940> obviously<00:03:09.630> you<00:03:09.810> know<00:03:09.960> um

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
guess and macro obviously you know um

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.030 
guess and macro obviously you know um
they<00:03:11.760> can't<00:03:12.000> send<00:03:12.300> from<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.840> these<00:03:13.590> guys<00:03:13.800> have

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040

they can't send from the these guys have
to<00:03:14.130> hit<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.430> graveyard<00:03:14.850> in<00:03:14.940> order<00:03:15.000> to

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
to hit the graveyard in order to

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.280 
to hit the graveyard in order to

like um spirit and woof bark would be

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.270 
like um spirit and woof bark would be
dead<00:03:21.120> too<00:03:21.440> because<00:03:22.440> they<00:03:22.650> need<00:03:22.830> targets<00:03:23.190> in

victory and another thing I noticed with

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.130 
victory and another thing I noticed with
the<00:04:33.550> new<00:04:33.670> format<00:04:33.970> is<00:04:34.090> that<00:04:34.270> how<00:04:34.450> good<00:04:34.810> mirror

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.500 
the new format is that how good mirror
forces<00:04:35.590> like<00:04:35.770> mirror<00:04:36.070> force<00:04:36.250> is<00:04:36.460> so<00:04:37.030> good<00:04:37.390> in

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
forces like mirror force is so good in

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.810 
forces like mirror force is so good in
this<00:04:37.600> new<00:04:37.990> format<00:04:38.440> I<00:04:38.680> don't<00:04:39.460> know<00:04:39.520> what<00:04:39.670> it<00:04:39.790> is

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
this new format I don't know what it is

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.430 
this new format I don't know what it is
but<00:04:40.060> it<00:04:40.180> being<00:04:40.360> just<00:04:40.750> mirror<00:04:40.960> force<00:04:41.140> is<00:04:41.230> one<00:04:41.380> of

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
but it being just mirror force is one of
