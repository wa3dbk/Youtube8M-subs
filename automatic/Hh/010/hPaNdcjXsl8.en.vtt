00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:08.309
 some avenue anatole-france 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.889
 we are under the wood on Wednesday, May 29, 2013 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:16.260
 and there in the street so if we see 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:18.900
 a city hall car what the beautiful 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.080
 logo aulnay under wood that visibly has 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.880
 had a little worry of nine since there 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.880
 there is no longer the front tire 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:35.700
 we see a cry to lift the car no 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.219
 not two tires the front and rear 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.030
 it's not better 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:43.950
 no steps behind the tires visibly 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.289
 the car was vandalized unless 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:51.329
 do not change them to my account changes 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:53.280
 the wheels in the street what seems 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.170
 unlikely because we do that we 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.140
 rarely leaves the jack in place so a 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.710
 little example like that not everything is going 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.470
 well one one respects one respects 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.970
 nothing even the same vehicles 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.010
 of the town hall is found without wheel 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.619
 so maybe it's a new 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.950
 practice to encourage circulation 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:24.530
 by bike but obviously it's a 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.530
 hypothesis to check so that's it 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.600
 this vehicle then the big irony 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.600
 obviously the fate is that 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.600
 or 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:43.950
 we see this vehicle is barely 50 m 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:48.690
 actually comes the local from the end the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.290
 local police 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.220
 the municipal police of nice sous bois 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.250
 in progress 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.000
 for konÃ© the 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.300
 the tree that must be a cedar so 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.600
 just not even 50 meters walk down one 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:11.800
 at the municipal police next door 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:17.290
 like as an ironic wink in 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.880
 this story we have how to say a 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.520
 car from the town hall that comes from 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:26.670
 nicely done in probably removed 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.670
 two wheels
