00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.580
 hello and welcome first pink 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.710
 Panther and I have my whole 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.240
 interesting thing and that is what I have 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.580
 invited two kita 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.259
 which ask a little bit now and 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.570
 answer and you see now 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.190
 also so gameplay of one of the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.840
 both 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.680
 the names will not be so now 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.070
 announced 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.900
 I think even imagine why and 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.429
 so I welcome now times I call 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.149
 I'll tell me why, peter 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.370
 why do you stand for 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.809
 So there are a few games in which we 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.920
 Send I is not in every game 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:46.020
 eg not in Battlefield 3 and I am 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.520
 kick in mw2 and mw3 because it's running 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.430
 just so many because that's anti 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.440
 cheat system will be bad and that 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.620
 In my opinion, the game is not anymore 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.879
 possible without playing it so there is 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.829
 always be a cheater in every lobby 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.789
 it can still play as much if 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.030
 they are banished 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.769
 There are also other tools for 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.140
 and yes, it also makes it easy 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.580
 fun divorced and that 's why I can do that 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.140
 others do not actually take over 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.400
 if you chose it and me with you 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.400
 kill her hit 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.790
 but that's just it 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.250
 it is pieced somewhere like that 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.990
 conclusion or sona so if if 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.549
 then everyone somehow thinks so 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.710
 logically that then say goodbye 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.450
 is that so it is in mw3 and in 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.549
 mw2 have in my opinion the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.549
 Developers do not think much about it 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.030
 increase and they have a lot 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.130
 can fix and I try too 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.720
 partly play without playing but 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.310
 sometime just does not make fun 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.140
 I just do my own 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.540
 always pure and I do it myself 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.649
 different so it makes it are the 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.829
 Programming chips really does 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.600
 fun and therefore you test them out then 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.299
 and improve your growth again 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.049
 That's why you use them already 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.110
 automatically happens 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.700
 okay what kind of possibilities are there 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.079
 because everything 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.780
 you can do everything there, so to speak 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:11.489
 I decided my godmode gives that 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.019
 Go away and what else can you do 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.260
 to edit the whole server 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:18.569
 So you can with me2 and mw3 poison the 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.300
 hostsystem that means if you do that well 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.040
 Internet as and open door then fits 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.720
 is the possibility that you just 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.569
 you will and show the services 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.510
 conducts on the pc and with certain 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.030
 You can just force that to do that 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.810
 it is so that you always always horst 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.190
 directs the server and then you can yes 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.599
 the whole server may eventually 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.579
 you can change the speed 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:46.650
 you can change the jump height 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:50.549
 Change time to change the points 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.590
 god mode just unlimited m and there's 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.090
 1000 of possibilities and it would still be 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.269
 always new possibilities found for 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.829
 you can play every game and you can 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.319
 then just edit it the way you do it 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.090
 you want and then you have his own 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.640
 fun or not so I have once 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.440
 seen in mw2 there is one through the 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.209
 wall had gone the claim behind 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.500
 set and of course then 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.160
 disappeared through the wall again 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.200
 The guy is down and can because is 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.280
 yes explodes more or less and then 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.530
 If you have a degree you can 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.609
 seen that christa one from the 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.560
 Wand came out 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:25.530
 the clanmo has set behind them and 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.620
 that was so bad I saw screaming 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.269
 clear with laughter on one side 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.609
 funny on the other side again 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.139
 not only because many have, of course 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.680
 a lot of money spent on the 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.739
 games 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.389
 and if he does, then every time 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.269
 have a kita in there and you can 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:44.670
 not play and that was with mw3 times 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.470
 you're really sick for a while 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.609
 you really do not care which lobby you are in 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.290
 he was somehow kita 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.769
 and of course that was somewhere 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.420
 so know that was now in this 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.069
 then probably new clip that 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.690
 It's easy to write like that 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.359
 a program with which one just clip 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.549
 You can do it for everyone 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.680
 make individual players individually 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.239
 can each one different 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.410
 individually edit for example his 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.360
 speed or even in this case 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.250
 so klipp so that you go through walls 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.920
 can and can fly 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.690
 yes and that is just because that 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.850
 anti cheat not really worked out 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.250
 is and also on the host system 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.080
 that the servers are on top of one another 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.020
 Computer hosted by the players 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.700
 become and one also determined 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.010
 program can handle everything 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.190
 because here we show that is now one 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.300
 good example no clip is worth and the 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.020
 is just in the memory 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.510
 written 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.030
 you can then if you certain 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.800
 Program has the value edit like that 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.070
 that you can just go through walls 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.410
 or can fly or it is the many 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.030
 possibilities but how is that only 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.270
 to open some such genia 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.990
 Hacked server in the sense and become 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.260
 then banned 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.420
 So they will become so then 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.010
 the spellbound and the game is gone 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.870
 So I mean they have money then 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.770
 and only because they are then on the 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.410
 servers have come 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.900
 that is so that is not so when will 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.190
 in mp3 e2 not banned if I am now 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.230
 for example in the lobby on fake 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.010
 and me people in it and me what I do 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:21.500
 the godmode give that a bit 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.030
 faster give a bit more speed 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.830
 or even that they can fly 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.020
 that does not warn them because 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.240
 The Horst changes the dates on his 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.340
 computer and that decided notes that 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.140
 just so to speak on the computer where it is 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.850
 was changed and other players 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.919
 are not warned by it so if 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.900
 that someone says then he lies because he is in 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.210
 In that case he has to be divorced 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.250
 myself am sure you have okay 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.919
 Gameplay is over, thank you 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.480
 First of all, if that continues 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.010
 interested if you have more of the 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.930
 Both wanted to hear next would be 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.270
 even then then in that his 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.950
 two offenders like me interview 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.480
 then you write the comments or 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.320
 lay the video so I just see that 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.530
 interested you 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.490
 thank you first and thank you very much 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.490
 for the audience in it
