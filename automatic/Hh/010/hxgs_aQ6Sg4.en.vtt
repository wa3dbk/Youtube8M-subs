message was photoshopped which you know
could<00:01:36.000> be<00:01:36.180> possible<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.780> could<00:01:37.140> be<00:01:37.229> entirely

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
could be possible it could be entirely

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.499 
could be possible it could be entirely
possibly<00:01:37.829> signed<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.310> with<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.460> guest<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.880> then

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
possibly signed in with a guest and then

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.969 
possibly signed in with a guest and then
set<00:01:39.930> them<00:01:40.020> up<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.320> bot<00:01:40.439> match<00:01:40.619> just<00:01:40.860> because

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
set them up in a bot match just because

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.410 
set them up in a bot match just because
he<00:01:41.189> wanted<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.549> clip<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.030> great<00:01:42.210> chaos

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
he wanted to clip on the great chaos

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.780 
he wanted to clip on the great chaos
Iceman<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:42.930> chaos<00:01:43.229> enemy<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:44.220> let's<00:01:44.460> look<00:01:44.640> at

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
Iceman and chaos enemy but let's look at

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.270 
Iceman and chaos enemy but let's look at
this<00:01:44.880> logically<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:46.320> what<00:01:46.710> he's<00:01:46.829> basically

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
this logically so what he's basically

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.399 
this logically so what he's basically
saying<00:01:47.579> here<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.090> yeah<00:01:48.750> signed<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.350> on

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
saying here is that yeah signed it on

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.319 
saying here is that yeah signed it on
guest<00:01:49.619> account<00:01:49.950> set<00:01:50.220> up<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.460> clip<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.850> then

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
guest account set up the clip and then

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.480 
guest account set up the clip and then
using<00:01:52.200> one<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> Fate<00:01:52.680> guest<00:01:52.890> account<00:01:53.189> sent

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
using one the Fate guest account sent

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.660 
using one the Fate guest account sent
himself<00:01:53.640> messages<00:01:54.329> or<00:01:54.450> photoshopped<00:01:55.439> them<00:01:55.670> so

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
himself messages or photoshopped them so

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.039 
himself messages or photoshopped them so
we<00:01:56.880> have<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.180> piece<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.540> evidence<00:01:57.719> which<00:01:57.930> was

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
we have this piece of evidence which was

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.420 
we have this piece of evidence which was
the<00:01:58.170> first<00:01:58.350> piece<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.740> unknown<00:01:59.009> for<00:01:59.159> reasons

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
the first piece that unknown for reasons

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.310 
the first piece that unknown for reasons
are<00:01:59.520> plotted<00:01:59.820> saying<00:02:00.420> shoot<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.110> video

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
are plotted saying shoot in the video

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.050 
are plotted saying shoot in the video
with<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.680> camera<00:02:01.740> showing<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.820> they<00:02:02.939> are

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
with this camera showing that they are

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.280 
with this camera showing that they are
real<00:02:03.240> messages<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.719> blatantly<00:02:04.079> not

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
real messages to blatantly not

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.109

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.520 
photoshopped at Photoshop messages you
can<00:02:06.149> see<00:02:06.450> them<00:02:06.600> here<00:02:06.630> I've<00:02:06.899> put<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.140> particle<00:02:07.500> of

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
can see them here I've put a particle of

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.250 
can see them here I've put a particle of

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
proves it's not a bot match if it wasn't

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.430 
proves it's not a bot match if it wasn't
much<00:04:57.220> that<00:04:57.550> was<00:04:58.030> just<00:04:58.270> the<00:04:58.660> m3<00:04:58.990> there<00:04:59.260> wouldn't

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
much that was just the m3 there wouldn't

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.500 
much that was just the m3 there wouldn't
be<00:04:59.560> ribbons<00:04:59.860> so<00:05:00.370> if<00:05:00.520> it<00:05:00.610> really<00:05:00.820> was<00:05:01.030> a<00:05:01.090> private
