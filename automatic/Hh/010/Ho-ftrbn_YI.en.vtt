the capability of numbering every person
on<00:00:30.789> this<00:00:30.970> planet<00:00:31.259> it's<00:00:32.259> not<00:00:32.559> a<00:00:32.590> big<00:00:32.860> deal

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
on this planet it's not a big deal

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.979 
on this planet it's not a big deal
anymore<00:00:33.489> what<00:00:34.239> we<00:00:34.390> see<00:00:34.690> is<00:00:35.020> centralized<00:00:35.829> power

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
anymore what we see is centralized power

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.970 
anymore what we see is centralized power
which<00:00:37.989> is<00:00:38.320> not<00:00:39.160> a<00:00:39.190> good<00:00:39.280> thing<00:00:39.960> okay<00:00:40.980> because

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
which is not a good thing okay because

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.670 
which is not a good thing okay because
once<00:00:42.250> all<00:00:42.489> the<00:00:42.640> power<00:00:42.910> is<00:00:43.330> concentrated<00:00:43.960> in

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
once all the power is concentrated in

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.140 
once all the power is concentrated in
one<00:00:44.739> place<00:00:45.269> one<00:00:46.269> strong<00:00:47.280> deceiver<00:00:48.280> liar<00:00:48.699> can

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
one place one strong deceiver liar can

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.619 
one place one strong deceiver liar can
come<00:00:49.390> in<00:00:49.629> and<00:00:49.900> take<00:00:50.050> over<00:00:50.110> the<00:00:50.470> whole<00:00:50.589> business

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
say it appears to me that when crisis

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.240 
say it appears to me that when crisis
number<00:00:59.530> one<00:00:59.769> occurs<00:01:01.710> we'll<00:01:02.710> see<00:01:02.949> the<00:01:03.070> New

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
number one occurs we'll see the New

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.369 
number one occurs we'll see the New
World<00:01:03.280> Order<00:01:03.850> and<00:01:04.030> there's<00:01:04.479> very<00:01:04.780> likely<00:01:05.049> a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
World Order and there's very likely a

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.649 
World Order and there's very likely a
change<00:01:05.890> that<00:01:06.340> takes<00:01:06.580> place<00:01:06.700> whether<00:01:07.330> it'll<00:01:07.540> be

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
change that takes place whether it'll be

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.440 
change that takes place whether it'll be
a<00:01:07.690> change<00:01:08.080> in<00:01:08.350> name<00:01:08.650> at<00:01:09.070> that<00:01:09.369> point<00:01:09.670> to

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
a change in name at that point to

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.810 
a change in name at that point to
something<00:01:11.080> other<00:01:11.409> than<00:01:11.650> the<00:01:11.830> UN<00:01:12.220> I<00:01:12.430> don't<00:01:12.700> know

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
something other than the UN I don't know

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.130 
something other than the UN I don't know
I<00:01:13.530> don't<00:01:14.530> expect<00:01:15.189> a<00:01:15.640> global<00:01:16.210> numbering<00:01:16.720> system

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
I don't expect a global numbering system

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.010 
I don't expect a global numbering system
