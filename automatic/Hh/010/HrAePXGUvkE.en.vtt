technology called theater 3d and theater
3d<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> new<00:00:18.180> technology<00:00:18.359> which<00:00:18.960> brings

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
3d is a new technology which brings

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.509 
3d is a new technology which brings
mass-market<00:00:20.840> consumer-focused<00:00:21.840> 3d<00:00:22.740> into

mass-market consumer-focused 3d into
your<00:00:23.609> living<00:00:23.820> room<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.330> we're<00:00:25.170> doing<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.560> on

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
your living room and we're doing that on

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.730 
your living room and we're doing that on
up<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:27.029> 15<00:00:27.449> different<00:00:27.689> Vizio<00:00:28.439> TVs<00:00:28.820> for<00:00:29.820> 2011

up to 15 different Vizio TVs for 2011

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.370 
up to 15 different Vizio TVs for 2011
and<00:00:31.740> one<00:00:32.040> TV<00:00:32.309> here<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.610> our<00:00:32.820> 65<00:00:33.360> inch<00:00:33.690> that

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
and one TV here is our 65 inch that

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.350 
and one TV here is our 65 inch that
we're<00:00:34.559> showing<00:00:34.739> theater<00:00:35.190> 3d<00:00:35.460> are<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.270> is

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
we're showing theater 3d are and this is

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.270 
we're showing theater 3d are and this is
the<00:00:36.420> one<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.600> have<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:36.930> my<00:00:37.050> studio<00:00:37.320> yes<00:00:37.770> yeah<00:00:38.070> and

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
the one I have in my studio yes yeah and

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.580 
the one I have in my studio yes yeah and
so<00:00:38.790> some<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.149> benefits<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.690> theater<00:00:40.050> 3d<00:00:40.290> is

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
so some of the benefits of theater 3d is

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.580 
so some of the benefits of theater 3d is
one<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.670> 3d<00:00:42.510> technologies<00:00:43.020> actually<00:00:43.379> built

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
one the 3d technologies actually built

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.610 
one the 3d technologies actually built
into<00:00:43.829> your<00:00:43.950> TV<00:00:44.280> set<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.719> main<00:00:45.899> benefits<00:00:46.440> of

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
into your TV set so the main benefits of

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.310 
into your TV set so the main benefits of
that<00:00:46.980> are<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.879> get<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> brighter<00:00:48.329> picture<00:00:48.600> you

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
that are you get a brighter picture you

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.709 
that are you get a brighter picture you
get<00:00:49.410> better<00:00:49.649> picture<00:00:50.129> quality<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.600> get

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
get better picture quality and you get

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.049 
get better picture quality and you get
an<00:00:51.809> overall<00:00:52.110> better<00:00:52.379> experience<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.430> big

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
an overall better experience and big

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.540 
an overall better experience and big
part<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.570> better<00:00:54.960> experience<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:56.100> 3d

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
part of the better experience is a 3d

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.459 
part of the better experience is a 3d
glasses<00:00:56.760> everyone<00:00:57.480> talks<00:00:57.629> about<00:00:57.809> 3d<00:00:58.199> glasses

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
glasses everyone talks about 3d glasses

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.860 
glasses everyone talks about 3d glasses
well<00:00:59.430> ultimately<00:00:59.850> people<00:01:00.270> don't<00:01:00.570> want<00:01:00.750> to

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
well ultimately people don't want to

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.920 
well ultimately people don't want to
wear<00:01:01.020> glasses<00:01:02.000> but<00:01:03.000> if<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.180> do<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.510> want<00:01:03.750> them

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
wear glasses but if you do you want them

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.450 
wear glasses but if you do you want them
to<00:01:03.989> be<00:01:04.140> lightweight<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.830> want<00:01:05.040> them<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.280> be

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
to be lightweight you want them to be

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.149 
to be lightweight you want them to be
relatively<00:01:05.970> inexpensive<00:01:06.810> e1<00:01:07.110> look<00:01:07.439> well<00:01:07.680> yeah

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
relatively inexpensive e1 look well yeah

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.039 
relatively inexpensive e1 look well yeah
so<00:01:08.400> one<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> things<00:01:08.760> we've<00:01:09.119> done<00:01:09.390> is

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
so one of the things we've done is

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.190 
so one of the things we've done is
instead<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.830> using<00:01:11.689> another<00:01:12.689> competing

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
instead of using another competing

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.920 
instead of using another competing
technology<00:01:13.890> called<00:01:14.070> active<00:01:14.640> 3d<00:01:14.850> which<00:01:15.659> gives

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
technology called active 3d which gives

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.740 
technology called active 3d which gives
you<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.650> fairly<00:01:17.220> large<00:01:17.400> glasses<00:01:17.790> they're<00:01:18.479> very

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
you a fairly large glasses they're very

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.240 
you a fairly large glasses they're very
flat<00:01:19.880> arguably<00:01:20.880> they're<00:01:21.119> not<00:01:21.390> as<00:01:22.250> appealing

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
flat arguably they're not as appealing

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.510 
flat arguably they're not as appealing
from<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.670> design<00:01:24.000> perspective<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:25.400> and<00:01:26.400> they

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
from a design perspective and and they

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.700 
from a design perspective and and they
actually<00:01:26.700> have<00:01:26.970> batteries<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
actually have batteries and so the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.230 
actually have batteries and so the
problem<00:01:28.979> with<00:01:29.070> batteries<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.759> they'll<00:01:30.030> run

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
problem with batteries is they'll run

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.819 
problem with batteries is they'll run
out<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.689> watch<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.049> movie<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.500> they<00:01:31.619> could

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
out so you watch a movie and they could

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.350 
out so you watch a movie and they could
run<00:01:32.009> out<00:01:32.159> during<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> movie<00:01:32.850> when<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.270> have

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
run out during the movie when you have

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.789 
run out during the movie when you have
to<00:01:33.450> recharge<00:01:33.810> them<00:01:34.020> during<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.290> movie<00:01:34.500> no<00:01:34.680> one

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
to recharge them during the movie no one

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.380 
to recharge them during the movie no one
wants<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.130> when<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.490> say<00:01:35.670> active<00:01:36.090> these

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
wants that when you say active these

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.210 
wants that when you say active these
actually<00:01:36.990> have<00:01:37.110> shutters<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.770> them<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.070> they

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
actually have shutters on them that they

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.270 
actually have shutters on them that they
do<00:01:38.280> they<00:01:39.119> do<00:01:39.180> they<00:01:39.540> flicker<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.560> off<00:01:40.799> so

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
do they do they flicker on and off so

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.520 
do they do they flicker on and off so
continuously<00:01:41.880> flickering<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.170> then<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.409> get

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
continuously flickering and then you get

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.660 
continuously flickering and then you get
the<00:01:43.649> 3d<00:01:43.950> image<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.460> way<00:01:45.979> this<00:01:46.979> technology

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
the 3d image that way this technology

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.969 
the 3d image that way this technology
allows<00:01:47.700> for<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> more<00:01:48.780> inexpensive<00:01:49.619> TV

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
allows for a more inexpensive TV

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.429 
allows for a more inexpensive TV
potentially<00:01:50.820> but<00:01:51.420> then<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.689> cost<00:01:51.930> goes<00:01:52.110> back

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
potentially but then the cost goes back

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.830 
potentially but then the cost goes back
into<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.829> 3d<00:01:53.250> glasses<00:01:53.579> themselves<00:01:53.909> when<00:01:54.750> you

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
into the 3d glasses themselves when you

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.600 
into the 3d glasses themselves when you
put<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.079> cost<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.530> 3d<00:01:55.829> glasses<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.340> also

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
put the cost in 3d glasses you also

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.950 
put the cost in 3d glasses you also
become<00:01:56.729> bigger<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.299> larger<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:58.880> somewhat

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
become bigger and larger and somewhat

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.510 
become bigger and larger and somewhat
something<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.110> consumers<00:02:01.380> aren't<00:02:01.860> appealed

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
something that consumers aren't appealed

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.600 
something that consumers aren't appealed
to<00:02:02.640> by<00:02:03.140> so<00:02:04.140> what<00:02:04.380> Vizio<00:02:04.680> did<00:02:04.829> instead<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.280> we

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
to by so what Vizio did instead is we

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.749 
to by so what Vizio did instead is we
put<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.360> 3d<00:02:06.600> technology<00:02:07.140> in<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.290> TV<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:08.009> that

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
put the 3d technology in the TV and that

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.800 
put the 3d technology in the TV and that
allows<00:02:09.060> us<00:02:09.090> to

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
allows us to

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.500 
allows us to
offer<00:02:10.250> very<00:02:11.250> cool<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.640> expensive

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
offer very cool and expensive

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.449 
offer very cool and expensive
lightweight<00:02:12.930> glasses<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:14.099> these<00:02:14.250> rail

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
lightweight glasses and these rail

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.100 
lightweight glasses and these rail
impassive<00:02:14.849> less<00:02:15.209> these<00:02:15.480> are<00:02:15.630> called<00:02:15.840> passive

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
impassive less these are called passive

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.240 
impassive less these are called passive
or<00:02:16.739> what<00:02:17.400> we<00:02:17.550> call<00:02:17.580> again<00:02:18.180> theater<00:02:18.599> 3d<00:02:18.840> glasses

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
or what we call again theater 3d glasses

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.130 
or what we call again theater 3d glasses
so<00:02:20.250> we<00:02:20.489> call<00:02:20.670> theater<00:02:21.060> 3d<00:02:21.270> because<00:02:21.599> these<00:02:21.989> are

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
so we call theater 3d because these are

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.610 
so we call theater 3d because these are
the<00:02:22.170> same<00:02:22.730> technology<00:02:23.730> that's<00:02:23.940> used<00:02:24.030> in

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
the same technology that's used in

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.210 
the same technology that's used in
theaters<00:02:25.670> around<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:27.030> world<00:02:27.830> reald<00:02:28.830> has<00:02:29.010> set

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
theaters around the world reald has set

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.979 
theaters around the world reald has set
the<00:02:29.250> standard<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:30.209> around<00:02:30.569> eighty<00:02:30.780> five

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
the standard and around eighty five

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.000 
the standard and around eighty five
percent<00:02:31.050> of<00:02:31.500> all<00:02:31.730> theaters<00:02:32.730> United<00:02:33.330> States

percent of all theaters United States

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.410 
percent of all theaters United States
standardizing<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.130> technology<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.000> this

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
standardizing this technology so this

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.870 
standardizing this technology so this
pair<00:02:37.319> of<00:02:37.410> glasses<00:02:37.560> here<00:02:38.130> can<00:02:38.370> be<00:02:38.400> used<00:02:38.640> in<00:02:38.760> the

theater<00:02:41.550> 3d<00:02:41.760> TV<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.540> how<00:02:42.750> did<00:02:42.900> these<00:02:43.019> work<00:02:43.290> how

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
theater 3d TV and how did these work how

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.500 
theater 3d TV and how did these work how
is<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.340> light<00:02:44.549> actually<00:02:44.970> going<00:02:45.150> through<00:02:45.269> the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
is the light actually going through the

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.650 
is the light actually going through the
lenses<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:46.230> go<00:02:47.069> back<00:02:47.370> out<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.760> 3d<00:02:48.090> image<00:02:48.390> so

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
lenses to go back out the 3d image so

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.479 
lenses to go back out the 3d image so
this<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:49.019> a<00:02:49.049> polarized<00:02:49.650> lens<00:02:50.069> is<00:02:50.310> called

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
this is a polarized lens is called

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.410 
this is a polarized lens is called
circular<00:02:50.910> polarization<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:51.989> so<00:02:53.030> when<00:02:54.030> the

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
circular polarization and so when the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.330 
circular polarization and so when the
image<00:02:54.900> is<00:02:55.200> shown<00:02:55.260> through<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.830> screen<00:02:56.130> is

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
image is shown through the screen is

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.940 
image is shown through the screen is
then<00:02:56.549> repurposed<00:02:57.239> through<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.630> glasses<00:02:57.950> so

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
then repurposed through the glasses so

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.620 
then repurposed through the glasses so
there's<00:02:59.130> no<00:02:59.250> batteries<00:02:59.700> required<00:02:59.730> there's<00:03:00.540> no

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
there's no batteries required there's no

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.839 
there's no batteries required there's no
electronics<00:03:01.319> putting<00:03:02.099> the<00:03:02.190> glasses<00:03:02.640> because

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
electronics putting the glasses because

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.360 
electronics putting the glasses because
this<00:03:03.090> is<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.750> circulation<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.799> that<00:03:05.010> based

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
this is a circulation is that based

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.470 
this is a circulation is that based
technology<00:03:06.150> it's<00:03:06.780> not<00:03:06.959> electronic<00:03:07.680> or

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
technology it's not electronic or

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.140 
technology it's not electronic or
frequency<00:03:09.480> based<00:03:09.630> technology<00:03:10.319> now<00:03:11.250> if<00:03:11.430> I

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
frequency based technology now if I

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.789 
frequency based technology now if I
we're<00:03:12.599> going<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.900> hope<00:03:13.049> you<00:03:13.260> later<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.709> we're

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
we're going to hope you later and we're

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.229 
we're going to hope you later and we're
going<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.010> send<00:03:14.250> some<00:03:14.430> of<00:03:14.489> their<00:03:14.609> really<00:03:14.880> nice

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
going to send some of their really nice

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.660 
going to send some of their really nice
and<00:03:15.540> somewhat<00:03:16.440> expensive<00:03:16.799> glasses<00:03:17.280> yeah

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
and somewhat expensive glasses yeah

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.039 
and somewhat expensive glasses yeah
these<00:03:17.850> are<00:03:17.910> about<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.209> hundred<00:03:18.359> fifty<00:03:18.720> bucks<00:03:18.900> a

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
these are about a hundred fifty bucks a

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.979 
these are about a hundred fifty bucks a
pair<00:03:19.230> if<00:03:20.070> their<00:03:20.760> circle<00:03:21.180> of<00:03:21.269> circular

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
pair if their circle of circular

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.930 
pair if their circle of circular
polarized<00:03:22.530> they'll<00:03:22.859> work<00:03:23.010> on<00:03:23.160> any<00:03:23.340> TV<00:03:23.609> set

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
polarized they'll work on any TV set

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.120 
polarized they'll work on any TV set
then<00:03:24.120> also<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.570> circular<00:03:24.989> better<00:03:25.200> act<00:03:25.530> so

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
then also the circular better act so

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.680 
then also the circular better act so
there's<00:03:26.310> an<00:03:26.459> industry<00:03:26.880> standard<00:03:26.940> is<00:03:27.420> an<00:03:27.540> issue

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
there's an industry standard is an issue

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.259 
there's an industry standard is an issue
standard<00:03:28.260> for<00:03:28.500> those<00:03:28.739> so<00:03:29.519> it's<00:03:29.670> not<00:03:29.790> busy<00:03:30.209> of

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
standard for those so it's not busy of

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.940 
standard for those so it's not busy of
glasses<00:03:30.690> won't<00:03:31.079> wear<00:03:31.380> that's<00:03:31.560> right<00:03:31.769> and

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
glasses won't wear that's right and

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.220 
glasses won't wear that's right and
other<00:03:32.069> tvs<00:03:32.459> that's<00:03:32.819> right<00:03:33.030> awesome<00:03:33.660> there's

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
other tvs that's right awesome there's

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.390 
other tvs that's right awesome there's
