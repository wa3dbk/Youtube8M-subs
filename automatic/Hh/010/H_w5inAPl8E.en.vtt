00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:29.320 

you<00:03:21.300> can<00:03:21.540> just<00:03:21.750> put<00:03:23.209> silicon<00:03:24.209> case<00:03:24.540> on<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:24.959> I

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:39.009 

think<00:03:30.330> it's<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.780> good<00:03:31.019> deal<00:03:31.769> for<00:03:32.099> just<00:03:34.159> 30<00:03:35.159> 99<00:03:37.849> as

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
think it's a good deal for just 30 99 as

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.660 
think it's a good deal for just 30 99 as
you<00:03:40.019> may<00:03:40.140> know<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:40.560> bought<00:03:41.010> this<00:03:41.250> from

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670

you may know I bought this from
dealextreme<00:03:43.280> so<00:03:44.629> it's<00:03:45.629> a<00:03:45.780> quiet<00:03:46.079> good<00:03:46.500> deal<00:03:47.360> as

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
dealextreme so it's a quiet good deal as

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:57.789 
dealextreme so it's a quiet good deal as
they<00:03:49.590> say<00:03:52.010> just<00:03:53.010> put<00:03:54.319> depends<00:03:55.319> quite<00:03:56.160> hard<00:03:56.579> to

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
they say just put depends quite hard to

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:15.699 
they say just put depends quite hard to
hold<00:03:58.799> on<00:04:04.459> ok<00:04:07.129> here<00:04:08.129> is<00:04:08.640> in<00:04:08.910> place<00:04:11.569> another<00:04:13.069> clip
