00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
typical Welsh whether it's going to be

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.949 
typical Welsh whether it's going to be
difficult<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.670> predict<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.030> conditions<00:02:57.510> yeah

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959

I<00:02:57.990> think<00:02:58.200> too<00:02:58.500> difficult<00:02:59.010> because<00:02:59.160> here<00:02:59.520> in

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
I think too difficult because here in

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.050 
I think too difficult because here in
Wells<00:02:59.940> you<00:03:00.209> can<00:03:00.450> find<00:03:00.830> three<00:03:01.910> condition<00:03:02.910> in

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060
