00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
probably don't get out until about one

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.180 
probably don't get out until about one
or<00:01:04.030> two<00:01:04.059> and<00:01:04.570> I<00:01:04.869> do<00:01:04.930> realize<00:01:05.259> outdoor<00:01:05.860> foods

weights<00:01:06.580> set<00:01:07.030> up<00:01:07.240> and<00:01:07.509> the<00:01:07.570> different<00:01:07.900> things

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
weights set up and the different things

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.450 
weights set up and the different things
we<00:01:08.080> get<00:01:08.259> to<00:01:08.320> do<00:01:08.500> is<00:01:08.680> completely<00:01:09.280> different

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
we get to do is completely different

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.580 
we get to do is completely different
from<00:01:09.759> what<00:01:10.270> everybody<00:01:10.479> else<00:01:10.630> that<00:01:11.080> is<00:01:11.290> to<00:01:11.440> do

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
from what everybody else that is to do

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.040 
from what everybody else that is to do
for<00:01:12.340> instance<00:01:12.729> most<00:01:13.180> people<00:01:13.540> get<00:01:13.720> to<00:01:13.840> clock

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
for instance most people get to clock

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.830 
for instance most people get to clock
out<00:01:14.229> on<00:01:14.410> time<00:01:14.759> outdoor<00:01:15.759> foods<00:01:16.030> we<00:01:16.300> rarely<00:01:16.539> ever

especially during peak hours is insane

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.859 
especially during peak hours is insane
