00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 good today we are going to make a 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.660
 tutorial on installation and 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.840
 configuration of an ip camera 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.269
 as we see we have already executed in your 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.280
 installation we give to accept accept 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.970
 the license and we return the following 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.009
 then this we connect the router camera and 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.110
 the energy chamber 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.900
 we give to next and see if he from the 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.960
 camera is on let's go to next 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.630
 and we wait to see if it is connected 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:36.280
 still as a message 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.280
 let's check and technique 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.170
 we can see there we think it's the 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.130
 then we give below we put 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.490
 a 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:52.250
 internet in password we give of enter and 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:55.390
 there he asks us for a name as if we want 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.220
 put next and then the ip address 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.620
 next if we want we can change 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.620
 password and we give the following 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.580
 Here we choose once available 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.340
 we set the level of security and the 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.830
 network password to access 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.930
 to her we give in following equipments see 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.390
 the previous and new data we are going to 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.290
 save wait for them to keep the 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.290
 new changes that we have made 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.229
 when many of the confirmation and still 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.680
 now let's check the connection that 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.160
 We have done it via cable 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.430
 we enter the ip address of the 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.690
 camera shows us that picture 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.160
 let's watch videos 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.140
 and we wait for him to carry the 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.850
 viewing of good videos from 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.150
 video that is capturing in this 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.150
 moment 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.030
 here we can see that the camera is already 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.220
 visualizing this days through the cable 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.110
 of data 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.700
 good now 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:21.960
 to configure the ip camera via wifi 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:27.250
 we have to make some changes 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:30.730
 let's go to the fighter 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.860
 and we are going to verify that the camera has 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.050
 the same level of security and the keys 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.930
 that has another let's 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.770
 to the security of the camera that is web 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.950
 of that type atr or bits 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.270
 let's go to the security of 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.110
 from French 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.060
 and we have to match every key that 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.820
 we see there from love are four 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.460
 kinds of dealing we trust every key 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:02.140
 from the counter to the camera to 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.140
 I can access well boy frame 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.530
 come on I understand the third 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.460
 we give in applying to keep the 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.460
 security changes 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.860
 and if we go and now we're going to apply the 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.860
 changes in the configuration of the bed 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.280
 addressed the changes and now we continue 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.620
 with the wifi installation 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.160
 we remove the power cord we are going to 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.160
 following 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.280
 we remove the cable that we are not going to 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.230
 use 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.440
 and we are going to connect only the cable 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.440
 Energy 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.900
 we wait for him to load 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.680
 it is a configuration very faulty and delayed 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.840
 a little more because it is already without cable 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.450
 data 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.450
 let's wait for him to load everything 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.190
 once it is finished 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:43.590
 confirmation installation and how 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.340
 we can see we have communication 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:50.700
 via wifi now that language and now 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.200
 we have the software now we are going to 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.830
 visualize 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.550
 the ip decision of the camera 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:01.240
 but now without cable via wifi 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.620
 we're going to watch videos anyway 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.720
 we wait for him to load 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.760
 and they have to show us 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.760
 the display of 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:18.040
 how to see the same has the wind of 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:21.210
 innovation with cables the website 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.210
 now let's see 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.540
 Y 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.080
 let's see the option to select 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.430
 the camera 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.390
 we wait for the 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.390
 know 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.630
 the camera appears 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:47.190
 we put the 2 in the word and we give 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.389
 address the changes 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.129
 to visualize the camera we owe the 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:54.860
 mojito button 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:56.620
 and we are going to observe this 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.200
 what he 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.849
 what the camera is 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:05.059
 and they are notified 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:08.689
 with this option we can start recording 

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:10.020
 the red button turns on and starts to 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:12.240
 Record 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.349
 to see this the camera options 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.349
 let's do 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.590
 we wait 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.289
 so that the camera and then we give to 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.699
 preferences 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:28.699
 where videos are saved 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:36.709
 and some of these options like in the 

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:36.709
 time limit 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:44.870
 the total space the limit 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:48.580
 other options we must address if it is that 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.580
 we have made some changes xxi 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.819
 then for 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:58.210
 to see 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.210
 and 

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:06.430
 video playback to select a 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:09.340
 camera provide videos 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.830
 to see better let's select the time 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.730
 in which the date on which the 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.730
 the video was made 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.410
 the present day 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:31.479
 we give him play and there we can visualize 

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:33.689
 the video that we have been taking makes 

00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:38.150
 just a moment 

00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:41.860
 then with this and options for 

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.860
 to manipulate the video 

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.230
 here as 

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:57.940
 the zoom 

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:57.940
 to zoom in and out in the video 

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:07.060
 and with this we finished the tutorial on 

00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:09.780
 the configuration of the ip camera 

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.780
 means
