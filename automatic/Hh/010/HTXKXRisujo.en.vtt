one<00:01:32.810> of<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.110> other<00:01:33.290> characters<00:01:34.009> that<00:01:34.220> I<00:01:34.280> think

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
one of the other characters that I think

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.149 
one of the other characters that I think
I<00:01:35.000> personally<00:01:35.780> struggled<00:01:36.259> with<00:01:36.439> was<00:01:36.680> ruined

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159

who's<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.850> horse<00:01:38.140> horses<00:01:39.140> are<00:01:39.380> really<00:01:39.740> hard

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
who's the horse horses are really hard

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.770 
who's the horse horses are really hard
to<00:01:40.009> do<00:01:40.250> first<00:01:40.610> of<00:01:40.759> all<00:01:40.880> I<00:01:40.909> hate<00:01:41.240> drawing<00:01:41.509> horses

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
to do first of all I hate drawing horses

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.480 
to do first of all I hate drawing horses
I<00:01:42.170> just<00:01:42.350> think<00:01:42.590> at<00:01:42.740> it<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:42.979> the<00:01:43.130> thing<00:01:43.159> about

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
I just think at it and the thing about

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.219 
I just think at it and the thing about
horses<00:01:43.939> they<00:01:44.210> look<00:01:44.360> kind<00:01:44.570> of<00:01:44.630> odd<00:01:44.810> from

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
horses they look kind of odd from

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.710 
horses they look kind of odd from
certain<00:01:45.619> angles<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:46.220> so<00:01:46.580> we<00:01:46.939> had<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.270> create

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
certain angles and so we had to create

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.570 
certain angles and so we had to create
this<00:01:47.930> horse<00:01:48.229> that<00:01:48.320> was<00:01:48.619> somehow<00:01:48.860> much<00:01:49.280> cooler

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
this horse that was somehow much cooler

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.850 
this horse that was somehow much cooler
than<00:01:49.880> an<00:01:50.000> actual<00:01:50.210> horse

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.180 

we<00:01:53.100> wanted<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.490> make<00:01:53.880> ruin<00:01:54.480> bigger<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.560> more

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
we wanted to make ruin bigger and more

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.280 
we wanted to make ruin bigger and more
powerful<00:01:56.250> than<00:01:56.850> any<00:01:57.150> horse<00:01:57.540> could<00:01:57.780> possibly

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
powerful than any horse could possibly

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.590 
powerful than any horse could possibly
be<00:01:58.560> he<00:01:59.310> had<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.580> look<00:01:59.790> like<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> weapon

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
be he had to look like a weapon

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:11.830 
be he had to look like a weapon
basically<00:02:01.370> something<00:02:02.370> like<00:02:02.940> this

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.680 

I<00:02:12.040> think<00:02:13.040> film<00:02:13.340> directors<00:02:13.819> have<00:02:14.030> influenced

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
I think film directors have influenced

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.640 
I think film directors have influenced
me<00:02:14.870> what<00:02:15.830> I<00:02:15.860> love<00:02:16.129> about<00:02:16.160> movies<00:02:16.790> is<00:02:17.060> the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
me what I love about movies is the

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.540 
me what I love about movies is the
cinematography<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:18.680> I<00:02:18.860> think<00:02:19.069> a<00:02:19.220> lot<00:02:19.430> of<00:02:19.459> the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
cinematography and I think a lot of the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.460 
cinematography and I think a lot of the
shots<00:02:19.849> a<00:02:20.060> lot<00:02:20.090> of<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.510> edits<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.110> things<00:02:21.349> like

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
shots a lot of the edits and things like

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.680
