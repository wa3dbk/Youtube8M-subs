suppose<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.320> guess<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.070> was<00:00:56.190> can<00:00:56.430> because<00:00:56.789> it

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
suppose I guess that was can because it

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.279 
suppose I guess that was can because it
was<00:00:57.030> really<00:00:57.210> stupid<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.809> didn't<00:00:58.020> make<00:00:58.109> any

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
was really stupid and didn't make any

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:58.790 
was really stupid and didn't make any
sense

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
sense

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.700

which<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.699> guess<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.239> no<00:01:00.539> real<00:01:00.840> loss<00:01:01.079> for<00:01:01.289> us<00:01:01.410> so

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
which I guess is no real loss for us so

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.920 
which I guess is no real loss for us so
we<00:01:01.829> gun<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.399> man<00:01:02.640> down<00:01:02.940> for<00:01:03.239> his<00:01:03.390> plot<00:01:03.719> hole

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
Call of Duty game we will see how that

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.890 
Call of Duty game we will see how that
works<00:03:10.400> out<00:03:10.730> in<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.910> next<00:03:11.060> level<00:03:11.450> whether<00:03:11.690> I'm

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
works out in the next level whether I'm

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.830 
works out in the next level whether I'm
right<00:03:12.319> or<00:03:12.349> nods<00:03:12.800> but<00:03:13.550> until<00:03:14.120> then<00:03:14.360> we<00:03:14.720> are

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
right or nods but until then we are

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.449 
right or nods but until then we are
going<00:03:15.019> to<00:03:15.200> have<00:03:15.319> to<00:03:15.440> just<00:03:15.590> continue<00:03:16.280> making

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
going to have to just continue making

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.280 
going to have to just continue making
our<00:03:16.700> way<00:03:16.790> through<00:03:16.819> here<00:03:17.000> now<00:03:17.900> what<00:03:18.140> we<00:03:18.260> are

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
our way through here now what we are

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.690 
our way through here now what we are
doing<00:03:18.380> we<00:03:18.830> planted<00:03:19.250> that<00:03:20.950> covert<00:03:21.950> modem<00:03:22.370> thing

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
doing we planted that covert modem thing

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.850 
doing we planted that covert modem thing
in<00:03:23.239> order<00:03:23.600> that<00:03:23.630> we<00:03:23.959> might<00:03:24.170> intercept<00:03:24.739> an

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
in order that we might intercept an

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.590 
in order that we might intercept an
off-site<00:03:25.220> data<00:03:25.459> backup<00:03:25.940> so<00:03:26.090> now<00:03:26.209> we<00:03:26.330> are<00:03:26.450> going

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
off-site data backup so now we are going

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.960 
off-site data backup so now we are going
to<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.840> data<00:03:27.080> room<00:03:27.440> in<00:03:27.830> the<00:03:28.069> dam<00:03:28.370> in<00:03:28.610> order<00:03:28.850> to

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
to the data room in the dam in order to

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.610 
to the data room in the dam in order to
activate<00:03:29.299> their<00:03:29.720> mainframe<00:03:30.290> in<00:03:30.530> a

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
activate their mainframe in a

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.680 
activate their mainframe in a
complicated<00:03:31.040> computer<00:03:31.730> e-type<00:03:32.030> fashion<00:03:32.450> and

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
complicated computer e-type fashion and

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.259 
complicated computer e-type fashion and
then<00:03:33.440> start<00:03:33.860> an<00:03:33.980> off-site<00:03:34.340> data<00:03:34.640> backup<00:03:35.120> which

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
then start an off-site data backup which

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.240 
then start an off-site data backup which
we<00:03:35.390> can<00:03:35.540> then<00:03:35.569> intercept<00:03:36.440> in<00:03:36.830> a<00:03:36.950> naughty

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
we can then intercept in a naughty

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.160 
we can then intercept in a naughty
manner<00:03:37.640> thus<00:03:38.060> finding<00:03:38.480> out<00:03:38.599> where<00:03:38.959> they're

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
manner thus finding out where they're

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.740 
manner thus finding out where they're
sending<00:03:39.560> all<00:03:39.650> their<00:03:39.830> nerve<00:03:40.220> gas<00:03:40.519> I<00:03:41.000> think

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
sending all their nerve gas I think

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.509 
sending all their nerve gas I think
they're<00:03:41.959> sending<00:03:42.260> it<00:03:42.530> to<00:03:42.680> Burger<00:03:43.099> King<00:03:43.130> in

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
they're sending it to Burger King in

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.400 
they're sending it to Burger King in
order<00:03:43.790> to<00:03:43.910> make<00:03:44.060> those<00:03:44.269> delicious<00:03:44.870> milkshakes

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
order to make those delicious milkshakes

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.400 
order to make those delicious milkshakes
but<00:03:45.739> that's<00:03:46.400> just<00:03:46.670> me<00:03:46.970> I'm<00:03:47.810> just<00:03:48.140> a<00:03:48.290> bit

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
but that's just me I'm just a bit

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.039 
but that's just me I'm just a bit
paranoid<00:03:48.650> like<00:03:49.069> that<00:03:49.340> so<00:03:49.640> it's<00:03:50.540> great<00:03:50.750> it<00:03:50.900> was

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
paranoid like that so it's great it was

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.319 
paranoid like that so it's great it was
great<00:03:51.319> and<00:03:51.680> take<00:03:52.160> away<00:03:52.370> all<00:03:52.579> their<00:03:52.760> weaponries

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
great and take away all their weaponries

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.420 
great and take away all their weaponries
most<00:03:54.260> of<00:03:54.410> all<00:03:54.470> these<00:03:54.560> crates<00:03:54.859> have<00:03:54.980> exactly

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
most of all these crates have exactly

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.280 
most of all these crates have exactly
one<00:03:55.700> gun<00:03:55.970> in<00:03:56.090> them<00:03:56.269> really<00:03:56.420> it's<00:03:56.870> sort<00:03:57.200> of

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
one gun in them really it's sort of

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.770 
one gun in them really it's sort of
bizarre<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:57.920> maybe<00:03:58.370> inefficient<00:03:58.940> but<00:03:59.180> yes

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
bizarre and maybe inefficient but yes

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.740 
bizarre and maybe inefficient but yes
it's<00:03:59.959> good<00:04:00.109> for<00:04:00.290> someone

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
it's good for someone

firstly we will destroy this guy but

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.170 
firstly we will destroy this guy but
secondly<00:05:18.030> it's<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:20.400> idea<00:05:20.639> of<00:05:20.699> using<00:05:20.909> the

secondly it's the idea of using the
Piton<00:05:21.479> gun<00:05:21.689> here<00:05:21.900> would<00:05:22.020> suggest<00:05:22.199> that<00:05:22.379> this

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
Piton gun here would suggest that this

first<00:05:23.939> QuickTime<00:05:24.449> event<00:05:24.750> which<00:05:24.870> terrifies<00:05:25.530> me

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
first QuickTime event which terrifies me

first QuickTime event which terrifies me
beyond<00:05:26.039> mortal<00:05:26.490> reason<00:05:26.789> anyway<00:05:27.060> we<00:05:27.150> have<00:05:27.240> left

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:50.029 
to leap to his demise anyway that has
been<00:05:48.870> that<00:05:49.020> level<00:05:49.349> that<00:05:49.500> is<00:05:49.590> the<00:05:49.620> first<00:05:49.889> level

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
been that level that is the first level

been that level that is the first level
of<00:05:50.159> Goldeneye<00:05:50.550> dam<00:05:50.969> I<00:05:51.000> have<00:05:51.479> been<00:05:51.659> evil<00:05:51.870> to<00:05:51.990> him

and<00:05:52.289> this<00:05:52.349> has<00:05:52.500> been<00:05:52.650> worse<00:05:53.009> but<00:05:53.189> let's<00:05:53.340> play

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
and this has been worse but let's play
