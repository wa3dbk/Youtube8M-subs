so<00:00:31.710> let's<00:00:31.949> go<00:00:32.099> ahead<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.279> jump<00:00:32.579> right<00:00:32.640> into<00:00:32.910> it

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
so let's go ahead and jump right into it

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.980 
so let's go ahead and jump right into it
first<00:00:33.870> question<00:00:34.050> what<00:00:34.829> does<00:00:35.040> TI<00:00:35.430> stand<00:00:36.060> for<00:00:36.330> TI

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:36.990 
first question what does TI stand for TI

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.850 
first question what does TI stand for TI
is<00:00:37.640> inspired<00:00:38.640> by<00:00:38.790> titanium<00:00:39.630> and<00:00:39.750> titanium<00:00:39.860> is

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
is inspired by titanium and titanium is

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.280 
is inspired by titanium and titanium is
a<00:00:40.890> very<00:00:41.310> durable<00:00:41.520> light<00:00:42.060> metal<00:00:42.480> it's<00:00:42.870> stronger

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
a very durable light metal it's stronger

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.560 
a very durable light metal it's stronger
than<00:00:43.320> steel<00:00:43.650> and<00:00:43.860> we<00:00:44.640> use<00:00:44.880> that<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.330> tell<00:00:45.540> you

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
than steel and we use that to tell you

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.570 
than steel and we use that to tell you
the<00:00:45.690> products<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.380> are<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.740> TI<00:00:47.010> products

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
the products that are the TI products

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.150 
the products that are the TI products
are<00:00:47.790> actually<00:00:48.450> faster<00:00:48.900> than<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.950> stock

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
are actually faster than the stock

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.420 
are actually faster than the stock
products<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:50.730> as<00:00:50.850> an<00:00:51.030> example<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:52.230> gtx<00:00:52.710> 650ti

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
products so as an example the gtx 650ti

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.360 
products so as an example the gtx 650ti
is<00:00:54.120> about<00:00:54.750> forty<00:00:55.110> percent<00:00:55.380> faster<00:00:55.680> than<00:00:56.220> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
is about forty percent faster than the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.410 
is about forty percent faster than the
gtx<00:00:56.880> 650<00:00:57.510> stock<00:00:57.810> model<00:00:58.550> next<00:00:59.550> question<00:00:59.970> can<00:01:00.300> it

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
gtx 650 stock model next question can it

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.180 
gtx 650 stock model next question can it
play<00:01:00.570> crisis<00:01:01.080> that<00:01:01.380> question<00:01:01.770> always<00:01:01.980> comes

play crisis that question always comes
up<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.670> almost<00:01:02.880> every<00:01:03.210> GPU<00:01:03.570> launch<00:01:03.750> we<00:01:03.960> do<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
up on almost every GPU launch we do the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.980 
up on almost every GPU launch we do the
answer<00:01:04.829> for<00:01:05.159> gtx<00:01:05.610> 650ti<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.509> that<00:01:06.869> it

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
answer for gtx 650ti is that it

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.750 
answer for gtx 650ti is that it
absolutely<00:01:07.140> can<00:01:07.470> play<00:01:07.650> crisis<00:01:08.100> as<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.490> matter

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760

if I replaced it with a gtx 650ti the

the<00:01:37.710> 560<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.370> probably<00:01:38.610> going<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.790> tend<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.090> win

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
the 560 is probably going to tend to win

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.539 
the 560 is probably going to tend to win
on<00:01:39.479> newer<00:01:39.750> titles<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.440> 650<00:01:40.920> Ti<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.190> going<00:01:41.490> to

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
on newer titles the 650 Ti is going to

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.010 
on newer titles the 650 Ti is going to
tend<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.850> win<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.360> I'd<00:01:42.479> say<00:01:42.630> they're<00:01:42.810> very

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
tend to win so I'd say they're very

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.010 
tend to win so I'd say they're very
close<00:01:43.350> what<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.100> difference<00:01:44.580> is<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.030> 650<00:01:45.840> Ti

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
close what is difference is the 650 Ti

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.719 
close what is difference is the 650 Ti
is<00:01:46.110> going<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.470> be<00:01:46.590> running<00:01:46.830> about<00:01:47.070> 90<00:01:47.520> watts

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729

less<00:01:48.150> than<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.930> 560<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.710> at<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:49.920> end<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.100> day

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.280 
less than the 560 so at the end of day
it<00:01:50.670> should<00:01:50.909> be<00:01:50.940> a<00:01:51.030> nice<00:01:51.240> experience<00:01:51.479> benefit

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
it should be a nice experience benefit

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.840 
it should be a nice experience benefit
but<00:01:52.470> really<00:01:52.950> they're<00:01:53.310> going<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.490> be<00:01:53.580> very

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
but really they're going to be very

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.969 
but really they're going to be very
close<00:01:54.090> on<00:01:54.299> performance<00:01:54.840> what's<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.680> point<00:01:55.860> of

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
close on performance what's the point of

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.649 
close on performance what's the point of

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
make it a little bit slower so while the
