 also feature of this multicooker 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:53.500
 this is a 3d heating function that

 allows you to evenly distribute heat 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:01:02.449
 lanyard motivation in my opinion short 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.660
 its length is 120 meters 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.369
 anyway he limited 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.460
 the location of this technology on 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.399
 coin included other than 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.950

 I would like to say about the instructions 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.910
 in my opinion the instruction 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:53.590
 inconsistent and incomprehensible but if 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.750
 cook everything according to the recipe book 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.770
 anyway cook a few 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.050

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.590
