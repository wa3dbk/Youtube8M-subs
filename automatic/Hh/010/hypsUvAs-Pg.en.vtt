00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.190
 as of November 15, 2000 students 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.589
 will take the road in front of Paris to 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.200
 go to the new university lyon ii 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.710
 will find a university in full 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.450
 construction site 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.470
 only part of the premises being 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.609
 completed big paris will be the university 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.430
 experimental in premises 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.539
 experimental is the fruit of the law 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.760
 of orientation 1971 will be the year 1 of 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.650
 the new university 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.900
 this set drivers and lips not 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.910
 only from the architect but also the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.600
 student teachers and the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.270
 sociologists 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.460
 all participated in the development of a 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.770
 construction program responding to 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.379
 administrative and educational needs 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.770
 we gathered in the anc is that 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.079
 here is 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.420
 although it is important to insist on 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.910
 the collaboration that took place at all 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.370
 the moments of research among all 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.199
 interested lab people 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.600
 rations that resulted in the definition 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.980
 of a program from a program that 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.480
 seeks to put to seek to define and 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.820
 a tool a teaching tool 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.600
 educational tool it is not intended 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.310
 only to higher education 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.530
 but who can answer more 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.780
 open to the multiple needs that say 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.900
 today in education and in 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.270
 cultural activity at the 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.130
 times for a university population 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.750
 in the strict sense of the word but more 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.880
 largely for an urban population 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.009
 the one that will exist in a few years 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.630
 around this university because we have 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.759
 tried to do here it's a little bit 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.540
 we could call an anti campus 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.610
 that is, to make sure that there is 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.650
 is on the one hand that the university is 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.619
 finally accounts integrated with the set of 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.930
 the city also the students themselves 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.299
 find in spaces that are not 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.710
 no spaces between buildings but 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.960
 that the buildings the different 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.440
 functions that can be fulfilled in a 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.600
 university ensemble 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.460
 is in a continuum that is at 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.540
 both teaching spaces of 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.520
 relaxation areas 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.470
 we chose techniques they 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.530
 can that allow us to put 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.700
 implement everything we have 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.860
 defined at the program level this is at 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.270
 say that it needs to be scalable to 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.400
 to say that all the elements 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.600
 that it is partitions that it is facades 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.910
 are removable 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.410
 we can even change a glass panel 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.150
 and replace it with another panel 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.580
 full one can make a multitude of 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.980
 things you see besides there there the 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.100
 technical possibilities of this head of 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.600
 this structure are obvious enough 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.250
 to bolt from just to laying of 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.010
 elements and then we can do 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.740
 continue the building following the 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.810
 continuous web needs we are not 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.810
 at all we know where we are we turn the 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.600
 back to this traditional architecture 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.670
 of buildings closed on themselves 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.450
 this university to a present we we 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.570
 see here 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.950
 she also has a future but her 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.720
 implantation and its situation 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.730
 geographic have raised some 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.680
 difficulties but what is his 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.410
 effect since we are placed a little 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.050
 outside the urban fabric and to 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.250
 near a motorway interchange 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.260
 that both the advantages of 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.610
 disadvantages advantage since we 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.739
 are easily accessible 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.440
 especially by the motorized public 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.300
 and disadvantages since it took us 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.280
 sort of organize a neighborhood 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.989
 around universities for this one 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.989
 in accordance with current principles 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.180
 be open precisely to 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.970
 the cultural and social animation of his 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.950
 environment its unfinished buildings 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.840
 so welcomes this year 2000 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.269
 students they will be eight thousand in 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.930
 two years they are part of the experience 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.250
 tempted to bang a tough task for 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.700
 the president of the university 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.860
 sir the room from the point of view 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.830
 pedagogical you know we had to 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.240
 blanton 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:51.510
 all first three cycles of units 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.130
 Germanic studies French study of 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.910
 science of man and his 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.030
 environment 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:00.390
 therefore dairy students 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.490
 will follow classic duels but in 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.300
 the framework of these classic duels 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:08.490
 they will also be able to obtain 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.740
 optional values that will give their 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.780
 training a coloring of the jury 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.820
 disciplinary 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.130
 initiation to public law initiation 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.410
 at computer initiation to the 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.170
 sociology 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.840
 there will even be an initiation 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.160
 secretarial super proud all this comes 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.470
 as part of the goal 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.510
 we continue to do that is 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.340
 will have to vary a university that is 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.830
 in accordance with the principles of the law 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.410
 guidance a university that is 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.290
 multidisciplinary and strives to 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.060
 find for all students 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.940
 outlets fit this amphitheater 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.550
 good paris is the image of the 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.169
 new university in that there is 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.710
 ten years an opening in all 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.260
 round 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.300
 yes indeed the entire university of 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.660
 bron parilly may differ may 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.940
 define by opening this set 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.400
 university is open to the world 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.710
 outside on the one hand and on himself 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.280
 on the other hand on the outside world of 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:11.460
 made of his architect the same the 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.460
 street the forum and opening on itself 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.130
 because of all the windows we've seen 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.169
 in the east in the classrooms of the 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.240
 does the design of the premises that 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.040
 tends to bring together students and 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.710
 remake that really to bron there is a 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.100
 community and that bron is really a 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.710
 soul 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.180
 your president to tell me that paris does 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.880
 will not we vincennes but does not allocate 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.860
 not a little impression that by then 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.970
 only the works the students are going 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.680
 to take habits 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.479
 she will not fall back on themselves 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.249
 as in any classical university 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:44.489
 I think it's a risk 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:46.709
 what I missed and very certain but 

00:05:44.489 --> 00:05:48.089
 on that side I think it's 

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:50.399
 rightly the authorities 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:53.099
 academics and to ensure that 

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:54.649
 students is not the temptation to 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:57.569
 exit on reindeer 

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:59.549
 the problem that will arise and who 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:00.869
 may accentuate folds this is not 

00:05:59.549 --> 00:06:02.869
 may be the building coming from 

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:06.029
 university cities on site too 

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:06.779
 in the future and I think the iphone 

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:09.149
 is found two original formulas 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:11.249
 allowing at the same time a certain 

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:14.459
 symbiosis with the outside environment and not 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:15.779
 not a mini an insulation of 

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:17.309
 the student about himself in 

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:19.199
 university in the university center 

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:20.549
 Lyon May 2 about the law 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:22.860
 guidance 

00:06:20.549 --> 00:06:24.659
 the work will only be completed in 1973 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.610
 what will become of this notion of openness 

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:28.769
 to the public 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:31.199
 so I think for the moment this 

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:35.579
 notion of openness to the public remains if I 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:37.529
 mean virtual initially the idea that has 

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:39.599
 presided at the birth of my paris li a 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:42.839
 been to make it an integrated university 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:45.329
 that is to say, place of communication between 

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:48.299
 students and the everyday world 

00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:49.949
 that they envy the surroundings he is well 

00:06:48.299 --> 00:06:51.629
 heard you see the yard you 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:53.089
 see the current situation of bron 

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:55.739
 paris there is still no 

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:59.610
 urbanization very little urbanization 

00:06:55.739 --> 00:07:00.989
 in an area that's pretty deserted and 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.969
 therefore it is a problem that he 

00:07:00.989 --> 00:07:05.999
 will have to approach in the future or in paris 

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:07.379
 will not be a second vincennes we the 

00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:09.839
 wish now we have ourselves 

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:12.179
 did we translated into space 

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:13.949
 a program again defined no 

00:07:12.179 --> 00:07:15.869
 not by architects, not by 

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:17.269
 not by programmers but by 

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:20.159
 future users 

00:07:17.269 --> 00:07:21.829
 we hope to have succeeded now 

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:23.539
 the main thing remains to be done 

00:07:21.829 --> 00:07:26.729
 how do users 

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:28.019
 will use this equipment we do not 

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:30.689
 are we are only 

00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:34.159
 Meme it fitness so I can say the 

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:34.159
 remains the most important remains to be done
