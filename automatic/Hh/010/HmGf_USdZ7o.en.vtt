00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
which I'm really interested in and we

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.630 
which I'm really interested in and we
didn't<00:01:31.229> get<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.350> look<00:01:31.619> at<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.799> Martian<00:01:32.130> madness

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640

invasion<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.900> really<00:01:34.860> love<00:01:35.009> how<00:01:35.159> there's<00:01:35.369> a

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
invasion and I really love how there's a

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.640 
invasion and I really love how there's a
progress<00:01:35.880> bar<00:01:35.939> during<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.320> think<00:01:37.380> that

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
progress bar during it and I think that

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.980 
progress bar during it and I think that
really<00:01:37.770> adds<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.220> lot<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.729> how<00:01:39.240> much<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.840> you
