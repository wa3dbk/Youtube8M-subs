with more f1 2013 news now in this video

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.459 
with more f1 2013 news now in this video
we're<00:00:12.599> gonna<00:00:12.660> be<00:00:12.809> talking<00:00:12.960> about<00:00:13.170> something

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
we're gonna be talking about something

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.020 
we're gonna be talking about something
that's<00:00:13.710> been<00:00:13.920> out<00:00:14.070> there<00:00:14.099> for<00:00:14.400> about<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.820> couple

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
that's been out there for about a couple

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.790 
that's been out there for about a couple
of<00:00:15.240> months<00:00:15.330> now<00:00:15.599> but<00:00:15.630> I<00:00:16.080> think<00:00:16.230> still<00:00:16.650> worth

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
of months now but I think still worth

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.349 
of months now but I think still worth
talking<00:00:17.039> about<00:00:17.279> because<00:00:17.670> it's<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.910> character

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
talking about because it's the character

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.960 
talking about because it's the character
modeling<00:00:18.720> for<00:00:18.990> f1<00:00:19.529> 2013<00:00:19.980> now<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.789> first

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
modeling for f1 2013 now the first

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.759 
modeling for f1 2013 now the first

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
picture we got was Charles peak you can

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.980 
picture we got was Charles peak you can
see<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:22.949> picture<00:00:23.250> right<00:00:23.400> here<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.660> makes

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
see that picture right here and it makes

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.689 
see that picture right here and it makes
him<00:00:25.109> look<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.380> lot<00:00:25.560> more<00:00:25.619> like<00:00:26.130> he<00:00:26.310> does<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:26.519> real

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
him look a lot more like he does in real

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.519 
him look a lot more like he does in real
life<00:00:27.000> than<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.420> last<00:00:27.599> year's<00:00:27.930> game<00:00:27.960> which<00:00:28.349> is

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
life than the last year's game which is

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.500 
life than the last year's game which is
interesting<00:00:29.340> because<00:00:29.369> they're<00:00:30.150> going<00:00:30.330> back

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
interesting because they're going back

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.030 
interesting because they're going back
and<00:00:30.660> doing<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:31.019> again<00:00:31.289> because<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.619> didn't<00:00:31.890> need

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
and doing it again because I didn't need

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.799 
and doing it again because I didn't need
to<00:00:32.250> go<00:00:32.369> back<00:00:32.520> here<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:32.969> actually<00:00:33.300> get<00:00:33.600> another

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
to go back here and actually get another

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.120 
to go back here and actually get another
picture<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.170> Charles<00:00:34.530> pic<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.829> put<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
picture of Charles pic to put in the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.740 
picture of Charles pic to put in the
game<00:00:35.340> but<00:00:35.520> they<00:00:35.640> did<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.300> try<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.510> get<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
game but they did it to try and get the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.479 
game but they did it to try and get the
best<00:00:36.960> character<00:00:37.559> modeling<00:00:37.860> they<00:00:38.010> possibly

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
best character modeling they possibly

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.580 
best character modeling they possibly
could<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.450> makes<00:00:39.600> me<00:00:39.780> think<00:00:39.809> are<00:00:40.440> they

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
could and this makes me think are they

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.170 
could and this makes me think are they
trying<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.950> make<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.489> ultimate<00:00:41.520> game

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
trying to make this the ultimate game

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.209 
trying to make this the ultimate game
because<00:00:42.629> they<00:00:43.050> learn<00:00:43.230> back<00:00:43.410> every<00:00:43.860> single

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
because they learn back every single

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.130 
because they learn back every single
year<00:00:44.340> it's<00:00:44.489> try<00:00:44.700> get<00:00:44.879> an<00:00:44.969> improvement<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.809> I

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
year it's try get an improvement and I

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.569 
year it's try get an improvement and I
think<00:00:46.200> they<00:00:46.440> are<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.620> trying<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.100> aim<00:00:47.250> for<00:00:47.280> a

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
think they are just trying to aim for a

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.479 
think they are just trying to aim for a
really<00:00:48.149> perfect<00:00:48.420> game<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.200> hopefully<00:00:50.160> this

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
really perfect game and hopefully this

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.950 
really perfect game and hopefully this
year<00:00:50.640> they<00:00:50.789> can<00:00:51.030> perfect<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.629> because

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
year they can perfect it because

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.060 
year they can perfect it because
obviously<00:00:52.079> over<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.469> last<00:00:52.620> couple<00:00:52.739> years<00:00:52.860> it

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
obviously over the last couple years it

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.040 
obviously over the last couple years it
hasn't<00:00:53.219> been<00:00:53.430> perfect<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:54.270> been<00:00:54.449> good<00:00:54.719> but

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
hasn't been perfect it's been good but

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.660 
hasn't been perfect it's been good but
it<00:00:55.140> hasn't<00:00:55.440> been<00:00:55.559> perfect<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.250> i<00:00:56.430> think<00:00:56.579> this

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
it hasn't been perfect and i think this

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.279 
it hasn't been perfect and i think this
year<00:00:56.879> they've<00:00:57.030> been<00:00:57.149> going<00:00:57.300> back<00:00:57.570> been<00:00:58.079> trying

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
year they've been going back been trying

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.660 
year they've been going back been trying
to<00:00:58.350> get<00:00:58.410> more<00:00:58.590> information<00:00:58.829> from<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.370> teams

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
to get more information from the teams

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.920 
to get more information from the teams
they've<00:01:00.059> trying<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.329> get<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.480> picture<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
they've trying to get the picture the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.810 
they've trying to get the picture the
drivers<00:01:01.350> just<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.920> make<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.100> feel<00:01:02.370> like<00:01:02.430> you're

actually the driver when you're walking

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.780 
actually the driver when you're walking
around<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.680> paddock<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.400> see<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> other

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
around the paddock you see the other

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.760 
around the paddock you see the other
drivers<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.270> like<00:01:06.420> yeah<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.140> me<00:01:07.530> i'm

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.590 
drivers to like yeah this is me i'm
driving<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.369> Formula<00:01:08.670> One<00:01:08.700> car<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.270> I'm

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
driving a Formula One car and I'm

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.690 
driving a Formula One car and I'm
driving<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:10.049> really<00:01:10.740> awesome<00:01:10.950> game<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.670> I

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
driving this really awesome game and I

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.980 
driving this really awesome game and I
think<00:01:11.909> that's<00:01:12.330> what<00:01:12.479> they're<00:01:12.600> trying<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.840> do

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
think that's what they're trying to do

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.210 
think that's what they're trying to do
they're<00:01:13.140> trying<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.350> make<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.010> perfect

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
they're trying to make it the perfect

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.460 
they're trying to make it the perfect
game<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.119> don't<00:01:15.540> know<00:01:15.600> how<00:01:15.780> long<00:01:16.290> that's

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
game and I don't know how long that's

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.960 
game and I don't know how long that's
gonna<00:01:16.650> be<00:01:16.770> before<00:01:17.009> they<00:01:17.280> realize<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.670> probably

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
gonna be before they realize it probably

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.789 
gonna be before they realize it probably
isn't<00:01:18.119> going<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.390> be<00:01:18.479> exactly<00:01:19.080> perfect<00:01:19.680> I

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
isn't going to be exactly perfect I

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.260 
isn't going to be exactly perfect I
think<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.340> gonna<00:01:20.430> be<00:01:20.520> good<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.090> don't

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
think it's gonna be good but I don't

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.679 
think it's gonna be good but I don't
think<00:01:21.330> it's<00:01:21.509> gonna<00:01:21.600> be<00:01:21.750> precisely<00:01:22.470> perfect

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
think it's gonna be precisely perfect

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.850 
think it's gonna be precisely perfect
but<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.869> think<00:01:25.170> they're<00:01:25.320> going<00:01:25.470> back<00:01:25.650> each<00:01:25.830> year

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
but I think they're going back each year

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.350 
but I think they're going back each year
trying<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.369> get<00:01:26.460> more<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.729> more<00:01:26.759> information

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
trying to get more and more information

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.030 
trying to get more and more information
and<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.900> think<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.290> couple<00:01:28.320> years<00:01:28.590> time<00:01:28.890> they

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
and I think in a couple years time they

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.280 
and I think in a couple years time they
can<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.790> game<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.450> really

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
can have a the game that is really

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.630 
can have a the game that is really
really<00:01:31.320> good<00:01:31.920> i<00:01:31.979> mean<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.369> year<00:01:32.579> i<00:01:32.610> think

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
really good i mean this year i think

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.249 
really good i mean this year i think
it's<00:01:32.880> going<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.060> be<00:01:33.180> it's<00:01:33.509> going<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.750> be<00:01:33.840> good<00:01:34.020> I

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
it's going to be it's going to be good I

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.289 
it's going to be it's going to be good I
don't<00:01:34.860> think<00:01:35.040> it's<00:01:35.130> gonna<00:01:35.250> be<00:01:35.340> exactly<00:01:35.700> what

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
don't think it's gonna be exactly what

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.580 
don't think it's gonna be exactly what
everybody<00:01:36.630> wants<00:01:36.990> but<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.200> think<00:01:37.409> they're

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
everybody wants but I think they're

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.380 
everybody wants but I think they're
gonna<00:01:37.680> pretty<00:01:38.009> much<00:01:38.100> perfect<00:01:38.640> most<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
gonna pretty much perfect most of the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.450 
gonna pretty much perfect most of the
things<00:01:39.600> they<00:01:39.720> got<00:01:39.869> wrong<00:01:40.140> with<00:01:40.439> 2012<00:01:41.189> so

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
things they got wrong with 2012 so

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.880 
things they got wrong with 2012 so
hopefully<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.479> penalty<00:01:42.930> system<00:01:43.170> hopefully

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
hopefully the penalty system hopefully

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.280 
hopefully the penalty system hopefully
the<00:01:44.430> collisions<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.329> when<00:01:45.720> you're<00:01:45.840> going<00:01:46.079> side

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the collisions of when you're going side

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.810 
the collisions of when you're going side
by<00:01:46.320> cyber<00:01:46.680> people<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.100> don't<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:47.399> interlock

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
by cyber people you don't just interlock

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.880 
by cyber people you don't just interlock
wheels<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.390> spin<00:01:49.140> off<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.470> random<00:01:49.860> directions

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
wheels and spin off in random directions

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.649 
wheels and spin off in random directions
hopefully<00:01:50.820> they've<00:01:50.970> fixed<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.390> sort<00:01:51.600> of

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
hopefully they've fixed that sort of

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.440 
hopefully they've fixed that sort of
thing<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.280> I<00:01:53.280> really<00:01:53.549> think<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.970> they<00:01:54.420> are

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
thing and I really think that they are

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.639 
thing and I really think that they are
trying<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.840> do<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.140> they're<00:01:55.290> not<00:01:55.350> trying<00:01:55.530> to

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
trying to do that they're not trying to

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.350 
trying to do that they're not trying to
just<00:01:55.829> focus<00:01:56.070> on<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.460> weird<00:01:56.939> things<00:01:57.270> that

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
just focus on the weird things that

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.730 
just focus on the weird things that
people<00:01:57.659> don't<00:01:57.750> really<00:01:57.899> want<00:01:58.140> they're<00:01:58.500> trying

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
people don't really want they're trying

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.200 
people don't really want they're trying
to<00:01:58.799> focus<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.219> things<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.520> we<00:01:59.790> want<00:02:00.060> and

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
to focus on the things that we want and

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.050 
to focus on the things that we want and
that's<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.899> good<00:02:01.049> things<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.860> I'm<00:02:02.759> looking

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
that's the good things and I'm looking

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.459 
that's the good things and I'm looking
forward<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.479> mean<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:04.110> character

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
forward to it mean the character

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.590 
forward to it mean the character
modeling<00:02:04.740> isn't<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.100> massive<00:02:05.520> thing<00:02:05.969> but<00:02:06.240> it

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
modeling isn't a massive thing but it

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.940 
modeling isn't a massive thing but it
does<00:02:06.810> make<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.020> feel<00:02:07.290> like<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.560> are<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
does make you feel like you are the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.830 
does make you feel like you are the
driver<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.520> actually<00:02:08.729> are<00:02:09.090> racing<00:02:09.629> this

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
driver and you actually are racing this

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.750 
driver and you actually are racing this
game<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.560> are<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> racing<00:02:11.220> driver<00:02:11.340> you're<00:02:11.670> not

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
game you are a racing driver you're not

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.870 
game you are a racing driver you're not
just<00:02:12.000> some<00:02:12.120> person<00:02:12.540> play

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
just some person play

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.340 
just some person play
again<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.210> actually<00:02:13.510> feel<00:02:13.690> like<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:14.020> are<00:02:14.170> the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
again you actually feel like you are the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.780 
again you actually feel like you are the
driver<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:14.740> think<00:02:14.950> whether<00:02:15.100> slogans<00:02:15.670> from

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
driver I think whether slogans from

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.790 
driver I think whether slogans from
their<00:02:16.060> first<00:02:16.300> game<00:02:16.540> was<00:02:16.720> like<00:02:17.170> be<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.530> driver

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
their first game was like be the driver

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.710 
their first game was like be the driver
live<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.370> life<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.210> drive<00:02:19.420> or<00:02:19.630> something

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
live the life of the drive or something

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.280 
live the life of the drive or something
like<00:02:20.050> that<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:21.000> open<00:02:22.000> till<00:02:22.180> this<00:02:22.780> point<00:02:23.020> I

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
like that and open till this point I

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.560 
like that and open till this point I
haven't<00:02:23.530> really<00:02:23.740> felt<00:02:23.950> that<00:02:24.130> but<00:02:24.610> recently<00:02:25.420> on

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
haven't really felt that but recently on

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.750 
haven't really felt that but recently on
f1<00:02:25.810> 2012<00:02:26.290> been<00:02:26.440> doing<00:02:26.650> career<00:02:26.920> mode<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.490> I

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
f1 2012 been doing career mode and I

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.060 
f1 2012 been doing career mode and I
really<00:02:28.330> feel<00:02:28.660> like<00:02:28.690> actually<00:02:29.440> getting<00:02:29.800> into

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
really feel like actually getting into

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.440 
really feel like actually getting into
it<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.220> lot<00:02:30.310> more<00:02:30.550> and<00:02:30.670> I'm<00:02:30.760> getting<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.150> bit<00:02:31.300> more

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
it a lot more and I'm getting a bit more

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.330 
it a lot more and I'm getting a bit more
immersed<00:02:31.750> into<00:02:32.050> it<00:02:32.350> cuz<00:02:32.950> I'm<00:02:33.010> leading<00:02:33.250> the

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
immersed into it cuz I'm leading the

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.300 
immersed into it cuz I'm leading the
championship<00:02:33.550> and<00:02:34.470> it's<00:02:35.470> becoming<00:02:36.070> a<00:02:36.160> bit

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
championship and it's becoming a bit

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.440 
championship and it's becoming a bit
more<00:02:36.400> interesting<00:02:36.640> because<00:02:37.000> we're<00:02:37.180> coming

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
more interesting because we're coming

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.960 
more interesting because we're coming
the<00:02:37.660> round<00:02:37.870> I'm<00:02:38.110> not<00:02:38.260> as<00:02:38.380> good<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:39.760> makes

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
the round I'm not as good and it makes

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.520 
the round I'm not as good and it makes
it<00:02:40.120> taut<00:02:40.600> there's<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:40.840> bit<00:02:40.990> more<00:02:41.110> pressure<00:02:41.320> on

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
it taut there's a bit more pressure on

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.460 
it taut there's a bit more pressure on
to<00:02:41.860> perform<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.810> done<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.960> game<00:02:44.140> just<00:02:44.290> seems

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
to perform and done the game just seems

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.170 
to perform and done the game just seems
to<00:02:44.650> have<00:02:44.740> pulled<00:02:45.070> out<00:02:45.220> a<00:02:45.370> bit<00:02:45.610> more<00:02:45.640> in<00:02:46.030> the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
to have pulled out a bit more in the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.510 
to have pulled out a bit more in the
career<00:02:46.420> mode<00:02:46.570> aspect<00:02:47.080> of<00:02:47.230> 2012<00:02:47.830> which<00:02:48.280> i<00:02:48.430> think

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
career mode aspect of 2012 which i think

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.650 
career mode aspect of 2012 which i think
is<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.790> good<00:02:48.910> thing<00:02:49.120> but<00:02:49.240> there's<00:02:49.420> obviously

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
is a good thing but there's obviously

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.110 
is a good thing but there's obviously
still<00:02:49.900> things<00:02:50.170> to<00:02:50.260> improve<00:02:50.530> in<00:02:50.680> all<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:50.950> areas

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
still things to improve in all the areas

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.490 
still things to improve in all the areas
online<00:02:52.120> definitely<00:02:53.050> it's<00:02:53.140> quite<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.320> bit

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
online definitely it's quite a bit

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.930 
online definitely it's quite a bit
improvement<00:02:54.010> in<00:02:54.070> terms<00:02:54.250> of<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.490> penalty

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940

improvement in terms of the penalty
system<00:02:55.620> career<00:02:56.620> mode<00:02:56.860> still<00:02:57.220> a<00:02:57.280> little<00:02:57.490> bit

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
system career mode still a little bit

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.330 
system career mode still a little bit
dull<00:02:58.030> but<00:02:58.570> i<00:02:59.020> think<00:02:59.470> it's<00:02:59.590> improved<00:02:59.950> massively

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
dull but i think it's improved massively

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.960 
dull but i think it's improved massively
since<00:03:00.790> 2010<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:02.010> other<00:03:03.010> aspects<00:03:03.550> like<00:03:03.700> how

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
since 2010 and other aspects like how

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.520 
since 2010 and other aspects like how
the<00:03:04.030> car<00:03:04.330> reacts<00:03:04.600> to<00:03:04.810> certain<00:03:04.990> things<00:03:05.290> and

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
the car reacts to certain things and

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.070 
the car reacts to certain things and
maybe<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.250> setup<00:03:06.640> guides<00:03:07.120> is<00:03:07.510> something<00:03:07.960> that

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
maybe the setup guides is something that

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.570 
maybe the setup guides is something that
i<00:03:08.140> would<00:03:08.260> like<00:03:08.410> to<00:03:08.620> be<00:03:08.710> interested<00:03:09.190> in<00:03:09.340> because

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
i would like to be interested in because

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.310 
i would like to be interested in because
the<00:03:10.120> setups<00:03:10.540> don't<00:03:10.900> seem<00:03:11.110> to<00:03:11.230> be<00:03:11.290> too

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
the setups don't seem to be too

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.220 
the setups don't seem to be too
realistic<00:03:12.190> on<00:03:12.760> this<00:03:13.210> game<00:03:13.480> at<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:13.690> moment<00:03:14.050> but

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
realistic on this game at the moment but

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.540 
realistic on this game at the moment but
you<00:03:14.650> know<00:03:14.770> all<00:03:15.010> these<00:03:15.160> things<00:03:15.220> will<00:03:15.520> change

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
you know all these things will change

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.820 
you know all these things will change
i'm<00:03:16.030> sure<00:03:16.300> that<00:03:16.540> he<00:03:16.630> will<00:03:16.930> try<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:17.290> improve<00:03:17.680> it

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
i'm sure that he will try and improve it

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.420 
i'm sure that he will try and improve it
as<00:03:17.920> much<00:03:18.070> as<00:03:18.100> possible<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:20.040> yeah<00:03:21.040> I'm<00:03:21.190> looking

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
as much as possible and yeah I'm looking

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.410 
as much as possible and yeah I'm looking
forward<00:03:21.580> to<00:03:21.700> I<00:03:21.790> mean<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:22.000> character<00:03:22.330> more

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
forward to I mean the character more

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
forward to I mean the character more
links<00:03:22.690> should<00:03:22.750> be<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:22.900> good<00:03:23.080> thing<00:03:23.290> because

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
links should be a good thing because

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.950 
links should be a good thing because
when<00:03:24.130> you<00:03:24.280> like<00:03:24.490> get<00:03:25.030> on<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.210> podium<00:03:25.390> whatever

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
or get out the card and already what

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.180 
or get out the card and already what
they've<00:03:27.760> planned<00:03:28.090> at<00:03:28.240> the<00:03:28.330> moment<00:03:28.390> but

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
they've planned at the moment but

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.350 
they've planned at the moment but
obviously<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.400> people<00:03:30.730> around<00:03:31.060> you're<00:03:31.300> gonna

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
obviously the people around you're gonna

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.120 
obviously the people around you're gonna
look<00:03:31.540> a<00:03:31.630> lot<00:03:31.810> more<00:03:31.870> realistic<00:03:32.380> so<00:03:32.830> that's<00:03:33.040> a

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
look a lot more realistic so that's a

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.710 
look a lot more realistic so that's a
good<00:03:33.280> thing<00:03:33.340> it<00:03:33.940> makes<00:03:34.090> you<00:03:34.270> feel<00:03:34.390> like<00:03:34.450> you

competitors and yeah I liked it you know

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.490 
competitors and yeah I liked it you know
edition<00:03:43.000> of<00:03:43.120> better<00:03:43.480> character<00:03:43.959> modeling<00:03:44.320> I

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
edition of better character modeling I

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.470 
edition of better character modeling I
like<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.220> effort<00:03:45.520> they<00:03:45.730> went<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.240> try<00:03:46.390> and

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
like the effort they went to to try and

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.380 
like the effort they went to to try and
make<00:03:46.570> this<00:03:46.780> game<00:03:46.959> a<00:03:47.020> lot<00:03:47.260> better<00:03:47.440> and<00:03:48.270> you<00:03:49.270> know

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
I think we've got to appreciate how much

I think we've got to appreciate how much
effort<00:03:50.920> goes<00:03:51.400> into<00:03:51.760> these<00:03:52.180> games<00:03:52.480> I<00:03:52.660> mean<00:03:52.810> they

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
effort goes into these games I mean they

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.020 
effort goes into these games I mean they
might<00:03:53.080> not<00:03:53.230> be<00:03:53.290> what<00:03:54.250> you<00:03:54.400> want<00:03:54.610> them<00:03:54.760> to<00:03:54.790> be<00:03:54.970> at

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
might not be what you want them to be at

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.550 
might not be what you want them to be at
the<00:03:55.120> end<00:03:55.209> of<00:03:55.240> the<00:03:55.390> day<00:03:55.540> but<00:03:55.600> they've<00:03:55.990> still<00:03:56.020> put

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
a huge amount of effort into trying to
