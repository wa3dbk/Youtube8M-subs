00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.200 
know we still don't get two points so
you<00:01:30.070> know<00:01:30.159> we<00:01:30.280> respected<00:01:30.759> them<00:01:30.820> in<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.119> way

they play if anything when you get a

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.450 
they play if anything when you get a
couple<00:01:34.090> that<00:01:34.210> early<00:01:34.509> I<00:01:35.170> think<00:01:36.100> you<00:01:36.189> realize

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
couple that early I think you realize

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.620 
couple that early I think you realize
that<00:01:36.640> even<00:01:36.850> more<00:01:37.000> there's<00:01:37.210> a<00:01:37.270> lot<00:01:37.390> of<00:01:37.420> game

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
that even more there's a lot of game

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.200 
that even more there's a lot of game
left<00:01:37.659> and<00:01:38.170> what<00:01:38.289> happened<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.220> see<00:01:39.939> they<00:01:40.060> get

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
left and what happened and see they get

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.910 
left and what happened and see they get
a<00:01:40.240> power-play<00:01:40.630> goal<00:01:40.869> they're<00:01:41.289> right<00:01:41.710> back

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
a power-play goal they're right back

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.340 
a power-play goal they're right back
into<00:01:42.130> it<00:01:42.250> so<00:01:42.520> we<00:01:43.299> respected<00:01:43.780> them<00:01:43.840> and<00:01:44.140> I<00:01:44.200> don't

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
into it so we respected them and I don't

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.069 
into it so we respected them and I don't
think<00:01:44.530> we<00:01:44.619> SAT<00:01:44.829> back<00:01:45.039> but<00:01:45.990> they<00:01:46.990> just

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
think we SAT back but they just

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:48.630 
think we SAT back but they just
capitalized<00:01:47.560> on<00:01:47.590> some<00:01:47.890> chances<00:01:48.189> they<00:01:48.340> got<00:01:48.490> two

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
capitalized on some chances they got two
