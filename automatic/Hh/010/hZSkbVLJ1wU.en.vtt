00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:09.709
 nine people i'm welcome cities 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.320
 to a new video channel today for 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:14.809
 first weapons guide in battlefield 4 and 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.010
 Although the m4 16 and is just that 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.320
 This is a bit different 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.000
 that's low of meshed really thanks to 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.250
 you definitely very cool thing and 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.590
 from now on, therefore, will be in front of the weapons 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.619
 Guides now come pay for 16 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.360
 Me really with the best beginner 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.039
 weapon and indeed you get right 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.689
 early start up has to go before the 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.760
 scala unlock from then there are already 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.010
 the mt 16 I believe from 11,000 points 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.069
 with the tax data and this power 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.469
 a damage from 25 to 18 

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:45.139
 that's two to three hits in the head 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.999
 four to six in the chest and five to 

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:49.429
 seven in the legs or in 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:52.129
 The abdomen's drop off start is on 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:55.129
 Eight meters and the drop off and is at 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.920
 55 meters that is from eight meters begins 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.079
 the damage falls off and from 55 meters 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.190
 then we have the minimal damage of 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.190
 18 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.440
 the fire rate 750 browns per minute that 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.630
 is really the average value of 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.880
 storm rifles to the speed amounts 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.220
 6 meters per second and the range 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.100
 consequence of the nine meters is also in 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.750
 midfield and the capacity is 30 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.570
 plus a shot so too 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.190
 standard rifle starting value for one 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.040
 assault rifle and after loading time 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.300
 is 185 seconds if one more 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.340
 ball is in progress and if the weapon 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.190
 completely empty shot takes the 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.170
 after running 24 seconds is actually 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.030
 a very low value and is in the 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.380
 melee sometimes very handy if 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.150
 you can load so fast 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.830
 All in all, therefore, we only have the values 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.840
 we are not really bad 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.450
 Although the best value somewhere long ago 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.340
 in there but no value is somewhere in 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.430
 a negative range are only times 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.430
 so 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.600
 but now the recoil after the recoil 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.890
 above is 0.32 or left residue 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.610
 and right is like in battlefield 3 and 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.530
 although to the left 0.1 and to the right 03 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.480
 multiply that by the first shot 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.130
 is called the increased recoil if one 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:10.740
 first time on the mouse expresses so seen 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:13.110
 is multiplied to 2 2 now for 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.270
 she is like in 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.270
 Battlefield 3, and if you stop 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.920
 it does not move 0 2 that is 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.340
 relatively no matter if he's been squatting in or out 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.740
 is or is always 0 2 in motion 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.070
 The same applies , no matter if you are 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.340
 is there or is there electricity in fact 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.540
 1.0 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.430
 there would have to be a little bit on it 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.830
 pay attention if he has the mt 16 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.780
 Do not try to move if you are 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.820
 this shoots because the control is 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.190
 just 5 times as high and that wants 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.810
 yes finally no one now to the values 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.670
 from the hip if you do not move 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:50.400
 is it standing in squat 25 and in the 30 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.770
 2.0 are just about to move 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.050
 strengthens the value in each case by 0 5 that is 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:59.790
 because when you stand and move 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:02.490
 35 of a hoe 30 and in lying is 25 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.709
 a normal value does not stand out 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.870
 from the other assault rifles 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.340
 So we are right in the midfield 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.830
 can also say from these values 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.420
 we have just an average 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.770
 assault rifle which sides somewhere 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.840
 especially stand out 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.300
 but also no negative values 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.130
 now has to record and 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.750
 that took really long enough 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.000
 unlock thanks to the weapons packs 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.770
 sometimes it takes its big so far 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.959
 is a matter of luck and stop at the 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.300
 I would really aim for melee 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.190
 say that cody is the smallest 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.450
 Edge seen in the game and the point 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.400
 in the middle you can aim very well 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.930
 but as soon as you are a bit tighter 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.940
 I would even go back to that country 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.010
 cobra fall back on the cobra 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.600
 distance from my feeling still one 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.959
 a bit better to play on melee 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.760
 loving that cody and some one 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.580
 recommends now also this flair 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.920
 this is the theme of this because that's what it's all about 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.420
 is really good, so you can really 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.430
 opponents clearly recognize that 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.170
 Disadvantage that we are very much in it 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.819
 that stops 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.290
 not really well displayed 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.390
 because the thing he has copied so one 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.530
 everything around the outside is black 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.620
 person eight times visor 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.910
 you just have a really great one 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.920
 limited field of vision at the next 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.110
 seeding row we have so laser one 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.270
 tactical light two trends such as 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.280
 example and there I would actually to 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.019
 green laser grab the green laser 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.209
 there are also seen only as a 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.490
 Weapons pack has the advantage 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.919
 makes a more precise and will want 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.630
 we and does not blind so because with 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.100
 the mt 16 is not ours 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.780
 Opponents somehow in close combat to the 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.300
 students but also has one 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.610
 not so noticeable and 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.470
 the green laser has the advantage that he 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.210
 not so much notice and I have 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.620
 nevertheless the effect that I exactly that 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.450
 should be of course you can laser the 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.220
 but off it also does not think so 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.840
 always at the next occurrence row 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.450
 we have seen the run like this and there 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.070
 I would either go to the muffler 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.260
 grab because he seems almost essential 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.580
 better than in battlefield 3 has lowered 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.200
 no longer the damage just stop that 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.370
 ball speed and the ball will 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.930
 has schneider fall down 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.389
 but the effect that I do not have on the 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.490
 minimap emerge remains existing 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.740
 right now my impression is so much 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.120
 many look at the minimap and then 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.220
 a silencer can really be very 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.110
 Much brings with the green laser field one 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.870
 not so much and that has 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.610
 already its advantages then tell me 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.110
 You can calm down a bit 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.789
 the heavy run of the was to 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.370
 Performance annoyed that is the damage 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.810
 the battlefield 3 is not slow 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.490
 caught the donation run on it 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.440
 that is not the case of harm now 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.270
 remains the same, however 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.530
 of course a bit more precise I have to 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.360
 say the spill is not like that 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.640
 incredibly high so you need that 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.789
 heavy running not so unconditional 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.780
 but on really longer distances 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:37.979
 In the end, he does not harm the 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.660
 Conclusion is a bit more 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.070
 but you can still go up 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.720
 that means at a distance 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.280
 you can calm the heavy run 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.780
 but otherwise take the silencer 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.729
 I made in the area quite well 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.010
 and last in the series concerns data 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:53.100
 The handle there I was then either to 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.110
 short or potato grip we grab 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.940
 Both of them can provide the same effect 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.220
 you for that the spill in the 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.380
 continuous fire is not that high and 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.400
 sometimes you are not always like that 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.500
 bad one still has so 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.390
 For example , the wrapped handle ensures that 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.190
 that the first shot is not from 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.870
 high recoil but has just this 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.320
 less scatter in the fire I think 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.930
 as 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.250
 quite helpful because sometimes 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.570
 shoot continuous fire and then it works 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.860
 just really good if you have this 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.940
 you can grab the stock exchange 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.070
 just extend a piece again 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.570
 and that can be important 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.250
 time to get out, that's why I would 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.830
 there for short or 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.870
 Potato grip now grab that was the 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.030
 first weapons money in battlefield 4 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.980
 Unfortunately, I could not do any more now 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.180
 weapon so suggest that yes 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.960
 really long it takes up 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.390
 unlock 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.760
 you sometimes need up to 500 kills 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:41.610
 until you actually have all the essays and 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.020
 that's just why it takes a bit 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.880
 is the problem 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.260
 but otherwise if you liked it 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.330
 I'm happy about a thumbs up 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.380
 for twitter as well as facebook links 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.060
 you will find a description and man 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.360
 sees itself at the next video skin three 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.360
 People
