wanted to know about the environmental
impacts<00:00:32.920> of<00:00:33.070> GMOs<00:00:33.719> when<00:00:34.719> I<00:00:34.749> talked<00:00:35.050> to<00:00:35.170> my

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
impacts of GMOs when I talked to my

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.229 
impacts of GMOs when I talked to my
friends<00:00:35.559> about<00:00:35.589> GMOs<00:00:36.129> a<00:00:36.489> lot<00:00:37.059> of<00:00:37.149> them

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
friends about GMOs a lot of them

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.300 
friends about GMOs a lot of them
expressed<00:00:37.690> concerns

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.600 

I<00:00:42.350> think<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.650> average<00:00:43.830> consumer<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
I think that the average consumer the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.970 
I think that the average consumer the
average<00:00:44.910> moms<00:00:45.150> understanding<00:00:45.810> of<00:00:45.930> GMOs<00:00:46.620> is

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
average moms understanding of GMOs is

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.340 
average moms understanding of GMOs is
not<00:00:47.490> as<00:00:48.120> extensive<00:00:48.510> as<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:48.990> should<00:00:49.200> be

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
not as extensive as it should be

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.050 
not as extensive as it should be
although<00:00:50.130> I've<00:00:50.400> spent<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> lot<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.850> time

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
although I've spent a lot of time

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.240 
although I've spent a lot of time
researching<00:00:51.660> GMOs<00:00:52.380> because<00:00:52.650> I'm<00:00:52.920> concerned

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
researching GMOs because I'm concerned

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.520 
researching GMOs because I'm concerned
about<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.910> health<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.240> demos<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.990> and<00:00:55.200> our

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
about the health of demos and and our

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.470 
about the health of demos and and our
family<00:00:55.890> sister<00:00:56.130> choices<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.820> do<00:00:57.090> feel<00:00:57.450> that

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
family sister choices I do feel that

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.300 
family sister choices I do feel that
there's<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.870> lot<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.080> don't<00:00:58.650> know<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.070> want<00:00:59.250> to

there's a lot I don't know and want to
learn<00:00:59.520> more<00:00:59.820> about<00:00:59.880> GMOs<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.080> had<00:01:01.560> an

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
learn more about GMOs so I had an

pesticide what our farmers are telling

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.710 
pesticide what our farmers are telling
us<00:01:55.490> is<00:01:55.730> that<00:01:55.850> when<00:01:56.000> they<00:01:56.120> grow<00:01:56.390> genetically

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
us is that when they grow genetically

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.830 
us is that when they grow genetically
modified<00:01:57.410> foods<00:01:57.880> they're<00:01:58.880> able<00:01:59.060> to<00:01:59.270> use<00:01:59.420> less

into a reduction in carbon dioxide it

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.650 
into a reduction in carbon dioxide it
would<00:02:06.980> be<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.190> equivalent<00:02:07.400> of<00:02:07.700> removing<00:02:08.119> all

a lot of testing to make sure that

and growing genetically modified crops

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.710 
and growing genetically modified crops
is<00:02:54.800> that<00:02:54.950> we<00:02:55.040> see<00:02:55.190> a<00:02:55.220> very<00:02:55.610> clear<00:02:55.850> increase<00:02:56.570> in

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
is that we see a very clear increase in

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.449 
is that we see a very clear increase in
yield<00:02:56.930> particularly<00:02:57.890> in<00:02:57.980> developing

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
yield particularly in developing

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.220 
yield particularly in developing
countries<00:02:58.910> so<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.390> net<00:02:59.600> benefits<00:03:00.110> of

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
are are simply just phenomenal there are

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.550 
are are simply just phenomenal there are
a<00:03:05.970> lot<00:03:06.330> of<00:03:06.360> sources<00:03:06.660> of<00:03:06.900> information<00:03:07.140> out

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
a lot of sources of information out

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.720 
a lot of sources of information out
there<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.980> I<00:03:08.130> think<00:03:08.190> one<00:03:08.460> of<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:08.610> hardest

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
there and I think one of the hardest

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.330 
there and I think one of the hardest
thing<00:03:09.090> is<00:03:09.240> as<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.570> mother<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:10.230> consumer<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.190> a

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
thing is as a mother a consumer and a

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.490 
thing is as a mother a consumer and a
farmer<00:03:11.670> is<00:03:11.820> is<00:03:12.060> finding<00:03:12.570> out<00:03:12.810> what's<00:03:13.050> credible

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
farmer is is finding out what's credible

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.590 
farmer is is finding out what's credible
information<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:14.550> know<00:03:14.640> being<00:03:14.910> able<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.180> talk

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600

to<00:03:15.630> Cecilia<00:03:16.470> today<00:03:16.710> who<00:03:16.920> is<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.430> scientist<00:03:18.060> and

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
to Cecilia today who is a scientist and

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.390 
to Cecilia today who is a scientist and
researcher<00:03:18.800> going<00:03:19.800> directly<00:03:20.100> to<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.310> source

researcher going directly to the source

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.850 
researcher going directly to the source
is<00:03:20.990> fantastic<00:03:21.990> and<00:03:22.110> I<00:03:22.200> think<00:03:22.230> if<00:03:22.500> more<00:03:22.530> people

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
is fantastic and I think if more people

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.010 
is fantastic and I think if more people
have<00:03:23.700> that<00:03:23.820> opportunity<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.510> think<00:03:24.810> they<00:03:24.900> would

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
have that opportunity I think they would

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.230 
have that opportunity I think they would
have<00:03:25.050> a<00:03:25.170> better<00:03:25.380> understanding<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.340> think<00:03:27.060> that

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
have a better understanding I think that

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.270 
have a better understanding I think that
there<00:03:27.450> are<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:28.260> really<00:03:28.590> need<00:03:28.740> to<00:03:28.830> scrutinize

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280
