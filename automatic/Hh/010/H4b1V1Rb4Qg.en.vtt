you not to wrap too tightly you want to

use moderate pressure because if you

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.520 
use moderate pressure because if you
wrap<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.000> residual<00:01:30.570> too<00:01:30.780> tightly<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.350> will

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
wrap the residual too tightly it will

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.920 
wrap the residual too tightly it will
elongate<00:01:31.979> your<00:01:32.520> residual<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.659> will<00:01:33.750> end

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
elongate your residual and it will end

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.200 
elongate your residual and it will end
in<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.170> socket<00:01:34.530> being<00:01:34.740> too<00:01:35.040> long<00:01:35.280> when<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
in the socket being too long when the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.780 
in the socket being too long when the
patient<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.720> now<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.229> seated<00:01:37.560> position<00:01:37.790> you

patient is now in a seated position you

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.030 
patient is now in a seated position you
can<00:01:38.939> begin<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.390> apply<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.810> wet<00:01:40.020> plaster<00:01:40.259> what

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
can begin to apply the wet plaster what

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.710 
can begin to apply the wet plaster what
I<00:01:41.070> recommend<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.670> have<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.060> patient<00:01:42.390> scoot

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
I recommend is have the patient scoot

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.330 
I recommend is have the patient scoot
their<00:01:42.899> rear<00:01:43.079> end<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.590> edge<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.070> chair

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
their rear end to the edge of the chair

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.950 
their rear end to the edge of the chair
and<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.700> way<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.909> can<00:01:45.119> take<00:01:45.329> your<00:01:45.479> plaster

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
and that way you can take your plaster

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.080 
and that way you can take your plaster
your<00:01:46.079> first<00:01:46.320> phase<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.950> plaster<00:01:47.369> all<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
your first phase of the plaster all the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.090 
your first phase of the plaster all the
way<00:01:48.180> up<00:01:48.360> into<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:49.110> patient's<00:01:49.470> perineum

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
way up into the patient's perineum

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.590 
way up into the patient's perineum
then<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.399> can<00:01:50.520> bring<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.880> your<00:01:50.909> your<00:01:51.329> brim

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
then you can bring in your your brim

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.600 
then you can bring in your your brim
second<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.350> get<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.070> patient<00:01:53.430> into<00:01:53.520> a

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
second to that get the patient into a

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.990 
second to that get the patient into a
standing<00:01:54.060> position<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:55.610> you'll<00:01:56.610> bring

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
standing position and you'll bring

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.819 
standing position and you'll bring
around<00:01:57.180> your<00:01:57.509> brim<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.079> what<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.500> want<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.740> do

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
needed to add a splint to make sure we

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.620 
needed to add a splint to make sure we
capture<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.340> patients<00:03:05.700> issue<00:03:05.880> really<00:03:06.270> well
