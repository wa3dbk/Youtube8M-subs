00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.419
 we have the first half of things well under control although he found it too 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.910
 by the the third tactical intervention that the applied with do who runs there 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.480
 to exercise a little longer from the left 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.630
 but by what options were available for the show down under over te 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.770
 go and find the interaction that I found pretty good because you 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.559
 then back in the week of competition seems therefore and via the left side the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.530
 fell the intention 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.150
 and I think that learners themselves have not created very many opportunities, but that 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.840
 the owner selcuk has absolutely no and 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.900
 today a deserved zero in the lead into the break at that moment 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.780
 you 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.379
 the second half onto the field and within 15 minutes 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.100
 probably two nights it happened 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.299
 yes i don't know who knows 

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:59.740
 we also knew that and if very strong with the woman was quite powerful 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.260
 and they proved that again today 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.400
 it still wrong 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.290
 yes people went anyway 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.300
 I know why that is Lee 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.600
 The reason are the tennis players stand they all get behind 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.520
 and a few more rows are very strong and after that it was up to us to get around 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.590
 make as few violations as possible 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.230
 but yes you have become aware that it is not always possible and must be done at that time 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.120
 you 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.880
 when there is a free kick 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.250
 yeah incredibly sharp because you know what because they are just there 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.160
 to be good at it and no, we just think there is a huge mistake in this 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.250
 I yes if you have a claim against goals that way 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.630
 that should not happen but what do you expect from a little better 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.390
 difficult to say with what 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.170
 just the om i'm not that person who dancers from a hole in the air 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.240
 it is grou the match with a 2 in 2 year too 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.689
 and then I knew the back of the car had to go on and on 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.710
 had to press 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.350
 and then had good hope that the citizen is a trap and that succeeds nice than brand 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.229
 you have to make a decisive decision on the last with the trees the last time 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.090
 a few more are shooting inside 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.419
 the cantus who oh well you have to decide but pay 

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:12.329
 people who headed in the 3 2 we can be satisfied we now have everything 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:15.909
 win and then hope for pink edge but you have to keep winning 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.339
 that is the same this summer of 2009
