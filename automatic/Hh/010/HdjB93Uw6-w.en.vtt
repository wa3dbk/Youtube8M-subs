00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
statistics now we get into something

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.960 
statistics now we get into something
good<00:03:08.330> because<00:03:09.330> you<00:03:10.170> can't<00:03:10.500> you<00:03:11.370> can't<00:03:11.640> really

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
good because you can't you can't really

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.900 
good because you can't you can't really
see<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:13.560> don't<00:03:14.250> think<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.490> can<00:03:14.580> actually<00:03:14.730> see

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910

your<00:03:15.270> achievements<00:03:15.950> I<00:03:16.950> mean<00:03:17.850> I<00:03:18.060> think<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:19.230> can

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
your achievements I mean I think you can

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.740 
your achievements I mean I think you can
in<00:03:19.560> single<00:03:19.950> player<00:03:19.980> but<00:03:20.370> every<00:03:21.120> time<00:03:21.300> I<00:03:21.360> update

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
in single player but every time I update

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.770 
in single player but every time I update
my<00:03:21.780> game<00:03:22.190> I<00:03:23.190> get<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.240> achievement<00:03:24.300> again

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
my game I get the achievement again

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.400 
my game I get the achievement again
again<00:03:25.080> again<00:03:25.230> so<00:03:25.650> it'd<00:03:26.310> be<00:03:26.370> good<00:03:26.490> if<00:03:26.880> they

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
again again so it'd be good if they

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.050 
again again so it'd be good if they
didn't<00:03:28.410> do<00:03:28.530> that<00:03:28.710> it<00:03:29.340> maybe<00:03:31.130> they<00:03:32.130> they<00:03:32.730> had<00:03:32.940> it

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
didn't do that it maybe they they had it

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.490 
didn't do that it maybe they they had it
so<00:03:33.240> once<00:03:33.510> you've<00:03:33.660> unlocked<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.140> like<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.290> neck

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
so once you've unlocked it like a neck

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.400 
so once you've unlocked it like a neck
like<00:03:34.620> an<00:03:34.740> Xbox<00:03:34.980> if<00:03:35.640> you<00:03:36.510> update<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:37.020> version<00:03:37.140> I

it would be quite hard every time you
maybe<00:06:01.730> change<00:06:01.820> your<00:06:02.210> username<00:06:02.330> or<00:06:02.750> maybe

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
maybe change your username or maybe

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.010 
maybe change your username or maybe
maybe<00:06:04.370> you<00:06:04.580> can<00:06:04.910> only<00:06:05.030> change<00:06:05.270> it<00:06:05.450> like<00:06:05.600> twice

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
maybe you can only change it like twice

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.580 
maybe you can only change it like twice
a<00:06:06.230> year<00:06:06.260> or<00:06:07.130> once<00:06:07.580> a<00:06:07.760> year<00:06:07.940> so<00:06:08.600> then<00:06:08.810> it<00:06:09.320> doesn't

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
a year or once a year so then it doesn't

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.470 
a year or once a year so then it doesn't
have<00:06:09.770> to<00:06:09.890> be<00:06:09.919> updated<00:06:10.430> so<00:06:10.669> many<00:06:10.850> times<00:06:11.120> a<00:06:11.240> year

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:11.480 
have to be updated so many times a year

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.550 
have to be updated so many times a year
because<00:06:12.140> like<00:06:12.800> on<00:06:12.980> xbox<00:06:13.750> I<00:06:14.750> don't<00:06:15.169> think<00:06:15.230> you

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
because like on xbox I don't think you

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.450 
because like on xbox I don't think you
use<00:06:15.800> black<00:06:16.040> and<00:06:16.220> white<00:06:16.340> lists<00:06:17.140> so<00:06:18.250> yeah<00:06:19.250> or

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
use black and white lists so yeah or

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.330 
use black and white lists so yeah or
maybe<00:06:19.669> have<00:06:20.000> I<00:06:20.330> do<00:06:20.990> actually<00:06:21.440> I<00:06:21.770> do<00:06:21.860> have<00:06:22.040> an

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
maybe have I do actually I do have an

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.830 
maybe have I do actually I do have an
idea<00:06:22.669> how<00:06:22.880> they<00:06:23.060> could<00:06:23.210> do<00:06:23.360> that<00:06:23.510> they<00:06:23.690> can

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
idea how they could do that they can

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.760 
idea how they could do that they can
maybe<00:06:23.990> have<00:06:24.370> account<00:06:25.370> IDs<00:06:26.200> so<00:06:27.200> maybe<00:06:27.500> have

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
maybe have account IDs so maybe have

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.190 
maybe have account IDs so maybe have
like<00:06:27.950> a<00:06:28.010> number<00:06:28.460> to<00:06:28.970> each<00:06:29.000> account<00:06:29.540> so<00:06:29.990> then

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.200 
like a number to each account so then

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.620 
like a number to each account so then
instead<00:06:30.890> of<00:06:30.950> having<00:06:31.250> the<00:06:31.669> actual<00:06:31.910> user<00:06:32.360> name

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
instead of having the actual user name

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.070 
instead of having the actual user name
you<00:06:33.110> can<00:06:33.260> have<00:06:33.380> your<00:06:33.530> cat<00:06:33.890> your<00:06:34.070> accountant<00:06:34.580> ID

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 
you can have your cat your accountant ID

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.690 
you can have your cat your accountant ID
so<00:06:36.080> then<00:06:36.260> you<00:06:36.380> can<00:06:36.560> have<00:06:36.740> you<00:06:37.039> can<00:06:37.070> black<00:06:37.490> or

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:37.700 
so then you can have you can black or

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.700 
so then you can have you can black or
white<00:06:37.880> this<00:06:38.090> the<00:06:38.270> account<00:06:38.539> ID<00:06:38.720> and<00:06:39.169> then

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:39.710 
white this the account ID and then

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.680 
white this the account ID and then
every<00:06:39.860> time<00:06:40.040> you<00:06:40.190> change<00:06:40.400> the<00:06:40.640> username<00:06:41.090> the

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:41.690 
every time you change the username the

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.750 
every time you change the username the
username<00:06:42.140> wouldn't<00:06:42.440> wouldn't<00:06:42.920> you<00:06:43.370> know<00:06:43.490> Matt

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:43.760 
username wouldn't wouldn't you know Matt

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.300 
username wouldn't wouldn't you know Matt
add<00:06:43.880> to<00:06:44.030> it<00:06:44.150> so<00:06:44.840> the<00:06:44.930> ID<00:06:45.350> would<00:06:45.830> stay<00:06:45.980> the<00:06:46.130> same

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310 
add to it so the ID would stay the same

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.340 
add to it so the ID would stay the same
but<00:06:46.370> the<00:06:46.580> username<00:06:46.970> would<00:06:47.090> change<00:06:47.360> now<00:06:48.020> to<00:06:48.080> me

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.350 
but the username would change now to me

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.280 
but the username would change now to me
that<00:06:48.530> sounds<00:06:48.770> like<00:06:48.800> a<00:06:48.890> good<00:06:49.010> idea<00:06:49.100> um<00:06:50.020> so<00:06:51.020> yeah

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.290 
that sounds like a good idea um so yeah
