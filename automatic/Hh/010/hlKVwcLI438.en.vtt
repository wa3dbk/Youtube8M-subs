other than sort one you need to go
through<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.100> make<00:01:41.189> sure<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.610> those

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
through and make sure you have those

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.300 
through and make sure you have those
unchecked<00:01:42.299> on<00:01:42.540> every<00:01:43.020> part<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.950> i<00:01:43.979> got<00:01:44.280> my

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
unchecked on every part so i got my

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.490 
unchecked on every part so i got my
focus<00:01:44.790> one<00:01:45.000> target<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.110> target<00:01:47.070> target<00:01:47.640> ok<00:01:48.509> so

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
focus one target and target target ok so

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.830 
focus one target and target target ok so
that's<00:01:49.680> those<00:01:50.310> are<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.549> first<00:01:50.670> two<00:01:50.850> important

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
that's those are the first two important

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.230 
that's those are the first two important
steps<00:01:51.899> i<00:01:52.320> guess<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.590> could<00:01:52.740> say<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.240> then

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
steps i guess you could say and then

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.760 
steps i guess you could say and then
after<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:55.460> under<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.700> general<00:01:57.180> settings

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
after that under the general settings

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.350 
after that under the general settings
once<00:01:58.770> again<00:01:58.979> i<00:01:59.159> have<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.759> only<00:02:00.030> other<00:02:00.180> change

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
once again i have the only other change

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.870 
once again i have the only other change
of<00:02:00.570> me<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.259> if<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.950> look<00:02:02.189> at<00:02:02.369> my<00:02:02.610> frame

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
of me to this is if you look at my frame

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.999 
of me to this is if you look at my frame
you<00:02:03.780> see<00:02:03.930> how<00:02:04.140> i<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.439> timer<00:02:04.649> counting

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
you see how i have the timer counting

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.219 
you see how i have the timer counting
down<00:02:05.070> my<00:02:05.490> tiger<00:02:06.000> palm<00:02:06.270> buff<00:02:06.689> if<00:02:07.409> i<00:02:08.000> do<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.390> no

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
timer if I leave that unchecked it's got

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.370 
timer if I leave that unchecked it's got
this<00:02:14.340> black<00:02:14.610> box<00:02:14.790> around<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.300> with<00:02:15.870> me<00:02:16.200> it's

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
the general settings part then in the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.780 
the general settings part then in the
frame<00:02:27.930> layout<00:02:28.170> once<00:02:28.590> again<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:28.980> can<00:02:29.130> do<00:02:29.370> focus

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
frame layout once again you can do focus

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.960 
frame layout once again you can do focus
target<00:02:30.599> target<00:02:31.319> target<00:02:31.349> before<00:02:32.010> debuff<00:02:32.610> so

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
it all the way max i three you then

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.390 
it all the way max i three you then
would<00:03:06.870> have<00:03:07.049> to<00:03:07.140> go<00:03:07.260> in<00:03:07.349> here<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.560> then<00:03:07.980> put<00:03:08.310> it

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
would have to go in here and then put it

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.640 
would have to go in here and then put it
even<00:03:08.730> more<00:03:08.940> in<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.299> normal<00:03:09.690> scale<00:03:09.989> part<00:03:10.349> so

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
even more in the normal scale part so

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.870 
even more in the normal scale part so
that's<00:03:10.890> where<00:03:11.130> it<00:03:11.190> could<00:03:11.310> be<00:03:11.430> that's<00:03:11.700> the

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
that's where it could be that's the

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.000 
that's where it could be that's the
biggest<00:03:12.060> here<00:03:12.269> we<00:03:12.330> go<00:03:12.480> now<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:13.319> don't<00:03:13.470> need<00:03:13.739> it

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
biggest here we go now I don't need it

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.620 
biggest here we go now I don't need it

and bring it down back two three three

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.660 
and bring it down back two three three
in<00:03:18.359> one<00:03:18.630> okay<00:03:19.140> so<00:03:20.100> let's<00:03:20.220> get<00:03:20.310> back<00:03:20.459> in<00:03:20.579> the

in one okay so let's get back in the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.900 
in one okay so let's get back in the
frame<00:03:20.989> layout<00:03:21.989> so<00:03:22.530> that's<00:03:22.950> all<00:03:23.430> I<00:03:23.459> did<00:03:23.670> with

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
frame layout so that's all I did with

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.990
