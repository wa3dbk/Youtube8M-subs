00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.139
 dental implants are a good alternative for the replacement of 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.899
 missing or missing teeth 

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:18.220
 as well as to support this rehabilitation is fixed by mobile 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:23.169
 in general we can talk about them as artificial roots 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.650
 Most dental implants are composed of pure titanium 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.020
 Titanium is a biocompatible material 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.640
 according to bone and physically and chemically in a process called post 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.760
 integration 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.819
 that makes it an ideal material 

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:41.350
 for use in medicine 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.350
 for example in traumatology 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.330
 before placing an implant we must know the shape and dimensions of the bone 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
 in which said implant will lodge 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.200
 it is important to have sufficient height and width 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.500
 we usually have to perform a radiological test similar to a tac that 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.870
 gives us accurate information about the available course allowing us to choose 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.190
 the exact size of the implant that we need 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.650
 if enough business to house the implant a regeneration surgery 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.650
 Bone could solve some cases 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.539
 Once the right implant is chosen, we proceed to its placement 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.930
 is done in the clinic under local anesthesia in a similar way to other 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.630
 dental treatments 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.430
 finished the process we placed a healing plug on the implant 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.130
 this plug is maintained during the time of this international that can 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.890
 vary from three to six months depending on the case and the location of the implant 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.150
 during that period the bone grows intimately around the implant 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.430
 providing a good stability capable of supporting the generated loads 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.410
 during chewing 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.640
 finished the time of this international we went to the phase 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.810
 practice 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.230
 to be realistic in several plants 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.920
 prints are taken for the mold making that allows us to make the 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.400
 protest to their measure and also several tests and adjustments are made before the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.400
 final placement 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:22.109
 in situations where several teeth have been lost, rehabilitation is 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:26.369
 can do with bridges supported by implants the process is the same as in the 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:27.279
 last case 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:30.849
 except that the bridge also replaces the intermediate teeth 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.790
 in this way with only two implants we can replace three teeth 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.569
 when the aesthetic requirement is very important and provided that the conditions 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.069
 of bone allow provisional teeth can be placed immediately 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.169
 after the insertion of implants said provisionals only has one 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:57.039
 aesthetic function so neither can nor should be used for chewing 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:01.669
 since an excessive load during the integration of the implant could 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:04.229
 alter that process 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:08.189
 once the time of this international is over, the prosthesis will be placed 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.189
 definitive 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.529
 in patients they see themselves the implants can be of great help 

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:34.759
 in many occasions with only two implants you can get a good 

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:38.179
 retention of the prosthesis 

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:42.679
 The retention elements used can be of various types depending on 

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:46.809
 the requirements of each case and offering greater with less retention in 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:47.859
 function of your design
