 the merry crowd for everyone 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.920
 I'm making this video on the 25th of 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.800
 December to show some things 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:19.050
 new ones I did myself and others 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:22.330
 christmas campaigns not only many things 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.460
 in boredom and I made this video promises 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.400
 also that I would stay longer 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:31.330
 making the videos and at the end of the video 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.780
 There is something new that I hope you 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.249
 really like 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.339
 Come on then, the first things I 

00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:43.030

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:46.179
 robert's letter that letter that part 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.089
 of the letter comes in the book the magic of cinema 

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:53.769

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.499
 with the name 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:20.470
 very cool I found a website in it 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:26.140
 site that taught you how to do this 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:28.750
 the platform 9 3/4 because this blue is the 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.630

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:36.420
 tava finding this here only thought these 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.420

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:58.149

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.369

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:57.540
 this one my cousin collection one 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:01.560
 shopping and this was the detailed navy 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.010
 where there is much variable that comes from a 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.790
 shopping that has nothing to do with 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:38.600
 and this one is really good. 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:42.870

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.380
