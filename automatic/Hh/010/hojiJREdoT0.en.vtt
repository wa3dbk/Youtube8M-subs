to be long-lasting but we want to look
like<00:02:41.340> we<00:02:41.489> don't<00:02:41.579> have<00:02:41.819> all<00:02:41.849> that<00:02:42.030> coverage<00:02:42.540> on

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
like we don't have all that coverage on

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.059 
like we don't have all that coverage on
so<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.079> get<00:02:43.260> coverage<00:02:43.470> without<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.799> coverage

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
so you get coverage without the coverage

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.740 
so you get coverage without the coverage
this<00:02:44.189> is<00:02:44.340> really<00:02:44.549> a<00:02:44.790> genius<00:02:45.060> thing<00:02:45.390> definitely

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
this is really a genius thing definitely

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.059 
this is really a genius thing definitely
and<00:02:46.140> then<00:02:46.230> we'll<00:02:46.409> think<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.709> it<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:46.950> now<00:02:46.980> a

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
and then we'll think of it and now a

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.280 
and then we'll think of it and now a
belated<00:02:47.609> happy<00:02:47.970> birthday<00:02:48.359> to<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.510> because
