which<00:04:26.419> is<00:04:26.570> pretty<00:04:26.780> cool<00:04:27.020> but<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:28.160> daytime<00:04:28.520> you

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
which is pretty cool but the daytime you

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.400 
which is pretty cool but the daytime you
can<00:04:28.729> see<00:04:28.850> that<00:04:29.000> color<00:04:29.150> is<00:04:29.300> better<00:04:29.419> and<00:04:29.990> I<00:04:30.080> hate

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
I just hate how even with far render

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.560 
I just hate how even with far render
distance<00:04:33.830> you<00:04:34.580> can't<00:04:34.850> see<00:04:35.120> all<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.390> way

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
distance you can't see all the way

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.870 
distance you can't see all the way

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
see from across have you sent beset the

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.320 
see from across have you sent beset the
render<00:04:42.050> distance<00:04:42.229> far<00:04:42.979> enough<00:04:43.160> and<00:04:43.669> that's

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
render distance far enough and that's

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.880 
render distance far enough and that's
because<00:04:44.900> I'm<00:04:45.050> see<00:04:45.229> edit<00:04:45.380> render<00:04:45.770> distance

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
because I'm see edit render distance

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.890 
because I'm see edit render distance
gonna<00:04:46.310> be<00:04:46.370> good<00:04:46.550> can<00:04:46.880> go<00:04:47.000> like<00:04:47.180> super<00:04:47.450> far<00:04:47.690> but

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
annoying and tricky to do because all

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.620 
annoying and tricky to do because all
these<00:05:41.300> intersecting<00:05:42.460> stories<00:05:43.630> difficult

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
these intersecting stories difficult

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.850 
these intersecting stories difficult
positions<00:05:46.690> especially<00:05:47.690> the<00:05:47.960> basement<00:05:48.440> really

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
positions especially the basement really

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.840 
positions especially the basement really
hard<00:05:49.010> to<00:05:49.100> do<00:05:49.250> the<00:05:49.580> window<00:05:49.940> like<00:05:50.120> that<00:05:51.580> but<00:05:52.580> yeah

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
hard to do the window like that but yeah

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.580 
hard to do the window like that but yeah
I<00:05:52.880> had<00:05:53.150> to<00:05:53.240> put<00:05:53.390> the<00:05:53.479> kitchen<00:05:53.630> in<00:05:53.900> there<00:05:54.080> Ed's

I had to put the kitchen in there Ed's
house<00:05:54.860> that<00:05:55.100> way

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
house that way

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.230 
house that way
and<00:05:56.479> here's<00:05:56.690> the<00:05:56.780> little<00:05:57.130> mini<00:05:58.130> forest<00:05:58.550> for

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
and here's the little mini forest for

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.570 
and here's the little mini forest for
the<00:05:59.330> forest<00:05:59.750> over<00:06:00.260> there<00:06:00.500> and<00:06:01.130> that's<00:06:01.310> how<00:06:01.460> the

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
the forest over there and that's how the

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.180 
the forest over there and that's how the
cul-de-sac<00:06:02.120> I'm<00:06:02.330> gonna<00:06:03.290> just<00:06:03.560> make<00:06:03.740> a<00:06:03.800> block

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
cul-de-sac I'm gonna just make a block

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.570 
cul-de-sac I'm gonna just make a block
of<00:06:04.370> like<00:06:04.550> I<00:06:04.850> don't<00:06:04.940> know<00:06:05.090> like<00:06:05.500> 24<00:06:06.500> by<00:06:06.650> 24<00:06:06.710> of

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
of like I don't know like 24 by 24 of

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.570 
of like I don't know like 24 by 24 of
what<00:06:08.210> I<00:06:08.240> think<00:06:08.540> is<00:06:08.630> a<00:06:08.660> good<00:06:08.840> forest<00:06:09.590> schematic

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
what I think is a good forest schematic

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.760 
what I think is a good forest schematic
kind<00:06:11.300> of<00:06:11.419> thing<00:06:11.600> and<00:06:11.840> MC<00:06:12.110> at<00:06:12.260> it<00:06:12.410> and<00:06:12.530> then<00:06:12.620> I'll

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
kind of thing and MC at it and then I'll

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.980 
kind of thing and MC at it and then I'll
just<00:06:13.070> copy<00:06:13.430> and<00:06:13.640> paste<00:06:13.850> that<00:06:13.940> to<00:06:14.810> make<00:06:14.960> it

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
just copy and paste that to make it

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.870 
just copy and paste that to make it
massive<00:06:15.800> forest<00:06:16.100> on<00:06:16.370> the<00:06:16.430> side<00:06:16.700> of<00:06:16.820> the

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
massive forest on the side of the

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.270 
massive forest on the side of the
neighborhood<00:06:17.210> because<00:06:17.479> I<00:06:17.570> know<00:06:17.630> it's<00:06:17.840> there

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
neighborhood because I know it's there

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.500 
neighborhood because I know it's there
that's<00:06:19.280> another<00:06:19.550> neighborhood's<00:06:20.060> gonna<00:06:20.300> have

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.510 
that's another neighborhood's gonna have

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.300 
that's another neighborhood's gonna have
the<00:06:20.690> playground<00:06:21.229> and<00:06:21.560> then<00:06:21.860> passed<00:06:22.160> the
