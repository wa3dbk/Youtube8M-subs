00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Good day to all with you again 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.680
 the kitchen to cook another 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.830
 another tasty preparation for the winter and 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.509
 today we will cook with you and part 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.540
 with courgettes in a slow cooker 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.710
 as you guessed that maybe our 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.039
 dishes of course will 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.990
 pepper tomatoes but we'll add 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.779
 add a little change to our dish 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.699
 zucchini here are so young straight from the tin 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.010
 and only two 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.439
 Here is such a wonderful sort of tenderness 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.530
 because it is very tasty zucchini and in 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.870
 they are almost no blue of course in 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.420
 supplement we need no bow 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.250
 big clove of garlic carrot here you are 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.379
 you see that I have a rather small 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.969
 just the groove lay with the fridges with 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.230
 moment thinning but in principle us 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.840
 will need 2 3 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.289
 not very big carrots of course 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.379
 spices this black pepper is ground 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.170
 salt allspice bay pepper 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.449
 Sheet can be add course food and 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.120
 hot chili can take advantage 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.799
 sweet paprika and so on of course 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.350
 we will need a small amount 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.780
 vegetable oils and table 9 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.810
 concert wsus also well we put a little 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.770
 sugar well, that's basically all we need 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.320
 our task will be useful now with you 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.840
 cut all the vegetables and lay in 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.420
 crock-pot besides tomato since we 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.119
 put them a little bit later now we 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.400
 you grind zucchini can be cleaned 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.890
 the skin can not be cleaned the same on your 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.140
 choice of course because the course is green 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.990
 tones will give a certain color to ours 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.780
 dish and to avoid yet changing 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.170
 color I think that the whole point we clean 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.210
 chop pepper onions and carrots all 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.070
 it captures the bowl of the multicooker but 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.399
 Of course 3 tablespoons 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.950
 vegetable oil you pour there on 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.740
 laid all the vegetables except tomatoes 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:02.360
 multicooker and turn it on mode 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:05.530
 I turn on the fire for half an hour and 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.590
 close and bye 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.380
 30 minutes we wait until our vegetables 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.690
 put out the juice and teach us 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.940
 tomatoes will have passed 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.959
 put 30 minutes let's see 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.730
 what's happening 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.360
 neatly open so as not to 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:28.270
 burn please look vegetables 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:31.630
 Of course the village was given a juice like this 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.390
 way and now is the time to add to 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.280
 our lie and tomatoes here look 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.860
 please we just got here 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.459
 fairly large tomatoes and want 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.010
 clarify if you like more liquid 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.350
 treat and there is a sense of course they even 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.030
 profile grind directly 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.390
 to get more juice 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.940
 but I like more when we are more dense 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.700
 and put it this way useful 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.300
 tomatoes 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.090
 clarify that tomatoes are somewhere around 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.459
 600 grams 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.390
 close our multicooker and gives 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.280
 stewing our urine before it ends 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.010
 cooking our dishes left 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.200
 literally 15 minutes is the right time 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.680

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.650

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.470

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.209
 if you want to fluid was 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.709
