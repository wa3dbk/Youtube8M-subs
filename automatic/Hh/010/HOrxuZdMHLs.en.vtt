00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
Champions League games and it has there

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.999 
Champions League games and it has there
been<00:01:42.600> any<00:01:42.810> kind<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.020> setback<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.619> think<00:01:43.860> there's

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
been any kind of setback I think there's

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.830 
been any kind of setback I think there's
a<00:01:44.070> feeling<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.520> possibly<00:01:44.850> he<00:01:45.540> would<00:01:45.720> have

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
a feeling that possibly he would have

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.100 
a feeling that possibly he would have
been<00:01:45.930> ready<00:01:46.170> before<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.680> end<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.979> sea<00:01:48.110> no

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
been ready before the end of the sea no

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.550 
been ready before the end of the sea no
I<00:01:49.829> think<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.369> know<00:01:50.820> we<00:01:51.030> always<00:01:51.270> try<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.810> get

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
I think you know we always try to get

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.880 
I think you know we always try to get
them<00:01:52.770> back<00:01:53.070> as<00:01:53.280> soon<00:01:53.700> as<00:01:53.850> possible<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.890> and

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
them back as soon as possible and and

what<00:03:55.190> would<00:03:55.280> you<00:03:55.430> consider<00:03:55.670> to<00:03:56.090> be<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.510> season

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
what would you consider to be the season

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.140 
what would you consider to be the season
would<00:03:57.470> you<00:03:57.560> consider<00:03:57.830> to<00:03:58.010> be<00:03:58.130> a<00:03:58.160> success<00:03:58.940> or<00:03:59.090> a

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
would you consider to be a success or a

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.690 
would you consider to be a success or a
failure<00:03:59.350> you<00:04:00.350> know<00:04:00.620> you<00:04:00.680> want<00:04:00.980> you<00:04:01.190> want<00:04:01.400> a

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
failure you know you want you want a

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.920 
failure you know you want you want a
trophy<00:04:02.380> well<00:04:03.380> I<00:04:03.410> think<00:04:03.820> if<00:04:04.820> if<00:04:05.450> we<00:04:05.630> manage<00:04:05.780> to

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
trophy well I think if if we manage to

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.980 
trophy well I think if if we manage to
win<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.530> big<00:04:07.370> final<00:04:07.640> then<00:04:08.090> then<00:04:08.390> it's

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
win the big final then then it's

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.830 
win the big final then then it's
probably<00:04:09.410> going<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:09.710> build<00:04:09.890> on<00:04:10.070> that<00:04:10.100> and

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
probably going to build on that and

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.890 
probably going to build on that and
history<00:04:11.840> this<00:04:12.320> club<00:04:12.620> and<00:04:12.890> they<00:04:13.040> will<00:04:13.720> make<00:04:14.720> up

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
history this club and they will make up

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.289 
history this club and they will make up
for<00:04:14.930> all<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:15.230> ups<00:04:16.100> and<00:04:16.430> downs<00:04:16.520> that<00:04:17.060> we<00:04:17.180> had

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
for all the ups and downs that we had

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.289 
for all the ups and downs that we had
this<00:04:17.450> season<00:04:17.840> and<00:04:18.049> we're<00:04:18.410> qualified<00:04:19.030> as<00:04:20.030> for

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
this season and we're qualified as for

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.180 
this season and we're qualified as for
next<00:04:20.510> season<00:04:20.780> as<00:04:20.870> well<00:04:21.049> for<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.530> competition

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
next season as well for the competition

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.670 
next season as well for the competition
so<00:04:22.700> I<00:04:23.030> think<00:04:23.840> there<00:04:24.110> will<00:04:24.230> be<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:24.500> best

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
so I think there will be the best

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.550 
so I think there will be the best
outcome<00:04:25.070> and<00:04:25.550> every<00:04:25.790> day<00:04:26.050> if<00:04:27.050> you<00:04:27.170> don't<00:04:27.350> then

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
outcome and every day if you don't then

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.520 
outcome and every day if you don't then
they<00:04:27.770> need<00:04:28.190> to<00:04:28.370> reassess<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:29.810> situation<00:04:29.840> I

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
they need to reassess the situation I

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.710 
they need to reassess the situation I
guess
