 We will not even use a brush to 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.789
 paint boxes and see how cool this 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.380
 There's paper and pen in hand. 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.019

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.880

 We're using it here to do this. 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.970
 technique inks that 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.790

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.870
 cover of this ink people is three times 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.270
 bigger than the powder paint give to do 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.700

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:15.010
 Oh I'm going to hit olive green and green 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:19.190
 pistachio and then you hit the box 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.709
 gives the impression that the box has texture but 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.360
 in reality when it's dry it's going to be a crack 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.600
 with hair dryer we go to 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.720
 hand is not one has no texture is 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.890
 only the plastic effect makes here I passed 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.780
 the dark I passed 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.090
 Look how the balls will be highlighted now 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.920
 So when you hit white, you see. 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.080

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.940
 here and back from all my box 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.709
 after I know who it is with the 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.810

 is brought forward for you see 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.130
 now I 'll do it, I'll choose the paper 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.040
 of decoupage that I think combines 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.050
 with my piece so I brought two 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.190
 themes to 1 with sunflower I think this 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.010
 pink flower 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.820
 I'll choose if there's a 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.820
 scissors and will cut without secrets 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.800
 look I clipped the role we will 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.410
 pass on the back of the paper the white glue 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.340
 tvi and now we will use the 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.830
 brush're spread with the brush always 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.180
 Good thing you use when doing crafts in 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.950
 up the clothes 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.180
 We'll see if this happened from here. 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.860
 I'll have it cut 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.509
 for you to see what we can 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.250
 do it for people spreads cola 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:32.479
 It's with a foam roll we take the 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:37.000
 excess 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:41.410
 Okay, we'll go and get the little box here. 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.410
 and let's put the paper 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:49.409
 you set straight was a ball of 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:51.110
 artha, and you're going to get that one. 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.669
 sheet that at the time I went to cut 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.889
 ripped and I'll put it here will not 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.449

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.300

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.319
 is all the tips well glued 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.469
 anything 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:07.740
 Yes, it's very true, Glue. 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:10.050
 I'll wash the brush or pick it up with the 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.629
 Chinese to come here for you could 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:16.379
 until you see the effect 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:17.639
 This one I passed the plate in the 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:20.009
 cover 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:23.009
 Look how bright it is to show that I 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:25.229
 I was seeing the video's brightness and 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:27.300
 I do not grow old, that's right. 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:29.879
 for you to see this difference 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.580
 look at the effect that the Chinese lacquer of the piece 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:35.069
 so now I'm going to hell with this one 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.979
 for you to see as an organism like me 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:40.919
 I do to apply this product is now 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:45.539
 How simple you are going to dump in the play. 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:47.940
 and will spread with the brush okay because I 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:52.620
 I want a layer that a layer above 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:54.659
 I'm generous, I'm not going to do anything 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.969
 this all over the box 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:59.490
 look how beautiful this picture and give to 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:01.800
 you see in it the effect of lacquer 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.210
 Chinese now has no way of saying no 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.029
 can paint a small box because 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.400
 paint endless sky easier than that 

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:10.139
 Impossible, in fact, I hope you 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.969
 We liked the interval well. 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:14.960
 I'm soon back soon 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:17.680
 with more easy art 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.070
 think 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.070
 not
