just correct me in the comments
but<00:00:16.340> anyway<00:00:17.340> it's<00:00:17.460> went<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:17.730> bought<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.880> mighty

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
but anyway it's went and bought a mighty

but anyway it's went and bought a mighty
back<00:00:18.420> used<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:20.160> vacuum<00:00:20.910> out<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.240> pressure

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
back used it to vacuum out the pressure

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.240 
back used it to vacuum out the pressure
which<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:21.960> has<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.140> gauge<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.740> tells<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.100> how

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
which it has a gauge that tells you how

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.000 
which it has a gauge that tells you how
much<00:00:23.430> pressure<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.689> are<00:00:24.869> building<00:00:25.109> up<00:00:25.439> to

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
much pressure you are building up to

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.099 
much pressure you are building up to
create<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:26.939> vacuum<00:00:27.180> which<00:00:27.810> just<00:00:27.990> says

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
create that vacuum which just says

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.560 
create that vacuum which just says
together<00:00:28.380> like<00:00:28.590> two<00:00:29.330> 15<00:00:30.859> you<00:00:31.859> know<00:00:32.300> 15<00:00:33.300> mart

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
together like two 15 you know 15 mart

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.600 
together like two 15 you know 15 mart
don't<00:00:33.899> ever<00:00:34.050> go<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.230> 20<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.250> little<00:00:35.520> bit

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
don't ever go to 20 it's a little bit

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.600 
don't ever go to 20 it's a little bit
too<00:00:35.730> much<00:00:35.820> pressure<00:00:36.739> anyway<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:37.800> been<00:00:38.370> using

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
too much pressure anyway so been using

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.270 
too much pressure anyway so been using
that<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.910> music<00:00:39.239> for<00:00:39.390> multiple<00:00:39.780> things<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.320> i

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
that you music for multiple things and i

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.970 
that you music for multiple things and i
found<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.000> be<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.180> little<00:00:42.360> bit<00:00:42.480> slower

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
found it to be a little bit slower

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.990 
found it to be a little bit slower
especially<00:00:43.980> if<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.460> want<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.670> bleed<00:00:44.850> your

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
whole brake system and just fill it up

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.670 
whole brake system and just fill it up
with<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.820> know<00:00:47.940> new<00:00:48.270> fluid<00:00:48.629> but<00:00:49.289> all<00:00:49.500> those

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
i guess over the years people just

i guess over the years people just
borrowed<00:01:51.540> them<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.750> never<00:01:51.869> brought<00:01:52.049> them

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
borrowed them and never brought them

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.590 
borrowed them and never brought them
back<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:53.579> know<00:01:53.640> about<00:01:53.850> four<00:01:54.149> bucks<00:01:54.390> for

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
have fun with it here in a little bit

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.070

and I'll show you the bleeder I've

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.190 
and I'll show you the bleeder I've
already<00:02:40.350> got<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.530> ready<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.460> roll<00:02:45.200> that's

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
already got it ready to roll that's

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.390 
already got it ready to roll that's
right<00:02:46.410> here<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:48.980> this<00:02:49.980> is<00:02:50.130> pretty<00:02:50.280> much

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
right here so this is pretty much

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.640 
right here so this is pretty much
creating<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:50.970> vacuum<00:02:51.210> and<00:02:51.660> sucking<00:02:52.560> it

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
creating a vacuum and sucking it

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.020 
creating a vacuum and sucking it
wherever<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.310> know<00:02:53.400> when<00:02:53.550> you<00:02:53.610> put<00:02:53.760> on<00:02:53.850> the

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
wherever you know when you put on the

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.360 
wherever you know when you put on the
nipple<00:02:54.330> on<00:02:54.390> your<00:02:54.510> caliper<00:02:54.960> to<00:02:55.190> release<00:02:56.190> the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
nipple on your caliper to release the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.740 
nipple on your caliper to release the
brake<00:02:56.580> fluid

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
brake fluid

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.490 
brake fluid
you<00:02:58.080> know<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.380> course<00:02:58.550> stick<00:02:59.550> this<00:02:59.700> on<00:02:59.910> there

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
you know of course stick this on there

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.620 
you know of course stick this on there
don't<00:03:01.500> crack<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.130> hose<00:03:02.310> until<00:03:02.880> you<00:03:03.750> know<00:03:03.870> you

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
don't crack the hose until you know you

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.720 
don't crack the hose until you know you
get<00:03:06.630> ready<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.960> start<00:03:07.170> sucking<00:03:07.560> out<00:03:07.710> so<00:03:07.920> you

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
get ready to start sucking out so you

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.670 
get ready to start sucking out so you
want<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.030> create<00:03:09.210> a<00:03:09.300> vacuum<00:03:09.600> and<00:03:10.110> then<00:03:10.380> let<00:03:10.590> it

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
want to create a vacuum and then let it

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.880 
want to create a vacuum and then let it
suck<00:03:10.950> out<00:03:12.170> hopefully<00:03:13.170> that<00:03:13.530> will<00:03:13.620> do<00:03:13.770> it

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
suck out hopefully that will do it

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.710 
suck out hopefully that will do it
pretty<00:03:14.040> quick<00:03:14.370> they<00:03:14.910> say<00:03:15.150> it's<00:03:15.300> a<00:03:15.360> lot<00:03:15.510> easier

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
pretty quick they say it's a lot easier

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.140 
pretty quick they say it's a lot easier
to<00:03:15.900> use<00:03:16.170> which<00:03:17.070> it<00:03:17.220> kind<00:03:17.400> of<00:03:17.460> contradicts<00:03:18.000> what

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
to use which it kind of contradicts what

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.610 
to use which it kind of contradicts what
I've<00:03:18.240> been<00:03:18.360> learning<00:03:18.570> which<00:03:18.960> is<00:03:18.990> you<00:03:19.440> don't

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
I've been learning which is you don't

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.020 
I've been learning which is you don't
want<00:03:19.800> to<00:03:19.860> crack<00:03:20.100> it<00:03:20.130> until<00:03:20.520> you<00:03:20.610> build<00:03:20.730> up<00:03:20.910> the

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
want to crack it until you build up the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.120 
want to crack it until you build up the
pressure<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.540> suck<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:21.900> out<00:03:22.020> but<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:22.800> creates

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
pressure to suck it out but that creates

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.220 
pressure to suck it out but that creates
a<00:03:23.250> constant<00:03:23.850> that<00:03:24.420> creates<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.900> constant

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
a constant that creates a constant

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.840 
a constant that creates a constant
vacuum<00:03:25.740> which<00:03:25.890> will<00:03:26.070> continuously<00:03:26.580> keep

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
vacuum which will continuously keep

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.000 
vacuum which will continuously keep
pulling<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.240> out<00:03:27.420> you<00:03:28.110> don't<00:03:28.320> need<00:03:28.470> two<00:03:28.680> people

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
pulling it out you don't need two people

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.500 
pulling it out you don't need two people
to<00:03:29.160> do<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.430> it's<00:03:29.550> just<00:03:29.610> a<00:03:29.820> one-man<00:03:30.180> job

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
to do it it's just a one-man job

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.740 
to do it it's just a one-man job
so<00:03:30.990> it<00:03:31.680> shouldn't<00:03:31.890> be<00:03:31.980> too<00:03:32.040> bad<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.430> do<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:33.510> of

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
so it shouldn't be too bad to do and of

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.520 
so it shouldn't be too bad to do and of
course<00:03:33.990> these<00:03:34.200> here<00:03:34.700> are<00:03:35.700> for<00:03:36.240> the<00:03:36.290> top<00:03:37.290> of
