00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.830
 Most men like to work with things, tools, objects 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.170
 fix things that's what we like to do and have seen that when a 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.460
 man is in front of his blue house garage working with tools all 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.090
 neighborhood residents are attracted as a unit to the 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.859
 men leave their homes walking like zombies 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.059
 Hahahaha men yesterday a drill and it stays like dogs 

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:27.109
 hunting 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.550
 nothing 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.930
 right away the curtain runs a little and they say that I think that whoever is 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.590
 working on something 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.310
 I kill you they go running to the house of the neighbor that they do not pretend to help him not 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.000
 they just want to be close 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.270
 of the area where the work is carried out in Navarre is 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.200
 that's what we like to do to men to hide that kind of clipping 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.270
 in the fair of goals silly questions like 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.610
 a percents star screwdriver jajajajajajajajajajajaja 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.710
 It has also been a sense of solidarity. You see Canada because in the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.470
 works have to put those wooden fences around so that men do not 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.979
 they approach the area but the holes so we can look out inverted 6% 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.160
 that's what those holes did, sure we'll take out the fence 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.300
 we would do with steel beams 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.480
 min 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.480
 has remained to be 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.880
 support for 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.560
 as a man I do not know how to break up with another man understand me the career is not 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.790
 stop 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.790
 I need to go out with other saba men 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.979
 it is impossible for me to do nothing I have to wait for that man to be able 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.979
 It is also the only way to end our relationship 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.420
 but maybe I have to wait a long time to see the best of men is that 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.220
 we can create a friendship 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.620
 practically without any basis 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.400
 men become friends simply because they are two men / arc is the only thing 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.550
 that we need to have an echo 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.280
 Sports sports and women are our only subjects 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.610
 if there were no sports and women men or we would not say hey 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.839
 that yesterday the fridge to nadal 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:12.339
 Panama 

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:15.879
 you know you'll come to the conclusion that we all have some friends and 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.819
 our feet will always be friends of jora accept it 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.579
 we continue with them even if we do not want to call them they call them 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:28.629
 we do not return or calls that they insist gaga the only way to chat 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.949
 with people with whom we have nothing in common is to act as in a 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:36.359
 interview for television before my case I imagine that I have a table in front and 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:38.049
 a chair there next 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.109
 and interviewed them 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.059
 the problem is that you can not say pay 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:44.749
 It has been a pleasure to have you here 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:47.749
 but time is over 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.539
 min 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:59.539
 by last 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.719
 so much 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:12.129
