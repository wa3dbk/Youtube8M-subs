00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
stitches like this and then finally I

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.440 
stitches like this and then finally I
just<00:01:46.829> joined<00:01:47.369> them<00:01:47.549> up<00:01:47.700> by<00:01:47.909> using<00:01:48.149> one

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
just joined them up by using one

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.300 
just joined them up by using one
straight<00:01:48.840> stitch<00:01:49.170> if<00:01:49.530> you're<00:01:49.860> having<00:01:50.009> trouble

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
looks like as you can see my stitches

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.229 
looks like as you can see my stitches
are<00:02:55.080> quite<00:02:55.410> visible<00:02:55.980> on<00:02:56.190> this<00:02:56.519> one<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:57.000> that's

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
are quite visible on this one and that's

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.000 
are quite visible on this one and that's
because<00:02:57.720> I'm<00:02:57.930> using<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.319> thread<00:02:58.530> color<00:02:58.799> that

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
because I'm using a thread color that

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.670 
because I'm using a thread color that
doesn't<00:02:59.310> quite<00:02:59.640> match<00:02:59.880> my<00:03:00.150> felt<00:03:00.450> but<00:03:01.410> if<00:03:01.560> you

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
doesn't quite match my felt but if you

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.990 
doesn't quite match my felt but if you
do<00:03:01.830> want<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.160> eliminate<00:03:02.370> those<00:03:02.760> stitches

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
do want to eliminate those stitches

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.640 
do want to eliminate those stitches
altogether<00:03:03.599> then<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:03.900> can<00:03:04.049> use<00:03:04.200> fabric<00:03:04.620> glue

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
altogether then you can use fabric glue

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.339 
altogether then you can use fabric glue
and<00:03:05.069> it<00:03:05.190> works<00:03:05.370> just<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.730> same<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:06.989> now<00:03:07.110> once

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
and it works just the same so now once

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:08.870 
and it works just the same so now once
you've<00:03:07.530> done<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:07.890> I'm<00:03:08.130> going<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.489> take<00:03:08.670> my

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880

completed my first full week at
university<00:03:47.940> so<00:03:48.150> that's<00:03:48.930> why<00:03:49.079> I<00:03:49.109> didn't<00:03:49.410> have<00:03:49.530> a

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.750 
university so that's why I didn't have a
lot<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.739> time<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:50.220> make<00:03:50.370> something<00:03:50.549> more
