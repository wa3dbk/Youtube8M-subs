as I was asked to talk about has defined
enlightenment<00:00:14.510> in<00:00:14.660> such<00:00:15.020> a<00:00:15.049> very<00:00:16.010> very

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
enlightenment in such a very very

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.910 
enlightenment in such a very very
individualistic<00:00:18.170> tiny<00:00:20.290> way<00:00:21.290> that<00:00:21.710> really

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
individualistic tiny way that really

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.200 
individualistic tiny way that really
offered<00:00:22.820> little<00:00:23.240> gift<00:00:23.630> to<00:00:23.900> the<00:00:24.020> world<00:00:24.199> I<00:00:25.210> don't

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
offered little gift to the world I don't

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.390 
offered little gift to the world I don't
know<00:00:26.270> all<00:00:26.480> the<00:00:26.840> historical<00:00:27.590> reasons<00:00:28.010> for<00:00:28.220> that

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
know all the historical reasons for that

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.890 
know all the historical reasons for that
my<00:00:29.270> guess<00:00:29.660> is<00:00:29.960> and<00:00:30.199> that's<00:00:30.350> all<00:00:30.619> I<00:00:30.710> can<00:00:30.949> say<00:00:31.900> is

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
my guess is and that's all I can say is

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.299 
my guess is and that's all I can say is
that<00:00:33.199> both<00:00:33.440> both<00:00:33.980> in<00:00:34.190> Eastern<00:00:34.670> Orthodoxy<00:00:35.600> and

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
that both both in Eastern Orthodoxy and

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.360 
that both both in Eastern Orthodoxy and
in<00:00:37.309> Roman<00:00:38.000> Catholicism<00:00:38.710> we<00:00:39.710> align<00:00:40.129> ourselves

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
in Roman Catholicism we align ourselves

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.210 
in Roman Catholicism we align ourselves
with<00:00:40.909> Empire<00:00:41.629> and<00:00:42.309> and<00:00:43.309> once<00:00:44.300> you<00:00:44.750> align<00:00:45.440> the

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
with Empire and and once you align the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.789 
with Empire and and once you align the
message<00:00:46.699> of<00:00:46.850> a<00:00:46.940> spiritual<00:00:47.420> teacher<00:00:47.799> with

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:48.799 
message of a spiritual teacher with

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:51.399 
message of a spiritual teacher with
Imperial<00:00:49.519> thinking<00:00:50.150> there's<00:00:50.870> a<00:00:51.019> whole<00:00:51.199> bunch

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.409 
Imperial thinking there's a whole bunch

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:54.030 
Imperial thinking there's a whole bunch
of<00:00:51.530> questions<00:00:52.040> you<00:00:52.159> can't<00:00:52.430> ask<00:00:52.640> anymore<00:00:53.360> and

be conformed into one world view you

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:29.230 
be conformed into one world view you
really<00:01:27.469> are<00:01:27.619> threatened<00:01:28.189> by<00:01:28.280> any<00:01:28.579> notion<00:01:29.090> of

of inner freedom or inner awareness or
consciousness<00:01:33.369> you<00:01:34.369> you<00:01:34.670> would<00:01:34.820> rather<00:01:35.090> to<00:01:35.750> be

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
consciousness you you would rather to be

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.620 
consciousness you you would rather to be
perfectly<00:01:36.320> honest<00:01:36.859> have<00:01:37.280> people<00:01:37.759> unconscious

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
perfectly honest have people unconscious

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.340 
perfectly honest have people unconscious
and<00:01:39.200> so<00:01:39.979> you<00:01:40.039> settle<00:01:40.609> for<00:01:40.909> belonging<00:01:41.450> systems

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
and so you settle for belonging systems

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.830 
and so you settle for belonging systems
and<00:01:42.740> we<00:01:43.399> look<00:01:43.579> at<00:01:43.700> most<00:01:43.909> of<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:44.240> wars<00:01:44.479> of

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
and we look at most of the wars of

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.489 
and we look at most of the wars of
Europe<00:01:45.710> and<00:01:46.310> Christian<00:01:47.060> nations<00:01:47.509> and<00:01:48.020> they've

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:48.499 
Europe and Christian nations and they've

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:51.010 
Europe and Christian nations and they've
all<00:01:48.710> been<00:01:49.039> between<00:01:49.700> groups<00:01:50.569> that<00:01:50.810> both

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
all been between groups that both

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.649 
all been between groups that both
consider<00:01:51.560> themselves<00:01:51.770> Christian<00:01:52.670> but<00:01:53.509> you

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
consider themselves Christian but you

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.260 
consider themselves Christian but you

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
can see that the the Christianity was

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.929 
can see that the the Christianity was
identified<00:01:57.049> if<00:01:57.380> at<00:01:57.560> all<00:01:57.710> with<00:01:58.640> their
