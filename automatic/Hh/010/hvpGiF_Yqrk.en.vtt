okay um let's say look in here this is
the<00:00:07.770> icon<00:00:08.340> for<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.610> puzzle<00:00:08.970> bobble<00:00:09.120> 3d<00:00:09.540> I'm

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
the icon for a puzzle bobble 3d I'm

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:10.730 
the icon for a puzzle bobble 3d I'm
going<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:09.900> turn<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.110> 3d<00:00:10.349> off<00:00:10.469> because<00:00:10.710> I

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
going to turn the 3d off because I

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.640 
going to turn the 3d off because I
realized<00:00:11.010> that<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.160> bond<00:00:11.630> and<00:00:12.630> we're<00:00:13.290> hopping

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
realized that I bond and we're hopping

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.990 
realized that I bond and we're hopping
in<00:00:16.940> so<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.359> kind<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.660> loads<00:00:19.050> pretty<00:00:19.320> quickly

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
in so it kind of loads pretty quickly

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.259 
in so it kind of loads pretty quickly
well<00:00:21.000> usually<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.869> there<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.269> standard

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269

Robert F is wondering is it easy to get
fingerprints<00:00:54.539> I'm<00:00:54.989> trying<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.620> out<00:00:55.680> right<00:00:55.890> now

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
fingerprints I'm trying it out right now

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.130 
fingerprints I'm trying it out right now
on<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.340> outside<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> system<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.719> maybe

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
on the outside of the system and maybe

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.349 
on the outside of the system and maybe
my<00:00:58.379> hands<00:00:58.800> are<00:00:58.890> not<00:00:59.070> as<00:00:59.309> greasy<00:00:59.670> as<00:00:59.850> they

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
my hands are not as greasy as they

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.740 
my hands are not as greasy as they
normally<00:01:00.539> are<00:01:00.840> today<00:01:01.520> but<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:02.750> surprisingly

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
normally are today but it's surprisingly

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.570 
normally are today but it's surprisingly
fingerprint<00:01:04.409> resistant<00:01:04.920> on<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.100> outside<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
fingerprint resistant on the outside the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.399 
fingerprint resistant on the outside the
case<00:01:05.790> well<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.270> would<00:01:06.510> point<00:01:06.780> out<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.170> do

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
case well I would point out that you do

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.080 
case well I would point out that you do
have<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.830> are<00:01:07.890> using<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.369> blue<00:01:08.580> one<00:01:08.790> which

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
have you are using the blue one which

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.420 
have you are using the blue one which
that's<00:01:09.659> true<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.350> blue<00:01:10.530> one<00:01:10.710> probably<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.400> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
that's true the blue one probably is a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.640 
that's true the blue one probably is a
little<00:01:11.760> bit<00:01:11.880> more<00:01:12.000> resistant<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.229> even<00:01:13.530> on

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
little bit more resistant and even on

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.590 
little bit more resistant and even on
the<00:01:13.799> inside<00:01:14.189> here<00:01:14.640> I'm<00:01:14.790> like<00:01:14.970> touching<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
the inside here I'm like touching the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.899 
the inside here I'm like touching the
top<00:01:16.259> screen<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.860> I'm<00:01:16.950> not<00:01:17.130> really<00:01:17.340> leaving<00:01:17.670> a

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
top screen and I'm not really leaving a

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.749 
top screen and I'm not really leaving a
whole<00:01:18.060> lot<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.240> finger<00:01:18.450> prints<00:01:19.040> so<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.460> mean

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
whole lot of finger prints so I mean

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.340 
whole lot of finger prints so I mean
yeah<00:01:20.939> compared<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.450> something<00:01:21.659> like<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.290> don't

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
yeah compared to something like I don't

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.230 
yeah compared to something like I don't
know<00:01:22.560> my<00:01:22.770> iphone<00:01:23.250> sitting<00:01:23.759> over<00:01:23.939> there<00:01:23.970> is

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
know my iphone sitting over there is

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.670 
know my iphone sitting over there is
quite<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> fingerprint<00:01:25.049> magnet<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.500> this

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
quite a fingerprint magnet and this

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.560 
quite a fingerprint magnet and this
thing<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.009> pretty<00:01:26.580> resistant<00:01:27.119> although<00:01:27.360> that

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
thing is pretty resistant although that

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.910 
thing is pretty resistant although that
might<00:01:27.720> be<00:01:27.869> different<00:01:28.049> for<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.409> black<00:01:28.680> one

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
might be different for the black one

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.390 
might be different for the black one
that<00:01:29.189> those<00:01:29.670> tend<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.030> be<00:01:30.119> more<00:01:30.439> well<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:32.159> did

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
that those tend to be more well you did

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.280 
that those tend to be more well you did
get<00:01:32.729> your<00:01:32.850> filthy<00:01:33.060> human<00:01:33.390> hands<00:01:33.659> on<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.930> and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
get your filthy human hands on this and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.050 
get your filthy human hands on this and
there<00:01:34.680> were<00:01:34.799> some<00:01:35.009> issues<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.579> think<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.850> little

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
there were some issues I think a little

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.069 
there were some issues I think a little
early<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:37.070> so<00:01:38.070> hey<00:01:38.369> for<00:01:39.360> those<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.780> love

little shifted you're playing in kind of

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.899 
little shifted you're playing in kind of
a<00:01:51.869> cylinder<00:01:53.240> and<00:01:54.920> you<00:01:55.920> know<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.399> actions<00:01:56.759> all

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
a cylinder and you know the actions all

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.370 
a cylinder and you know the actions all
up<00:01:57.060> top<00:01:57.270> they<00:01:57.540> don't<00:01:57.689> really<00:01:57.750> bother<00:01:58.049> much

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
up top they don't really bother much

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.069 
up top they don't really bother much
with<00:01:59.000> any<00:02:00.000> touch<00:02:00.210> functionality<00:02:00.689> at<00:02:00.960> all
