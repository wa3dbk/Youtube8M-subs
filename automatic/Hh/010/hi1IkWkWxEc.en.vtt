00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.050
 based on cold colors like blue and 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.050
 silver 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.520
 to begin we're going to start 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.290
 applying us a base for shadows this 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.220
 It serves to last us longer 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.220
 our shadow 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.600
 and we are going to place a silver shadow 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.130
 with our applicator remember that you 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.930

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.150
 we place the shadow all over the eyelid 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.860
 mobile phone remembers that you should not be left 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.670
 spaces without coloring and remember 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.670

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.600
 strong blue on the outside of 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.600
 our mobile eyelid 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.059
 Now I'm going to take a blue color more 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.859
 clear as a blue water color and now 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.080

 to take a shadow let's color a 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.020
 line being the natural way of our 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.580
 eyelid that will help us to give 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.080
 depth to our look and with 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.330

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.020

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.280

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.600
 part of the mobile eyelid that does not have 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.600

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.040
 corrector well we blur the concealer 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.349
