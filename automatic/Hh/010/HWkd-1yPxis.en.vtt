00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 very good to all guys and girls of 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.319
 youtube I'm waiting and I are 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.820
 video to teach how to clean the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.260
 reader of the playstation3 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.450
 in my case be the model of the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.040
 playstation 3 slim but this serves to 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.480
 the precision 3 the face the super slim or 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.160
 any type of model does not matter 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.630
 gigabytes or nothing the only thing 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.980
 we need is to have a cable 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.539
 current with a power supply 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.390
 from which you come original cable of the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.200
 console and precision three without hdmi vga 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.850
 if nothing connected 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.860
 we take out the game that we have inside the 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.770
 reader so as not to damage the game or anything in 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:36.250
 my person of 24 and we're going to leave it and 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:39.070
 now we turn off the console good the trick 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.170
 it's very simple is to take stable from the 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.120
 power supply and the moment that what 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.309
 we get to have the button pulse when 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.840
 we remove the cde connect the cable and 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.920
 wait for the fans to jump 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.920
 we have to put the console 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.769
 the console we remove the cable from the source 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.800
 feed as you can see let's 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.170
 put a better time 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.970
 and we have pressed the button that is 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.970
 the one to get you out 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.920
 and now good do not worry about the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.900
 noise you 're not successful while the console 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.210
 nothing takes 30 seconds nothing 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.190
 it will go out alone and as you can see good 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.930
 because this steam that is pulling is all 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.940
 the shit he has inside the reader in 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.680
 the console inside everything that usually 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.740
 be the dust that usually enters inside 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.659
 the console of dirt and everything but 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.700
 because as you can see the console has already been 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.770
 paid practically now we 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.479
 stage we will lend to us 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.070
 as flashing lights 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.380
 this wants the console is 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.509
 perfectly clean now we take out the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.179
 power supply cable what 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.899
 we reconnect and as you can see 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:53.610
 our console already works 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.070
 we have perfectly complemented by 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.610
 sorry completely clean and it works 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.440
 perfectly 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.600

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.210
