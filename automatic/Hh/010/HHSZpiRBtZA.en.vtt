is<00:00:04.759> it<00:00:05.759> your<00:00:06.120> assertion<00:00:06.960> that<00:00:06.990> there<00:00:07.319> is

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
is it your assertion that there is

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.480 
is it your assertion that there is
something<00:00:07.859> physically<00:00:08.700> different<00:00:09.469> between

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
something physically different between

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.009 
something physically different between
say<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.519> dolphin<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.269> human<00:00:12.540> being<00:00:12.599> or<00:00:12.990> a

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
say a dolphin and a human being or a

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.420 
say a dolphin and a human being or a
hominid<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.679> human<00:00:13.980> being<00:00:14.839> say<00:00:15.839> some<00:00:16.470> gene

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
hominid and a human being say some gene

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.820 
hominid and a human being say some gene
in<00:00:17.699> our<00:00:17.789> genome<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.570> if<00:00:18.960> we<00:00:19.410> couldn't<00:00:19.680> knock

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
in our genome that if we couldn't knock

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.400 
in our genome that if we couldn't knock
it<00:00:20.010> out<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.400> human<00:00:20.850> would<00:00:21.119> lose<00:00:21.330> his<00:00:21.600> soul<00:00:21.810> yeah

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
it out a human would lose his soul yeah

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.540 
it out a human would lose his soul yeah
that's<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.160> great<00:00:23.340> question<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:25.369> with<00:00:26.369> respect

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
that's a great question and with respect

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.279 
that's a great question and with respect
to<00:00:26.820> our<00:00:26.970> model<00:00:27.390> from<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.689> biblical<00:00:27.930> perspective

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
to our model from a biblical perspective

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.620 
to our model from a biblical perspective
we<00:00:29.160> would<00:00:29.519> view<00:00:29.670> human<00:00:29.849> beings<00:00:30.269> as<00:00:30.449> both

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
we would view human beings as both

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.459 
we would view human beings as both
physical<00:00:31.230> entities<00:00:31.980> as<00:00:32.219> we're<00:00:32.430> as<00:00:32.790> well<00:00:33.030> as

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
physical entities as we're as well as

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.940 
physical entities as we're as well as
spiritual<00:00:34.469> entities<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:36.210> spiritual

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
spiritual entities and the spiritual

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.860 
spiritual entities and the spiritual
aspect<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.100> our<00:00:38.219> nature<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.670> think<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:39.239> some

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
aspect of our nature I think in some

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.560 
aspect of our nature I think in some
respects<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.620> perhaps<00:00:41.610> beyond<00:00:42.059> direct

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
respects is perhaps beyond direct

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.410 
respects is perhaps beyond direct
scientific<00:00:42.950> observation<00:00:43.950> but<00:00:44.879> what<00:00:45.059> we<00:00:45.149> can

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
scientific observation but what we can

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.720 
scientific observation but what we can
do<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.750> indirectly<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.410> think<00:00:46.739> test<00:00:47.039> for<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
do is indirectly I think test for the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.540 
do is indirectly I think test for the
existence<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.980> what<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.070> would<00:00:50.160> call<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
existence of what we would call the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.369 
existence of what we would call the
image<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:51.000> God<00:00:51.180> or<00:00:51.420> what<00:00:51.539> scripture<00:00:51.989> calls<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
image of God or what scripture calls the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.549 
image of God or what scripture calls the
image<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.739> God<00:00:53.059> the<00:00:54.059> Bible<00:00:54.390> teaches<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:55.050> it's

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
image of God the Bible teaches that it's

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.220 
image of God the Bible teaches that it's
only<00:00:55.739> human<00:00:55.980> humanity<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.120> bears<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.989> image

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
only human humanity that bears the image

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.639 
only human humanity that bears the image
of<00:00:58.379> God<00:00:58.559> now<00:00:59.520> the<00:01:00.449> Bible<00:01:00.780> doesn't<00:01:00.809> define<00:01:01.379> what

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
of God now the Bible doesn't define what

of God now the Bible doesn't define what
the<00:01:01.739> image<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.129> God<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.910> just<00:01:03.090> simply<00:01:03.210> makes

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
the image of God is it just simply makes

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.500 
the image of God is it just simply makes
that<00:01:03.960> statement<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.850> over<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.000> centuries

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
that statement and over the centuries

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.719 
that statement and over the centuries
theologians<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.710> debated<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.520> discussed

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
theologians have debated and discussed

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.510 
theologians have debated and discussed
what<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.570> image<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.960> God<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.280> what<00:01:11.400> we

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
what the image of God is and so what we

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.010 
what the image of God is and so what we
do<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.000> book<00:01:12.150> who<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.390> Adam<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.930> we

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
do in the book who is Adam is we

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.560 
do in the book who is Adam is we
actually<00:01:13.200> address<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.280> think<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
actually address that I think the the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.530 
actually address that I think the the
brunt<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.680> your<00:01:16.740> question<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.549> we<00:01:18.119> say<00:01:18.330> well

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
brunt of your question and we say well

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.899 
brunt of your question and we say well
if<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.140> look<00:01:19.320> at<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> consensus<00:01:20.280> as<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.610> what

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
if you look at the consensus as to what

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.969 
if you look at the consensus as to what
the<00:01:21.030> image<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.420> God<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.020> consists<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.560> in

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the image of God is it consists of in

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.670 
the image of God is it consists of in
effect<00:01:23.670> four<00:01:23.939> components<00:01:24.630> there's<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.320> an

effect four components there's a an
intellectual<00:01:26.280> component<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.000> man's

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
intellectual component so man's

here<00:01:58.110> on<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.259> fourth<00:01:58.530> one<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:58.979> anyway<00:01:59.250> the

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
here on the fourth one but anyway the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.120 
here on the fourth one but anyway the
idea<00:02:00.180> here<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:00.899> there<00:02:01.200> have<00:02:01.770> been<00:02:01.890> four

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
idea here is that there have been four

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.490 
idea here is that there have been four
components<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.729> have<00:02:02.850> been<00:02:02.880> identified<00:02:03.500> now

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
components that have been identified now

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.319 
components that have been identified now
some<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.799> those<00:02:04.950> components<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.759> think<00:02:06.210> are

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
some of those components I think are

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.719 
some of those components I think are
beyond<00:02:06.630> probing<00:02:07.290> scientifically<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.250> think

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
beyond probing scientifically I think

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.050 
beyond probing scientifically I think
other<00:02:08.910> components<00:02:09.569> actually<00:02:10.110> can<00:02:10.319> be<00:02:10.500> probed

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
other components actually can be probed

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.250 
other components actually can be probed
scientifically<00:02:12.110> particularly<00:02:13.110> the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
scientifically particularly the

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.820 
scientifically particularly the
intellectual

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
intellectual

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.830 
intellectual
component<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.330> relational

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
component and the the relational

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.600 
component and the the relational
component<00:02:16.380> with<00:02:16.470> respect<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.010> how<00:02:17.160> humans

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
component with respect to how humans

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.630 
component with respect to how humans
relate<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:18.120> each<00:02:18.240> other<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.950> relate<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.160> to

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
relate to each other and relate to to

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.550 
relate to each other and relate to to
God<00:02:20.820> that<00:02:21.090> would<00:02:21.240> be<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.420> religious<00:02:22.080> expression

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
God that would be a religious expression

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.620 
God that would be a religious expression
and<00:02:23.100> so<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.730> archaeological<00:02:24.480> record

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
and so the archaeological record

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.310 
and so the archaeological record
provides<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.950> documentation<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:27.320> technical

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
provides a documentation of technical

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.960 
provides a documentation of technical
inventiveness<00:02:28.740> musical<00:02:29.430> expression

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.540

artistic expression religious expression

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.330 
artistic expression religious expression
social<00:02:33.270> structure<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:34.740> you<00:02:34.800> could<00:02:35.130> argue

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
social structure and so you could argue

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.730 
social structure and so you could argue
that<00:02:35.790> if<00:02:36.150> human<00:02:36.480> beings<00:02:36.810> are<00:02:37.110> made<00:02:37.470> in<00:02:37.650> the

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
that if human beings are made in the

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.110 
that if human beings are made in the
image<00:02:37.830> of<00:02:38.070> God<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.550> there<00:02:38.730> are<00:02:38.820> certain

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
image of God that there are certain

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.510 
image of God that there are certain
behaviors<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.870> would<00:02:40.080> manifest<00:02:40.430> from<00:02:41.430> the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
behaviors that would manifest from the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.200 
behaviors that would manifest from the
image<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.880> God<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.270> would<00:02:42.390> we<00:02:42.570> that<00:02:43.140> would<00:02:43.230> be

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
image of God that would we that would be

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.640 
image of God that would we that would be
left<00:02:45.210> behind<00:02:45.420> those<00:02:45.810> artifacts<00:02:46.320> and<00:02:46.560> the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
left behind those artifacts and the

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.020 
left behind those artifacts and the
archaeological<00:02:47.010> record<00:02:47.550> so<00:02:47.910> the

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
archaeological record so the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.640 
archaeological record so the
archaeological<00:02:48.720> record<00:02:48.840> becomes<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.470> way<00:02:49.590> to

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
archaeological record becomes a way to

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.570 
archaeological record becomes a way to
probe<00:02:50.010> if<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.970> will<00:02:51.150> for<00:02:51.510> when<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:53.190> image<00:02:53.459> of

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
probe if you will for when the image of

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.520 
probe if you will for when the image of
God<00:02:53.730> would<00:02:53.970> appear<00:02:54.060> who<00:02:54.630> would<00:02:54.990> in<00:02:55.230> principle

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
God would appear who would in principle

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.370 
God would appear who would in principle
possess<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.459> that<00:02:56.790> characteristic<00:02:57.450> so<00:02:58.200> it's

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
possess that that characteristic so it's

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.520 
possess that that characteristic so it's
an<00:02:58.500> indirect<00:02:58.980> way<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.250> probe<00:03:00.150> for<00:03:00.540> for

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
an indirect way to probe for for

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.380 
an indirect way to probe for for
something<00:03:01.860> that<00:03:01.980> perhaps<00:03:02.370> is<00:03:02.580> not<00:03:02.610> physically

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
something that perhaps is not physically

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.220 
something that perhaps is not physically
detectable<00:03:04.020> but<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.890> know<00:03:05.040> as<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:06.450> chemist<00:03:06.990> you

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
know I'm not sure that you can actually

directly observe an electron I'll at

directly observe an electron I'll at

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
directly observe it but what you can do

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.259 
directly observe it but what you can do
is<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.600> can<00:03:15.780> have<00:03:16.650> extreme<00:03:17.550> confidence<00:03:18.150> that

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
is you can have extreme confidence that

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.030 
is you can have extreme confidence that
it<00:03:18.390> exists<00:03:18.870> because<00:03:19.200> of<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.410> effects<00:03:19.769> that<00:03:19.860> it

it exists because of the effects that it

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.410 
it exists because of the effects that it
leaves<00:03:20.190> behind<00:03:20.489> what<00:03:20.880> you're<00:03:20.970> really<00:03:21.180> you're

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
leaves behind what you're really you're

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.290 
leaves behind what you're really you're
doing<00:03:21.720> is<00:03:21.840> indirectly<00:03:22.970> probing<00:03:23.970> for<00:03:24.209> the

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
doing is indirectly probing for the

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.850 
doing is indirectly probing for the
existence<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:25.019> electron<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.680> we<00:03:25.739> can

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
existence of a electron and we can

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.550 
existence of a electron and we can
understand<00:03:26.820> its<00:03:27.000> behavior<00:03:27.120> quite<00:03:27.780> quite<00:03:28.530> well

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
understand its behavior quite quite well

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.580 
understand its behavior quite quite well
indirectly<00:03:29.310> by<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.150> macroscopic<00:03:31.050> effects

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
indirectly by the macroscopic effects

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.610 
indirectly by the macroscopic effects
that<00:03:31.769> this<00:03:31.940> subatomic<00:03:32.940> particle<00:03:33.720> essentially

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
that this subatomic particle essentially

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.259 
that this subatomic particle essentially
leaves<00:03:34.830> behind<00:03:35.070> so<00:03:35.489> it's<00:03:35.610> a<00:03:35.700> similar<00:03:36.030> type<00:03:36.060> of

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
leaves behind so it's a similar type of

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.380 
leaves behind so it's a similar type of
principle<00:03:37.130> now<00:03:38.130> in<00:03:38.430> terms<00:03:38.850> of<00:03:39.090> is<00:03:39.209> there<00:03:39.360> a

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
principle now in terms of is there a

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.370 
principle now in terms of is there a
gene<00:03:40.280> if<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:41.489> will<00:03:41.640> that<00:03:42.300> if<00:03:42.600> you<00:03:42.750> disabled<00:03:43.290> it

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
gene if you will that if you disabled it

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.110 
gene if you will that if you disabled it
you<00:03:43.530> would<00:03:43.650> lose<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:43.860> spiritual<00:03:44.489> capacity

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
you would lose the spiritual capacity

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.810 
you would lose the spiritual capacity
and<00:03:45.330> I<00:03:45.930> would<00:03:46.410> argue<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:47.010> answer<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.430> is

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
and I would argue the answer to that is

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.550 
and I would argue the answer to that is
no<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.630> way<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:48.780> kind<00:03:49.110> of<00:03:49.170> think<00:03:49.410> of<00:03:49.500> that

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
no and the way I kind of think of that

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.610 
no and the way I kind of think of that
is<00:03:50.090> kind<00:03:51.090> of<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.239> hardware<00:03:51.540> software<00:03:51.930> type<00:03:52.470> of

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
is kind of a hardware software type of

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.860 
is kind of a hardware software type of
analogy<00:03:53.070> that<00:03:53.910> if<00:03:54.269> you<00:03:54.510> think<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.810> our

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
analogy that if you think of our

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.570 
analogy that if you think of our

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
hardware and the spiritual aspect is

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.550 
hardware and the spiritual aspect is

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
within a computer system so likewise I

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.170 
within a computer system so likewise I
think<00:04:13.019> you<00:04:13.110> can<00:04:13.430> damage<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.610> brain<00:04:14.850> or<00:04:15.090> there

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
think you can damage the brain or there

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.000 
think you can damage the brain or there
can<00:04:15.330> be<00:04:15.450> genetic<00:04:15.900> defects<00:04:16.350> in<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.620> brain<00:04:16.830> that

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
can be genetic defects in the brain that

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.820 
can be genetic defects in the brain that
would<00:04:17.130> prevent<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:18.419> proper<00:04:18.830> manifestation

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
would prevent the proper manifestation

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.210 
would prevent the proper manifestation
of<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:21.060> man's<00:04:21.419> spiritual<00:04:21.959> makeup<00:04:22.710> but<00:04:23.160> I

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
of the man's spiritual makeup but I

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.800 
of the man's spiritual makeup but I
don't<00:04:23.430> think<00:04:23.610> that<00:04:23.760> that<00:04:24.000> spiritual<00:04:24.539> makeup

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
don't think that that spiritual makeup

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.640 
don't think that that spiritual makeup
is<00:04:24.930> necessarily<00:04:25.440> lost<00:04:25.770> or<00:04:26.160> is

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
is necessarily lost or is

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.550 
is necessarily lost or is
and<00:04:26.860> so<00:04:27.550> you<00:04:28.060> know<00:04:28.180> yes<00:04:28.540> in<00:04:29.020> some<00:04:29.259> sense

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
and so you know yes in some sense

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.080 
and so you know yes in some sense
there's<00:04:29.919> things<00:04:30.250> that<00:04:30.460> you<00:04:30.520> can<00:04:30.729> probe

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
there's things that you can probe

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.550 
there's things that you can probe
scientifically<00:04:31.870> and<00:04:31.990> other<00:04:32.110> things<00:04:32.410> I<00:04:32.530> think

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
scientifically and other things I think

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.400 
scientifically and other things I think
you<00:04:33.220> can't<00:04:33.490> probe<00:04:33.790> scientifically<00:04:34.600> and<00:04:34.750> what

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
you can't probe scientifically and what

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.540 
you can't probe scientifically and what
we're<00:04:35.530> trying<00:04:35.620> to<00:04:35.800> do<00:04:35.860> with<00:04:35.979> our<00:04:36.100> creation

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
we're trying to do with our creation

we're trying to do with our creation
model<00:04:36.729> is<00:04:37.030> to<00:04:37.180> try<00:04:38.110> to<00:04:38.169> come<00:04:38.380> up<00:04:38.410> with<00:04:38.530> ways<00:04:38.800> to

biblical creation accounts and try to

biblical creation accounts and try to

develop predictions and you know if if

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.960 
develop predictions and you know if if
at<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:47.889> end<00:04:47.919> of<00:04:48.100> the<00:04:48.160> day<00:04:48.280> our<00:04:48.310> predictions

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
at the end of the day our predictions

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.939 
at the end of the day our predictions
are<00:04:49.090> not<00:04:49.240> detailed<00:04:49.690> enough<00:04:49.870> or<00:04:50.229> not<00:04:50.259> extensive

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
are not detailed enough or not extensive

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:52.620 
are not detailed enough or not extensive
enough<00:04:51.160> what<00:04:51.400> that<00:04:51.520> suggests<00:04:52.060> to<00:04:52.090> me<00:04:52.180> is<00:04:52.330> that

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
enough what that suggests to me is that

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.230 
enough what that suggests to me is that
we<00:04:52.780> just<00:04:52.990> have<00:04:53.139> more<00:04:53.380> work<00:04:53.919> to<00:04:53.949> do<00:04:54.280> I<00:04:54.520> mean<00:04:55.120> our

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
we just have more work to do I mean our

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.969 
we just have more work to do I mean our
view<00:04:55.509> is<00:04:55.570> that<00:04:55.630> we<00:04:55.750> bear<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.289> burden<00:04:56.680> of

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
view is that we bear the burden of

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.550 
view is that we bear the burden of
producing<00:04:57.699> a<00:04:58.210> model<00:04:58.900> that<00:04:59.110> would<00:04:59.350> be

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
producing a model that would be

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.100 
producing a model that would be
recognized<00:05:00.160> by<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.150> scientific<00:05:01.720> community

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
recognized by the scientific community

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.050 
recognized by the scientific community
as<00:05:02.199> being<00:05:02.410> a<00:05:02.590> legitimate<00:05:02.680> scientific<00:05:03.669> model

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
as being a legitimate scientific model

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.170 
as being a legitimate scientific model
and<00:05:04.270> if<00:05:04.389> tonight<00:05:04.780> we<00:05:05.500> haven't<00:05:05.800> convinced<00:05:06.280> our

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
and if tonight we haven't convinced our

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.689 
and if tonight we haven't convinced our
two<00:05:07.510> colleagues<00:05:08.169> here<00:05:08.590> to<00:05:08.889> panelists<00:05:09.550> then

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
two colleagues here to panelists then

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.640 
two colleagues here to panelists then
that<00:05:10.360> it<00:05:10.479> means<00:05:10.600> that<00:05:10.690> we<00:05:10.780> have<00:05:10.990> more<00:05:11.199> work<00:05:11.440> to

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
that it means that we have more work to

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.969 
that it means that we have more work to
do

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
do

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.950 
do
but<00:05:12.100> I<00:05:12.130> think<00:05:12.490> hopefully<00:05:13.360> we've<00:05:13.720> demonstrated

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
but I think hopefully we've demonstrated

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.439 
but I think hopefully we've demonstrated
that<00:05:14.500> at<00:05:14.740> least<00:05:14.919> we<00:05:15.100> can<00:05:15.280> take<00:05:15.490> substantial<00:05:15.910> or

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
that at least we can take substantial or

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.420 
that at least we can take substantial or
we've<00:05:16.630> taken<00:05:16.900> substantial<00:05:17.199> steps<00:05:18.039> towards

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
we've taken substantial steps towards

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.020 
we've taken substantial steps towards
that<00:05:18.520> end

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
that end

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.890 
that end
if<00:05:19.120> not<00:05:20.160> being<00:05:21.160> at<00:05:21.280> the<00:05:21.460> the<00:05:21.760> final<00:05:22.479> point<00:05:22.750> in
