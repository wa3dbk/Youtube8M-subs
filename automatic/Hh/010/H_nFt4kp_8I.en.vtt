00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.100
 [Music] 

00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.110
 here we see a ball of gta 5 extra 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.590
 the patriot update that has come out 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.200
 today July 1 as I said is Tuesday and 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.840
 I had to leave this update 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.669
 tomorrow is that great day day in usa 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.859
 Independence Day is worth but as 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:21.499
 you already know rockstar because it puts the days 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.329
 Tuesday so here we have the mass 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:25.550
 is of all as you see there we are in 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.560
 a truck that wins then I will teach or in 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.720
 a truck, you will not see it, so it's worth it 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.970
 we started with the update with the 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.770
 houses that have given homes that the truth 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.940
 I do not think it's so important to the 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.309
 update because they are houses that 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.620
 they have six garage spaces worth for 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.530
 six cars and they are not worth more than 150,000 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.289
 they are houses as well as let's say shit not 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.570
 are houses inside because no 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.309
 does not change much, not to say in 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.930
 nothing is worth everything I did not buy any 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.860
 but from what I have been told it does not change 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.079
 a lot and well they are not worth more than 150 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.879
 thousand 200 thousand does not arrive and for good there 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.920
 different locations as in paleto 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.890
 by others but as I say the houses do not 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.979
 they're so important and now we're going with 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.310
 the cars in more specific with this 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.740
 with the liberator that is worth 740 and 2014 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.050
 go to price or 14 dollars that I know 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.119
 what they are for will be for the wheels that 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.090
 they seem to have four or you who 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.909
 is a piece of Ticos and bone, giant and 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.130
 now then I'll teach it more so it's worth 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.350
 Anchor 700 and a thousand thousand that is a monster 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.390
 truck but the things that you can not 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.729
 add in activities but good in that 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.730
 we'll see later then we have the question 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.590
 in sovereign that is a motorcycle of acidity 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.870
 well with the design of the USA that I 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.880
 I bought nothing else to see it until very cool and 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.370
 You see with that flag design 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.830
 beautiful American and now we go to the 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.960
 emulation that has surprised me 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.730
 very much we have fireworks 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.680
 as you can see there I am buying several 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.320
 witnesses are worth it from source of 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.000
 flash and starry there are three 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.550
 different than this because we have to 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.230
 put on the ground and when we do it to 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.000
 turn on according to the time that we have 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.010
 put to exploit it will explode and 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.590
 it will be with fireworks 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.060
 as its name says good has also 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.100
 added this is a musket that is 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.040
 typical student of shotguns and old not 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.120
 that each mask has a shot and 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.480
 recharge a little weird like that with the 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.160
 finger I do not know a shotgun 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.410
 ancient that is called musket and here 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.560
 we have a pyrotechnics cannon that is 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.660
 to throw our fireworks 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.130
 as if it were a rocket launcher but that 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.870
 Threw artificial fire driving 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.460
 up and the fires there explode and 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.380
 others and now let's see it as you see 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.270
 there we have here the pyrotechnics truck 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.640
 and law side as it sounds look how it is 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.420
 I'm going to shut up a bit the moment there what 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.930
 You see that order sounds 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.530
 [Music] 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.939
 beautiful, incredible, whether or not I am 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.519
 He liked it quite honestly 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:52.379
 we buy artificial and we may not be 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.909
 and also it kills kills and either but 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.920
 matallana we see the shotgun that looks like 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.799
 like recharging with your finger and it's like 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.480
 gunpowder and bony I do not know is a bit weird and 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.920
 did not kill a good shot in the 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.379
 chest yes I think killing short 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.030
 distance is not not that it is but good 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.790
 I think it's more decorative this shotgun 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.290
 honestly so now let's see 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.030
 fireworks we have to 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.500
 go to the inventory to see it is worth 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.849
 we have to go to the fires inventory 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.470
 artificial and we have to give 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.060
 place it and I have it placed and I 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.590
 let's turn on put two seconds and 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.900
 see there the fireworks 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.349
 that is the star that for me is the 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.000
 more cool and you see that chulada uncle or 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.310
 fireworks are very cool and 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.950
 until we see is that with another and 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.719
 now look at this please because it is 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.049
 incredible because it puts the doge is 6 x 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:39.510
 6 and nexus with the monster truck giving and 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.189
 look at where he sent me be the doge is 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.109
 is not anyone against this my age by 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:45.120
 example look at this look at this is that 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.730
 He sent me to take it for ass go show 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.370
 the deal is 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.739
 where is it that he has incredible strength 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.440
 Look, look, it does not let me do anything 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.420
 that is the gross monster truck is 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.890
 really cool is that it is very hard and 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.080
 over can be the king of the road 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.879
 and now we go with the motorcycle that took it 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.349
 that a little bit because I bought it is 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.660
 pink on the bike that I'm going to catch and it 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.310
 looks a lot like the green franklin's 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.920
 campaign mode but good with this 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.980
 American design but it's not the same 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.930
 it's similar but it's not the same and now 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.400
 let's go I'll summarize this theft 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.310
 because there are so many clothes as you see 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.470
 dress I will summarize what with the costumes 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.210
 predetermined that it already gives you because 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.280
 stores not because of how you see there already gives you 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.030
 an idea and there are jackets shirts 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.460
 pants hats glasses and accessories 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.720
 be a lot of things are worth and good 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.430

 amazing all the things that are here 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.370
 then I joined in consciousness side the 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.080
 bastard with the monster truck and had him 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.789
