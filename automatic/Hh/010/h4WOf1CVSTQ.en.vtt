chlorophyll<00:00:01.620> is<00:00:01.979> a<00:00:02.610> green<00:00:03.060> pigmented

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
chlorophyll is a green pigmented

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.930 
chlorophyll is a green pigmented
molecule<00:00:04.319> that<00:00:05.250> allows<00:00:05.640> plants<00:00:06.410> to<00:00:07.410> absorb

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:07.940 
molecule that allows plants to absorb

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.190 
molecule that allows plants to absorb
the<00:00:08.940> sunlight<00:00:10.219> so<00:00:11.219> it<00:00:11.370> can<00:00:11.610> go<00:00:11.849> through

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
the sunlight so it can go through

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.450 
the sunlight so it can go through
photosynthesis<00:00:14.990> chlorophyll<00:00:15.990> has<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.770> similar

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
assimilating into your body it forms a

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.170 
assimilating into your body it forms a
complex<00:02:44.940> with<00:02:45.209> these<00:02:45.780> carcinogens<00:02:46.260> and

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
complex with these carcinogens and

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.930 
complex with these carcinogens and
prevents<00:02:48.180> these<00:02:48.750> carcinogens<00:02:49.470> from<00:02:50.100> being

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
prevents these carcinogens from being

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.120 
prevents these carcinogens from being
absorbed<00:02:51.840> into<00:02:52.260> our<00:02:53.160> system<00:02:54.709> that's<00:02:55.709> a

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.500 
beautiful thing anti-cancer the greens
there's<00:03:03.060> nothing<00:03:03.690> better<00:03:04.110> than<00:03:05.510> greens

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
there's nothing better than greens

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.410 
there's nothing better than greens
inside<00:03:07.020> your<00:03:07.260> system<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:08.610> health<00:03:08.850> benefits

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
inside your system the health benefits

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.199 
inside your system the health benefits
are<00:03:09.600> beyond<00:03:10.200> any<00:03:11.030> drug<00:03:12.260> or<00:03:13.260> any<00:03:13.410> food<00:03:13.850> so<00:03:14.850> the

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
are beyond any drug or any food so the

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.360 
are beyond any drug or any food so the
