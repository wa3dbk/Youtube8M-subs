cave doing nicely it's all growing in
java<00:01:44.430> fern<00:01:44.700> growing<00:01:45.119> nicely<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.780> have<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.229> huge

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
java fern growing nicely I have a huge

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.830 
java fern growing nicely I have a huge
patch<00:01:46.770> right<00:01:47.009> here<00:01:47.070> because<00:01:47.610> as<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.570> can<00:01:48.659> see

patch right here because as you can see

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.230 
patch right here because as you can see
on<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.020> side<00:01:49.290> it's<00:01:50.189> when<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.549> java<00:01:50.880> moss

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
on the side it's when the java moss

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.120 
on the side it's when the java moss
meets<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.990> job<00:01:52.320> fern<00:01:52.590> i<00:01:52.740> don't<00:01:52.890> know<00:01:52.950> what<00:01:53.040> to

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
meets the job fern i don't know what to

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.120 
meets the job fern i don't know what to
do<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.490> just<00:01:53.729> folded<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.149> back<00:01:54.500> I'm<00:01:55.500> maybe

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
do so I just folded it back I'm maybe

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.030 
do so I just folded it back I'm maybe
put<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.579> in<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.820> tank<00:01:57.149> uh<00:01:57.560> I'm<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.799> gonna<00:01:58.860> do

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
put it in this tank uh I'm just gonna do

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.520 
put it in this tank uh I'm just gonna do
that<00:01:59.219> good<00:01:59.670> idea<00:02:00.000> since<00:02:00.719> there's<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.200> lot<00:02:01.409> of

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
that good idea since there's a lot of

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.590 
that good idea since there's a lot of
ammonia<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:02.070> here<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:03.119> it's<00:02:03.240> still<00:02:03.420> maturing

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
ammonia in here and it's still maturing

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.679 
ammonia in here and it's still maturing
I'm<00:02:04.259> gonna<00:02:04.770> get<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> huge<00:02:05.759> clump<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.390> just<00:02:06.509> put

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
I'm gonna get a huge clump and just put

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.510 
I'm gonna get a huge clump and just put
it<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:06.930> here<00:02:07.170> let<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.710> float<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:08.340> all

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
it in here let it float and it's all

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.029 
it in here let it float and it's all
that's<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:09.000> good<00:02:09.149> idea<00:02:09.319> let<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.440> absorb<00:02:10.530> all

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
that's a good idea let it absorb all

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.890 
that's a good idea let it absorb all
that<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.489> then<00:02:11.580> the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
that and then the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.929 
that and then the
it's<00:02:12.110> gonna<00:02:12.319> get<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:13.040> job<00:02:13.069> of<00:02:13.400> mosques<00:02:13.819> you

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:13.939 
it's gonna get the job of mosques you

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:16.119 
it's gonna get the job of mosques you
can<00:02:14.030> get<00:02:14.209> a<00:02:14.239> lot<00:02:14.390> bigger<00:02:14.799> maybe<00:02:15.799> I'm<00:02:15.980> just

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
can get a lot bigger maybe I'm just

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:17.649 
can get a lot bigger maybe I'm just
gonna<00:02:16.250> put<00:02:16.430> in<00:02:16.519> like<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.700> corner<00:02:17.269> and<00:02:17.360> let<00:02:17.420> it

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
gonna put in like a corner and let it

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:20.289 
gonna put in like a corner and let it
just<00:02:17.689> suck<00:02:18.620> up<00:02:18.799> all<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.010> ammonia<00:02:19.400> but<00:02:20.090> that's

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
just suck up all the ammonia but that's

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:21.819 
just suck up all the ammonia but that's
a<00:02:20.360> good<00:02:20.480> idea<00:02:20.629> I'm<00:02:21.049> going<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.230> do<00:02:21.379> that<00:02:21.560> right

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
a good idea I'm going to do that right

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.259 
a good idea I'm going to do that right
after<00:02:21.980> this<00:02:22.189> video<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.819> probably<00:02:23.120> do<00:02:23.180> another

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
after this video and probably do another

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.710 
after this video and probably do another
water<00:02:23.689> change<00:02:24.079> half<00:02:24.709> half<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.430> tank<00:02:25.720> so

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
water change half half the tank so

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.970 
water change half half the tank so
that's<00:02:26.870> pretty<00:02:27.049> much<00:02:27.110> it<00:02:27.230> so<00:02:27.560> there's<00:02:27.799> that

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
that's pretty much it so there's that

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.559 
that's pretty much it so there's that
total<00:02:28.519> of<00:02:28.700> 13<00:02:29.329> 14<00:02:29.900> 15<00:02:30.019> 16<00:02:30.319> 17<00:02:30.530> 18<00:02:30.920> 19<00:02:31.220> 20<00:02:31.569> there's

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
total of 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 there's

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.800 
total of 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 there's
20<00:02:33.170> fish<00:02:33.530> in<00:02:33.739> here<00:02:33.890> exact<00:02:34.430> in<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.299> five<00:02:35.569> and<00:02:35.750> a

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
20 fish in here exact in a five and a

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.649

cleaning<00:02:47.060> out<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.209> tank<00:02:47.420> so<00:02:47.659> they're<00:02:47.810> getting

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
cleaning out the tank so they're getting

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.699 
cleaning out the tank so they're getting
refreshed<00:02:48.379> um<00:02:49.129> I<00:02:49.389> found<00:02:50.389> out<00:02:50.690> I<00:02:50.900> said<00:02:51.470> in<00:02:51.590> an

refreshed um I found out I said in an
earlier<00:02:51.829> video<00:02:52.190> that<00:02:52.370> my<00:02:52.790> shrimp<00:02:53.120> died<00:02:53.420> while

new shrimp I spotted two shrimp

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.759 
new shrimp I spotted two shrimp
yesterday<00:03:03.739> so<00:03:03.799> it's<00:03:04.250> still<00:03:04.489> alive<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.900> I'm

yesterday so it's still alive and I'm

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.759 
yesterday so it's still alive and I'm
guessing<00:03:07.310> on<00:03:07.489> this<00:03:07.700> uh<00:03:07.730> this<00:03:08.629> rock<00:03:08.900> this<00:03:09.470> java

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
guessing on this uh this rock this java

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.190 
guessing on this uh this rock this java
moss<00:03:10.069> is<00:03:10.370> getting<00:03:10.700> direct<00:03:11.299> light<00:03:11.780> because

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
moss is getting direct light because

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.660 
moss is getting direct light because
there's<00:03:12.799> no<00:03:12.920> light<00:03:13.040> in<00:03:13.159> the<00:03:13.220> section<00:03:13.519> it's

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
there's no light in the section it's

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.280 
there's no light in the section it's
kind<00:03:13.849> of<00:03:13.909> off<00:03:14.090> it's<00:03:14.359> on<00:03:14.450> this<00:03:14.599> side<00:03:14.659> the<00:03:15.109> light

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
kind of off it's on this side the light

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.530 
kind of off it's on this side the light
bulb<00:03:15.530> so<00:03:15.739> it's<00:03:16.609> getting<00:03:16.879> the<00:03:17.060> most<00:03:17.209> light<00:03:17.419> in

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
bulb so it's getting the most light in
