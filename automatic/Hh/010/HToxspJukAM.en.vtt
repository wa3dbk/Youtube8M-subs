00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.490 
on it I did not record any of those
flips<00:01:14.130> but<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.340> did<00:01:14.610> make<00:01:15.170> probably<00:01:16.170> an<00:01:16.290> extra

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
flips but I did make probably an extra

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.420

five mil or so which you're not going to

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.160 
five mil or so which you're not going to
see<00:01:20.670> but<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.240> was<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:21.570> from<00:01:21.750> flips<00:01:21.990> that

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
see but that was just from flips that

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.350 
see but that was just from flips that
stagnated<00:01:22.770> for<00:01:22.920> example<00:01:23.790> these<00:01:23.909> static

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
stagnated for example these static

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.530 
stagnated for example these static
gloves<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:25.470> put<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.610> buy<00:01:26.759> offer<00:01:26.970> for<00:01:27.240> nine<00:01:27.390> of

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
gloves I put in a buy offer for nine of

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.120 
gloves I put in a buy offer for nine of
them<00:01:27.689> but<00:01:27.810> only<00:01:27.869> four<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.350> them<00:01:28.650> bought<00:01:28.860> and

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
them but only four of them bought and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.520 
them but only four of them bought and
there<00:01:29.880> was<00:01:30.030> no<00:01:30.210> time<00:01:30.450> left<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.049> ten<00:01:31.229> hours

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
I have until potions they just didn't

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.509

potions clean dwarf weeds super ranging

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.259 
potions clean dwarf weeds super ranging
so<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:16.979> super<00:04:17.250> engine<00:04:17.549> was<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.820> only<00:04:18.090> major

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
so the super engine was the only major

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.259 
so the super engine was the only major
flip<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:18.750> did<00:04:18.989> that<00:04:19.440> loss<00:04:19.859> or<00:04:20.250> did<00:04:20.639> not<00:04:20.789> make<00:04:21.000> any

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269

flip I did that loss or did not make any
money<00:04:21.479> there<00:04:21.870> is<00:04:21.959> a<00:04:21.989> few<00:04:22.289> really<00:04:22.500> minor<00:04:22.890> flips

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
money there is a few really minor flips

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.149 
money there is a few really minor flips
I<00:04:23.400> had<00:04:23.610> like<00:04:23.909> dwarf<00:04:24.870> weed<00:04:25.110> seeds<00:04:25.469> lanta<00:04:25.979> dime

I had like dwarf weed seeds lanta dime
seeds

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210

palm<00:04:27.630> tree<00:04:28.050> seeds<00:04:28.380> those<00:04:29.310> are<00:04:29.460> three<00:04:29.699> flips<00:04:29.880> I

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
palm tree seeds those are three flips I

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.219 
palm tree seeds those are three flips I
didn't<00:04:30.240> even<00:04:30.330> include<00:04:30.479> because<00:04:30.930> they<00:04:31.080> all

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
didn't even include because they all

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.960 
didn't even include because they all
broke<00:04:31.590> even<00:04:31.770> they're<00:04:32.130> really<00:04:32.400> tiny<00:04:32.610> flips

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
broke even they're really tiny flips

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.020 
broke even they're really tiny flips
anyway<00:04:33.419> so<00:04:33.479> anyway<00:04:34.320> that's<00:04:34.740> about<00:04:35.040> all<00:04:35.370> on<00:04:35.729> so

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
anyway so anyway that's about all on so

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.250 
anyway so anyway that's about all on so
I'm<00:04:36.120> going<00:04:36.240> to<00:04:36.300> show<00:04:36.479> you<00:04:36.570> exactly<00:04:36.870> how<00:04:37.050> much

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
I'm going to show you exactly how much

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.760 
I'm going to show you exactly how much
cash<00:04:37.620> I<00:04:37.919> made<00:04:38.220> roughly<00:04:38.900> estimated<00:04:39.900> it's<00:04:40.620> not

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
cash I made roughly estimated it's not

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.320 
cash I made roughly estimated it's not
an<00:04:40.860> exact<00:04:41.190> price<00:04:41.430> but<00:04:41.790> I'll<00:04:41.880> show<00:04:42.060> you<00:04:42.090> what<00:04:42.300> I

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
an exact price but I'll show you what I

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.620 
an exact price but I'll show you what I
got<00:04:43.550> so<00:04:44.550> I<00:04:44.580> looked<00:04:44.940> through<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.180> amount<00:04:45.419> of

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
got so I looked through the amount of

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.200 
got so I looked through the amount of
money<00:04:45.810> that<00:04:45.900> I<00:04:46.190> roughly<00:04:47.190> made<00:04:47.400> this<00:04:47.760> is<00:04:47.970> just

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
money that I roughly made this is just

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.379 
money that I roughly made this is just
an<00:04:48.360> estimate<00:04:48.979> this<00:04:49.979> is<00:04:50.160> not<00:04:50.310> the<00:04:50.460> exact<00:04:51.030> amount

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
an estimate this is not the exact amount

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.210 
an estimate this is not the exact amount
of<00:04:51.479> cash<00:04:51.720> that<00:04:52.050> I<00:04:52.139> made<00:04:52.380> in<00:04:52.560> 10<00:04:52.830> hours<00:04:53.040> of

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
of cash that I made in 10 hours of

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.790 
of cash that I made in 10 hours of
flipping<00:04:53.910> but<00:04:54.479> this<00:04:54.780> is<00:04:54.960> pretty<00:04:55.260> darn<00:04:55.440> close

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
flipping but this is pretty darn close

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.909 
flipping but this is pretty darn close
so<00:04:56.220> about<00:04:56.580> 20<00:04:57.150> mil<00:04:57.389> so<00:04:58.320> that's<00:04:58.500> only<00:04:58.620> a<00:04:58.740> two

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
so about 20 mil so that's only a two

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.219 
so about 20 mil so that's only a two
million<00:04:59.130> hour<00:04:59.340> you<00:05:00.300> got<00:05:00.479> to<00:05:00.600> realize<00:05:00.720> though

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
million hour you got to realize though

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.890 
million hour you got to realize though
if<00:05:01.470> you<00:05:01.860> aren't<00:05:02.130> like<00:05:02.280> me<00:05:02.310> and<00:05:02.820> you<00:05:02.970> don't<00:05:03.210> go

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
if you aren't like me and you don't go

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.659 
if you aren't like me and you don't go

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
to glaze horse for two hours and then

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.120 
to glaze horse for two hours and then
check<00:05:05.970> your<00:05:06.000> flips<00:05:06.419> when<00:05:06.510> you<00:05:06.660> get<00:05:06.840> back

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
check your flips when you get back

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.469 
check your flips when you get back
you're<00:05:08.130> gonna<00:05:08.310> be<00:05:08.699> able<00:05:08.940> to<00:05:09.030> do<00:05:09.150> a<00:05:09.180> lot<00:05:09.449> more

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
you're gonna be able to do a lot more

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.060 
you're gonna be able to do a lot more
flips<00:05:10.020> per<00:05:10.199> hour<00:05:10.320> because<00:05:10.560> I<00:05:10.680> had<00:05:10.830> a<00:05:10.889> lot<00:05:11.039> of

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
flips per hour because I had a lot of

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.550 
flips per hour because I had a lot of
stuff<00:05:11.310> buy<00:05:11.550> and<00:05:11.940> sell<00:05:12.539> walls<00:05:12.780> got<00:05:13.080> glaze<00:05:13.350> sores

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
stuff buy and sell walls got glaze sores

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.230 
stuff buy and sell walls got glaze sores
and<00:05:13.680> if<00:05:13.860> I<00:05:13.949> immediately<00:05:14.190> went<00:05:14.550> back<00:05:14.699> to<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.030> GE

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
and if I immediately went back to the GE

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.060 
and if I immediately went back to the GE
and<00:05:15.539> checked<00:05:15.780> my<00:05:15.840> flips<00:05:16.199> and<00:05:16.380> put<00:05:16.560> in<00:05:16.650> new<00:05:16.680> ones

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
and checked my flips and put in new ones

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.540 
and checked my flips and put in new ones
I<00:05:17.310> would<00:05:17.639> have<00:05:17.910> been<00:05:18.060> able<00:05:18.210> to<00:05:18.510> do<00:05:18.720> more<00:05:18.990> flips

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
I would have been able to do more flips

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.860 
I would have been able to do more flips
but<00:05:20.550> at<00:05:20.699> the<00:05:20.789> same<00:05:20.940> time<00:05:21.210> I<00:05:21.389> you<00:05:21.630> got<00:05:21.780> to

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
but at the same time I you got to

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.600 
but at the same time I you got to
remember<00:05:21.990> I<00:05:22.139> had<00:05:22.320> three<00:05:22.680> of<00:05:22.800> my<00:05:22.919> GE<00:05:23.160> slots

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
remember I had three of my GE slots

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.070 
remember I had three of my GE slots
taken<00:05:24.030> out<00:05:24.150> because<00:05:24.300> I<00:05:24.419> was<00:05:24.539> buying<00:05:24.690> earth

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
taken out because I was buying earth

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.909 
taken out because I was buying earth
talismans

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
talismans

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.980 
talismans
I<00:05:25.979> was<00:05:26.310> buying<00:05:26.460> headless<00:05:26.850> arrows<00:05:27.210> and<00:05:27.600> I<00:05:27.870> was

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
I was buying headless arrows and I was

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.339 
I was buying headless arrows and I was
buying<00:05:28.310> brought<00:05:29.310> arrowheads<00:05:29.789> so<00:05:30.479> I<00:05:30.870> was<00:05:31.200> only

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
buying brought arrowheads so I was only

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:33.350 
buying brought arrowheads so I was only
using<00:05:31.530> three<00:05:31.950> G<00:05:32.130> slots<00:05:32.550> to<00:05:32.700> flip<00:05:32.940> and<00:05:33.180> that's

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
using three G slots to flip and that's

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.350 
using three G slots to flip and that's
why<00:05:33.539> I<00:05:33.570> didn't<00:05:33.960> get<00:05:34.080> a<00:05:34.139> ton<00:05:34.410> of<00:05:34.440> flips<00:05:34.770> off<00:05:34.950> but

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
why I didn't get a ton of flips off but

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.060 
why I didn't get a ton of flips off but
