00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
all the code that comes with the book

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.300 
all the code that comes with the book
one<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.870> very<00:00:16.170> first<00:00:16.440> plugins<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.190> we

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
one of the very first plugins that we

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.820 
one of the very first plugins that we
look<00:00:17.490> at<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.940> called<00:00:18.210> build<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.750> house<00:00:18.930> here<00:00:19.740> are

look at is called build a house here are

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.080 
look at is called build a house here are
the<00:00:19.920> files<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.460> make<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.789> up

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
the files that make it up

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.000 
the files that make it up
we've<00:00:21.240> got<00:00:21.390> some<00:00:21.660> various<00:00:22.109> directories<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.920> a

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
and my house dot Java so the very first

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.950 
and my house dot Java so the very first
thing<00:00:28.529> we're<00:00:28.769> gonna<00:00:28.859> do<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.160> go<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.119> use

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
thing we're gonna do is go in and use

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.290 
thing we're gonna do is go in and use
this<00:00:31.199> build<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.710> house<00:00:32.030> function<00:00:33.030> that's

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
this build a house function that's

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.060 
this build a house function that's
listed<00:00:33.570> here<00:00:33.750> but<00:00:34.320> we<00:00:34.380> have<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.559> tell<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.800> how

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
listed here but we have to tell it how

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.520 
listed here but we have to tell it how
big<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.489> house<00:00:35.730> we<00:00:36.000> want<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.750> we<00:00:36.899> get<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.170> declare

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
big a house we want so we get to declare

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.619 
big a house we want so we get to declare
some<00:00:37.950> variables<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.670> will<00:00:38.940> make<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> house

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
some variables I will make a house

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.200 
some variables I will make a house
that's<00:00:39.930> five<00:00:40.200> wide<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.010> five<00:00:41.309> high<00:00:41.640> that

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
that's five wide and five high that

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.760 
that's five wide and five high that
seems<00:00:42.480> like<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.840> should<00:00:43.050> be<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> good<00:00:43.469> size

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
seems like that should be a good size

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.819 
seems like that should be a good size
we'll<00:00:44.370> save<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.700> file<00:00:45.239> off<00:00:45.510> then<00:00:46.079> go<00:00:46.350> back<00:00:46.800> up

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
we'll save that file off then go back up

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.069 
we'll save that file off then go back up
over<00:00:47.160> here<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.760> build<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> plug-in<00:00:48.539> using

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
over here and build the plug-in using

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.160 
over here and build the plug-in using
the<00:00:49.200> build<00:00:49.530> script<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.190> comes<00:00:50.370> with<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.850> and

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
the build script that comes with it and

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.200 
the build script that comes with it and
voila<00:00:52.170> we've<00:00:52.649> got<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> plug-in<00:00:53.370> now<00:00:53.820> we<00:00:53.910> can<00:00:54.120> go

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
voila we've got a plug-in now we can go

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.970 
voila we've got a plug-in now we can go
over<00:00:54.329> here<00:00:54.480> start<00:00:55.050> up<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> minecraft<00:00:55.800> server

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
over here start up the minecraft server

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.790 
over here start up the minecraft server
and<00:00:56.399> go<00:00:57.390> into<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.750> game<00:00:57.930> itself<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.559> let's

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
and go into the game itself and let's

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.529 
and go into the game itself and let's
take<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> look<00:00:59.250> around<00:00:59.399> oh<00:00:59.820> this<00:01:00.210> looks<00:01:00.390> like<00:01:00.449> a

go out and take a look around okay it's

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.399 
go out and take a look around okay it's
not<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.210> great<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.479> house<00:01:15.720> but<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.170> know<00:01:16.200> what

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
not that great a house but you know what

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.260 
not that great a house but you know what
it's<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.770> good<00:01:16.950> start<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.000> was<00:01:18.090> one<00:01:18.240> of

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
it's a good start and that was one of

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.999 
it's a good start and that was one of
the<00:01:18.420> simpler<00:01:18.810> plugins<00:01:19.350> here's<00:01:19.650> one<00:01:19.860> that's

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
the simpler plugins here's one that's

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.950 
the simpler plugins here's one that's
much<00:01:20.280> more<00:01:20.460> complicated<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
much more complicated this is the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.289 
much more complicated this is the
flaming<00:01:22.259> cow<00:01:22.680> shooter<00:01:23.189> where<00:01:23.759> with<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> piece

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
flaming cow shooter where with a piece

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.300 
flaming cow shooter where with a piece
of<00:01:24.479> leather<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.960> your<00:01:25.110> hand<00:01:25.409> as<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> sort<00:01:26.220> of

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
of leather in your hand as a sort of

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.609 
of leather in your hand as a sort of
magic<00:01:26.700> wand<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.240> can<00:01:27.570> wave<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.350> shoot

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
magic wand you can wave it and shoot

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.249 
magic wand you can wave it and shoot
flaming<00:01:29.070> cows<00:01:29.490> at<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.450> target<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.960> your

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
flaming cows at the target of your

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.620 
flaming cows at the target of your
choice<00:01:31.530> here's<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.640> code<00:01:32.850> for<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.270> now<00:01:33.479> this

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
choice here's the code for it now this

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.480 
choice here's the code for it now this
is<00:01:33.810> one<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.079> more<00:01:34.200> complicated<00:01:34.650> ones<00:01:34.979> so

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
is one of the more complicated ones so

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.249 
is one of the more complicated ones so
don't<00:01:35.670> panic<00:01:35.939> yet<00:01:36.299> we<00:01:36.720> check<00:01:36.960> if<00:01:37.110> you're

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
don't panic yet we check if you're
