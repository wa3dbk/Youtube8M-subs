 then I personally don't play any kind of instrument 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.310
 so he never tried to 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:47.080
 thun to insert for I have never even had the opportunity to insert 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.150
 is an instrument such as a piano or an electric guitar in fl 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.000
 study 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.760
 maxu 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.519
 I ask that the child be the same as the one in the microphone 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.090
 correct me if I'm wrong 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.450
 then 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.920
 I recapitulating hill is a way to connect the microphone 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.230
 to the 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.660
 fl studio 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.060
 we will have to click on this icon here 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.710
 sister 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.650
 audio 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.909
 dinner here will be selected the main audio abi driver 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.450

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.400
 house I have forola v2 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.200
 however this will be the name of the microphone now 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.950

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.240
 connect to the computer 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.220
 so basically I can only say 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.310

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.340

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.570
 eea then now 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.400
 let me explain how to insert the folders in fl studio 9 

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:47.479
 then we will go in there are two ways to not 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.749
 to re-enter your folders 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:53.209
 % 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.280
 we will go 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.420
 first we extract the files of the compressed tac folder we have downloaded 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.859
 after which we will go today will serve 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.859
 in the file and study folder 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.939
 we will go sweaty exu pei cissÃ¨ 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.739
 the chips folder la 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.539
 we will insert it here 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:19.199
 after which in 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.380
 we should close the fl study 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.629
 reopen 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:23.969
 touch 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:26.969
 after which we will find the ayer folder 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:27.980
 Quaglini 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.209
 they will be 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.819
 creating in order 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.349
 alphabetical 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.669
 we will find the kixd directory 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:38.329
 with all its sounds in it 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.829
 this was the first way we say the easiest 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:45.899
 after which if another world 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:48.909
 where you will not need to use the folder 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:50.850
 used a second 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.859
 the study paper 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.069
 so we could close it 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.449
 then 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:01.149
 here we can choose the option so in the meantime let's go to open 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:04.169
 again this icon here 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.589
 and we're going to click on file 

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:12.049
 we could choose or in the meantime click on this folder then we can 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.419
 choose to select each app folder 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:17.689
 hair 

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:21.319
 to be included in the telestudio such as chips and then there will be one 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:24.180
 folder that we will call at 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.939
 etc. etc. 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:27.620
 or 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.970
 we can decide to create clubs 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.699
 another folder 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.159
 which we will call boh 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:35.569
 canelli 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.330
 fl studio 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.360
 where inside we will insert all the folders that 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.000
 that we will download that must be in you inserted in 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.029
 telestudio 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:49.860
 insert up to this card 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.900
 after which we will click on this file system icon again 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:56.680
 % 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.680
 finally on this card in the eagle 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:02.939
 and we're going to select the folder 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:05.939
 renamed fl studio folders 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.050
 i creamy ok 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.229
 this green colored folder should appear 

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:16.959
 opened the oar and found mod within the folder sorry if I'm a bit 

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:18.279
 repetitive 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:19.779
 hum 

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:22.779
 that we will have downloaded. 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.900
 these were 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.629
 I think there are 2 changes 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:33.629
