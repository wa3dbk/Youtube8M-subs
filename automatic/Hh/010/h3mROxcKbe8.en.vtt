00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
screen that we make T 1 T 2 T 3 T 4 so

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.840 
screen that we make T 1 T 2 T 3 T 4 so
that<00:00:51.600> we<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.899> keep<00:00:52.079> track<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.739> which<00:00:53.520> green

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
that we can keep track of which green

to be taking now you don't need to do

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.470 
to be taking now you don't need to do
eleven<00:01:15.950> you<00:01:16.040> could<00:01:16.190> do<00:01:16.370> less<00:01:16.970> than<00:01:17.000> that<00:01:17.270> you

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
eleven you could do less than that you

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.670 
eleven you could do less than that you
could<00:01:17.600> do<00:01:17.690> more<00:01:17.870> than<00:01:17.930> that<00:01:18.200> but<00:01:18.410> for<00:01:18.530> this

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
could do more than that but for this

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.130 
could do more than that but for this
example<00:01:19.040> we'll<00:01:19.430> be<00:01:19.460> using<00:01:19.750> eleven<00:01:20.750> green

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
example we'll be using eleven green

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.990 
example we'll be using eleven green

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
number of green screens that we just

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.410 
number of green screens that we just
created<00:01:51.080> which<00:01:51.560> was<00:01:51.740> 11<00:01:52.040> and<00:01:52.340> we're<00:01:53.180> going<00:01:53.390> to

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
created which was 11 and we're going to

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.990 
created which was 11 and we're going to
change<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:54.050> frames<00:01:54.410> per<00:01:54.740> second<00:01:55.220> to<00:01:55.280> about

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
change the frames per second to about

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.960 
change the frames per second to about
eight<00:01:56.300> now<00:01:57.140> just<00:01:57.590> as<00:01:57.710> a<00:01:57.740> rule<00:01:57.980> of<00:01:58.130> thumb<00:01:58.160> the

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
eight now just as a rule of thumb the

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.840 
eight now just as a rule of thumb the
higher<00:01:59.540> the<00:02:00.050> frame<00:02:00.380> rate<00:02:00.620> the<00:02:00.890> faster<00:02:01.670> the

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
higher the frame rate the faster the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.110 
higher the frame rate the faster the
gift<00:02:02.090> will<00:02:02.300> play<00:02:02.800> so<00:02:03.800> eight<00:02:04.370> should<00:02:04.820> be<00:02:04.910> good

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
gift will play so eight should be good

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.050 
gift will play so eight should be good
for<00:02:05.300> this<00:02:05.420> example<00:02:05.990> under<00:02:06.710> frame<00:02:07.160> number<00:02:07.850> and
