and we're going to get to the bottom of
this<00:02:32.480> I<00:02:32.780> used<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.230> think<00:02:33.380> it<00:02:33.530> was<00:02:33.590> funny<00:02:33.890> to

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
this I used to think it was funny to

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.390 
this I used to think it was funny to
call<00:02:34.450> Big<00:02:35.450> Show<00:02:35.690> Shrek<00:02:36.050> but<00:02:36.950> then<00:02:37.069> he<00:02:37.160> started

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
call Big Show Shrek but then he started

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.589 
call Big Show Shrek but then he started
calling<00:02:37.550> me<00:02:37.670> a<00:02:37.760> sidekick<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:38.450> then<00:02:38.569> I

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
calling me a sidekick and then I

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.210 
calling me a sidekick and then I
realized<00:02:38.930> that<00:02:38.989> Shrek<00:02:39.290> sidekick<00:02:39.739> was<00:02:40.010> a

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
realized that Shrek sidekick was a

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.949 
realized that Shrek sidekick was a
donkey<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:40.910> so<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.090> didn't<00:02:41.480> think<00:02:41.599> that<00:02:41.810> was

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
donkey and so I didn't think that was

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.949 
donkey and so I didn't think that was
quite<00:02:42.140> so<00:02:42.349> funny<00:02:42.590> anymore<00:02:42.830> however<00:02:43.700> it<00:02:44.630> was<00:02:44.930> a

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
quite so funny anymore however it was a

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.059 
quite so funny anymore however it was a
very<00:02:45.380> funny<00:02:46.040> donkey<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:48.440> rock<00:02:48.650> going<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:48.980> be
