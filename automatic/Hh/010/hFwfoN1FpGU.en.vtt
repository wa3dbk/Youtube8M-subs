00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello everybody we open a new series 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.830
 of videos that will take place monthly and 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.559
 precisely the discovery of the month 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.719
 or the product I never had 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.790
 tried that I discovered during the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.160
 month and that particularly struck me 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.010
 so I decided to talk 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.010
 well then as you have seen from 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.119
 preview the product I will talk about 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.560
 this month is understood 7 very famous 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.309
 so a discovery for me why 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.850
 surely you will already know it 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:39.510
 just a cream for dry hair and 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:43.020
 then the package is 50 ml 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.340
 I paid 13 euros and 60 in the pharmacy 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.680
 you can find it in pharmacies 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.660
 parapharmacies that are produced trustworthy 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.899
 thick goes well in short, the one there and it's one 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.329
 which was precisely in the dry hair with 7 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.489
 herbs but a sage burdock is happening 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.059
 his willow and rosemary with the expiration 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.949
 six months and I'm using it from 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.570
 end of February so it remains is not one 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.290
 discovery of the month of March but his 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.450
 using the end of February 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.630
 practically this is the phyto set 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.090
 so with seven plants 7 herbs and is 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.009
 suitable for thin hair like i 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.689
 my 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.820
 then there is the little sister suitable for those who have the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.119
 culture of having spacey big hair 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.829
 which is the rent precisely 9 and for hair 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.810
 dry as you know the length and le 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.119
 tips if they form double point is 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.369
 just looking at them and this one that loves me 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.500
 really helping a lot 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.080
 then how and when you can use it 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.150
 you can just use it 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.400
 after calling the hair by dabbing 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.660
 good hair indeed good and 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.910
 then distributing a little is needed 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.640
 really a very small amount of 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.550
 cream on the lengths on the tips then 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.520
 proceeding the norm the normal fold I do not 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.780
 I fold and I don't plate so I ask 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.520
 sorry at the moment but I'm looking for 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.580
 to be as little as possible i 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.560
 hair then little parenthesis I said 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.660
 then or after dabbing your hair 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.760
 after washing or daily 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.490
 on the tips I used it 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.140
 initially the first few times on the hair 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.030
 then dry after drying them 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.880
 having made the turn, put a little bit 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.620
 of this cream on the lengths on 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.600
 tips also daily because precisely 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.520
 a moisturizer like you treat 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.920
 daily the face is a cream 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.570
 which goes to moisturize the ends lengths 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.100
 or later also tested 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.400
 application on wet hair 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.080
 dabbed hair from that wash and 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.680
 I must say that I like but both 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.360
 so now cases in the last washings 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.340
 I'm using it both on the hair 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.500
 buffered then in the following days 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.239
 on dry hair as I am 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.010
 finding with this cream really 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.550
 very well because i just having i 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.519
 thin hair weighs down with 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.560
 whatever i put on and i these 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.540
 I washed them practically two 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.970
 days almost two days ago and see that 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.680
 They are not without fine hair from 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.810
 several are not often at all 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.760
 weighed down by the cream 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:17.530
 so this is undoubtedly a 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:22.349
 a point in his favor then the tips le 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:25.239
 I find the tips slightly visible 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.400
 improve then the two points are noticed 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.640
 a little less certain does not go to repair them 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.799
 but in short moisturizing it makes no 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.299
 see that straw hat effect that already 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.909
 normally when there are double rooms 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.569
 tips because this obviously a point 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.609
 in his favour 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.549
 as mentioned his using from approx 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:44.079
 twenty days then vi 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.879
 In short, I'll update the road afterwards 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.650
 on long-term effects but those 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.500
 I have seen so far are without a doubt 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.099
 the two super positive effects 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.590
 against then meeting could be 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:59.079
 the price 13 euros and 60 50 ml of product 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.340
 but again I am using it for twenty 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.780
 very few days are missing 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.480
 because now I'll show you the 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.109
 quantity here this is what came out is the 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.840
 in fact not even too much 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:12.489
 necessary for the application indeed 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.170
 not even the one I showed you 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:19.810
 also too much and increased to even increase 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:23.710
 a little less and precisely so we say 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.770
 the cost sorry in yielding a little 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:32.710
 I put the cost is amortized let's say 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:36.330
 over time and the second against which I am 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.310
 noting in this convent is the smell 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.580
 then I knew he didn't have a very good one 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.770
 smell and indeed it is so 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.820
 after a first application like the 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.490
 wound and already this smell of 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.070
 I don't know seems to smell of cooked herbs 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.170
 I do n't know how to explain it, however, to my luck 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.380
 the moment in the applied one e 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.690
 the smell also feels strong enough 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.190
 however it disappears within a quarter 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.450
 from now twenty minutes you don't hear 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.450
 absolutely nothing on the hair
