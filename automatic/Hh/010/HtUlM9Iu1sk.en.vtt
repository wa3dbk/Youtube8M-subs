 aquino curve 14 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.009

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:27.029

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:28.800
 there is plenty of space inside the heart of 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.500
 people are putting the battery in 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.520

 What are you going to do, you guys are going to get this? 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:15.569
 light cut the background of it take as 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.590
 if it were a pipe put that pipe that 

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:21.889
 inside a kayak and seal on the outside and 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.569
 inside with cocoa mass affect 

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:27.409
 you can see that here is cocoa mass 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:30.389
 affected if any record contains 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.869
 put the cocoa mass on the outside 

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:39.749
 and inside you will put the 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:42.209
 transporter mold 5 the dough for it 

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:44.849
 is seated and each time you use the 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:48.060
 to put water inside this 

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:49.259
 The container vessel must have a 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.539
 cover right 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.770
 You can see the lid here. 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:58.649
 close and ready 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.649
 Okay, the pot will give me the reading. 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.169
 normal depth will vary in 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.409
 temperature then water vareira 

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:10.319
 around one degree or two but that is 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.750
 normal but installation was done in 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.650

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.740
 sporting with water inside the battery as 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.400
 I said 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:31.050
 What 5 or 10 amp amps support 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.350
 for gps to provide then this 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.060
