00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:07.690
 in this video you will learn how to perform 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:09.570
 Haitian effect and we see how the 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.150
 original photo 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.850
 and how will it be after applying this 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.220
 nice effect 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.330
 I am your friend dan in saavedra and not you 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.330
 go we started 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.700
 well let's start working 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.590
 with this image that if you like the 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.630
 I will leave in the description of the video 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.900
 so that you practice 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.420
 the example that we are going to make then 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:51.890
 first we are going to double our 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.400
 pre sio nando control j twice a 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.400
 the first 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:01.630
 and the second 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.340
 right away let's go to the filter 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.970
 other 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:11.320
 step high and we're going to give you a radius of 2 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:15.729
 pixels we give ok 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:19.050
 let's select the blending mode in 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:22.860
 intense light 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:27.920
 right away we are going to select these two 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:31.030
 layers and we're going to press control 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.030
 to join them 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:39.440
 again we duplicate control j we continue 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.400
 to filter 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:47.690
 another again step high and we're going to 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.190
 give a radius of 5 pixels 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.860
 come on ok 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.000
 and this layer we are going to put it in mode 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.310
 colour 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.310
 and in the opacity we are going to leave it to a 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.310
 30% 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.520
 we select again the two layers and 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.120
 we press control 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.330
 to join them again 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.830
 we will make a new duplicate by pressing 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.900
 control j 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:24.690
 we will go to filter blur 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.080
 Gaussian blur and let's apply a 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.280
 4 pixel radius this will depend on 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.350
 every photograph as well you know 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:39.570
 so I recommend you apply 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:42.720
 from 14 to 6 will be radio for this 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:47.170
 example we leave it in 4 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.970
 today ok again let's filter 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.690
 noise 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.680
 add noise 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:58.410
 in quantity we are going to put 2 % in 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.540
 distribution we will leave it in 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.530
 uniform 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.530
 we arrived ok 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:10.270
 here in the opacity we will lower it to 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.270
 35% 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:17.620
 and we are going to join these two layers 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:21.569
 pressing control 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.569
 Right away we're going to filter 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.770
 focus focus mask 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.459
 and here in quantity 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:40.129
 we're going to put 100 percent on radio 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:42.470
 15 pixels and your threshold levels 2 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:45.800
 you can move it like you better than 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:49.900
 look like the result ok 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.900
 if we accept by giving ok 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.520
 if you get a bit exaggerated 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.270
 brightness that generated then you're going to go to 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.270
 edition 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:07.750
 and you are going to press on this option 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:10.650
 which is transition focus mask 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.650
 in mode 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.910
 we are going to put it in brightness and 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.910
 let's lower the percentage 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.610
 I'm going to leave it here more or less like 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.479
 a 60 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.479
 camps ok 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:40.529
 and in this way we already achieved what it is 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:43.349
 the basis of the directing effect 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:46.679
 we see how it was before how it is 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:49.799
 later but you can continue playing 

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:51.830
 with some parameters for example you 

00:04:49.799 --> 00:04:56.200
 we can create 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.200
 an adjustment layer in curves 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:06.079
 we press on this with what is 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:06.079
 here 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:12.430
 and a dropper will appear 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.600
 let's click on this area 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.600
 dark of the forehead 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.129
 and we are going to pull in this way to 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:27.869
 create him 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.869
 more of the matrix bad image 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:37.710
 let's say so 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:41.610
 and in this way we have already created our 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:44.540
 result with the effect of choosing we see 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.540
 as it was before 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:51.350
 and already with our result 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:55.910
 how did you like it very easy to perform and 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:58.289
 very attractive I am your friend 50 I hope 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:01.949
 that you liked the video 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:06.119
 please rate what you put thumb up 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:09.479
 and if it's on my blog that's 50 point what 

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:12.199
 which is pot mx point we are in the 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:12.199
 next video
