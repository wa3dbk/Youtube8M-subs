barrel right now and the fire rate is
normal<00:01:42.240> for<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.350> people<00:01:43.380> just<00:01:44.189> good<00:01:44.460> fire

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
normal for for the people just good fire

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.520 
normal for for the people just good fire
right<00:01:44.909> now<00:01:45.060> we're<00:01:45.840> gonna<00:01:45.960> put<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.290> under

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
right now we're gonna put it under

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.749 
right now we're gonna put it under
barrel<00:01:46.829> on<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.040> think<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.549> going<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.700> be

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
barrel on it I think it's going to be

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.639 
barrel on it I think it's going to be
the<00:01:47.909> noob<00:01:48.060> tube<00:01:48.329> yeah<00:01:48.840> as<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.350> guys<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:49.590> see

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
the noob tube yeah as you guys can see

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.590 
the noob tube yeah as you guys can see
noob<00:01:49.890> tube<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.310> as<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.060> guys<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.329> see<00:01:51.390> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
noob tube and as you guys can see the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.389 
noob tube and as you guys can see the
fire<00:01:51.780> rate<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.140> much<00:01:52.439> higher<00:01:52.500> well<00:01:53.040> not<00:01:53.250> much

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
fire rate is much higher well not much

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.969 
fire rate is much higher well not much
higher<00:01:53.670> but<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.270> certainly<00:01:54.540> higher<00:01:54.899> now<00:01:55.619> if

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
higher but it's certainly higher now if

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:56.959 
higher but it's certainly higher now if
you<00:01:56.159> guys<00:01:56.280> want<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.490> use<00:01:56.579> this<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.850> your

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
you guys want to use this to your

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.420 
you guys want to use this to your
advantage<00:01:57.030> sure<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.659> mean<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.170> don't<00:01:59.130> think<00:01:59.310> it's

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
advantage sure I mean I don't think it's

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.130 
advantage sure I mean I don't think it's
an<00:01:59.729> actual<00:02:00.030> glitch<00:02:00.329> i<00:02:00.450> think<00:02:00.659> it's<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:00.869> an

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
an actual glitch i think it's just an

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.709 
an actual glitch i think it's just an
easter<00:02:01.409> egg<00:02:01.439> now<00:02:02.100> here<00:02:02.430> comes<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:03.180> op<00:02:03.360> the

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
easter egg now here comes the op the

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.050 
easter egg now here comes the op the
exact<00:02:04.110> opposite<00:02:04.680> with<00:02:04.860> fa<00:02:05.189> d<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:05.820> without

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
exact opposite with fa d this is without

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.999 
exact opposite with fa d this is without
underbarrel<00:02:06.719> as<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.170> guys<00:02:07.290> can<00:02:07.500> see<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.860> rap

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
underbarrel as you guys can see the rap

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.180 
underbarrel as you guys can see the rap
the<00:02:08.849> rate<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.030> fire

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
the rate of fire

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.580 
the rate of fire
I rapid<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:10.840> we're<00:02:11.840> going<00:02:11.990> to<00:02:12.020> be<00:02:12.140> switching

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
I rapid and we're going to be switching

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.550 
I rapid and we're going to be switching
to<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:13.430> f80<00:02:14.180> webinar<00:02:14.660> underbarrel<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:15.350> think

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
to the f80 webinar underbarrel I think

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.140 
to the f80 webinar underbarrel I think
it's<00:02:15.680> also<00:02:15.800> going<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:16.010> be<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.160> noob<00:02:16.370> tube<00:02:16.610> yeah

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
it's also going to be a noob tube yeah

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.270 
it's also going to be a noob tube yeah
here<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.510> guys<00:02:17.600> can<00:02:17.810> see<00:02:17.960> no<00:02:18.530> ammo<00:02:18.830> but<00:02:19.040> still

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
here you guys can see no ammo but still

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.210 
here you guys can see no ammo but still
noob<00:02:19.460> tube<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:19.880> it's<00:02:20.780> much<00:02:21.290> lower<00:02:21.590> you<00:02:21.860> can

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
noob tube and it's much lower you can

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.520 
noob tube and it's much lower you can
see<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.490> ammo<00:02:22.730> go<00:02:22.850> down<00:02:23.000> much<00:02:23.330> lower<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.900> I

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
see the ammo go down much lower and I

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.600 
see the ammo go down much lower and I
think<00:02:24.650> that's<00:02:24.740> a<00:02:24.950> pretty<00:02:25.070> cool<00:02:25.310> glitch<00:02:25.490> i

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
think that's a pretty cool glitch i

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.680 
think that's a pretty cool glitch i
think<00:02:25.790> you<00:02:25.850> can<00:02:25.940> really<00:02:26.090> use<00:02:26.210> this<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.600> your

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
think you can really use this to your

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.140 
think you can really use this to your
advantage<00:02:26.830> certainly<00:02:27.830> don't<00:02:28.550> equip<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.910> new

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
advantage certainly don't equip a new

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.760 
advantage certainly don't equip a new
tube<00:02:29.420> don't<00:02:29.690> equip<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.020> anyway<00:02:30.290> unless<00:02:30.620> you

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
tube don't equip it anyway unless you

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.430 
tube don't equip it anyway unless you
want<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:31.220> higher<00:02:31.490> rate<00:02:31.760> of<00:02:31.790> fire<00:02:32.030> anyway<00:02:32.870> thanks

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
want a higher rate of fire anyway thanks

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.890 
want a higher rate of fire anyway thanks
for<00:02:33.470> watching<00:02:33.770> guys
