00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
it's beyond me right now the easiest way

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.799 
it's beyond me right now the easiest way
from<00:00:37.550> your<00:00:37.670> clothes<00:00:37.850> myself<00:00:38.239> is<00:00:38.390> probably<00:00:38.690> to

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
from your clothes myself is probably to

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:40.660 
from your clothes myself is probably to
kind<00:00:39.109> of<00:00:39.140> go<00:00:39.230> back<00:00:39.260> to<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:39.710> original<00:00:40.039> way<00:00:40.489> that

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
kind of go back to the original way that

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.639 
kind of go back to the original way that
people<00:00:40.940> probably<00:00:41.780> clothe<00:00:42.050> themselves<00:00:42.199> and<00:00:42.559> as

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
people probably clothe themselves and as

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.160 
people probably clothe themselves and as
animal<00:00:43.039> skins<00:00:43.339> they're<00:00:44.300> very<00:00:44.510> convenient<00:00:44.870> and

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
animal skins they're very convenient and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.069 
animal skins they're very convenient and
we<00:00:45.679> do<00:00:45.829> have<00:00:46.039> rabbit<00:00:46.609> here<00:00:46.879> and<00:00:47.659> we<00:00:47.780> want<00:00:47.960> to

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079

use all the parts of the rabbit at this

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.110 
use all the parts of the rabbit at this
point<00:00:49.760> our<00:00:50.030> process<00:00:50.920> does<00:00:51.920> use<00:00:52.339> every<00:00:52.760> single

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
point our process does use every single

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.450 
point our process does use every single
part<00:00:53.329> of<00:00:53.389> the<00:00:53.479> rabbit<00:00:53.809> even<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.530> head<00:00:54.710> becomes

other<00:00:58.670> birds<00:00:58.940> of<00:00:59.120> prey<00:00:59.679> so<00:01:00.679> we've<00:01:01.399> learned<00:01:01.519> to

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
other birds of prey so we've learned to

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.780 
other birds of prey so we've learned to
tan<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:01.879> hides<00:01:02.179> now<00:01:02.749> here's<00:01:02.960> one<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:03.920> it's

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
tan the hides now here's one and it's

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.450 
tan the hides now here's one and it's
not<00:01:05.180> a<00:01:05.210> real<00:01:05.390> big<00:01:05.570> one<00:01:05.690> nice<00:01:06.080> color<00:01:06.409> gray<00:01:07.159> they

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
not a real big one nice color gray they

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.460 
not a real big one nice color gray they
come<00:01:07.580> in<00:01:07.670> all<00:01:07.790> colors<00:01:07.940> Gray's<00:01:08.720> blacks<00:01:08.990> and

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.380 
come in all colors Gray's blacks and
whites<00:01:10.130> and<00:01:10.430> spotted<00:01:10.820> and<00:01:10.969> all<00:01:11.030> kinds<00:01:11.360> of

whites and spotted and all kinds of

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.770 
whites and spotted and all kinds of
things<00:01:11.450> this<00:01:12.079> one's<00:01:12.289> fairly<00:01:13.570> fairly<00:01:14.570> flexible

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
things this one's fairly fairly flexible

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.200 
things this one's fairly fairly flexible
that's<00:01:15.259> the<00:01:15.409> goal<00:01:15.590> is<00:01:15.740> to<00:01:15.770> get<00:01:15.950> a<00:01:16.009> nice<00:01:16.210> healt

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
that's the goal is to get a nice healt

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.020 
that's the goal is to get a nice healt
that<00:01:17.570> is<00:01:17.689> really<00:01:17.960> flexible<00:01:18.320> this<00:01:18.979> one<00:01:19.250> didn't

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
that is really flexible this one didn't

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.700 
that is really flexible this one didn't
go<00:01:20.060> so<00:01:20.210> well<00:01:20.450> I<00:01:20.659> think<00:01:20.840> this<00:01:21.140> one<00:01:21.289> was<00:01:21.380> probably

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
go so well I think this one was probably

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.529 
go so well I think this one was probably
done<00:01:21.890> in<00:01:22.039> a<00:01:22.219> shore<00:01:22.579> in<00:01:22.670> Cal<00:01:22.939> we've<00:01:23.240> done<00:01:23.390> some

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
done in a shore in Cal we've done some

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.090 
done in a shore in Cal we've done some
experiments<00:01:24.140> of<00:01:24.289> different<00:01:24.590> ways<00:01:24.829> of<00:01:25.009> doing

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
experiments of different ways of doing

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.539 
experiments of different ways of doing
it<00:01:25.280> and<00:01:25.460> it<00:01:25.850> looks<00:01:26.119> like<00:01:26.180> it's<00:01:26.719> not<00:01:26.810> that<00:01:26.869> great

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
it and it looks like it's not that great

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.590 
it and it looks like it's not that great
also<00:01:28.549> some<00:01:28.700> of<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:28.820> fur<00:01:29.000> came<00:01:29.240> off<00:01:29.359> on<00:01:29.390> this

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
also some of the fur came off on this

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.120 
also some of the fur came off on this
side<00:01:29.840> which<00:01:30.109> which<00:01:30.409> we<00:01:30.530> could<00:01:30.649> do<00:01:30.710> on<00:01:30.799> purpose

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
side which which we could do on purpose

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.419 
side which which we could do on purpose
sometime<00:01:31.549> if<00:01:32.420> we<00:01:32.539> wanted<00:01:32.780> to<00:01:32.899> but<00:01:33.079> for<00:01:33.229> now

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
sometime if we wanted to but for now

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:35.859 
sometime if we wanted to but for now
we're<00:01:34.429> trying<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.729> get<00:01:34.820> a<00:01:34.880> good<00:01:35.240> process<00:01:35.479> to

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
we're trying to get a good process to

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.959 
we're trying to get a good process to
make<00:01:36.049> really<00:01:36.380> soft<00:01:36.619> ones<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.399> best<00:01:37.609> we've<00:01:37.789> got

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:37.969 
make really soft ones the best we've got

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:42.340 
make really soft ones the best we've got
is<00:01:38.149> using<00:01:39.100> Toninho<00:01:40.100> which<00:01:40.399> is<00:01:40.549> tannin<00:01:41.350> the

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
is using Toninho which is tannin the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.840 
is using Toninho which is tannin the
tannins<00:01:42.799> come<00:01:43.159> from<00:01:43.369> a<00:01:43.399> tree<00:01:43.579> called<00:01:43.759> the

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
tannins come from a tree called the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.370 
tannins come from a tree called the
mimosa<00:01:44.270> tree<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:46.689> that<00:01:47.689> tree<00:01:47.960> doesn't<00:01:48.289> grow

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
mimosa tree and that tree doesn't grow

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.749 
mimosa tree and that tree doesn't grow
here<00:01:48.799> what<00:01:49.009> to<00:01:49.100> do<00:01:49.189> is<00:01:49.280> they<00:01:49.369> peel<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.609> bark

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
here what to do is they peel the bark

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.249 
here what to do is they peel the bark
off<00:01:49.969> of<00:01:50.119> it<00:01:50.240> grind<00:01:50.450> it<00:01:50.509> up<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:50.719> then<00:01:50.869> we<00:01:50.960> use<00:01:51.109> it

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
off of it grind it up and then we use it

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.700 
off of it grind it up and then we use it
I<00:01:51.439> would<00:01:52.070> rather<00:01:52.310> use<00:01:52.670> a<00:01:53.560> tannin<00:01:54.560> that's

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
I would rather use a tannin that's

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.469 
I would rather use a tannin that's
already<00:01:54.890> here<00:01:55.249> Oaks<00:01:55.579> have<00:01:55.850> a<00:01:55.880> lot<00:01:56.060> of<00:01:56.090> tannin

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
already here Oaks have a lot of tannin

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.359 
already here Oaks have a lot of tannin
we<00:01:56.570> have<00:01:56.689> a<00:01:56.719> lot<00:01:56.840> of<00:01:56.869> Oaks<00:01:57.109> I<00:01:57.409> don't<00:01:58.130> want<00:01:58.310> to

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
we have a lot of Oaks I don't want to

00:01:58.369 --> 00:01:59.859 
we have a lot of Oaks I don't want to
peel<00:01:58.549> the<00:01:58.670> bark<00:01:58.820> off<00:01:59.030> them<00:01:59.299> because<00:01:59.630> that's

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
peel the bark off them because that's

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.499 
peel the bark off them because that's
actually<00:02:00.320> that<00:02:00.469> hurts<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:00.979> tree<00:02:01.390> maybe<00:02:02.390> we

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
actually that hurts the tree maybe we

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:03.249 
actually that hurts the tree maybe we
could<00:02:02.659> figure<00:02:02.780> out<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:02.960> way<00:02:03.049> to<00:02:03.109> do<00:02:03.170> it

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
could figure out a way to do it

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.200 
could figure out a way to do it
sustainably<00:02:03.409> but<00:02:03.979> since<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.819> tannins<00:02:05.149> are

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
sustainably but since the tannins are

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.809 
sustainably but since the tannins are
all<00:02:05.329> through<00:02:05.539> the<00:02:05.659> tree<00:02:05.869> I'd<00:02:06.049> rather<00:02:06.229> use

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
all through the tree I'd rather use

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.700 
all through the tree I'd rather use
tannins<00:02:07.819> from<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.330> acorns<00:02:08.810> or<00:02:09.020> leaves<00:02:09.500> or

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
tannins from the acorns or leaves or

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.380 
tannins from the acorns or leaves or
something<00:02:09.890> that<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:10.789> doesn't<00:02:11.150> kill<00:02:11.270> the

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
something that that doesn't kill the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.840 
something that that doesn't kill the
tree<00:02:11.540> off<00:02:11.690> of<00:02:12.590> course<00:02:12.830> those<00:02:13.100> options<00:02:13.730> are

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
tree off of course those options are

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.240 
tree off of course those options are
both<00:02:14.300> better<00:02:14.570> than<00:02:14.900> using<00:02:15.170> alum<00:02:15.710> which<00:02:16.100> is

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
both better than using alum which is

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.570 
both better than using alum which is
common<00:02:16.670> it's<00:02:16.820> a<00:02:16.970> toxic<00:02:17.420> chemical

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
common it's a toxic chemical

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.020 
common it's a toxic chemical
and<00:02:19.290> we<00:02:20.290> don't<00:02:20.380> want<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.680> do<00:02:20.770> that<00:02:20.890> we<00:02:21.760> want<00:02:21.940> to

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
and we don't want to do that we want to

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.490 
and we don't want to do that we want to
I<00:02:22.180> mean<00:02:22.390> I<00:02:22.450> tried<00:02:22.630> it<00:02:22.750> once<00:02:23.020> it<00:02:23.170> worked<00:02:23.380> great

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
I mean I tried it once it worked great

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.560 
I mean I tried it once it worked great
but<00:02:23.890> why<00:02:24.430> use<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.610> toxic<00:02:25.030> thing<00:02:25.210> when<00:02:25.330> we<00:02:25.420> can

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
but why use a toxic thing when we can

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.410 
but why use a toxic thing when we can
use<00:02:25.690> something<00:02:25.900> from<00:02:26.140> nature<00:02:27.150> let's<00:02:28.150> take<00:02:28.390> a

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
use something from nature let's take a

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
use something from nature let's take a
look<00:02:28.600> at<00:02:28.780> what<00:02:29.410> we<00:02:29.470> can<00:02:29.620> do<00:02:29.740> with<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.240> here's<00:02:31.240> a

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
look at what we can do with it here's a

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.260 
look at what we can do with it here's a
here's<00:02:32.440> a<00:02:32.500> model<00:02:32.800> hat<00:02:33.160> this<00:02:33.670> is<00:02:33.910> one<00:02:34.060> I've<00:02:34.180> had

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
here's a model hat this is one I've had

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.190 
here's a model hat this is one I've had
for<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.480> long<00:02:34.570> time<00:02:34.750> this<00:02:34.900> one's<00:02:35.050> actually

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
for a long time this one's actually

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.410 
for a long time this one's actually
sheepskin<00:02:35.770> very<00:02:36.430> nice<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:36.820> soft<00:02:37.030> they<00:02:37.240> put

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
sheepskin very nice and soft they put

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.570 
sheepskin very nice and soft they put
the<00:02:37.540> fur<00:02:37.720> on<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.930> inside<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:39.130> I've<00:02:39.280> worn<00:02:39.430> this

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
the fur on the inside and I've worn this

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.730 
the fur on the inside and I've worn this
around<00:02:39.880> it's<00:02:40.450> a<00:02:40.630> very<00:02:40.810> warm<00:02:41.050> if<00:02:41.260> you're<00:02:41.290> really

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
around it's a very warm if you're really

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.790 
around it's a very warm if you're really
cold<00:02:41.920> you<00:02:42.160> could<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:43.180> know<00:02:43.300> that<00:02:44.080> doesn't

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
cold you could you know that doesn't

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.980 
cold you could you know that doesn't
look<00:02:44.860> as<00:02:45.040> good<00:02:47.040> but<00:02:48.600> enjoy<00:02:49.600> it<00:02:49.660> it's<00:02:49.870> only

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
look as good but enjoy it it's only

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.180 
look as good but enjoy it it's only
three<00:02:50.230> pieces<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:50.770> they're<00:02:50.860> sewed<00:02:51.040> together

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
three pieces and they're sewed together

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.630 
three pieces and they're sewed together
so<00:02:52.150> we<00:02:52.300> use<00:02:52.420> this<00:02:52.570> as<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:52.780> model<00:02:53.170> before<00:02:54.130> making

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
so we use this as a model before making

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.980 
so we use this as a model before making
this<00:02:54.820> our<00:02:55.150> first<00:02:55.390> rabbit<00:02:55.750> hat<00:02:57.750> it's<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.780> little

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
this our first rabbit hat it's a little

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.320 
this our first rabbit hat it's a little
big<00:03:01.110> it's<00:03:02.110> very<00:03:02.140> soft<00:03:02.560> which<00:03:03.010> is<00:03:03.040> nice<00:03:03.400> and

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
big it's very soft which is nice and

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.930 
big it's very soft which is nice and
I'll<00:03:05.110> definitely<00:03:05.560> keep<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:05.800> warm<00:03:06.040> also<00:03:06.640> it<00:03:07.180> is

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
I'll definitely keep you warm also it is

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.720 
I'll definitely keep you warm also it is
reversible<00:03:10.620> so<00:03:11.620> that<00:03:11.770> if<00:03:11.860> I<00:03:11.980> wanted<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.490> I

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
reversible so that if I wanted to I

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.020 
reversible so that if I wanted to I
could<00:03:15.730> switch<00:03:16.180> it<00:03:16.210> inside<00:03:16.690> out<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.910> wear<00:03:18.910> it

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
could switch it inside out and wear it

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.560 
could switch it inside out and wear it
this<00:03:19.180> way<00:03:19.240> oh<00:03:22.800> it's<00:03:23.800> so<00:03:23.950> soft<00:03:24.160> on<00:03:24.340> my<00:03:24.459> head<00:03:24.640> this

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
this way oh it's so soft on my head this

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.810 
this way oh it's so soft on my head this
would<00:03:25.780> keep<00:03:25.900> you<00:03:26.050> even<00:03:26.320> warmer<00:03:26.620> when<00:03:27.550> design

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
would keep you even warmer when design

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.550 
would keep you even warmer when design
improvement<00:03:28.300> could<00:03:28.420> be<00:03:28.570> to<00:03:28.720> use<00:03:29.140> two<00:03:29.380> layers

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
improvement could be to use two layers

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.370 
improvement could be to use two layers
of<00:03:29.740> rabbit<00:03:30.240> and<00:03:31.240> have<00:03:31.630> rabbit<00:03:31.900> fur<00:03:32.080> on<00:03:32.200> both

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
of rabbit and have rabbit fur on both

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.280 
of rabbit and have rabbit fur on both
sides<00:03:32.620> so<00:03:32.830> it<00:03:32.860> looks<00:03:33.160> cool<00:03:33.400> from<00:03:33.430> from<00:03:34.360> the

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
sides so it looks cool from from the

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.140 
sides so it looks cool from from the
outside<00:03:35.620> and<00:03:35.920> it<00:03:36.070> also<00:03:36.280> is<00:03:36.520> really<00:03:36.670> comfy<00:03:37.060> on

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
outside and it also is really comfy on

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.850 
outside and it also is really comfy on
the<00:03:37.209> inside<00:03:37.510> I<00:03:37.720> would<00:03:38.290> double<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.620> amount<00:03:38.800> of

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
the inside I would double the amount of

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.380 
the inside I would double the amount of
rabbit<00:03:39.130> skins<00:03:39.370> used<00:03:39.700> and<00:03:40.000> you'd<00:03:40.150> have<00:03:40.240> to

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
rabbit skins used and you'd have to

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.850 
rabbit skins used and you'd have to
probably<00:03:40.540> have<00:03:40.690> a<00:03:40.750> really<00:03:41.080> cold<00:03:41.320> climate<00:03:41.380> or

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
probably have a really cold climate or

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.980 
probably have a really cold climate or
your<00:03:41.980> head<00:03:42.130> would<00:03:42.310> bake<00:03:42.730> because<00:03:43.540> these<00:03:43.870> are

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
your head would bake because these are
