00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.230
 point net and I take advantage of the uncertainty 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.119
 this moment of returns to say that 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.060
 just released the virtualbox course 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:35.240
 online is valid and that you can see it now 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.829
 then online for free without dropping the 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.109
 pasta 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.469
 here you access the course you are watching 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:44.359
 ok are the embedded videos 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.609
 illustrators good as it is good be 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:49.190
 as it is for the only thing that I would ask you is 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.269
 that you encourage to share it and that 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.890
 reach as many people as possible 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.559
 also whoever wants to continue 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.299
 thus contributing asking for the course to 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.430
 see the computers quietly with a 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:02.229
 tablet or offline can also 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:05.539
 do it and I will stay enormously 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:09.140
 grateful well that we're going to see sometimes 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:11.270
 I'm wrong, and I'm not going 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.030
 talking the news out there but sometimes 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.610
 I'm wrong and I skid a click 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.799
 a mouse escapes that way out there by 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.640
 example well I'm here I do not know if there 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.640
 something here to see 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.490
 let's see good message for example 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.490
 I'm watching the news of the stock market 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.310
 I do not know what we are 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.890
 like 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.750
 of the bag and such and then for example I 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.890
 I go back to the beginning and now I want to see the 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.080
 time I'm that weird hobbies are 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.159
 mine 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.100
 so then I want to see the time 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.320
 I want to see him and I do not know how much but what 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.950
 would happen if I wanted to for example by 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.409
 example then have a view of time 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.110
 and such and a view of the bag in a 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.820
 screen as I have 15 screens well in 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.740
 a key I open the bag 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.789
 what closes waiting I open the 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.899
 weather 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.899
 I opened the bag 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.050
 with this broth as it is very easy click 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.410
 that and displaced the loose one and 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.970
 once released 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.210
 I come to here and open the time 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.130
 and here I have the view of the time in 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.760
 and big bag here that 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.890
 I want upside down waters and here I have the 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.230
 view of time as we see it engages 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.000
 perfectly to the side and here and now 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.160
 You can check my news from the stock exchange 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.870
 I want it backwards then I skewer and what 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.560
 step here to see if an agreement without clarified 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.950
 ok I want this little one so what 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.690
 We've done it before so it better not and 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.390
 they are coupling and all this goes 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.790
 working very well is a bullshit but 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.620
 I think it 's a bullshit that's cool 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.450
 and that more than one is going to pay that 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.500
 I want to be an application directly 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.959
 he caught her even though this one in tiny 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.670
 pulls down and automatically the 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.220
 another one maximizes that I want to go back to 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.590
 desk because nothing comes to me here and 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.420
 I know that for example I can put 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.170
 this is news 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.690
 and now for having 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.000
 news here I was loading and the bag 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.520
 I do not want to reverse what we have 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.010
 seen before the bag here in large and 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.720
 such is the bag here in tiny 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.130
 news here I'm looking at the news and 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.530
 so and on the other screen I can 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.110
 have other things I have monitors 12 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.180
 15 but yes and well then a little thing 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.050
 interesting that I think more than one 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.670
 then you'll like 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.760
 better to close these applications 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.370
 to know that they open from start the 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.160
 screen click above we put the 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.990
 up the little hand cursor appears and 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:54.650
 down with this the same 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.970
 and this is all friends I hope that I have 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.040
 liked the video good simply because 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.900
 I wanted to show this curiosity as 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.000
 that I'm learning because I try to 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.690
 you too the now that either 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.340
 it is for so much the discovery 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.560
 and well, nothing reminds everyone that 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.630
 it's very important for blog that 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.500
 We recommend that you share these videos 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.500
 if you are cool or what 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.760
 billionaires and you want to make a 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.690
 Court of 45 million euros without 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.480
 problem 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.480
 have friends see you later
