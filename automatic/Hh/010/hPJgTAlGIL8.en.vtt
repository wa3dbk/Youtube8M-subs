00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.330 
neat and tidy hollier so I think drifter
is<00:04:11.600> a<00:04:11.630> voice<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:12.260> I<00:04:12.290> think<00:04:12.620> that<00:04:12.770> he<00:04:12.860> does<00:04:13.070> have

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.920 
is a voice and I think that he does have
a<00:04:13.370> point<00:04:13.760> of<00:04:13.940> view<00:04:14.000> and<00:04:14.210> I<00:04:14.300> think<00:04:14.540> that<00:04:14.660> he<00:04:14.750> does

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
a point of view and I think that he does

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.870 
a point of view and I think that he does
sometimes<00:04:15.140> step<00:04:15.590> up<00:04:15.710> for<00:04:15.890> the<00:04:15.950> masses<00:04:16.310> and<00:04:16.460> you
