to<00:00:29.130> pour<00:00:29.250> all<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:29.820> because<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.210> want<00:00:30.359> to

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
to pour all of it in because you want to

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.600 
to pour all of it in because you want to
make<00:00:30.510> sure<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:31.289> have<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.529> well<00:00:31.980> mixed<00:00:32.399> and

make sure you you have it well mixed and

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.580 
make sure you you have it well mixed and
putting<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.420> parts<00:00:33.719> definitely<00:00:34.200> helps<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
putting it in parts definitely helps the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.200 
putting it in parts definitely helps the
speed<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.430> we're<00:00:35.520> going<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.700> put<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> lid<00:00:36.180> on

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
speed so we're going to put the lid on

way on and we're going to start off with

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.080 
way on and we're going to start off with
the<00:00:42.059> speed<00:00:42.329> all<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.690> way<00:00:42.899> down<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.800> 7%<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.700> hit

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
the speed all the way down to 7% and hit

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.270 
the speed all the way down to 7% and hit
start

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.670 

and<00:00:48.700> you're<00:00:48.820> gonna<00:00:48.910> slowly

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
and you're gonna slowly

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.740 
and you're gonna slowly
pick<00:00:51.190> up<00:00:51.310> the<00:00:51.430> speed<00:00:51.640> so<00:00:51.880> about<00:00:52.000> 25%

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
pick up the speed so about 25%

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.709 
pick up the speed so about 25%
let<00:00:54.050> that<00:00:54.230> sugar<00:00:54.530> get<00:00:54.710> nice<00:00:54.860> too<00:00:55.010> mixed<00:00:55.280> up

to add the rest of it to the container

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.219 
to add the rest of it to the container
and<00:01:02.899> once<00:01:03.170> again<00:01:03.320> seal<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.850> top<00:01:05.059> and<00:01:05.420> again

and once again seal the top and again
we're<00:01:06.470> going<00:01:06.590> to<00:01:06.650> start<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.280> quiet<00:01:07.490> one<00:01:07.729> at

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.070 

and<00:02:04.260> this<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> cordial<00:02:05.400> so<00:02:05.970> it<00:02:06.570> does<00:02:06.870> of

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
and this is a cordial so it does of

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.680 
and this is a cordial so it does of
course<00:02:07.110> have<00:02:07.440> sugar<00:02:07.680> but<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.209> case<00:02:09.390> just

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
course have sugar but just a case just

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.140 
course have sugar but just a case just
to<00:02:09.810> get<00:02:09.929> these<00:02:10.170> kumquats<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.670> know<00:02:11.760> cut<00:02:12.000> up<00:02:12.090> a

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
to get these kumquats you know cut up a

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.670 
to get these kumquats you know cut up a
little<00:02:12.300> bit<00:02:12.450> more<00:02:12.630> to<00:02:13.020> start<00:02:13.260> we're<00:02:13.500> going<00:02:13.620> to

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
little bit more to start we're going to

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.680 
little bit more to start we're going to
put<00:02:13.920> these<00:02:14.040> in<00:02:14.220> first<00:02:14.520> without<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.120> sugar<00:02:15.540> I

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
put these in first without the sugar I

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.780 
put these in first without the sugar I
find<00:02:16.260> setting<00:02:16.590> for<00:02:16.860> works<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.280> best<00:02:17.430> because

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
find setting for works the best because

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.150 
find setting for works the best because
it<00:02:17.940> starts<00:02:18.240> off<00:02:18.390> slow<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:18.930> then<00:02:19.100> gradually<00:02:20.100> it

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
it starts off slow and then gradually it

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.320 
it starts off slow and then gradually it
gets<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.400> little<00:02:20.490> bit<00:02:20.640> faster<00:02:21.030> for<00:02:21.060> about

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
gets a little bit faster for about

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.660 
gets a little bit faster for about
thirty<00:02:21.570> seconds<00:02:22.050> so<00:02:22.260> all<00:02:23.010> we<00:02:23.100> have<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.250> do<00:02:23.430> is

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
thirty seconds so all we have to do is

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.119 
thirty seconds so all we have to do is
hit<00:02:23.850> four

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.289 

all<00:02:29.129> right<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:29.430> after<00:02:29.519> you<00:02:29.700> get<00:02:29.819> those<00:02:29.939> chopped

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
all right so after you get those chopped

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.449 
all right so after you get those chopped
up<00:02:30.510> we're<00:02:30.959> going<00:02:31.049> to<00:02:31.110> add<00:02:31.170> our<00:02:31.409> sugar<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:32.370> you

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
up we're going to add our sugar and you

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.580 
up we're going to add our sugar and you
can<00:02:32.579> go<00:02:32.700> ahead<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.120> dump<00:02:34.109> all<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.319> it<00:02:34.500> in

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
can go ahead and dump all of it in

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.849 
can go ahead and dump all of it in
because<00:02:34.890> there's<00:02:35.069> more<00:02:35.370> more<00:02:36.359> citrus<00:02:36.859> more

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
because there's more more citrus more

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.649 
because there's more more citrus more
liquid<00:02:38.219> than<00:02:38.700> we<00:02:38.849> did<00:02:39.030> when<00:02:39.299> we<00:02:39.329> made<00:02:39.540> the

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
liquid than we did when we made the

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:40.890 
liquid than we did when we made the
ginger<00:02:39.930> syrup

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
ginger syrup

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.170

and<00:02:41.530> again<00:02:42.250> like<00:02:42.400> what<00:02:42.489> we<00:02:42.640> did<00:02:42.760> with<00:02:42.819> the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
and again like what we did with the

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.850 
and again like what we did with the
ginger<00:02:43.569> syrup<00:02:43.750> we're<00:02:44.319> going<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.530> start<00:02:44.739> off<00:02:44.830> a

little bit slow about seven percent

little bit slow about seven percent
which<00:02:47.170> is<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.349> lowest<00:02:47.440> setting<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.099> we're

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
which is the lowest setting and we're

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.580
