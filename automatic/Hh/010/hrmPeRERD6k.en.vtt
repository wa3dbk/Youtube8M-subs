just like this I'm gonna do is just give

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.120 
just like this I'm gonna do is just give
it<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> little<00:01:21.270> spin<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.530> can<00:01:22.590> see<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> four

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
it a little spin you can see the four

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.219 
it a little spin you can see the four
eights<00:01:23.310> actually<00:01:23.580> jumped<00:01:23.850> back<00:01:24.030> over<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.049> me

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
eights actually jumped back over to me

and the four fours jump to their hand
okay<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.310> thought<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.579> might<00:01:29.790> have<00:01:29.850> been<00:01:29.939> a

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
okay and I thought it might have been a

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.730 
okay and I thought it might have been a
little<00:01:30.210> bit<00:01:30.299> too<00:01:30.420> fast<00:01:30.630> for<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.869> but<00:01:31.229> I'll<00:01:31.590> do

little bit too fast for you but I'll do

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.160 
little bit too fast for you but I'll do
it<00:01:31.829> again<00:01:31.939> use<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.090> four<00:01:33.390> eights<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:33.960> time

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
it again use the four eights this time

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.840 
it again use the four eights this time
we're<00:01:34.320> gonna<00:01:34.380> give<00:01:34.590> them<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.860> ACE<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.340> we're

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
we're gonna give them the ACE and we're

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.960 
we're gonna give them the ACE and we're
going<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.030> use<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.299> Force<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.729> they<00:01:38.729> get<00:01:38.880> two

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
going to use the Force so they get two

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.260 
going to use the Force so they get two
eights

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
eights

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.219 
eights

you<00:02:11.640> know<00:02:11.760> switch<00:02:11.819> places

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
you know switch places

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.460 
you know switch places
you<00:02:13.300> just<00:02:13.540> give<00:02:13.690> them<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.810> little<00:02:13.900> bit<00:02:14.080> of<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.230> rub

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
you just give them a little bit of a rub

take four eights flip them face net now
these<00:02:49.120> can<00:02:49.780> be<00:02:50.079> any<00:02:50.549> for<00:02:51.549> overtime<00:02:51.910> both<00:02:52.390> of

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
these can be any for overtime both of

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.360 
these can be any for overtime both of
them<00:02:52.630> again<00:02:52.810> you're<00:02:53.530> gonna<00:02:53.620> take<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.099> four

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
it's just one card so then in reality

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.150

reality they're getting three eights and
a<00:03:49.540> four<00:03:49.780> so<00:03:50.620> you<00:03:50.709> set<00:03:50.889> those<00:03:51.010> in<00:03:51.130> their<00:03:51.250> hands

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
a four so you set those in their hands

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.280 
a four so you set those in their hands
make<00:03:52.269> sure<00:03:52.359> you<00:03:52.450> tell<00:03:52.870> them<00:03:52.959> to<00:03:53.019> hold<00:03:53.109> their

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
hands out like tables and then right

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.309 
hands out like tables and then right
here<00:03:55.090> you<00:03:55.209> just<00:03:55.299> count<00:03:55.630> them<00:03:55.690> off<00:03:55.870> you<00:03:56.169> have

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
here you just count them off you have

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.170 
flip it over but what I believe looks a
little<00:05:40.860> bit<00:05:41.039> better<00:05:41.280> is<00:05:41.639> when<00:05:41.820> you<00:05:41.910> take<00:05:42.060> the

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
little bit better is when you take the

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.690 
little bit better is when you take the
card<00:05:42.419> and<00:05:42.750> give<00:05:43.650> a<00:05:43.680> little<00:05:43.950> rub<00:05:44.160> and<00:05:44.400> it<00:05:44.580> looks

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
card and give a little rub and it looks

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.580 
card and give a little rub and it looks
like<00:05:44.760> it<00:05:44.940> changes<00:05:45.450> basically<00:05:46.200> what<00:05:46.470> you're

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
like it changes basically what you're

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.350 
like it changes basically what you're
doing<00:05:46.740> here<00:05:46.979> is<00:05:47.160> you<00:05:48.120> have<00:05:48.150> a<00:05:48.270> double<00:05:48.720> and

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
doing here is you have a double and

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.990 
doing here is you have a double and
you're<00:05:51.360> just<00:05:51.539> pushing<00:05:52.490> basically<00:05:53.490> pushing

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
you're just pushing basically pushing

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.350 
you're just pushing basically pushing
and<00:05:54.870> that's<00:05:55.110> called<00:05:55.320> fall<00:05:55.590> it's<00:05:56.580> not<00:05:56.699> it's<00:05:57.240> not

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
and that's called fall it's not it's not

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.810 
and that's called fall it's not it's not
that<00:05:57.510> difficult<00:05:58.110> of<00:05:58.349> a<00:05:58.470> move<00:05:58.650> but<00:05:58.979> um<00:05:59.340> takes<00:05:59.789> a

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
that difficult of a move but um takes a

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.089 
that difficult of a move but um takes a
little<00:05:59.910> bit<00:06:00.060> of<00:06:00.120> practice<00:06:00.419> and<00:06:00.479> a<00:06:00.539> college<00:06:00.780> kid

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:01.099
