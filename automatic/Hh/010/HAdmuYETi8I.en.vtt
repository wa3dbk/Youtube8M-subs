00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.029
 it is in the heart of the medina of Marrakech and that we find at 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.320
 middle of the fields director of rugby abdaladzé he was located right in 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.219
 neighborhood of the same name 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.999
 What did he do 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:20.099
 killer very close to the palace badii convoy maybe behind us 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:22.230
 politicians 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.210
 but this advantage of close percent compared to 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.890
 the different 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.229
 neighborhoods like mallet place end-august 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:31.909
 where the places some monuments around us like the palace badii the 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:33.270
 bahia palace 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.710
 and 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.710
 marie-adèle which is broken down into three houses united in one 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.210
 and which must date from the period roughly 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.600
 18th century 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.000
 we have residents 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.460
 to the individual who come through 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.760
 internet all over the phone and then we learned at a 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.120
 to his agency 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.170
 the Moroccan 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.750
 who represents us and then international agencies that pursues produce 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.100
 trips to Morocco 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.700
 in totality three types of individual customers 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.430
 e but also everything in his life 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.479
 today we especially his invitation authenticity tradition 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.180
 as I said I meant that families or groups 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.460
 so in formula 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.560
 at for example and that's how it formulates to the nights with the 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.570
 breakfast 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.820
 through formulas that are not titillating with the help of the discovery of 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.210
 the representative of time 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.080
 to wait there 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.470
 e and then we also have a whole part that is dedicated to the outlines of what 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.200
 will do compared to companies 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.399
 kingston like his little ones 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.100
 these miners 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.300
 - alternating stay the establishment of a specification allow to 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.040
 better supervise couples 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.690
 I think it would be a very good thing a very good thing for the 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.350
 download in seconds 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.939
 to refer follow as for example with the losses today that is done 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.440
 in orbit and related to Morocco 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.870
 he did not mention the charges to be respected 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.340
 for now we have goals to achieve 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.470
 in europe 1 in the cid and means of communication to make available 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.809
 of our customers 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:11.219
 and I think it's obvious not to be the same for the operators 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:12.399
 tourist 

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:15.839
 finding his stay to propose a circuit on Morocco it is necessary that it 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:17.229
 fits in the same frame 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:20.229
 I think these activists but I think these are a guarantee of seriousness 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:24.139
 from operators in europe 1 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:26.690
 and then I became confident about 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.479
 back to customers who actually go to Morocco 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:32.859
 and it has all the applications Morocco a bordering destination 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:34.290
 wood 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.079
 notice in the morning because the breeds pledge of serious and lifetime warranty 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.079
 for 67% by proposing 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.569
 e the axes that have been recommended for this 2020 vision, that is to say 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.579
 the patrimony 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.509
 yes the rural 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:52.919
 e wellbeing if I believe 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:58.129
 e so it is in this service that we can not go we are already 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.759
 in a little while 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:03.009
 the other interest that it is in place according to me beauquier 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.090
 percent and that drivers are also offered to see them this or that 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.979
 monument 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:10.489
 because they are all their interests 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.489
 I think this 2020 vision and it's a very good thing 

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:17.149
 p hope we will not be the only ones to 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.819
 to do it because it's not something that's going to be done in a way 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:24.849
 in this top anyway as a loner I think it's really a 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.689
 grouping phenomenon 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:31.219
 % and more we will be many atrocious temptation since we can remember 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:34.129
 and then I think the results will be positive and it's 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:35.719
 interesting 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:39.159
 a defeat recycling project may soon see the light of day 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.770
 provided that the future professionals and local actors that they are part 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:44.450
 involved 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.309
 for the common good very very specific examples 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:50.759
 so we are currently working on the idea of ​​god 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:51.600
 developed at 1 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.129
 a small neighborhood network as part of the raelian hunting movement 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:57.939
 who could mans 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:58.999
 harvested 

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:01.989
 everything that is recyclable that we will talk about bottles 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.459
 plastics and glass bottles of plants 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.119
 we would have only through his brigade of proximity with the others 

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:11.109
 I accept 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.239
 to embark on the same path that would allow us 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.059
 obviously from the udc not to hire someone 

00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:18.989
 with his brown ass that his plow 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.840
 to harvest all these elements and then put them in in a 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.759
 container 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:28.919
 who what today say and for what will be sorted is in this climate a 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.249
 part will leave at 15h for example for all that is more typical green 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:34.400
 all these plants will leave in an area 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.229
 in a family on a farm 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:37.569
 for compost 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.500
 because it's an example obviously we do not understand choice of solutions 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:43.360
 concerted partners always 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.669
 e associative so it's neighborhood whether it's region 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.439
 m because you feel so why not to consequence 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:54.830
 it takes time for that 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.699
 the workforce is reached 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:57.779
 when I think that 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:01.509
 however, it would be useful to have access to training 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:04.379
 where at least 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:06.639
 to have the information 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.219
 not easy to see 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:09.900
 that's what we miss 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.300
 it's a call to better information party brest expects without 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.350
 doubt for these trials to unfold as expected both senses publicis va 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.650
 continue articulated ap 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.650
 he threatens recovery 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:24.129
