00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello very good to all welcome to 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.130
 channel of home experiments today we're going 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.130
 to make a review lamp 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.870
 one need glue stick 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.720
 gun fuse theme cellophane red paper 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:20.000
 scissors and cutter a bit of brass tape 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.710
 adhesive of any kind a small 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.110
 led lamps if they have behind 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.849
 better adhesive and some templates that you 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.930
 we leave below in the description come back and 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.150
 for this the first thing that we have to 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.520
 make is with the scissors trim the 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.790
 templates 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.630
 Gasteiz 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.630
 we remember 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.190
 and once cut in the six 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.640
 templates we take a piece of cardboard and 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.640
 we activate it 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.450
 next with great patience 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.160
 we have to go with the cutter cutting 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.670
 all the little red squares of the 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.670
 templates 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.710
 you have to be very careful with the cutter 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.010
 If you are younger ask for help from a 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.010
 adult 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.710
 once we have trimmed the 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.930
 six pieces we have to do 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.619
 squares of the same size with the 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.619
 red cellophane 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.520
 do not worry if it does not stay exactly 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:47.100
 the same size since this is going to go by 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.100
 inside and it does not go away and we stick it 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.960
 and we repeat the same process with the 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.450
 another 5 put to heat the gun 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.430
 I have possible and while it is heated with 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.070
 a little tape we are going to prepare a 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.990
 small mechanism to make a lid 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.860
 where are we going to put 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.860
 our side 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.950
 and ready once the gun is hot 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.950
 we are going to hit the faces 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.510
 we have to paste all the faces not to 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.470
 the base but to the side face to 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.470
 to be able to make this movement 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.030
 we fix it with more hot silicone 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.340
 we put it well before it dries 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.890
 and we continue ham 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.709
 and I would be almost ready finally 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.020
 we have to place the lamp here 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:57.040
 we turn it on 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.040
 and let's try 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.720
 normal 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.500
 you can do it from all the minerals 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.640
 from minecraft and agree with you we leave the 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.750
 templates in the links of the 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.100

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.400

 a text lamp 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:57.330
 coinciding the rat hole with 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:57.330
 the son of a lamp 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.160
 a lamp of choice 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.789
 If you are younger ask for help from a 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.560
 good to see if you are 16 years old 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.199
 Well, we do not need to later 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.050
 bombard that comment of yours but I have 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:17.810
 17 years old I just have to say to my 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.830
 parents put on heat the gun 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.490
 thermo fuse 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.490
 the cut 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.790
 to save 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:35.490
 how I hate the threads 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.490
 over here 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.060
 no no 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.060
