but<00:02:11.319> when<00:02:11.860> I<00:02:11.950> sprayed<00:02:12.670> like<00:02:12.940> if<00:02:13.540> I<00:02:14.050> put<00:02:14.290> oil<00:02:14.440> on

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
but when I sprayed like if I put oil on

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.740 
but when I sprayed like if I put oil on
it<00:02:15.190> like<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.340> little<00:02:15.550> bit<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.879> oil<00:02:16.090> I<00:02:16.390> got<00:02:16.420> this

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
it like a little bit of oil I got this

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.410 
it like a little bit of oil I got this
coconut<00:02:17.080> whim<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:18.250> when<00:02:18.430> I<00:02:18.459> put<00:02:18.819> that<00:02:19.030> on<00:02:19.239> it

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
coconut whim and when I put that on it

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.930 
coconut whim and when I put that on it
and<00:02:19.599> then<00:02:19.750> comb<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:20.290> out<00:02:20.500> like<00:02:20.769> the<00:02:21.010> waves<00:02:21.220> it's

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
and then comb it out like the waves it's

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.559 
and then comb it out like the waves it's
wavy<00:02:22.629> and<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:24.250> know<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.670> bounces<00:02:25.300> right<00:02:25.330> back

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
wavy and you know it bounces right back

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.509 
wavy and you know it bounces right back
but<00:02:26.790> hopefully<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:28.840> lasts<00:02:29.739> two<00:02:29.980> weeks<00:02:30.010> I

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
but hopefully it lasts two weeks I

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.170 
but hopefully it lasts two weeks I
honestly<00:02:31.120> don't<00:02:31.780> think<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:33.069> will<00:02:33.340> just

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
honestly don't think it will just

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.570 
honestly don't think it will just
because<00:02:34.630> but<00:02:35.099> we'll<00:02:36.099> see

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
and it was just confusing me because I

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.850 
and it was just confusing me because I
didn't<00:02:39.310> see<00:02:39.489> any<00:02:39.849> girl<00:02:40.269> saying<00:02:40.630> anything<00:02:41.560> bad
