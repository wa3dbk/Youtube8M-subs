00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.490
 hi everyone i walk on it now 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.440
 mall in houses and i am 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.210
 on the way to the albert heijn in for me 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.639
 I am really looking forward to spring and I have 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.100
 so also very much looking forward to multi 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.570
 which gives me a little spring currency 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.770
 I go shopping and go 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.289
 see what they all have at the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.160
 fresh department so my favorite 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.160
 put together a smoothie 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.090
 we can 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.280
 I just got back from groceries 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.290
 I immediately have a nice grove 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.940
 picked up at the florist to be a real one 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.100
 kind of like getting home that spring 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.989
 well i was quickly bought eventually as 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.290
 ingredients for your smootie 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.800
 I would like to show you a moment 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.780
 fresh pineapple 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.059
 i have to say very often i am lazy and 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.739
 then I buy pieces but yes is fresh anyway 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.449
 always that tastiest 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.309
 coconut 3 passion fruit and vanilla 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.400
 chopsticks and 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.690
 biogarde stir the smoothie naturally 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.360
 to make something creamier 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.280
 well this has become this yellow 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.720
 They give him flowers and it really smells 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.090
 very tasty 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.520
 these are spray roses 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.979
 and it is here and I found trace 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.710
 so together really a very beautiful one 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.270
 spring bouquet or as nice and fresh 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.280
 cheerful at home to this is ultimately 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.820
 I have a picture of this 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.350
 made 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.750
 First of all I start cutting 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.479
 the pineapple how do you know first or foremost 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.250
 ripe pineapple is what you have to do 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.450
 is you pulling on the leaves here on the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.340
 topside 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.510
 and if you can take them out quite easily 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.240
 get it 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.150
 as for example, then you know 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.380
 that he is good so all of these 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.850
 steans rhine 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:51.680
 well i start cutting the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:54.200
 top and then the back 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.060
 bottom 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.500
 then you put it like this and then you go a lot 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.030
 the cutting 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.870
 may best fat or is it all the 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.870
 features 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.369
 as you can see all of this 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.869
 those seeds still and they are not tasty 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.030
 so we are going to take it out and do it 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.480
 just with your knife or with something else 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.480
 sharply 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.030
 if you already have one if it stripped the 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:24.630
 most pitches then go do it in thick 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:26.580
 cut slices in the middle like still 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.959
 a hard core and I am going too 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.790
 removing with it can be very easy 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.740
 become through 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.040
 so to cut you can actually see it 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.040
 to sit 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.950
 yo and we are going to do this again 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.230
 well that name I want it 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.260
 coconut step out of this coconut 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.610
 collect in a bowl and then ben 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.870
 I'm doing odd jobs so I have a drill 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.640
 wines 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.380
 and these three dots are the weakest 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.500
 place of the coconut 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.500
 so at a son's point I go bora 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.709
 well as you see there is also something yes 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.690
 coconut fiber 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.320
 so I briefly threw them through a sieve 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.530
 Finally I take the vanilla and me 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.420
 first in half and then you have to 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:34.370
 a very careful when it is weird 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.370
 filleting actually by a blow 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:42.060
 cut open the gold it really half 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:47.220
 nice and sweet and yes good sleep like you 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.660
 as much as possible and that or your knife 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.930
 and we will use this for later on 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.930
 the smoothie 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.550
 it is on the side and is ready should he 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.660
 coincidentally came where there is momentarily 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.919
 stopped by and just tasted it 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.560
 or learning falls 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:34.130
 yes nice and creamy and fresh chrome give it 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.830
 just don't think for a minute 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.090
 logical and dystrophy look there I went 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.110
 before I went for something else 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.240
 tropical 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.539
 something that reminds me of spring 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.710
 and I like him would be a good 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.020
 that just already bought in principle 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.130
 but he really does very well 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.229
 indeed just think of a species 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.520
 from vacation in a cup 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.590
 well there are also completely inspired 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.330
 to make your own smoothie or juice 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.050
