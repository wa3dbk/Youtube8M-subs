halfway across the lid and I love this
adds<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.829> really<00:02:32.040> nice<00:02:32.220> pop<00:02:32.519> of<00:02:32.549> color

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.240 

so<00:02:42.000> now<00:02:42.540> I've<00:02:42.870> got<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.320> my<00:02:43.530> liking<00:02:43.740> I'm<00:02:44.070> just

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
so now I've got it to my liking I'm just

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.160 
so now I've got it to my liking I'm just
gonna<00:02:44.340> blend<00:02:44.640> out<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.060> edges<00:02:45.240> just<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.990> soften

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
gonna blend out the edges just to soften

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.630 
gonna blend out the edges just to soften
them<00:02:46.380> up<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.590> bit<00:02:46.620> because<00:02:46.890> as<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.370> can<00:02:47.490> see

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
them up a bit because as you can see

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.310 
them up a bit because as you can see
it's<00:02:47.760> quite<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.970> harsh<00:02:48.300> effect<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:48.990> it<00:02:49.110> gives

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
it's quite a harsh effect that it gives

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.620 
it's quite a harsh effect that it gives
and<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.490> definitely<00:02:50.790> want<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.150> make<00:02:51.210> this<00:02:51.420> as

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
and so I definitely want to make this as

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.780 
and so I definitely want to make this as
smokey<00:02:52.020> as<00:02:52.110> possible<00:02:52.590> once<00:02:53.160> it's<00:02:53.430> done<00:02:53.580> I'm

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
smokey as possible once it's done I'm

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.100 
smokey as possible once it's done I'm
then<00:02:54.030> going<00:02:54.270> in<00:02:54.450> with<00:02:54.570> this<00:02:54.630> color<00:02:54.900> from<00:02:55.080> the

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
then going in with this color from the

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.810 
then going in with this color from the
Naked<00:02:55.470> 3<00:02:55.500> palette<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:56.070> can't<00:02:56.400> remember<00:02:56.580> off

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
Naked 3 palette I can't remember off

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.700 
Naked 3 palette I can't remember off
hand<00:02:56.850> but<00:02:57.300> I<00:02:57.450> will<00:02:57.660> have<00:02:57.810> everything<00:02:58.230> linked

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
hand but I will have everything linked

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.040 
hand but I will have everything linked
in<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:58.890> description<00:02:59.040> box<00:02:59.550> and<00:02:59.880> but<00:03:00.570> here<00:03:00.840> I'm

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
in the description box and but here I'm

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.680 
in the description box and but here I'm
just<00:03:01.080> putting<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.220> in<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.460> outer<00:03:02.640> corner<00:03:03.480> and

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
just putting it in the outer corner and

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.650 
just putting it in the outer corner and
kind<00:03:03.990> of<00:03:04.050> like<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.200> c-shape<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:05.850> I<00:03:06.300> really

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
kind of like a c-shape and and I really

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.090 
kind of like a c-shape and and I really
like<00:03:06.810> this<00:03:06.990> I<00:03:07.140> think<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.380> just<00:03:07.470> adds<00:03:07.650> a<00:03:07.890> lot<00:03:08.040> of

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
like this I think it just adds a lot of

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.550 
like this I think it just adds a lot of
depth<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:09.210> lower<00:03:09.390> lash<00:03:09.600> line<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.230> just

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
depth to the lower lash line and just

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.270 
depth to the lower lash line and just
looks<00:03:10.860> nice<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.100> smoky<00:03:12.620> I'm<00:03:13.620> now<00:03:13.890> going<00:03:14.100> with

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
looks nice and smoky I'm now going with

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.700 
looks nice and smoky I'm now going with
a<00:03:14.310> black<00:03:14.580> color<00:03:14.850> from<00:03:14.940> urban<00:03:15.630> decay<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:16.260> I

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
a black color from urban decay and I

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.920 
a black color from urban decay and I
really<00:03:17.280> really<00:03:17.550> love<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.120> way<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.660> black

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
really really love the way the black

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.290 
really really love the way the black
looks<00:03:19.290> on<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.560> ice<00:03:19.650> but<00:03:20.010> just<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.430> tip<00:03:20.700> just<00:03:21.090> add

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
looks on the ice but just a tip just add

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.450 
looks on the ice but just a tip just add
it<00:03:21.330> really<00:03:21.870> really<00:03:22.110> slowly<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:22.590> build<00:03:23.190> the

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
it really really slowly and build the

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.610 
it really really slowly and build the
color<00:03:23.700> because<00:03:24.150> if<00:03:24.630> you<00:03:24.780> put<00:03:24.840> too<00:03:25.020> much<00:03:25.320> on

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
color because if you put too much on

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.290 
color because if you put too much on
there's<00:03:26.130> not<00:03:26.340> really<00:03:26.400> much<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:26.970> can<00:03:27.090> do<00:03:27.210> about

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
there's not really much you can do about

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.220 
there's not really much you can do about
it<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:27.750> with<00:03:27.900> black<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:28.440> want<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.770> work<00:03:28.890> slowly

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.870 

and<00:03:33.230> once<00:03:33.590> it's<00:03:33.800> all<00:03:33.920> applied<00:03:34.220> I'm<00:03:34.520> then

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
and once it's all applied I'm then

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.090 
and once it's all applied I'm then
blending<00:03:35.540> out<00:03:35.720> with<00:03:35.870> a<00:03:35.900> fluffy<00:03:36.200> brush<00:03:36.440> just<00:03:36.920> to

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
blending out with a fluffy brush just to

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.660 
blending out with a fluffy brush just to
add<00:03:37.520> a<00:03:37.940> nice<00:03:38.090> smokey<00:03:38.630> effect

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.699 

but<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.540> lower<00:03:42.690> lash<00:03:42.930> line<00:03:43.200> I'm<00:03:43.380> going<00:03:43.410> in

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
but the lower lash line I'm going in

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.530 
but the lower lash line I'm going in
with<00:03:43.740> a<00:03:43.890> color<00:03:44.099> black<00:03:44.370> art<00:03:44.640> which<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.209> from<00:03:45.450> the

Naked<00:03:45.870> 3<00:03:45.900> palette<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.830> love<00:03:47.220> this<00:03:47.459> color<00:03:47.730> is

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
Naked 3 palette and I love this color is

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.030 
Naked 3 palette and I love this color is
like<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.180> really<00:03:48.510> nice<00:03:48.750> dock<00:03:49.230> plumbing<00:03:49.860> color

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
like a really nice dock plumbing color

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.040 
like a really nice dock plumbing color
but<00:03:50.250> it's<00:03:50.370> got<00:03:50.580> slight<00:03:51.060> bit<00:03:51.569> of<00:03:51.599> glitter

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
but it's got slight bit of glitter

00:03:52.050 --> 00:04:04.309 
but it's got slight bit of glitter
through<00:03:52.319> so<00:03:52.590> it's<00:03:52.709> super<00:03:53.130> super<00:03:53.250> pretty

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.050 

so<00:04:05.319> I<00:04:05.349> decided<00:04:05.859> I<00:04:06.099> wanted<00:04:06.430> a<00:04:06.489> little<00:04:06.790> bit<00:04:06.909> more

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
so I decided I wanted a little bit more

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.360 
so I decided I wanted a little bit more
powerful<00:04:07.629> added<00:04:07.989> to<00:04:08.109> the<00:04:08.230> looks<00:04:08.439> so<00:04:08.769> I<00:04:08.799> dotted

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
powerful added to the looks so I dotted

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.030 
powerful added to the looks so I dotted
just<00:04:09.819> a<00:04:09.939> small<00:04:10.239> bit<00:04:10.269> across<00:04:10.750> my<00:04:11.019> eye<00:04:11.049> and<00:04:11.439> then

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
just a small bit across my eye and then

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.820 
just a small bit across my eye and then
I<00:04:12.099> blended<00:04:12.640> it<00:04:12.760> out<00:04:12.879> with<00:04:13.090> a<00:04:13.120> fluffy<00:04:13.359> brush

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.860 

right<00:04:18.830> so<00:04:19.160> it's<00:04:19.220> time<00:04:19.610> for<00:04:19.970> eyeliner<00:04:20.540> and

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
right so it's time for eyeliner and

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.780 
right so it's time for eyeliner and
isn't<00:04:21.290> that<00:04:21.350> just<00:04:21.709> the<00:04:21.769> worst<00:04:22.160> part<00:04:22.550> of

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
isn't that just the worst part of

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.670 
isn't that just the worst part of
putting<00:04:22.970> on<00:04:23.210> makeup<00:04:23.600> I<00:04:23.810> struggle<00:04:24.260> so<00:04:24.500> much

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
putting on makeup I struggle so much

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.530 
putting on makeup I struggle so much
with<00:04:24.740> it<00:04:25.010> mine<00:04:25.190> looks<00:04:25.460> so<00:04:25.730> messy<00:04:25.940> here<00:04:26.210> but

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
with it mine looks so messy here but

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.330 
with it mine looks so messy here but
with<00:04:27.080> this<00:04:27.230> kind<00:04:27.470> of<00:04:27.500> look<00:04:27.740> it's<00:04:27.950> kind<00:04:28.220> of<00:04:28.280> very

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
with this kind of look it's kind of very

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.820 
with this kind of look it's kind of very
grungy<00:04:29.060> look<00:04:29.270> that<00:04:29.480> I'm<00:04:29.600> going<00:04:29.630> for<00:04:29.900> so<00:04:30.410> it

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
grungy look that I'm going for so it

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.950 
grungy look that I'm going for so it
doesn't<00:04:31.250> really<00:04:31.400> matter<00:04:31.610> if<00:04:32.030> it's<00:04:32.240> not<00:04:32.600> one

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
doesn't really matter if it's not one

on now on to contouring I decided to go

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:39.350

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
for like a silvery gray color because I

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.270 
for like a silvery gray color because I
wanted<00:05:39.810> my<00:05:39.960> cheeks<00:05:40.259> to<00:05:40.500> look<00:05:40.650> very<00:05:40.680> sort<00:05:41.250> of

wanted my cheeks to look very sort of
aunt<00:05:41.639> and<00:05:41.970> I<00:05:42.419> just<00:05:42.720> thought<00:05:42.900> this<00:05:43.110> would<00:05:43.350> be

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
aunt and I just thought this would be

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.170 
aunt and I just thought this would be
slightly<00:05:43.830> different<00:05:44.070> than<00:05:44.370> using<00:05:44.639> bronzer

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
slightly different than using bronzer

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.999 
slightly different than using bronzer
and<00:05:45.360> I<00:05:45.840> actually<00:05:46.050> really<00:05:46.470> really<00:05:46.560> like<00:05:46.860> the

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
and I actually really really like the

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:49.850 
and I actually really really like the
way<00:05:47.039> that<00:05:47.340> it<00:05:47.490> looked<00:05:47.789> it's<00:05:48.210> just<00:05:48.630> a<00:05:48.930> little

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
way that it looked it's just a little

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:59.570 
way that it looked it's just a little
different<00:05:50.220> I<00:05:50.430> think

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.870 

lipstick<00:06:00.580> time<00:06:00.880> so<00:06:01.420> I<00:06:01.450> have<00:06:02.110> decided<00:06:02.140> to<00:06:02.980> use<00:06:03.640> a

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
lipstick time so I have decided to use a

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.990 
lipstick time so I have decided to use a
black<00:06:04.390> eyeliner<00:06:04.770> to<00:06:05.770> line<00:06:06.100> my<00:06:06.550> lips<00:06:06.700> now<00:06:06.970> i

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
black eyeliner to line my lips now i

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.400 
black eyeliner to line my lips now i
have<00:06:07.210> seen<00:06:07.450> quite<00:06:07.600> a<00:06:07.660> few<00:06:07.750> other<00:06:08.020> people<00:06:08.290> do

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
have seen quite a few other people do

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.170 
have seen quite a few other people do
this<00:06:08.530> so<00:06:08.710> i<00:06:08.740> do<00:06:08.860> think<00:06:09.220> it<00:06:09.340> is<00:06:09.370> safe<00:06:09.640> to<00:06:09.700> do<00:06:10.000> I'm

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
this so i do think it is safe to do I'm

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.080 
this so i do think it is safe to do I'm
but<00:06:11.110> what<00:06:11.650> I'm<00:06:11.770> doing<00:06:11.800> is<00:06:12.190> just<00:06:12.250> lining<00:06:12.670> it<00:06:12.880> and

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
but what I'm doing is just lining it and

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.550 
but what I'm doing is just lining it and
then<00:06:13.240> very<00:06:13.480> lightly<00:06:13.720> smudging<00:06:14.260> and<00:06:14.380> then

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
then very lightly smudging and then

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.680 
then very lightly smudging and then
lining<00:06:14.770> it<00:06:14.980> again<00:06:15.250> and<00:06:15.520> then<00:06:15.760> smudging<00:06:16.330> just

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
lining it again and then smudging just

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.210 
lining it again and then smudging just
to<00:06:16.810> kind<00:06:16.990> of<00:06:17.050> create<00:06:17.200> like<00:06:17.470> an<00:06:17.590> ombre<00:06:17.920> effect

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
to kind of create like an ombre effect

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.920 
to kind of create like an ombre effect
