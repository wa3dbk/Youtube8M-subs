00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.650
hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to another

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.110
session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.670
The other day I've got call from one of
my friend

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.449
who called me after looking at my website he was telling me how

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.320
he went to Singapore for training
session and you looked all over

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.580
and he could never find chilli chicken because

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.730
Indo Chinese chili chicken is so unique it belongs to the India.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.790
and today I'll show you how to make it at home

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.890
even if your home in Singapore Italy anywhere so today

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.070
to make the chilli chicken, for this preparation

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.700
I love to use dark meat cut into small
pieces

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.000
dark meat is the thigh meat of the chicken because when you fry the meat

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.780
this comes out really soft and tender. I have got some chillies

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.329
I took scissor and cut them into kind of nice

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.770
edges okay some bell peppers that is green pepper

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.400
I have got onion and what i did, i cut the onions into little

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.189
cubes and separated them out, little ajinomoto

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.340
pepper powder, egg, chopped

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.400
ginger and chopped garlic, very finely chopped

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.360
half half, nice cashew nuts see when I used to work in Park Sheraton in the

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.040
chicken they used to used whole big cashew nuts since I don't have the whole big cashew nut I'm

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.720
using broken cashew nut and for like kung pao you use peanuts

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.439
for chilli chicken Chinese style we used
to use cashew nuts

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.590
salt sugar I'm going to use just a pinch of sugar

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.350
corn flour I added just little some water so I can use it as thickening for my sauce

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.250
Have some sesame seed oil as for lot of
Chinese cooking we used to use sesame seed

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.670
oil

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.390

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.009
add 1 tablespoon of cornflour, little pinch of ajinomoto

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.220
little bit of salt and add

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.050
one egg

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.560
mix all these ingredients together

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.020

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.190
add chopped ginger and garlic

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.080
you can use lot of ginger and garlic, it gives nice flavor

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.230
ok...wow...this is beautiful

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.450

spring onion

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.440

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.100
little bit of chilli powder

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.370
and lot of times they use mixed vegetables also

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:13.370
in this preparation now add some soya sauce

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.660
ok

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.150
add little chilli garlic paste, mix it real good

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.620
ah....

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.980
what a flavor, add little ajinomoto

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.630
add little bit sugar

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.380
and little bit salt okay what we do after we add these ingredients

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.320
immediately we add chicken stock, since we don't have chicken stock

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.330
and I'm sure lot of you people cooking
at home

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.910
won't have chicken stock so what we are going to do. we're going to add water

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.610
okay see

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.130
the soya sauce, the chilli garlic sauce

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.270
and ajinomoto all these things have so much flavor

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.190
and specially we had bell pepper and these red chillies give lof of flavor to it

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.540
so don't worry if you don't have chicken stock. one of my friend was

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.950
suggesting

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.280
hey you know what you know when they
don't have chicken stock what he used to do

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.230
he used go and buy those maggi noodles in which that little stock packet

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.180
comes he used to put so he used to use that, if you want to use it, you can use

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.890
anything, otherwise even if you don't have its fine so

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.940
bring it to a nice boil

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.060
add one or two teaspoon of vinegar

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.510
that gives nice strong nice flavor okay

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.710
now the mixture is come to a boil now add your chicken

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:44.710
okay

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.670
okay

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.490
so add your chicken, see remember there is some corn flour on this

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.340
the chicken too but just wait for two seconds

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.440
and add spoonfull of this water

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.940
don't add too much, add one, two

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.360
three,  four; first mix little bit

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.710
and then toss it over.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.490
see if i would have added more this would have been a messed up chicken

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.180
because I added just little bit spoon by spoon

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.290
now the sauce is really thick and nice. so
all you have to do is

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.620
slow it down. Just let it absorb the nice

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.750
flavors. Now our chilli chick is ready let's

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.840
put it on our plate

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.880
