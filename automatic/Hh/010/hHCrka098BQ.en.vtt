gonna send the jiggy out to another

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.610 
gonna send the jiggy out to another
flower<00:01:08.770> so<00:01:09.820> quick<00:01:10.820> you<00:01:10.940> fool

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620

and make our way over to that second one
I<00:01:24.240> don't<00:01:25.080> think<00:01:25.230> it<00:01:25.350> actually<00:01:25.710> matters<00:01:25.950> what

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
I don't think it actually matters what

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.240 
I don't think it actually matters what
order<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.760> do<00:01:26.940> this<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:27.980> I'm<00:01:28.980> just<00:01:29.100> gonna

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
order you do this in but I'm just gonna

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.210

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
doing it now shoot I think I probably

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.750 
doing it now shoot I think I probably
should<00:01:37.800> have<00:01:37.830> gone<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.100> other<00:01:38.130> way<00:01:40.760> anyway

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
should have gone the other way anyway

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.400 
should have gone the other way anyway
