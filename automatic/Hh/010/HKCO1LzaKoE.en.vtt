compost<00:01:05.549> we<00:01:06.140> just<00:01:07.140> wanted<00:01:07.470> this

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.530 

is<00:01:22.900> it<00:01:23.080> sort<00:01:23.290> of<00:01:23.350> hexagon<00:01:23.830> we<00:01:24.280> oh<00:01:24.310> my<00:01:24.670> god<00:01:25.119> yeah

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
is it sort of hexagon we oh my god yeah

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:45.980 
is it sort of hexagon we oh my god yeah
yeah

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:02:15.480 

okay

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.390 

rap<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.210> it's<00:02:16.300> one<00:02:16.480> single<00:02:16.900> piece<00:02:17.380> I<00:02:17.980> gotta

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
rap and it's one single piece I gotta

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.190 
rap and it's one single piece I gotta
show<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:18.610> in<00:02:18.820> a<00:02:18.910> minute<00:02:19.030> what<00:02:19.360> happens<00:02:19.990> that

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
show you in a minute what happens that

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.100 
show you in a minute what happens that
we<00:02:20.350> go<00:02:20.470> through<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.710> single<00:02:21.070> phase<00:02:21.300> this<00:02:22.300> is

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
we go through a single phase this is

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:32.110 
we go through a single phase this is
very<00:02:23.410> simple<00:02:24.310> way

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.259 

so<00:02:32.480> we<00:02:32.629> do<00:02:32.870> this<00:02:33.019> configuration<00:02:34.000> which<00:02:35.000> brings

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
so we do this configuration which brings

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.970 
so we do this configuration which brings
me<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.450> our<00:02:35.569> most<00:02:35.810> expensive<00:02:36.200> kit<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:36.890> we

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
me to our most expensive kit that we

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.660 
me to our most expensive kit that we
have<00:02:37.010> a<00:02:37.190> Power<00:02:37.640> Core

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
have a Power Core

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.640 
have a Power Core
this<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.090> for<00:02:40.270> a<00:02:40.300> customer<00:02:40.900> came<00:02:41.080> Harley<00:02:41.530> the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
this is for a customer came Harley the

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.590 
this is for a customer came Harley the
winner<00:02:41.860> is<00:02:42.069> with<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.280> band<00:02:42.520> called<00:02:42.760> hot<00:02:43.030> divided

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
winner is with a band called hot divided

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.470 
winner is with a band called hot divided
so<00:02:43.900> this<00:02:44.140> only<00:02:44.290> 14<00:02:44.890> years<00:02:44.920> old<00:02:45.310> pump<00:02:45.819> this<00:02:46.270> is

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
so this only 14 years old pump this is

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.290 
so this only 14 years old pump this is
fine<00:02:46.780> wine<00:02:47.110> maple<00:02:47.620> with<00:02:48.100> a<00:02:48.430> carbon<00:02:49.000> fiber<00:02:49.300> line

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
fine wine maple with a carbon fiber line

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.059 
fine wine maple with a carbon fiber line
okay<00:02:52.300> so<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.810> get<00:02:53.020> the<00:02:53.140> fundamentally<00:02:53.830> lower

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
okay so you get the fundamentally lower

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.910 
okay so you get the fundamentally lower
denture<00:02:54.640> inner<00:02:54.940> shell<00:02:55.330> but<00:02:56.110> at<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.410> same<00:02:56.620> time

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
denture inner shell but at the same time

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.570 
denture inner shell but at the same time
you<00:02:57.100> get<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.370> structural<00:02:57.910> integrity<00:02:59.430> and<00:03:00.430> the

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
you get the structural integrity and the

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.550 
you get the structural integrity and the
carbon<00:03:00.880> backsplash<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.810> carbon<00:03:02.350> fiber

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
carbon backsplash the carbon fiber

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.710 
carbon backsplash the carbon fiber
probably<00:03:02.980> has<00:03:03.130> a<00:03:03.160> little<00:03:03.520> bit<00:03:03.790> of<00:03:03.940> slap<00:03:04.300> to<00:03:04.600> it

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
probably has a little bit of slap to it

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.570 
probably has a little bit of slap to it
too<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.110> we<00:03:05.230> have<00:03:05.709> a<00:03:05.739> little<00:03:05.950> bit<00:03:06.070> of<00:03:06.100> Swat<00:03:06.400> but

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
too and we have a little bit of Swat but

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.910 
too and we have a little bit of Swat but
it's<00:03:06.700> gone<00:03:06.940> crazy

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
it's gone crazy

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.830 
it's gone crazy
make<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:09.069> sound<00:03:09.220> like<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.459> father

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
make it sound like a father

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.460 
make it sound like a father
Oh

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.020 

vibrations<00:03:15.470> made<00:03:15.680> them<00:03:15.890> actually<00:03:16.730> breaks

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
vibrations made them actually breaks

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.670 
vibrations made them actually breaks
that<00:03:17.240> pitch<00:03:17.480> down

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
that pitch down

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.580 
that pitch down
breaks<00:03:20.310> out<00:03:20.549> who<00:03:21.180> did<00:03:21.359> those<00:03:21.510> who<00:03:22.319> did<00:03:22.469> the

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
breaks out who did those who did the

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.709 
breaks out who did those who did the
paint<00:03:22.799> job<00:03:23.040> um<00:03:23.219> the<00:03:23.370> same<00:03:23.640> guy<00:03:23.849> did<00:03:24.090> this<00:03:24.269> did

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:24.719 
paint job um the same guy did this did

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:27.349 
paint job um the same guy did this did
that<00:03:24.959> his<00:03:25.799> name's<00:03:26.040> Greg<00:03:26.250> Fraser<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:27.269> they

that his name's Greg Fraser and they

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.319 
that his name's Greg Fraser and they
sustained<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:28.439> it's<00:03:28.890> actually<00:03:29.310> clear<00:03:29.700> with<00:03:30.299> a

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
sustained and it's actually clear with a

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:36.289 
sustained and it's actually clear with a
clear<00:03:34.189> flattening<00:03:35.189> agent<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:35.849> the<00:03:36.000> clear

this is the same thing it's got the

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.819 
this is the same thing it's got the
carbon<00:03:38.939> fiber<00:03:39.209> inside<00:03:39.689> let's<00:03:40.200> go<00:03:40.349> if<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:40.799> have

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
carbon fiber inside let's go if I have

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.309
