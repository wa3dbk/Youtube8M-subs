00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
out you can see it sticks out a little

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.910 
out you can see it sticks out a little
bit<00:01:00.329> further<00:01:00.480> than<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.899> 750<00:01:01.440> back<00:01:01.620> there<00:01:02.840> so

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
bit further than the 750 back there so

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.530 
bit further than the 750 back there so
yeah<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.129> little<00:01:05.189> dirty<00:01:05.460> but<00:01:06.150> that's<00:01:06.360> what

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
yeah it's a little dirty but that's what

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.429 
yeah it's a little dirty but that's what
happens<00:01:06.869> when<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.110> leave<00:01:07.260> these<00:01:07.380> things

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
sure it's good and I'm probably run a

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.780 
sure it's good and I'm probably run a
puff<00:03:07.320> off<00:03:07.500> test<00:03:07.830> on<00:03:07.980> this<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.310> make<00:03:08.430> sure<00:03:08.580> the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
puff off test on this to make sure the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.790 
puff off test on this to make sure the
carburetors<00:03:09.239> aren't<00:03:09.450> gum<00:03:09.660> now<00:03:10.380> on<00:03:10.590> the

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
carburetors aren't gum now on the

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.280 
carburetors aren't gum now on the
computer<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:11.790> says<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.120> only<00:03:12.209> has<00:03:12.420> 22<00:03:12.840> hours<00:03:13.140> on

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
computer it says it only has 22 hours on

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.710 
computer it says it only has 22 hours on
it<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:13.650> don't<00:03:14.580> know<00:03:14.700> if<00:03:14.760> that's<00:03:14.940> 100%<00:03:15.540> or<00:03:15.600> not

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
it I don't know if that's 100% or not

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.229 
it I don't know if that's 100% or not
that<00:03:15.900> one<00:03:16.110> said<00:03:16.739> 160<00:03:17.459> hours<00:03:17.610> when<00:03:17.940> I<00:03:17.970> bought<00:03:18.209> it

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.010 
quarter amp 250 volt and apparently when

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.280 
quarter amp 250 volt and apparently when
I<00:07:15.040> was<00:07:15.370> like<00:07:15.700> an<00:07:15.820> idiot<00:07:16.210> holding<00:07:16.930> the<00:07:17.020> ground

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:17.290 
I was like an idiot holding the ground

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:18.810 
I was like an idiot holding the ground
on<00:07:17.530> there<00:07:17.740> and<00:07:17.890> starting<00:07:18.250> this<00:07:18.370> thing<00:07:18.580> without

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:18.820 
on there and starting this thing without

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.610 
on there and starting this thing without
actually<00:07:19.360> having<00:07:19.450> it<00:07:19.570> screwed<00:07:19.900> down<00:07:20.050> it<00:07:20.440> was

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:20.620 
actually having it screwed down it was

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.940 
actually having it screwed down it was
causing<00:07:21.310> a<00:07:21.550> short<00:07:21.850> and<00:07:22.090> so<00:07:22.990> everything<00:07:23.650> seems

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:23.950 
causing a short and so everything seems

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:30.960 
causing a short and so everything seems
to<00:07:24.070> be<00:07:24.190> okay<00:07:24.490> now<00:07:25.110> I<00:07:26.640> can<00:07:27.640> see<00:07:27.820> here<00:07:28.120> mode<00:07:29.970> yeah

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:30.970 
to be okay now I can see here mode yeah

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:32.460 
to be okay now I can see here mode yeah
it's<00:07:31.360> not<00:07:31.510> changing<00:07:31.870> there<00:07:32.110> we<00:07:32.200> go

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:32.470 
it's not changing there we go

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:37.909 
it's not changing there we go
o'clock<00:07:32.890> distance<00:07:34.050> see<00:07:35.050> there's<00:07:35.230> hours<00:07:36.750> 22.9

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 
o'clock distance see there's hours 22.9

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:42.060 
o'clock distance see there's hours 22.9
you<00:07:38.919> know<00:07:39.250> if<00:07:39.370> that's<00:07:40.500> volts<00:07:41.500> twelve<00:07:41.830> point

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:42.070 
you know if that's volts twelve point

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.050 
you know if that's volts twelve point
two<00:07:42.220> volts<00:07:42.250> so<00:07:43.180> somebody<00:07:43.960> knows<00:07:44.110> that<00:07:44.290> that's

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:45.060 
two volts so somebody knows that that's

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.000 
two volts so somebody knows that that's
you<00:07:46.060> know<00:07:46.150> kosher<00:07:46.720> with<00:07:46.960> or<00:07:47.260> that's<00:07:47.530> if<00:07:47.890> that

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.010 
you know kosher with or that's if that

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.530 
you know kosher with or that's if that
could<00:07:48.160> never<00:07:48.250> be<00:07:48.370> reset<00:07:48.850> so<00:07:49.060> maybe<00:07:49.240> this<00:07:49.390> thing

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:49.540 
could never be reset so maybe this thing

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.600 
could never be reset so maybe this thing
only<00:07:49.660> has<00:07:49.900> twenty<00:07:50.200> two<00:07:50.350> hours<00:07:50.620> on<00:07:50.770> it<00:07:50.919> and

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:51.610 
only has twenty two hours on it and

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.500 
only has twenty two hours on it and
he'll<00:07:51.760> the<00:07:51.910> compressions<00:07:52.570> over<00:07:53.200> 150<00:07:53.560> so<00:07:54.100> I

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:54.510 
he'll the compressions over 150 so I

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.100 
he'll the compressions over 150 so I
don't<00:07:55.510> know<00:07:55.570> I<00:07:55.600> think<00:07:55.690> I'm<00:07:55.840> gonna<00:07:55.930> have<00:07:56.050> to

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:56.110 
don't know I think I'm gonna have to

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.440
