very useful to create choke points in
the<00:01:26.100> crucible<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.119> super<00:01:27.360> excited<00:01:27.720> to

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
the crucible and it's super excited to

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.480 
the crucible and it's super excited to
see<00:01:27.930> how<00:01:28.080> that's<00:01:28.259> going<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.500> work<00:01:28.560> now<00:01:29.220> last

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
what you guys think this is in the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.910 
what you guys think this is in the
comments<00:01:47.970> section<00:01:48.030> below<00:01:48.689> now<00:01:49.439> back<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
comments section below now back to the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.740 
comments section below now back to the
super<00:01:50.430> one<00:01:50.880> thing<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.180> noticed<00:01:51.420> from<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
super one thing I noticed from the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.389 
super one thing I noticed from the
footage<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.560> every<00:01:52.829> time<00:01:53.009> they<00:01:53.130> shoot

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
footage is that every time they shoot

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.639 
footage is that every time they shoot
the<00:01:53.520> super<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:54.000> second<00:01:54.720> one<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.049> instantly

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
the super a second one is instantly

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.170 
the super a second one is instantly
available<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.430> suit<00:01:56.700> super

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
available to suit super

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.360 
available to suit super
again<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:58.050> maybe<00:01:58.740> there's<00:01:58.980> a<00:01:59.040> perk<00:01:59.250> that

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
again so maybe there's a perk that

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.770 
again so maybe there's a perk that
lending<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.700> super<00:02:00.000> grants<00:02:00.240> an<00:02:00.390> additional

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
lending a super grants an additional

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.300 
lending a super grants an additional
shot<00:02:00.990> but<00:02:01.410> that's<00:02:01.560> just<00:02:01.740> speculated

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
shot but that's just speculated

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.430 
shot but that's just speculated

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
speculation you know maybe we

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.290 
speculation you know maybe we
automatically<00:02:05.070> get<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.460> supers<00:02:05.850> for<00:02:06.180> the

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300
