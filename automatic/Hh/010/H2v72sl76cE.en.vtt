00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.890
 you have 200 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.850

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.880
 let me tell you about the endangered 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.739
 either ok saving endangered species this 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.170
 another arrogant attempt by humanity 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.360
 control nature 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.550
 this arrogant intervention is what 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.710
 added to us the problems initially really 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.410
 no one noticed intervention in 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.900
 nature is over 90 percent much 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.060
 more than 90 percent of all individuals that 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.110
 ever lived on the planet ever 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.700
 lived here 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.280
 disappeared they died out we didn't kill everything 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.290
 they just disappeared 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.059
 that's what nature does these days they 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.699
 disappear at a rate of 25 per day 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.220
 regardless of our behavior 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.049
 no matter how we behave 25 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.060
 species there are today which will not 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.729
 tomorrow 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.840
 let them leave with dignity leave 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.450

 these gags are joking 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.899
 Yes, we still do not know how about yourself 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.990
 take care I learned how to help 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.299

 i'm getting tired of this shit i'm tired 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.810

 I'm tired of these fucking righteous people 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.770
 environmentalists are tired of these white liberal 

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:56.869
 bourgeoisie fucking white libero sheets 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.209
 who believe that the only 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.490
 wrong in our planet this 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:03.799

 somewhere forest is the same 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.630
 nothing but first of all to the lags 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.490
 don't give a shit on the planet 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.270
 before the planet know what they are 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.920
 interested clean place to live them 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.750
 own home 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.900
 don't worry that sometime in the future 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.710
 they can get into an awkward position but 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.780
 be honest 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.790
 mouth and unenlightened self interest me 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.220
 not at all impressive besides 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.510
 nothing with planet planet order 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.730
 these people ass people ass 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.000
 comparing people to the planet 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.160
 fine planet here already four with 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.410
 half a billion years 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.650
 four and a half billion and we are here 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.020
 how many 100,000 can be 200 we 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.480
 use heavy industry to little 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.310
 over two hundred years two hundred years against 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.200
 four and a half billion and we 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.440
 we are bent on thinking that somehow 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.209
 way we are a threat we somehow harvest 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.920
 this beautiful little blue 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.050
 a ball that just spins around 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.260
 sun planet survived things much 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.340
 worse than we are a hundred times 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.769
 tectonic volcano earthquake 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.560
 plates continental drift solar 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.959
 magnetic tabs solar strobe outbreaks 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.080
 change of magnetic poles hundreds of thousands 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.940
 years of bombing comets and asteroids 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.430
 meteorites all kinds of sandstorms 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.380
 Rosy cosmic radiation world wide 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.140
 Fire Flood repetitive 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:42.290
 glacial periods and we think some 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:46.080
 aluminum cans and plastic bags 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:51.360
 will make a difference the planet is not going anywhere 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:57.070
 go away and there we will disappear 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:04:00.880
 we'll disappear pack junk people 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.160
 we leave and believe me we will not leave 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.320
 many tracks 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.990
 maybe a little foam maybe 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.360
 a little foam coin will be here at 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.790
 we will not be just another for a long time 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.070
 unsuccessful mutat another completed 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.580
 evolutionary biological chain here 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:23.070
 big planet 3 place with as annoying 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:25.810
 blocks of a cover update 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.910
 if you want to know how are things from the planet 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.380
 ask those people from Pompeii who 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.930
 froze in poses under tons 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.820
 volcanic dust like the planets do 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.770
 want to know that the planets are all right 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.870
 ask people in mexico or armenia 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.790
 or hundreds of other places buried under 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.530
 by thousands of tons of boulders do they feel 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.920
 yourself real threats to the planet on this 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:47.110
 week about people in kilauea hawaii 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.940
 who built their homes next to 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.020
 active volcano and then surprised 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:55.060
 where did they get their logo in the living room 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.180
 the planet will be here long long long 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.440
 time after we are gone and she 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.260
 heal yourself 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.990
 she is cleansed because she does 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.680
 this is a self - correcting air system 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.300
 water will be restored the earth will renew and 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.580
 let's say if it's true that plastic is not 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.010
 decomposed planet just turn on 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:18.100
 plastic into a new paradigm 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.780
 earth + plastic planet do not share 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.850
 our plastic prejudices 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.830
 plastic came out of the ground earth is possible 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.990
 perceives him as another of his 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.480
 children maybe only one reason 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.000
 which the earth allowed us to get out of it 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.250
 initially she wanted to get plastic 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.070
 for myself did not know how to do this we 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.620
 were needed this could be the answer to our 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:42.310
 centuries-old philosophical question why are we 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:48.520
 here is plastic 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:51.190
 for the pages and so here 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.680
 plastic here our work is over 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.290
 now we can leave i think it already 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.970
 it began after all and to be honest 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.250
 planets perhaps perceives us as 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.140
 mean threat something with which 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.090
 understand and I'm sure the planet will be able 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.160
 protect yourself in a big way 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.770
 organism or like a beehive or 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.480
 ant colony accumulates protection i 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.940
 I am sure that the planet will invent something 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.410
 what would you do if you were a planet 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.200
 trying to protect against these 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.300
 annoying problem individuals can be 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.730
 virus and viruses may be quite good 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.070
 they seem vulnerable to viruses and viruses 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.360
 sly constantly mutates and continue 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.920
 new strains whenever 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.560
 new vaccine developed 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.290
 maybe the first virus should be 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.750
 so which parasite is the immune system 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.610
 these creatures may be human 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.960
 immunodeficiency virus 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.720
 and maybe it will be transmitted 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:44.220
 Sexually that will hinder 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.900
 their participation in the reproduction process 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:50.740
 poetic note is not it and it is only 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:54.430
 beginning i can dream i don't worry 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:58.360
 amount bee trees china snail i 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:59.170
 I think we are part of the great idea of ​​the highest 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.360
 the order 

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:05.350
 call it whatever you want you know how i am 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:08.250
 call it a big electron big 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.250
 electron 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:15.820
 she does not punish she does not reward 

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:19.420
 she doesn't even judge 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:21.820
 she just is like you and me true 

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:25.200
 thank you for a while for having spent this 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.200
 a long time today itself
