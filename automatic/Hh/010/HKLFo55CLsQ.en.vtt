00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 and well hi to all and and manson we get 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.029
 found today for the 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.560
 presentation of six small fashion that will 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.000
 allow your minecraft to be 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.540
 much more realistic 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.280
 so it starts directly first 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.900
 we will have the right to better foliage 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.420
 so a fairly well known mode that is going 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.680
 allow your trees to simply 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.779
 to have this effect two tufts 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.119
 beautiful that will break a little side 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.789
 square of minecraft that will add some 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.349
 little reeds for example so this 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.210
 are purely graphic ie 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.520
 you can not break them it's 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.920
 really just that graphically alters 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.180
 so it works on server you will see 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.100
 reeds but the other players 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.820
 will not send if they do not have the mode 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.980
 that goes with 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.660
 it adds a lot of little things 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.820
 funny like little flowers on 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.620
 water lilies indeed from leaves that 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.920
 fall below the trees one can 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.829
 see that hop here you see nice 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.750
 so that does not change your situation 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.620
 game it's on the blocks of land you 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.789
 see the green will completely overlap 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.000
 as soon as they have the opportunity to 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.280
 make 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.049
 hop it covers everything while if you 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.119
 break below that bah it becomes again the 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.180
 earth rather ugly so it adds in 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.350
 nice effect and it really changes 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.340
 everything that is plants you see c 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.979
 cactus we vaguely see from afar that ya 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.140
 a small effect finally two 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.170
 big arm swells like on 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.689
 real cactus I put you pictures of 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.740
 comparison you will see it changes rather 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.650
 not bad 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.180
 so after we're going to have matmos so matt 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.619
 moss is what will add these little ones 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.900
 ambient noises there you heard 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.250
 this duck and little birds 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.100
 so that's changing at the sound level 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.690
 bio you are and just that 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.790
 add a lot of atmosphere I find it 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.310
 super friendly and updated it 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.870
 recently in one point seven points 10 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.320
 physical items so this is a mode that 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.020
 just released that actually will change 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.740
 the physics of objects you see there 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.600
 falls down 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.940
 so we end up where I 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.540
 planned a little plan to see that more 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.130
 so close a compromise on our chest 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.130
 so we'll see the different aspects 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.539
 of everything starts to run so an item 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.270
 flat like a pop record 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.760
 it will flatten like these is so 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.459
 friendly a block down it's going like I 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.200
 have shown you a few seconds a 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.930
 half slab so saw that these dishes down that 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.700
 is really going to be finally it's more 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.580
 dish that the rest it's really going to get 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.030
 flatten a sword or stone bat 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.620
 just up tossing out really well and 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.390
 it works also for the estac of objects on 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.700
 will see the difference as on the game 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.350
 so it's going fast it's much more 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.540
 Realistic that the small bill hall towers 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.260
 that it's all about the game asic 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.209
 from minecraft 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.709
 so I find it nice so we 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.250
 go see that on a big chest well 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.049
 complete this is not bad laguÃ« the 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.430
 game to have all this but look at the 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.709
 realism of the thing anyway 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.769
 I think it's super nice to have 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.690
 added this effect so here we go 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.850
 we can clear ourselves and we go from 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.170
 afterwards 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.570
 necessarily there are still shaders 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.370
 and scheider who are still the mode 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.530
 the best known for making minecraft 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.049
 realistic so everyone knows to 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.210
 1 this is the effect back it was 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.110
 made 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.910
 sunbathing simply and your 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.980
 shadow and all that good there I think 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.350
 everyone knows well I will suggest 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.710
 in descriptions the complete list of 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.050
 mechas leader not complete but my 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:29.100
 heat personal pac we will change by 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.190
 example for me m here is chocapic have 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.560
 to change from time to time 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.390
 so move and what will allow that 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.340
 just released so many things 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.440
 who have just come out of 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.910
 make your appearance your player 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.790
 much more realistic at the level of 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.040
 movements he does so for example 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.510
 so here I do not know why it does not 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.010
 does not do it but in any case when you 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.900
 climb a ladder normally that's the 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.060
 hatch with the hands I 'm not going so 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.220
 it was the old fashion that I do not 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.440
 remember longer who did that but 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.660
 in any case that's it really makes the 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.550
 nice game and its adapters 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.730
 multiplayer you will see even those who 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.980
 do not have the mode like this but it's 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.330
 especially especially nice so there we 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.040
 feels like being crazy about 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.200
 run like this and just now you 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.820
 have surely seen them ask you 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.890
 what did the zombies do here 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.560
 it's just to show you that 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.050
 the two modes that are affected this 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.860
 realism effect are the zombies and 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.880
 the pigments 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.820
 so that's what makes the side really more 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:35.140
 + rp in the game what to see 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.190
 thing like this is for the last 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.410
 step I do not remember what is the 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.570
 mode yes that 's it's 3 blocks so 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.360
 the last little fashion just a little 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.440
 ellipses we put in place so here 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.580
 just a little ellipses for for 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.560
 activate this mode because in fact the problem 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.720
 is that better foliage does not work 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.190
 not with this mode 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.230
 even though it's not great I 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.210
 still presents an effect 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.330
 3d on some blogs as per 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.830
 example these erp or see his creepers there 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.540
 down I put a little post we can 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.700
 see pretty much everything that changes 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.220
 the red stone you see that adds a one 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.410
 small side relief on this nice 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.420
 but not very very useful either 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.450
 especially what is plan table 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:20.230
 flowers of tree boosts here and there 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:24.070
 on these scales so on it I think 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:26.380
 we're going to drink the conclusion so that's it 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.870
 will be all for this presentation of this 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.070
 little word of Easter that I prepared 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.750
 everything is in the description I you 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.310
 invite to download it to put a 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.080
 little I like if you use it and to
