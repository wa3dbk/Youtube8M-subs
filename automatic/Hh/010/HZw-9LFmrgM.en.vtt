00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.690 

I've<00:00:09.480> been<00:00:09.660> asked<00:00:10.140> a<00:00:10.290> somewhat<00:00:11.040> confusing

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
I've been asked a somewhat confusing

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.060 
I've been asked a somewhat confusing
question<00:00:12.180> in<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.480> sense<00:00:12.780> that<00:00:12.930> people<00:00:13.770> are

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
question in the sense that people are

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.720 
question in the sense that people are
confused<00:00:14.550> about<00:00:14.850> genetic<00:00:15.720> counseling<00:00:16.730> versus

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
confused about genetic counseling versus

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.950 
confused about genetic counseling versus
genetic<00:00:18.360> testing<00:00:19.050> for<00:00:19.770> brca1<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.970> 2<00:00:21.210> it's

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
genetic testing for brca1 and 2 it's

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.230 
genetic testing for brca1 and 2 it's
good<00:00:22.110> question<00:00:23.090> what<00:00:24.090> comes<00:00:24.390> first<00:00:24.919> is<00:00:25.970> in<00:00:26.970> my

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
good question what comes first is in my

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.450 
good question what comes first is in my
mind<00:00:27.450> clearly<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.290> think<00:00:28.590> everyone<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.430> I

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
mind clearly and I think everyone that I

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.670 
mind clearly and I think everyone that I
deal<00:00:29.849> with<00:00:30.439> nationally<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.500> internationally

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
deal with nationally and internationally

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.720 
deal with nationally and internationally
what<00:00:32.490> should<00:00:32.850> should<00:00:33.329> come<00:00:33.630> first<00:00:33.900> is<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:35.370> fact

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
what should should come first is in fact

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.890 
what should should come first is in fact
genetic<00:00:36.530> counseling<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:38.150> with<00:00:39.150> the<00:00:39.420> genetic

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
genetic counseling and with the genetic

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.479 
genetic counseling and with the genetic
counseling<00:00:40.500> there<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> detailed<00:00:41.340> history

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
counseling there is a detailed history

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.529 
counseling there is a detailed history
taken<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.899> family<00:00:43.520> both<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.910> maternal

taken of the family both in the maternal

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.689 
taken of the family both in the maternal
side<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.199> paternal<00:00:46.800> side<00:00:47.010> looking<00:00:47.519> not

only<00:00:47.760> for<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:49.219> history<00:00:50.219> obviously<00:00:50.699> of<00:00:50.789> breast

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
only for a history obviously of breast

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.959 
only for a history obviously of breast
cancer<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:51.750> also<00:00:51.780> ovarian<00:00:52.769> cancer<00:00:53.250> or<00:00:53.429> other

cancer but also ovarian cancer or other
things<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:55.079> would<00:00:55.500> indicate<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.219> somebody

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
things that would indicate that somebody

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.919 
things that would indicate that somebody
should<00:00:57.059> be<00:00:57.359> tested<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:58.019> brca1<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.010> 2<00:00:59.929> now

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:00.929 
should be tested for brca1 and 2 now

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:04.610 
should be tested for brca1 and 2 now
depending<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.039> location<00:01:02.989> where<00:01:03.989> people

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
depending on the location where people

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.300 
depending on the location where people
live<00:01:05.090> this<00:01:06.090> may<00:01:06.450> not<00:01:06.660> always<00:01:06.900> be<00:01:07.260> possible<00:01:07.440> but

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
live this may not always be possible but

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.690 
live this may not always be possible but
it's<00:01:08.490> clearly<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.270> preferential<00:01:09.840> way<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> go

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
it's clearly the preferential way to go

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.289 
it's clearly the preferential way to go
the<00:01:11.700> cost<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.780> testing<00:01:13.320> for<00:01:13.740> brca1<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.790> 2<00:01:15.030> is

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
the cost of testing for brca1 and 2 is

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.010 
the cost of testing for brca1 and 2 is
high<00:01:16.040> there<00:01:17.040> are<00:01:17.369> locations<00:01:17.909> where<00:01:18.509> genetic

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
high there are locations where genetic

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.130 
high there are locations where genetic
counselors<00:01:19.619> are<00:01:19.829> not<00:01:20.070> available<00:01:20.990> there<00:01:21.990> are

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
counselors are not available there are

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.730 
counselors are not available there are
certainly<00:01:22.680> physicians<00:01:24.079> who<00:01:25.079> are<00:01:25.110> well

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
certainly physicians who are well

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.670 
certainly physicians who are well
schooled<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.720> knowing<00:01:27.720> when<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.110> test<00:01:28.409> is

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
schooled and knowing when the test is

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.289 
schooled and knowing when the test is
should<00:01:28.950> be<00:01:29.130> ordered<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.119> would<00:01:30.270> be

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
should be ordered so that would be

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.710 
should be ordered so that would be
certainly<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.960> second<00:01:31.500> line<00:01:31.680> approach<00:01:32.720> there

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
certainly a second line approach there

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.870 
certainly a second line approach there
may<00:01:33.869> be<00:01:33.899> a<00:01:34.049> few<00:01:34.439> other<00:01:34.680> circumstances<00:01:35.640> where

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
may be a few other circumstances where

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.179 
may be a few other circumstances where
you<00:01:36.030> would<00:01:36.180> go<00:01:36.210> straight<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:37.259> actually

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
you would go straight to actually

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.870 
you would go straight to actually
drawing<00:01:38.579> blood<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.390> doing<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.960> genetic<00:01:40.409> test

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
drawing blood and doing the genetic test

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.030 
drawing blood and doing the genetic test
so<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.030> summary<00:01:42.479> then<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.290> absolutely

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
so in summary then it is absolutely

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.840 
so in summary then it is absolutely
always<00:01:44.460> appropriate<00:01:45.270> always<00:01:46.140> better<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.850> do

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
always appropriate always better to do

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.920 
always appropriate always better to do
the<00:01:48.450> genetic<00:01:49.020> counseling<00:01:49.860> first<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.930> frankly

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
the genetic counseling first and frankly

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.560 
the genetic counseling first and frankly
if<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.259> don't<00:01:52.920> how<00:01:53.789> do<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.969> put<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.210> if<00:01:54.479> you
