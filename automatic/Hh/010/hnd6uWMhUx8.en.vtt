00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760 

a<00:00:00.030> lot<00:00:00.269> of<00:00:00.299> people<00:00:00.630> think<00:00:00.930> when<00:00:01.319> I'm<00:00:01.469> doing

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
a lot of people think when I'm doing

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.610 
a lot of people think when I'm doing
this<00:00:01.890> kind<00:00:02.129> of<00:00:02.250> things<00:00:02.520> with<00:00:02.669> my<00:00:02.850> fingers<00:00:03.620> then

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
this kind of things with my fingers then

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.270 
this kind of things with my fingers then
it<00:00:04.740> looks<00:00:04.859> very<00:00:05.040> chaotic<00:00:06.710> but<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.859> truth<00:00:08.069> is

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
it looks very chaotic but the truth is

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.100 
it looks very chaotic but the truth is
when<00:00:08.700> I'm<00:00:08.820> doing<00:00:09.120> this<00:00:09.240> I'm<00:00:09.450> paying<00:00:09.690> attention

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
when I'm doing this I'm paying attention

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.259 
when I'm doing this I'm paying attention
to<00:00:10.200> only<00:00:10.320> one<00:00:10.650> small<00:00:11.070> very<00:00:11.429> tiny<00:00:11.730> thing<00:00:12.059> not

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
to only one small very tiny thing not

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.570 
to only one small very tiny thing not
the<00:00:12.450> cube<00:00:12.690> overall<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:14.280> gives<00:00:14.519> me

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
the cube overall and that gives me

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.460 
the cube overall and that gives me
ability<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.330> focus<00:00:15.690> on<00:00:15.839> things<00:00:16.080> even<00:00:16.379> though

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
ability to focus on things even though

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.680 
ability to focus on things even though
it<00:00:16.590> looks<00:00:16.770> very<00:00:16.920> chaotic<00:00:17.330> now<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.390> first

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
it looks very chaotic now the first

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.109 
it looks very chaotic now the first
thing<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:18.960> do<00:00:19.020> when<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.350> solve<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.670> focus

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
thing I do when I solve it is to focus

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.120 
thing I do when I solve it is to focus
on<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:21.449> piece<00:00:21.689> right<00:00:21.960> here<00:00:22.020> which<00:00:22.890> seems

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
on this piece right here which seems

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.340 
on this piece right here which seems
pretty<00:00:23.340> simple<00:00:23.820> right<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.689> need<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:25.019> do<00:00:25.170> is

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
pretty simple right and I need to do is

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.990 
pretty simple right and I need to do is
make<00:00:25.590> sure<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.460> four<00:00:26.730> surrounding

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
make sure that the four surrounding

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.720 
make sure that the four surrounding
edges<00:00:27.689> free<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.199> them<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.949> going<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.340> be<00:00:29.490> white

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
edges free to them is going to be white

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.910 
edges free to them is going to be white
now<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.359> can<00:00:30.599> see<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.199> one<00:00:31.439> here<00:00:31.740> is

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
now you can see that this one here is

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.549 
now you can see that this one here is
white<00:00:32.219> as<00:00:32.520> well<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.660> problem<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.230> when<00:00:34.530> I

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
white as well but the problem is when I

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.160 
white as well but the problem is when I
come<00:00:34.800> over<00:00:34.829> here<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:36.000> green<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.899> blue

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
come over here the green and the blue

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.619 
come over here the green and the blue
don't<00:00:37.649> match<00:00:37.829> up<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.700> that's<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.210> very<00:00:39.360> easy

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
don't match up and that's a very easy

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.869 
don't match up and that's a very easy
fix<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.379> can<00:00:40.890> take<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.340> can<00:00:41.370> move<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.670> like

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
fix I can take and I can move it like

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.299 
fix I can take and I can move it like
that<00:00:42.230> so<00:00:43.230> even<00:00:43.530> though<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.739> may<00:00:43.829> seem<00:00:43.890> like<00:00:44.129> a

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
that so even though it may seem like a

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.889 
that so even though it may seem like a
lot<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.640> work<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.030> being<00:00:45.059> done<00:00:45.329> I'm<00:00:45.690> only

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
lot of work is being done I'm only

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.709 
lot of work is being done I'm only
focusing<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.770> one<00:00:46.829> piece<00:00:47.250> right<00:00:47.520> there

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
focusing on that one piece right there

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.180 
focusing on that one piece right there
now<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.780> rest<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.320> what<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.559> have<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.920> do<00:00:50.039> to

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
now the rest of the what I have to do to

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.010 
now the rest of the what I have to do to
begin<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.879> first<00:00:51.149> step<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.809> make<00:00:51.960> sure

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
begin in this first step is to make sure

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.260 
begin in this first step is to make sure
that<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.410> get<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.770> white<00:00:53.039> cross<00:00:53.370> right<00:00:53.699> here

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.970 

so<00:01:00.270> just<00:01:00.510> then<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> couple<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.260> seconds<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.830> was

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
so just then a couple of seconds I was

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.009 
so just then a couple of seconds I was
able<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.280> get<00:01:02.400> this<00:01:02.580> white<00:01:02.820> cross<00:01:03.150> but<00:01:03.870> not

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
able to get this white cross but not

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.050 
able to get this white cross but not
only<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.559> was<00:01:04.800> able<00:01:05.160> to<00:01:05.190> get<00:01:05.460> these

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
only that I was able to get these

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.240 
only that I was able to get these
centerpieces<00:01:06.560> matched<00:01:07.560> up<00:01:07.860> with<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.160> edge

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
centerpieces matched up with the edge

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.440 
centerpieces matched up with the edge
pieces<00:01:08.580> as<00:01:08.910> well<00:01:10.670> so<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.850> next<00:01:12.060> step<00:01:12.300> is

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
pieces as well so this next step is

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.940 
pieces as well so this next step is
where<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.720> magic<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.140> gonna<00:01:13.350> happen<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.860> this

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
where the magic is gonna happen and this

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.469 
where the magic is gonna happen and this
is<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.370> difference<00:01:14.910> between<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.330> beginning

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
is the difference between the beginning

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.900 
is the difference between the beginning
solvers<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.229> more<00:01:16.650> advanced<00:01:16.979> solvers<00:01:17.460> I'm

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
solvers and more advanced solvers I'm

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.580 
solvers and more advanced solvers I'm
actually<00:01:18.119> going<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.479> do<00:01:18.660> two<00:01:18.869> steps<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.350> one

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
actually going to do two steps in one

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.580 
actually going to do two steps in one
I'm<00:01:20.280> going<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.729> pay<00:01:20.880> attention<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.600> not<00:01:22.290> this

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
I'm going to pay attention to not this

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.650 
I'm going to pay attention to not this
piece<00:01:22.830> not<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.400> piece<00:01:23.670> but<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.360> piece

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
piece not this piece but this piece

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.500 
piece not this piece but this piece
right<00:01:24.869> here<00:01:25.470> but<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> advanced<00:01:26.820> method<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.390> to

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
right here but the advanced method is to

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.840 
right here but the advanced method is to
worry<00:01:27.720> about<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.110> piece<00:01:28.380> as<00:01:28.590> well<00:01:28.830> so<00:01:29.550> in<00:01:29.670> my

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
worry about this piece as well so in my

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.420 
worry about this piece as well so in my
next<00:01:30.149> set<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.450> moves<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.990> intend<00:01:31.410> to<00:01:31.500> put<00:01:32.190> these

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
next set of moves I intend to put these

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.120 
next set of moves I intend to put these
pieces<00:01:32.759> into<00:01:33.149> place<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:34.259> what<00:01:34.440> I<00:01:34.470> do<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:35.009> I

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
pieces into place and what I do is I

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.850 
pieces into place and what I do is I
would<00:01:35.190> find<00:01:35.520> those<00:01:35.700> pieces<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:36.450> queue<00:01:36.860> and

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
would find those pieces on the queue and

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.859 
would find those pieces on the queue and
make<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.220> adjustments<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:38.970> if<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.540> see

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
make the adjustments and if you can see

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.380 
make the adjustments and if you can see
those<00:01:40.110> two<00:01:40.380> pieces<00:01:40.590> are<00:01:40.920> now<00:01:41.040> together<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:42.300> I

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
those two pieces are now together and I

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.810 
those two pieces are now together and I
simply<00:01:42.750> put<00:01:43.020> them<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.979> now<00:01:44.130> we've<00:01:44.340> got<00:01:44.550> one

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
simply put them in so now we've got one

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.719 
simply put them in so now we've got one
corner<00:01:45.300> of<00:01:45.330> the<00:01:45.450> Rubik's<00:01:45.720> Cube<00:01:46.050> song<00:01:46.670> so<00:01:47.670> to

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
corner of the Rubik's Cube song so to

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.760 
corner of the Rubik's Cube song so to
finish<00:01:48.180> off<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.509> second<00:01:48.899> step<00:01:49.140> what<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.500> did

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
finish off the second step what I did

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.590 
finish off the second step what I did
for<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.070> corner<00:01:50.460> right<00:01:50.580> here<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.000> want<00:01:51.330> to<00:01:51.450> do

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
for this corner right here I want to do

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.420 
for this corner right here I want to do
for<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> other<00:01:52.050> three<00:01:52.320> corners<00:01:52.500> as<00:01:52.890> well

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
for the other three corners as well

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.340 
for the other three corners as well
now<00:01:54.149> those<00:01:54.360> pieces<00:01:54.630> are<00:01:54.869> going<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.020> be<00:01:55.140> living

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
now those pieces are going to be living

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.990 
now those pieces are going to be living
up<00:01:55.560> here<00:01:55.590> somewhere<00:01:56.220> I<00:01:56.250> simply<00:01:56.700> need<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.910> find

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
up here somewhere I simply need to find

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.719 
up here somewhere I simply need to find
them<00:01:57.530> recognize<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.830> algorithm<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.430> have<00:01:59.580> to

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
them recognize the algorithm I have to

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.399 
them recognize the algorithm I have to
use<00:01:59.910> and<00:02:00.840> put<00:02:01.080> them<00:02:01.229> into<00:02:01.380> place<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:03.409> just

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
use and put them into place and just

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.230 
use and put them into place and just
like<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.830> I've<00:02:05.220> got<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.640> bottom<00:02:05.790> half<00:02:06.150> of

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
like that I've got the bottom half of

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.800 
like that I've got the bottom half of
the<00:02:06.330> cube<00:02:06.570> saw<00:02:07.549> the<00:02:08.549> third<00:02:08.820> step<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.660> make

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
the cube saw the third step is to make

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.440 
the cube saw the third step is to make
top<00:02:10.170> all<00:02:10.440> yellow<00:02:10.830> now<00:02:11.700> pay<00:02:12.030> close<00:02:12.269> attention

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
top all yellow now pay close attention

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.940 
top all yellow now pay close attention
because<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.290> going<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.470> happen<00:02:13.650> really

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
because this is going to happen really

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.540 
because this is going to happen really
fast

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.940 

and<00:02:16.790> finally<00:02:17.600> we<00:02:17.720> get<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.140> last<00:02:18.320> step<00:02:18.650> it's

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
and finally we get to the last step it's

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.410 
and finally we get to the last step it's
gonna<00:02:19.070> be<00:02:19.280> just<00:02:19.400> as<00:02:19.580> easy<00:02:19.790> as<00:02:20.000> step<00:02:20.270> number

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
gonna be just as easy as step number

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.450 
gonna be just as easy as step number
