really not gonna help too much I noticed

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.120 
really not gonna help too much I noticed
there<00:00:09.900> there<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.260> that<00:00:10.410> temple<00:00:10.800> there<00:00:10.920> you<00:00:11.010> can

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
there there is that temple there you can

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.580 
there there is that temple there you can
take<00:00:11.280> out<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:11.550> temple<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.259> actually<00:00:13.259> for

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
take out that temple and actually for

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.720 
take out that temple and actually for
Terrans<00:00:13.920> especially<00:00:14.340> they<00:00:14.460> can<00:00:14.580> actually

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
Terrans especially they can actually

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.400 
Terrans especially they can actually
mine<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.240> minerals<00:00:15.570> from<00:00:15.660> behind<00:00:15.990> we<00:00:16.230> saw

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
mine the minerals from behind we saw

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.010 
mine the minerals from behind we saw
that<00:00:16.560> in<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.710> game<00:00:16.920> between<00:00:17.100> flash<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:18.000> 0<00:00:18.840> on

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
that in the game between flash and 0 on

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.349 
that in the game between flash and 0 on
this<00:00:19.230> map<00:00:19.439> you're<00:00:20.400> really<00:00:20.640> interesting<00:00:21.150> that

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
this map you're really interesting that

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.029 
this map you're really interesting that
can<00:00:21.449> actually<00:00:21.600> mine<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.230> minerals<00:00:22.769> without

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
can actually mine the minerals without

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.890 
can actually mine the minerals without
having<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.490> actually<00:00:23.519> take<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.390> expansion

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
having to actually take that expansion

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.660 
having to actually take that expansion
they'll<00:00:25.170> be<00:00:25.260> protected<00:00:25.740> from<00:00:25.830> attacks<00:00:26.220> of

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
they'll be protected from attacks of

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.189 
they'll be protected from attacks of
course<00:00:26.880> they<00:00:26.970> can't<00:00:27.150> do<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.689> efficiently

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
course they can't do it to efficiently

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.470 
course they can't do it to efficiently
anyway<00:00:29.070> here<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.580> best<00:00:29.939> taking<00:00:30.269> another

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
anyway here is best taking another

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.770 
anyway here is best taking another
expansion<00:00:30.750> here<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.230> his<00:00:31.470> third<00:00:31.740> base<00:00:31.980> at<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
expansion here of his third base at the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.290 
expansion here of his third base at the
at<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.430> eleven<00:00:35.430> o'clock<00:00:35.489> location<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.270> is

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
at the eleven o'clock location that is

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.389 
at the eleven o'clock location that is
actually<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:37.020> second<00:00:37.829> expansion<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.309> the

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
actually the second expansion of the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.790 
actually the second expansion of the
upper<00:00:38.640> left<00:00:38.850> base<00:00:39.059> but<00:00:39.719> hassan<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.350> going<00:00:40.590> to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
upper left base but hassan is going to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.799 
upper left base but hassan is going to
scout<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.430> pretty<00:00:41.790> much<00:00:41.910> immediately<00:00:42.210> i<00:00:42.540> think

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
scout it pretty much immediately i think

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.360 
scout it pretty much immediately i think
he<00:00:42.899> knows<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.110> base<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.890> going<00:00:44.040> up<00:00:44.219> you've

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
he knows that base is going up you've

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.250 
he knows that base is going up you've
seen<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> pylons<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.629> he's<00:00:45.989> going<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.170> know

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
seen the pylons so he's going to know

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.979 
seen the pylons so he's going to know
it's<00:00:46.410> there<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:47.030> he'll<00:00:48.030> probably<00:00:48.450> move<00:00:48.840> out

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
it's there and he'll probably move out

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.080 
it's there and he'll probably move out
in<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> few<00:00:49.320> minutes<00:00:49.530> actually<00:00:49.910> give<00:00:50.910> me<00:00:51.000> he

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
in a few minutes actually give me he

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.670 
in a few minutes actually give me he
knows<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.449> best<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.840> not<00:00:52.079> too<00:00:52.260> strong<00:00:52.500> right

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
knows that best is not too strong right

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.950 
knows that best is not too strong right
now<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:53.460> course<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:54.059> see<00:00:54.210> from<00:00:54.360> best<00:00:54.690> is

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
now of course we can see from best is

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.510 
now of course we can see from best is
something<00:00:55.350> he<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:55.649> good<00:00:56.160> at<00:00:56.190> which<00:00:56.489> is

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
something he is so good at which is

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.270 
something he is so good at which is
early<00:00:57.000> arbiters<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.660> he<00:00:58.469> just<00:00:58.739> crushes

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
early arbiters and he just crushes

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.880 
early arbiters and he just crushes
opponents<00:00:59.730> with<00:00:59.820> early<00:01:00.180> arbiters<00:01:00.770> he's<00:01:01.770> just

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
opponents with early arbiters he's just

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.500 
opponents with early arbiters he's just
so<00:01:02.129> good<00:01:02.160> with<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.520> arbiter<00:01:02.879> rush<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.270> we

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
so good with that arbiter rush and we

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.200 
so good with that arbiter rush and we
saw<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.719> uh<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.350> best<00:01:04.920> versus<00:01:06.950> best<00:01:07.950> vs<00:01:08.340> hawks

cheese<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:39.360> unfortunately<00:01:39.780> that's<00:01:39.840> all<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
cheese but unfortunately that's all the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.719 
cheese but unfortunately that's all the
duties<00:01:40.380> are<00:01:40.560> good<00:01:40.710> for<00:01:40.920> they're<00:01:41.460> just<00:01:41.640> going

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
duties are good for they're just going

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.670 
duties are good for they're just going
to<00:01:41.820> delay<00:01:42.150> ever<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.600> slightly<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.140> push<00:01:43.380> but

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
to delay ever so slightly this push but

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.160 
to delay ever so slightly this push but
once<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.460> couple<00:01:44.729> more<00:01:44.850> turrets<00:01:45.689> are<00:01:45.840> up<00:01:45.960> this

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
once a couple more turrets are up this

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.289 
once a couple more turrets are up this
push<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.590> going<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.920> be<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.610> strong<00:01:47.670> from<00:01:48.090> wasps

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
push is going to be so strong from wasps

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.760 
push is going to be so strong from wasps
and<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.630> don't<00:01:48.930> know<00:01:49.049> if<00:01:49.200> best<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.500> going<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.710> be

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
and I don't know if best is going to be

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.490 
and I don't know if best is going to be
able<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.979> handle<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.340> best<00:01:50.939> um<00:01:51.320> trying<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.409> do

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
able to handle this best um trying to do

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.080 
able to handle this best um trying to do
something<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.860> delaying<00:01:53.310> there<00:01:53.549> with<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.820> DTS

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
something to delaying there with the DTS

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.399 
something to delaying there with the DTS
but<00:01:54.329> he<00:01:54.390> doesn't<00:01:54.720> have<00:01:54.840> reverse<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.320> his

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
but he doesn't have reverse and his

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.649 
but he doesn't have reverse and his
armies<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.159> small<00:01:56.430> look<00:01:57.210> at<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.540> a

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
armies just so small look at that just a

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.480 
armies just so small look at that just a
hint<00:01:57.990> maybe<00:01:58.380> it's<00:01:58.530> just<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.770> dozen<00:01:59.189> dragoons

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
hint maybe it's just a dozen dragoons

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.490 
hint maybe it's just a dozen dragoons
their<00:01:59.610> versus<00:02:00.000> at<00:02:00.119> least<00:02:00.329> I'd<00:02:00.899> say<00:02:01.079> six<00:02:01.409> or

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
their versus at least I'd say six or

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.249 
their versus at least I'd say six or
seven<00:02:01.799> tanks<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.909> know<00:02:03.259> turrets

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
seven tanks and you know turrets

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.840 
seven tanks and you know turrets
creeping<00:02:04.590> up<00:02:04.740> all<00:02:04.979> sorts<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.369> stuff<00:02:05.430> coming<00:02:05.820> up

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
creeping up all sorts of stuff coming up

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.559 
creeping up all sorts of stuff coming up
from<00:02:06.000> Boston<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:07.429> yeah<00:02:08.429> there's<00:02:08.970> Watson<00:02:09.390> yet

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
from Boston and yeah there's Watson yet

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.999 
from Boston and yeah there's Watson yet
with<00:02:09.690> all<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.989> his<00:02:10.050> tanks<00:02:10.410> he's<00:02:10.830> probably

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
with all of his tanks he's probably

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.590 
with all of his tanks he's probably
gonna<00:02:11.250> start<00:02:11.459> skiing<00:02:11.700> pretty<00:02:12.090> soon

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
gonna start skiing pretty soon

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.470 
gonna start skiing pretty soon
and<00:02:13.320> uh<00:02:13.520> bestest<00:02:14.520> just<00:02:14.850> transferred<00:02:15.360> his

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
and uh bestest just transferred his

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.330 
and uh bestest just transferred his
probes<00:02:15.780> over<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.320> left<00:02:16.500> side<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:16.860> if<00:02:17.010> best

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
probes over to the left side so if best

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.460 
probes over to the left side so if best
loses<00:02:17.820> this<00:02:18.000> base<00:02:18.240> on<00:02:18.450> left<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.290> probably

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
loses this base on left that is probably

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.200 
loses this base on left that is probably
going<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:19.830> be<00:02:19.950> game<00:02:20.250> for<00:02:20.520> him<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.790> don't<00:02:20.940> see<00:02:21.060> him

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
going to be game for him I don't see him

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.580 
going to be game for him I don't see him
coming<00:02:21.390> back<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.930> at<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:22.170> point<00:02:22.380> it's<00:02:22.530> gonna

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
coming back and at this point it's gonna

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.920 
coming back and at this point it's gonna
be<00:02:22.740> really<00:02:22.920> hard<00:02:23.010> he<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.880> course<00:02:23.910> is<00:02:24.300> so<00:02:24.630> good

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
be really hard he of course is so good

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.360 
be really hard he of course is so good
at<00:02:25.080> breaking<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.590> Terran<00:02:25.890> push<00:02:26.070> as<00:02:26.250> though

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
at breaking the Terran push as though

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.980 
at breaking the Terran push as though
that<00:02:26.520> I<00:02:26.580> wouldn't<00:02:26.910> put<00:02:27.090> anything<00:02:27.480> past<00:02:27.630> them

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
that I wouldn't put anything past them

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.810 
that I wouldn't put anything past them
and<00:02:28.140> looks<00:02:28.890> like<00:02:29.010> he<00:02:29.130> is<00:02:29.160> going<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.430> go<00:02:29.520> for<00:02:29.730> and

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
and looks like he is going to go for and

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.220 
and looks like he is going to go for and
try<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.030> snap<00:02:30.270> off<00:02:30.420> some<00:02:30.600> of<00:02:30.660> these<00:02:30.720> tanks<00:02:31.110> and

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
try and snap off some of these tanks and

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.110 
try and snap off some of these tanks and
he's<00:02:31.740> going<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:31.980> go<00:02:32.130> for<00:02:32.310> some<00:02:32.430> zella<00:02:32.670> bombs<00:02:32.910> at

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
he's going to go for some zella bombs at

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.520 
he's going to go for some zella bombs at
the<00:02:33.150> same<00:02:33.360> time<00:02:33.600> but<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:33.900> don't<00:02:34.200> think<00:02:34.320> it's

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
the same time but I don't think it's

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.110 
the same time but I don't think it's
gonna<00:02:34.620> succeed<00:02:34.980> yeah<00:02:35.190> this<00:02:35.370> is<00:02:35.520> not<00:02:35.820> going<00:02:36.030> to

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
gonna succeed yeah this is not going to

are<00:02:40.410> just<00:02:40.590> going<00:02:40.710> to<00:02:40.740> melt<00:02:41.040> away<00:02:41.190> against<00:02:41.520> the

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
are just going to melt away against the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.180 
are just going to melt away against the
tanks<00:02:41.850> that<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:43.110> really<00:02:43.440> want<00:02:43.650> results<00:02:43.860> to

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
tanks that you really want results to

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.850 
tanks that you really want results to
kill<00:02:44.370> off<00:02:44.490> more<00:02:44.760> than<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.990> go<00:02:46.410> get<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.710> good

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
kill off more than that to go get a good

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.680 
kill off more than that to go get a good
defense<00:02:47.190> at<00:02:47.400> least<00:02:47.670> what<00:02:48.030> he<00:02:48.120> did<00:02:48.270> was<00:02:48.450> managed

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
defense at least what he did was managed

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.540 
defense at least what he did was managed
to<00:02:48.750> kill<00:02:48.930> off<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.200> number<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.680> vultures<00:02:50.070> so

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
to kill off a number of vultures so

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.510 
to kill off a number of vultures so
Watson<00:02:51.030> doesn't<00:02:51.710> reinforce<00:02:52.710> immediately

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
Watson doesn't reinforce immediately

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.430 
Watson doesn't reinforce immediately
with<00:02:53.640> more<00:02:53.850> vultures<00:02:54.270> that<00:02:54.720> group<00:02:55.110> of<00:02:55.230> zealots

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
with more vultures that group of zealots

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.840 
with more vultures that group of zealots
coming<00:02:55.860> up<00:02:55.980> could<00:02:56.220> deal<00:02:56.460> a<00:02:56.520> little<00:02:56.640> more

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
coming up could deal a little more

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.640 
coming up could deal a little more
damage<00:02:57.150> but<00:02:57.330> at<00:02:57.420> this<00:02:57.510> point<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:57.810> think<00:02:57.840> best<00:02:58.500> is

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
damage but at this point I think best is

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.080 
damage but at this point I think best is
going<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:58.890> lose<00:02:59.070> that<00:02:59.100> expansion<00:02:59.670> it's<00:02:59.970> going

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
going to lose that expansion it's going

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.210 
going to lose that expansion it's going
to<00:03:00.150> be<00:03:00.210> really<00:03:00.480> bad<00:03:00.690> for<00:03:00.750> him<00:03:01.220> Clausen's

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
to be really bad for him Clausen's

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.130 
to be really bad for him Clausen's
getting<00:03:02.490> set<00:03:02.700> up<00:03:02.730> here<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.240> the<00:03:03.630> more<00:03:03.870> time

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:01.540 
should not be in this game at this point

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.020 
should not be in this game at this point
to<00:06:01.780> be<00:06:01.840> honest<00:06:02.490> best<00:06:03.490> looks<00:06:03.730> like<00:06:03.820> he's<00:06:03.940> gonna

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
to be honest best looks like he's gonna

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.240 
to be honest best looks like he's gonna
try<00:06:04.300> to<00:06:04.330> polish<00:06:04.840> off<00:06:05.020> this<00:06:05.140> army<00:06:05.500> hero<00:06:05.710> another

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
try to polish off this army hero another

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.580 
try to polish off this army hero another
great<00:06:06.550> stasis<00:06:06.970> so<00:06:07.090> just<00:06:07.390> as<00:06:07.540> one<00:06:07.720> group<00:06:07.900> on<00:06:08.350> the

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
great stasis so just as one group on the

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.470 
great stasis so just as one group on the
stasis<00:06:08.800> is<00:06:09.130> the<00:06:09.490> other<00:06:09.610> group<00:06:09.820> can't<00:06:10.030> stasis

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:10.480 
stasis is the other group can't stasis

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.610 
stasis is the other group can't stasis
so<00:06:10.630> i<00:06:10.660> think<00:06:10.780> best<00:06:11.080> is<00:06:11.200> going<00:06:11.320> to<00:06:11.380> kill<00:06:11.530> off

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
so i think best is going to kill off

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.050 
so i think best is going to kill off
everything<00:06:11.890> here<00:06:12.220> yeah<00:06:12.400> looks<00:06:12.910> like<00:06:12.970> the

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
everything here yeah looks like the

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.880 
everything here yeah looks like the
unsafe<00:06:13.540> this<00:06:13.720> army<00:06:14.020> goes<00:06:14.170> down<00:06:14.380> and<00:06:14.590> so<00:06:14.740> will

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:14.890 
unsafe this army goes down and so will

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.220 
unsafe this army goes down and so will
these<00:06:14.980> trap<00:06:15.310> units<00:06:15.750> that's<00:06:16.750> doing<00:06:17.020> a<00:06:17.050> good<00:06:17.170> job

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:17.230 
these trap units that's doing a good job

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.990 
these trap units that's doing a good job
of<00:06:17.470> killing<00:06:17.620> Lawson's<00:06:18.100> units<00:06:18.460> plus<00:06:18.610> and<00:06:18.820> doing

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
of killing Lawson's units plus and doing

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.670 
of killing Lawson's units plus and doing
a<00:06:19.060> good<00:06:19.180> job<00:06:19.240> of<00:06:19.390> killing<00:06:19.630> best<00:06:20.020> economy

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
a good job of killing best economy

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.440 
a good job of killing best economy
though<00:06:20.800> and<00:06:21.040> best<00:06:21.670> just<00:06:21.880> look<00:06:22.030> at<00:06:22.090> how<00:06:22.240> few

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.450 
though and best just look at how few

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.730 
though and best just look at how few
units<00:06:22.750> he's<00:06:22.900> able<00:06:23.020> to<00:06:23.140> put<00:06:23.320> out<00:06:23.350> just<00:06:23.650> a<00:06:23.710> couple

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
units he's able to put out just a couple

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.860 
units he's able to put out just a couple
of<00:06:24.070> zealots<00:06:24.400> and<00:06:24.490> those<00:06:24.910> arbiters<00:06:25.480> are<00:06:25.690> the

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
of zealots and those arbiters are the

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.210 
of zealots and those arbiters are the
only<00:06:26.020> things<00:06:26.410> that<00:06:26.620> are<00:06:26.710> keeping<00:06:26.830> him<00:06:27.070> in<00:06:27.130> this

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
only things that are keeping him in this

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.400 
only things that are keeping him in this
game<00:06:27.310> the<00:06:28.120> only<00:06:28.330> thing<00:06:28.480> he<00:06:28.720> has<00:06:28.840> is<00:06:29.050> the<00:06:29.080> fact

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.410 
game the only thing he has is the fact

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.350 
game the only thing he has is the fact
that<00:06:29.500> Hassan<00:06:29.800> is<00:06:30.130> uh<00:06:30.160> got<00:06:30.670> limited<00:06:31.060> scans

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
that Hassan is uh got limited scans

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.580 
that Hassan is uh got limited scans
that's<00:06:31.630> probably<00:06:31.900> one<00:06:32.080> of<00:06:32.110> the<00:06:32.200> reasons<00:06:32.230> why

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
that's probably one of the reasons why

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.520 
that's probably one of the reasons why
he<00:06:32.890> has<00:06:33.130> not<00:06:33.430> been<00:06:33.640> effective<00:06:34.030> so<00:06:34.060> far<00:06:34.380> he<00:06:35.380> just

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
he has not been effective so far he just

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.140 
he has not been effective so far he just
has<00:06:35.650> such<00:06:35.860> few<00:06:36.040> limited<00:06:36.490> scans<00:06:36.730> he<00:06:36.880> doesn't

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
has such few limited scans he doesn't

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.150 
has such few limited scans he doesn't
have<00:06:37.300> science<00:06:37.900> vessels<00:06:38.230> out<00:06:38.350> yet<00:06:38.560> of<00:06:38.650> course

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160 
have science vessels out yet of course

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.340 
have science vessels out yet of course
and<00:06:39.250> he's<00:06:39.910> been<00:06:40.270> losing<00:06:40.600> his<00:06:40.690> armies<00:06:41.050> against

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:41.350 
and he's been losing his armies against

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.110 
and he's been losing his armies against
best<00:06:41.620> but<00:06:42.310> there's<00:06:42.490> the<00:06:42.640> first<00:06:42.820> Science

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120

best but there's the first Science
Vessel<00:06:43.180> claassen<00:06:44.140> also<00:06:44.590> can<00:06:45.490> pick<00:06:45.730> up<00:06:45.820> another

Vessel claassen also can pick up another

Vessel claassen also can pick up another
expansion<00:06:46.360> pretty<00:06:46.900> easily<00:06:47.170> at<00:06:47.380> this<00:06:47.530> point

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740 
expansion pretty easily at this point

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.970 
expansion pretty easily at this point
and<00:06:47.860> ho<00:06:48.090> Lawson<00:06:49.090> exploiting<00:06:49.930> the<00:06:50.050> guy<00:06:50.230> that's

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:50.980 
and ho Lawson exploiting the guy that's

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.320 
and ho Lawson exploiting the guy that's
a<00:06:51.100> great<00:06:51.490> thing<00:06:51.700> I<00:06:51.880> didn't<00:06:52.060> even<00:06:52.210> know<00:06:52.300> that

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
a great thing I didn't even know that

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.690 
a great thing I didn't even know that
map<00:06:52.690> that<00:06:53.170> exists<00:06:53.650> on<00:06:53.770> the<00:06:53.890> map<00:06:54.010> but<00:06:54.160> that's<00:06:54.640> a

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:54.700 
map that exists on the map but that's a

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.940 
map that exists on the map but that's a
great<00:06:54.940> use<00:06:55.090> of<00:06:55.120> that<00:06:55.390> distance<00:06:55.780> there<00:06:56.050> I<00:06:56.260> guess

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:56.950 
great use of that distance there I guess

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.170 
great use of that distance there I guess
that<00:06:57.130> is<00:06:57.160> a<00:06:57.310> danger<00:06:57.760> of<00:06:57.850> taking<00:06:57.970> that

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.180 
that is a danger of taking that

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.060 
that is a danger of taking that
expansion<00:06:58.540> you<00:06:58.810> are<00:06:59.050> in<00:06:59.200> see<00:06:59.440> jable<00:06:59.680> position

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.070 
expansion you are in see jable position

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.070 
expansion you are in see jable position
but<00:07:00.250> here<00:07:00.430> comes<00:07:00.670> arbiters<00:07:01.180> arbors<00:07:01.840> are<00:07:01.960> going

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 
but here comes arbiters arbors are going

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.350 
but here comes arbiters arbors are going
to<00:07:02.140> take<00:07:02.260> out<00:07:02.440> this<00:07:02.590> cannon<00:07:03.160> I<00:07:03.250> think<00:07:03.520> sorry

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360 
to take out this cannon I think sorry

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.420 
to take out this cannon I think sorry
this<00:07:04.570> tank<00:07:05.050> I<00:07:05.290> think<00:07:05.590> before<00:07:05.770> it<00:07:06.070> takes<00:07:06.220> out

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:06.430 
this tank I think before it takes out

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.450 
this tank I think before it takes out
the<00:07:06.460> Nexus<00:07:06.970> yeah<00:07:07.720> these<00:07:07.900> hero<00:07:08.320> arbiters<00:07:08.950> great

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.460 
the Nexus yeah these hero arbiters great

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.710 
the Nexus yeah these hero arbiters great
use<00:07:09.820> by<00:07:11.460> best<00:07:12.460> and<00:07:12.760> the<00:07:12.910> the<00:07:13.180> arbiters<00:07:13.540> will

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:13.720 
use by best and the the arbiters will

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.930 
use by best and the the arbiters will
actually<00:07:14.320> take<00:07:14.560> out<00:07:14.770> the<00:07:15.100> siege<00:07:15.340> tank<00:07:15.670> yes

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:15.940 
actually take out the siege tank yes

actually take out the siege tank yes
they<00:07:16.180> will<00:07:16.360> arbiters<00:07:17.320> have<00:07:17.590> actually<00:07:18.190> taken

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.490 
they will arbiters have actually taken

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.180 
they will arbiters have actually taken
something<00:07:18.850> out<00:07:19.060> with<00:07:19.450> their<00:07:20.230> weapon<00:07:20.770> oh<00:07:20.980> my

then suicide themselves on there but for
once<00:07:39.130> the<00:07:39.340> arbiters<00:07:39.670> attack<00:07:39.910> actually<00:07:40.240> did

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:40.360 
once the arbiters attack actually did

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.930 
once the arbiters attack actually did
some<00:07:40.510> work<00:07:40.630> and<00:07:41.500> mansions<00:07:42.490> take<00:07:42.730> out<00:07:42.820> the

some work and mansions take out the

some work and mansions take out the
tanks<00:07:43.240> so<00:07:43.390> good<00:07:43.660> work<00:07:43.840> and<00:07:44.050> meanwhile<00:07:45.040> Hassan
