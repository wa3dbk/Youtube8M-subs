hit the plus sign and I'm gonna go with
a<00:01:23.549> real<00:01:23.880> attribute<00:01:24.570> because<00:01:24.990> we're<00:01:25.170> dealing

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
a real attribute because we're dealing

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.789 
a real attribute because we're dealing
with<00:01:25.610> decimal<00:01:26.610> points<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.439> we're<00:01:28.439> gonna<00:01:28.530> call

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
with decimal points and we're gonna call

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.429 
with decimal points and we're gonna call
that<00:01:29.630> ink<00:01:32.450> now<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.509> first<00:01:33.810> thing<00:01:33.990> we<00:01:34.110> want<00:01:34.350> to

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
that ink now the first thing we want to

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.080 
that ink now the first thing we want to
do<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:35.240> we<00:01:36.240> want<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.540> tell<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.560> lines<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.909> add

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
do is we want to tell the lines to add

do is we want to tell the lines to add
to<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.810> ink<00:01:40.130> so<00:01:41.130> we're<00:01:41.549> gonna<00:01:41.640> go<00:01:41.759> into<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
to the ink so we're gonna go into the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.410 
to the ink so we're gonna go into the
segments<00:01:42.659> here<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.640> we're<00:01:44.640> gonna<00:01:44.729> create<00:01:45.030> a

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
segments here and we're gonna create a

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.100 
segments here and we're gonna create a
rule<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.200> an<00:01:47.070> attribute<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.390> on<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.990> left

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
rule and an attribute so on the left

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.380 
rule and an attribute so on the left
hand<00:01:49.290> side<00:01:49.470> hit<00:01:49.740> attribute<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.369> we're<00:01:51.299> gonna

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
hand side hit attribute and we're gonna

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.880 
hand side hit attribute and we're gonna
use<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.720> boolean<00:01:52.079> because<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:52.619> gonna<00:01:52.740> be<00:01:52.829> a

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
use a boolean because it's gonna be a

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.420 
use a boolean because it's gonna be a
yes<00:01:53.159> or<00:01:53.430> no<00:01:53.600> and<00:01:54.829> we're<00:01:55.829> gonna<00:01:55.920> call<00:01:56.189> this

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
yes or no and we're gonna call this

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.270 
yes or no and we're gonna call this
active<00:01:59.299> we're<00:02:00.299> gonna<00:02:00.390> hit<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.719> true<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.290> we're

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
active we're gonna hit it true and we're

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.630 
active we're gonna hit it true and we're
gonna<00:02:02.399> say<00:02:02.670> when<00:02:03.210> mouse<00:02:03.479> button<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.140> up<00:02:04.640> now

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
gonna say when mouse button is up now

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.249 
gonna say when mouse button is up now
this<00:02:05.790> will<00:02:05.939> also<00:02:06.090> work<00:02:06.240> for<00:02:06.540> touch<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.110> when

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
this will also work for touch so when

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.380 
this will also work for touch so when
touches<00:02:07.710> up<00:02:07.860> it'll<00:02:08.429> work<00:02:09.560> hit<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.590> plus<00:02:10.830> sign

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
touches up it'll work hit a plus sign

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.250 
touches up it'll work hit a plus sign
I'm<00:02:13.050> going<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.350> say<00:02:13.500> attribute<00:02:14.960> game

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
I'm going to say attribute game

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:24.590 
I'm going to say attribute game
oh<00:02:17.630> sorry<00:02:18.630> self<00:02:20.240> dot<00:02:21.240> active<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:22.050> true<00:02:23.600> we're

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
oh sorry self dot active is true we're

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.660 
oh sorry self dot active is true we're
gonna<00:02:24.690> change<00:02:25.110> attribute<00:02:26.959> game<00:02:28.430> dot<00:02:29.430> Inc<00:02:30.410> to

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
gonna change attribute game dot Inc to

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:40.490 
gonna change attribute game dot Inc to
game<00:02:32.990> dot<00:02:33.990> Inc<00:02:34.550> +<00:02:36.200> self<00:02:37.200> size<00:02:38.190> width<00:02:39.260> so<00:02:40.260> we<00:02:40.410> can

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
game dot Inc + self size width so we can

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.559 
game dot Inc + self size width so we can
keep<00:02:40.620> track<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.980> how<00:02:41.250> long<00:02:41.850> each<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.450> our

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
keep track of how long each of our

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.580 
keep track of how long each of our
segments<00:02:43.050> are<00:02:43.790> we're<00:02:44.790> gonna<00:02:44.850> okay<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.590> then

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
segments are we're gonna okay and then

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.050 
segments are we're gonna okay and then
we're<00:02:46.680> gonna<00:02:46.770> do<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:46.920> change<00:02:47.220> attribute<00:02:47.820> and

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
we're gonna do a change attribute and

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
we're gonna do a change attribute and
we're<00:02:49.020> gonna<00:02:49.140> change<00:02:49.500> self<00:02:51.470> active<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:53.580> false

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
we're gonna change self active to false

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.199 
we're gonna change self active to false
so<00:02:55.080> that<00:02:55.230> way<00:02:55.350> this<00:02:55.620> line<00:02:55.920> will<00:02:56.280> no<00:02:56.519> longer<00:02:56.970> add

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
so that way this line will no longer add

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.470 
so that way this line will no longer add
when<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:59.130> mouse<00:02:59.310> button<00:02:59.640> is<00:02:59.730> up<00:03:01.610> now<00:03:02.610> I've

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
when the mouse button is up now I've

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.910 
when the mouse button is up now I've
already<00:03:03.810> played<00:03:04.019> with<00:03:04.170> some<00:03:04.380> numbers<00:03:04.650> here<00:03:04.890> so

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
already played with some numbers here so

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.420 
already played with some numbers here so
I<00:03:05.190> want<00:03:05.519> to<00:03:05.610> give<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.880> player<00:03:06.800> 1500<00:03:07.800> units<00:03:08.100> of

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
I want to give the player 1500 units of

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.970 
I want to give the player 1500 units of
Inc<00:03:08.870> so<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.200> first<00:03:10.410> thing<00:03:10.530> we're<00:03:10.650> gonna<00:03:10.739> do<00:03:10.950> is

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
Inc so the first thing we're gonna do is

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.250 
Inc so the first thing we're gonna do is
we're<00:03:11.220> going<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.370> go<00:03:11.489> into<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.330> pen<00:03:12.750> system

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
we're going to go into the pen system

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.830 
we're going to go into the pen system
and<00:03:13.519> it<00:03:14.519> says<00:03:14.730> when<00:03:14.940> mouse<00:03:15.120> button<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.600> down

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
and it says when mouse button is down

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.990 
and it says when mouse button is down
we're<00:03:16.709> gonna<00:03:16.799> do<00:03:17.040> when<00:03:17.250> mouse<00:03:17.430> button<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.820> down

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
we're gonna do when mouse button is down

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.280 
we're gonna do when mouse button is down
and<00:03:19.880> attribute<00:03:21.590> game<00:03:23.030> Inc<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:25.220> equal<00:03:26.220> or<00:03:26.430> less

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
and attribute game Inc is equal or less

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.020 
and attribute game Inc is equal or less
than<00:03:29.090> 1500<00:03:30.410> so<00:03:31.410> once<00:03:31.980> it's<00:03:32.220> more<00:03:32.459> than<00:03:32.579> 50<00:03:32.940> are

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
than 1500 so once it's more than 50 are

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.720 
than 1500 so once it's more than 50 are
1500<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:34.079> will<00:03:34.230> stop<00:03:34.500> drawing<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:35.280> user<00:03:35.459> can

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
1500 it will stop drawing the user can

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.440 
1500 it will stop drawing the user can
no<00:03:35.940> longer<00:03:36.209> draw<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.570> line<00:03:38.150> we're<00:03:39.150> gonna<00:03:39.209> hit

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
no longer draw a line we're gonna hit

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.069 
no longer draw a line we're gonna hit
back<00:03:40.370> and<00:03:41.370> I'm<00:03:41.579> gonna<00:03:41.700> go<00:03:41.820> into<00:03:42.120> our<00:03:42.150> Inc<00:03:42.750> line

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
back and I'm gonna go into our Inc line

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.949 
back and I'm gonna go into our Inc line
here<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:44.400> I'm<00:03:44.970> just<00:03:45.120> gonna<00:03:45.209> make<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:45.900> a

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
here and I'm just gonna make that a

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.770 
here and I'm just gonna make that a
little<00:03:46.290> thinner<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:46.950> I'm<00:03:47.250> gonna<00:03:47.340> go<00:03:47.549> maybe<00:03:47.730> 10

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.509 

now<00:03:51.780> we<00:03:52.320> want<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.560> do<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.650> couple<00:03:53.040> things<00:03:53.070> here

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
now we want to do a couple things here

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.539 
now we want to do a couple things here
we<00:03:53.670> want<00:03:53.880> to<00:03:54.500> constrain<00:03:55.500> this<00:03:55.829> to<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.370> left

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
we want to constrain this to the left

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.850 
we want to constrain this to the left
hand<00:03:56.790> side<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:57.269> we<00:03:58.079> also<00:03:58.110> want<00:03:58.440> to<00:03:58.500> constrain

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
hand side and we also want to constrain

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.530 
hand side and we also want to constrain
it<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.010> how<00:03:59.220> much<00:03:59.340> ink<00:03:59.610> there<00:03:59.790> is<00:04:02.390> so<00:04:03.390> what

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
it to how much ink there is so what

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.699 
it to how much ink there is so what
we're<00:04:03.630> gonna<00:04:03.720> do<00:04:03.930> is<00:04:04.140> we're<00:04:04.260> gonna<00:04:04.350> open<00:04:04.530> up

we're gonna do is we're gonna open up

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.130 
we're gonna do is we're gonna open up
the<00:04:04.769> ink<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.519> we're<00:04:06.209> gonna<00:04:06.329> put<00:04:06.540> a<00:04:06.570> constraint

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
the ink and we're gonna put a constraint

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.949 
the ink and we're gonna put a constraint
attribute<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:08.299> we're<00:04:09.299> going<00:04:09.420> to<00:04:09.480> constrain

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
attribute and we're going to constrain

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.770 
attribute and we're going to constrain
self<00:04:12.170> position<00:04:13.549> X<00:04:14.549> because<00:04:15.120> X<00:04:15.239> is<00:04:15.420> left<00:04:15.630> and

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
going to do is grab another constraint

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.950 
going to do is grab another constraint
attribute<00:04:43.400> and<00:04:43.789> we're<00:04:44.509> going<00:04:44.630> to<00:04:44.690> put<00:04:44.810> it<00:04:44.870> in

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
attribute and we're going to put it in

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.790 
attribute and we're going to put it in
here<00:04:45.139> and<00:04:45.490> we're<00:04:46.490> gonna<00:04:46.850> constrain<00:04:49.600> self.size

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
here and we're gonna constrain self.size

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:58.839 
here and we're gonna constrain self.size
width<00:04:52.389> to<00:04:53.389> now<00:04:54.350> the<00:04:56.080> the<00:04:57.080> bar<00:04:57.289> is<00:04:57.699> 450<00:04:58.699> pixels

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:58.849 
width to now the the bar is 450 pixels

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:00.820 
width to now the the bar is 450 pixels
long<00:04:59.180> I've<00:04:59.509> already<00:04:59.810> tested<00:05:00.169> that<00:05:00.289> that's

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
long I've already tested that that's

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.409 
long I've already tested that that's
somewhat<00:05:01.160> hella<00:05:01.400> that's<00:05:01.610> how<00:05:01.729> long<00:05:01.880> my<00:05:02.030> bar<00:05:02.240> is

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
somewhat hella that's how long my bar is

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.810 
somewhat hella that's how long my bar is
you<00:05:02.990> can<00:05:03.169> make<00:05:03.259> your<00:05:03.320> bar<00:05:03.770> whatever<00:05:04.340> you<00:05:04.580> want

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
you can make your bar whatever you want

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.260 
you can make your bar whatever you want
the<00:05:04.970> math<00:05:05.120> would<00:05:05.270> be<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.449> same<00:05:05.690> but<00:05:06.289> mine<00:05:06.500> is

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
the math would be the same but mine is

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.110 
the math would be the same but mine is
450<00:05:08.270> pixels<00:05:08.419> so<00:05:08.780> I'm<00:05:08.870> gonna<00:05:08.990> put<00:05:09.259> 450<00:05:09.949> and<00:05:10.190> I'm

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
450 pixels so I'm gonna put 450 and I'm

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.520 
450 pixels so I'm gonna put 450 and I'm
gonna<00:05:11.270> go<00:05:11.360> -<00:05:12.250> Open<00:05:13.250> bracket<00:05:14.110> and<00:05:15.110> we're<00:05:15.440> gonna

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
gonna go - Open bracket and we're gonna

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:22.089 
gonna go - Open bracket and we're gonna
go<00:05:15.830> game<00:05:16.419> dot<00:05:17.419> Inc<00:05:18.430> divided<00:05:19.430> by<00:05:20.620> three<00:05:21.620> point

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099 
go game dot Inc divided by three point

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.420 
go game dot Inc divided by three point
three<00:05:22.220> three<00:05:23.050> close<00:05:24.050> bracket<00:05:24.530> now<00:05:25.009> here's<00:05:25.280> the

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
three three close bracket now here's the

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.350 
three three close bracket now here's the
math<00:05:25.610> for<00:05:25.849> this<00:05:26.169> I<00:05:27.169> want<00:05:27.889> 1500<00:05:28.729> units<00:05:28.910> of<00:05:29.210> ink

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
math for this I want 1500 units of ink

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.790 
math for this I want 1500 units of ink
so<00:05:30.020> I<00:05:30.050> do<00:05:30.199> I<00:05:30.530> divide<00:05:30.830> 1500<00:05:31.820> divided<00:05:32.690> by<00:05:32.960> 450

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
so I do I divide 1500 divided by 450

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.670 
so I do I divide 1500 divided by 450
gives<00:05:34.669> me<00:05:34.820> three<00:05:35.060> point<00:05:35.330> three<00:05:35.419> three<00:05:35.780> so<00:05:36.590> if

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
gives me three point three three so if

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.980 
gives me three point three three so if
you<00:05:36.800> had<00:05:36.919> two<00:05:37.220> thousand<00:05:38.030> units<00:05:38.300> of<00:05:38.389> ink<00:05:38.599> you<00:05:38.750> do

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
you had two thousand units of ink you do

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.279 
you had two thousand units of ink you do
2,000<00:05:39.889> divided<00:05:40.190> by<00:05:40.400> 450<00:05:41.120> and<00:05:41.330> that<00:05:41.930> would<00:05:42.080> tell

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289 
2,000 divided by 450 and that would tell

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:44.950 
2,000 divided by 450 and that would tell
you<00:05:42.409> what<00:05:42.590> to<00:05:42.770> divide<00:05:43.099> by<00:05:43.539> okay<00:05:44.539> so<00:05:44.570> whatever

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
you what to divide by okay so whatever

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.029 
you what to divide by okay so whatever
your<00:05:45.320> total<00:05:45.740> ink<00:05:45.919> they<00:05:46.070> want<00:05:47.349> divided<00:05:48.349> by<00:05:48.500> how

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 
your total ink they want divided by how

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:51.790 
your total ink they want divided by how
long<00:05:49.340> your<00:05:49.520> bar<00:05:49.699> is<00:05:49.940> gives<00:05:50.810> you<00:05:51.080> this<00:05:51.380> number

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
long your bar is gives you this number

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.790 
long your bar is gives you this number
here<00:05:52.039> okay<00:05:52.570> I'm<00:05:53.570> gonna<00:05:53.780> hit<00:05:53.900> okay<00:05:54.169> now<00:05:54.710> I'm

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800

you how to fix that right now but you'll
notice<00:06:13.550> once<00:06:13.759> we<00:06:13.880> run<00:06:13.970> out<00:06:14.120> of<00:06:14.180> ink<00:06:14.330> I<00:06:14.509> can<00:06:14.690> no

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
notice once we run out of ink I can no

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.830 
notice once we run out of ink I can no
longer<00:06:14.900> draw<00:06:15.470> a<00:06:15.500> line<00:06:15.770> anymore

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
longer draw a line anymore

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.020 
longer draw a line anymore
so<00:06:17.840> we're<00:06:17.990> back<00:06:18.259> and<00:06:18.470> I<00:06:18.530> show<00:06:18.800> you<00:06:18.830> you<00:06:19.820> always

want<00:06:20.419> to<00:06:20.479> have<00:06:20.780> the<00:06:22.389> constrain<00:06:23.389> self<00:06:24.050> position

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
want to have the constrain self position

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.300 
want to have the constrain self position
X<00:06:24.699> underneath<00:06:25.699> that<00:06:26.690> rule<00:06:26.960> there<00:06:27.199> so<00:06:28.070> now<00:06:28.190> when

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
X underneath that rule there so now when

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.640 
X underneath that rule there so now when
I<00:06:28.340> hit<00:06:28.460> preview<00:06:28.699> you'll<00:06:29.060> see<00:06:29.349> it's<00:06:30.349> no<00:06:30.620> longer

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
I hit preview you'll see it's no longer

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.219 
I hit preview you'll see it's no longer
jumping<00:06:31.430> on<00:06:31.580> this<00:06:31.759> side<00:06:31.970> so<00:06:32.780> it<00:06:32.870> looks<00:06:33.020> much

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:33.229 
jumping on this side so it looks much

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:35.800 
jumping on this side so it looks much
smoother<00:06:33.680> and<00:06:34.180> again<00:06:35.180> you<00:06:35.300> run<00:06:35.419> into<00:06:35.630> Vinc

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
smoother and again you run into Vinc

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.950 
smoother and again you run into Vinc
that's<00:06:36.440> it<00:06:36.969> so<00:06:37.969> it's<00:06:38.060> as<00:06:38.210> simple<00:06:38.240> as<00:06:38.539> that<00:06:38.599> I

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
that's it so it's as simple as that I

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.279 
that's it so it's as simple as that I
hope

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:39.289
