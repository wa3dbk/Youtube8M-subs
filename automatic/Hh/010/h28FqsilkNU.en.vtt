for my first recommendation for the week
going<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.820> give<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.150> one<00:00:21.330> over<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.689> LeBlanc

going to give that one over to LeBlanc

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.439 
going to give that one over to LeBlanc
LeBlanc's<00:00:23.100> been<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.460> decent<00:00:23.699> state<00:00:24.180> for<00:00:24.420> a

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
LeBlanc's been in a decent state for a

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.140 
LeBlanc's been in a decent state for a
while<00:00:24.720> now<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:25.019> know<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:26.039> we<00:00:26.340> had<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.670> removal

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
while now I know that we had the removal

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.040 
while now I know that we had the removal
of<00:00:27.269> DFG<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.380> we<00:00:28.980> had<00:00:29.310> what<00:00:30.179> else<00:00:30.359> we<00:00:30.539> have<00:00:30.570> she

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
of DFG and we had what else we have she

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.959 
of DFG and we had what else we have she
had<00:00:31.170> her<00:00:31.199> silence<00:00:31.830> removed<00:00:32.189> at<00:00:32.369> one<00:00:32.520> point<00:00:32.730> and

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
had her silence removed at one point and

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.790 
had her silence removed at one point and
that<00:00:33.090> seemed<00:00:33.390> like<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.690> downfall<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.170> LeBlanc

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
that seemed like the downfall of LeBlanc

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.770 
that seemed like the downfall of LeBlanc
but<00:00:34.950> she's<00:00:35.160> still<00:00:35.309> pretty<00:00:35.550> darn<00:00:35.969> strong<00:00:36.510> I

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
but she's still pretty darn strong I

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.350 
but she's still pretty darn strong I
think<00:00:37.230> she<00:00:37.410> still<00:00:37.620> does<00:00:37.829> quite<00:00:38.190> well<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:39.180> only

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
think she still does quite well the only

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.389 
think she still does quite well the only
thing<00:00:39.540> really<00:00:39.719> being<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.590> being<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.160> problem

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
thing really being and being a problem

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.729 
thing really being and being a problem
for<00:00:41.670> her<00:00:41.730> currently<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.360> just<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> tanky<00:00:43.559> meta

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
for her currently is just the tanky meta

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:44.930 
for her currently is just the tanky meta
but<00:00:43.980> once<00:00:44.219> again<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.430> think<00:00:44.640> we're<00:00:44.760> seeing

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
but once again I think we're seeing

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.400 
but once again I think we're seeing
people<00:00:45.270> stray<00:00:45.480> away<00:00:45.600> from<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> little<00:00:46.170> bit

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
people stray away from it a little bit

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.290 
people stray away from it a little bit
to<00:00:46.530> be<00:00:46.620> honest<00:00:46.950> she<00:00:47.070> does<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> great<00:00:47.910> job<00:00:48.000> but

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
to be honest she does a great job but

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.610 
to be honest she does a great job but
just<00:00:48.420> assassinating<00:00:49.020> people<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.440> back

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
just assassinating people in the back

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.619 
just assassinating people in the back
line<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.129> being<00:00:50.520> quite<00:00:50.789> tricky<00:00:51.120> while<00:00:51.449> doing

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629

now<00:01:33.180> Caleb<00:01:34.049> probably<00:01:34.439> doesn't<00:01:34.650> see<00:01:34.740> as<00:01:34.829> much

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950

now Caleb probably doesn't see as much
gameplay<00:01:35.220> as<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> lot<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.939> other<00:01:36.150> champions<00:01:36.630> but

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
gameplay as a lot of other champions but

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.960 
gameplay as a lot of other champions but
i<00:01:37.619> still<00:01:37.799> think<00:01:37.920> kales<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.430> very<00:01:38.670> strong

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
i still think kales in a very strong

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.880 
i still think kales in a very strong
position<00:01:39.030> i<00:01:39.630> still<00:01:39.840> think<00:01:39.930> jungle<00:01:40.200> kales<00:01:40.500> fine

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
position i still think jungle kales fine

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.310 
position i still think jungle kales fine
as<00:01:41.159> well<00:01:41.430> i<00:01:41.700> made<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> video<00:01:42.210> about<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.899> earlier

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
as well i made a video about it earlier

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.770 
as well i made a video about it earlier
in<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.680> season<00:01:43.890> I'm<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.850> big<00:01:45.030> fan<00:01:45.270> it's<00:01:45.540> still

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
in the season I'm a big fan it's still

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.139 
in the season I'm a big fan it's still
really<00:01:45.960> fun<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.320> play<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.670> kale<00:01:47.670> doesn't<00:01:48.030> get

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
really fun to play to kale doesn't get

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.149 
really fun to play to kale doesn't get
as<00:01:48.270> much<00:01:48.299> respect<00:01:48.869> as<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.110> would<00:01:49.590> hope<00:01:49.890> either

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
as much respect as I would hope either

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.310 
as much respect as I would hope either
and<00:01:50.520> she<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.240> kind<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.509> be<00:01:51.630> clutch<00:01:51.990> now<00:01:52.259> too

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
and she can kind of be clutch now too

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.800 
and she can kind of be clutch now too
with<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.799> lot<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.280> these<00:01:53.640> hyper<00:01:53.880> carry<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.299> DC's

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
with a lot of these hyper carry a DC's

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.810 
with a lot of these hyper carry a DC's
coming<00:01:55.170> back<00:01:55.320> into<00:01:55.500> play<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.770> take<00:01:56.040> out<00:01:56.250> tanks

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
coming back into play to take out tanks

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.130 
coming back into play to take out tanks
she<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.360> keep<00:01:57.450> him<00:01:57.630> alive<00:01:57.840> with<00:01:58.020> her

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
she can keep him alive with her

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.810 
she can keep him alive with her
intervention<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:58.979> think<00:01:59.310> she's<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> pretty

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
intervention so I think she's a pretty

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.069 
intervention so I think she's a pretty
smart<00:02:00.119> play<00:02:00.420> she<00:02:00.570> does<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> good<00:02:00.840> job<00:02:00.899> of

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
smart play she does a good job of

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.899 
smart play she does a good job of
cutting<00:02:01.320> through<00:02:01.649> people's<00:02:01.950> defense<00:02:02.369> too<00:02:02.610> so

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
cutting through people's defense too so

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.789 
cutting through people's defense too so
you<00:02:03.270> might<00:02:03.390> want<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.570> try<00:02:03.689> kale<00:02:03.960> out<00:02:04.170> and

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
you might want to try kale out and

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.350 
you might want to try kale out and
that's<00:02:04.890> for<00:02:05.070> my<00:02:05.159> final<00:02:05.520> recommendation<00:02:06.180> I'm

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
that's for my final recommendation I'm

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.940 
that's for my final recommendation I'm
going<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.570> go<00:02:06.719> ahead<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.990> throw<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.380> over<00:02:07.710> to

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
going to go ahead and throw it over to

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.630 
going to go ahead and throw it over to
kha'zix<00:02:08.879> now<00:02:09.149> kha'zix<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:10.619> think<00:02:11.129> struggled<00:02:11.610> a

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
kha'zix now kha'zix I think struggled a

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.270 
kha'zix now kha'zix I think struggled a
little<00:02:11.819> bit

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
little bit

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.670 
little bit
the<00:02:12.459> jungle<00:02:12.790> earlier<00:02:13.330> on<00:02:13.600> in<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.959> season<00:02:14.170> he

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
the jungle earlier on in the season he

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.820 
the jungle earlier on in the season he
did<00:02:14.860> receive<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.220> little<00:02:15.550> bit<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:15.910> a<00:02:16.209> buff

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
did receive a little bit of a buff

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.170 
did receive a little bit of a buff
recently<00:02:17.830> helping<00:02:18.400> him<00:02:18.520> out<00:02:18.700> with<00:02:18.760> getting

some<00:02:19.510> health<00:02:19.750> back<00:02:20.020> on<00:02:20.260> his<00:02:20.500> W<00:02:21.069> which<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:21.760> think

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
some health back on his W which I think

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:22.920 
some health back on his W which I think
has<00:02:22.030> helped<00:02:22.240> him<00:02:22.330> out<00:02:22.390> in<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.569> jungle<00:02:22.660> a
