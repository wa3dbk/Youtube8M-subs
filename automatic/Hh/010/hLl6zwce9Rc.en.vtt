00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
there's probably pretty much two

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.249 
there's probably pretty much two
separate<00:00:09.300> issues<00:00:09.980> one<00:00:10.980> issue<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:12.259> social

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
separate issues one issue is that social

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.220 
separate issues one issue is that social
media<00:00:14.210> plays<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.240> lot<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.660> long<00:00:15.870> tail<00:00:16.109> and

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
media plays a lot in the long tail and

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.349 
media plays a lot in the long tail and
longtail<00:00:17.010> measurement<00:00:17.520> needles<00:00:18.000> say<00:00:18.240> is

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
longtail measurement needles say is

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.150 
longtail measurement needles say is
really<00:00:18.750> really<00:00:19.050> hard<00:00:19.289> because<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.920> smaller

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
really really hard because the smaller

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.790 
really really hard because the smaller
the<00:00:20.340> audience<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.689> harder<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.350> to

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
the audience is the harder it is to

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.220 
the audience is the harder it is to
actually<00:00:23.160> be<00:00:23.519> able<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.880> talk<00:00:24.869> about<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.140> a

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
actually be able to talk about in a

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.250 
actually be able to talk about in a
meaningful<00:00:25.470> way<00:00:25.939> now<00:00:26.939> what<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.689> think<00:00:27.930> becomes

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
meaningful way now what I think becomes

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.620 
meaningful way now what I think becomes
sort<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.529> interesting<00:00:29.099> here<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:29.849> if<00:00:30.420> I

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
sort of interesting here is that if I

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.160 
sort of interesting here is that if I
have<00:00:30.840> let's<00:00:31.260> say<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.439> blog<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.640> has<00:00:32.790> about

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
so here's sort of an analogy an analogy

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.550 
so here's sort of an analogy an analogy
would<00:01:17.220> be<00:01:17.420> if<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.600> think<00:01:18.840> about<00:01:18.900> Billy<00:01:19.350> Beane

media you have this core of influencers
that<00:01:44.399> we<00:01:44.549> can<00:01:44.759> quantify<00:01:45.090> those<00:01:45.659> influencers

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
that we can quantify those influencers

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.410 
that we can quantify those influencers
there<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.920> buzz<00:01:47.070> metrics<00:01:47.460> data<00:01:47.579> set<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.030> we

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
there a buzz metrics data set and we

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.670 
there a buzz metrics data set and we
could<00:01:48.540> talk<00:01:48.659> about<00:01:48.689> how<00:01:49.079> those<00:01:49.290> people<00:01:49.470> are

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
could talk about how those people are

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.170 
could talk about how those people are
influencing<00:01:50.220> other<00:01:50.369> people's<00:01:50.670> behavior<00:01:51.060> so

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
influencing other people's behavior so

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.219 
influencing other people's behavior so
we<00:01:51.270> think<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.540> that's<00:01:51.659> really<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.990> core

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
we think that that's really the core

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.740 
we think that that's really the core
element<00:01:52.680> for<00:01:53.250> social<00:01:53.820> media<00:01:54.119> measurement<00:01:54.360> so

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
element for social media measurement so

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.999 
element for social media measurement so
that's<00:01:54.899> problem<00:01:55.530> one<00:01:56.030> problem<00:01:57.030> two<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.990> how<00:01:58.950> do

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
that's problem one problem two is how do

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.700 
that's problem one problem two is how do
we<00:01:59.159> measure<00:01:59.759> it<00:02:00.350> how<00:02:01.350> do<00:02:01.409> we<00:02:01.560> measure

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
we measure it how do we measure

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.340 
we measure it how do we measure
dimensions<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:03.180> social<00:02:03.540> media<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.960> turn<00:02:04.170> it

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
dimensions in social media and turn it

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.770 
dimensions in social media and turn it
into<00:02:04.469> sort<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.920> general<00:02:05.280> media<00:02:05.640> context<00:02:06.299> so

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
into sort of a general media context so

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.960 
into sort of a general media context so
we<00:02:07.020> talk<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.259> lot<00:02:07.409> we<00:02:07.979> using<00:02:08.220> buzz<00:02:08.369> metrics<00:02:08.819> data

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
blogs and so we do is using matching up

blogs and so we do is using matching up
our<00:02:44.310> buzz<00:02:44.549> metrics<00:02:44.970> data<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.810> our<00:02:45.840> panel<00:02:46.290> data

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
our buzz metrics data to our panel data

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.229 
our buzz metrics data to our panel data
we<00:02:46.709> can<00:02:46.830> say<00:02:46.950> okay<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.459> is<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.760> population

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
we can say okay this is the population

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.530 
we can say okay this is the population
that<00:02:48.690> is<00:02:49.410> out<00:02:49.680> there<00:02:49.819> reading<00:02:50.819> about<00:02:51.299> the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
that is out there reading about the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.819 
that is out there reading about the
iphone<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.170> this<00:02:52.349> is<00:02:52.500> sort<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.739> the

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
iphone and this is sort of the

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.589 
iphone and this is sort of the
penetration<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.519> iphone<00:02:53.940> in<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.299> blogosphere

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
penetration of iphone in the blogosphere

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.900 
penetration of iphone in the blogosphere
reading<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.590> allows<00:02:56.250> us<00:02:56.549> to<00:02:56.670> sort<00:02:56.819> of

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
reading and allows us to sort of

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.880 
reading and allows us to sort of
translate<00:02:57.329> those<00:02:57.690> types<00:02:58.079> of<00:02:58.230> numbers<00:02:58.290> into

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
translate those types of numbers into

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:59.839 
translate those types of numbers into
numbers<00:02:59.190> they're<00:02:59.340> similar<00:02:59.549> to<00:02:59.670> an

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
numbers they're similar to an

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.750 
numbers they're similar to an
advertising<00:03:00.239> campaign<00:03:00.920> we<00:03:01.920> can<00:03:02.040> print<00:03:02.190> out<00:03:02.250> we

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
advertising campaign we can print out we

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.490 
advertising campaign we can print out we
could<00:03:02.910> produce<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.239> number<00:03:03.360> of<00:03:03.510> grps<00:03:04.019> that

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
could produce the number of grps that

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.069 
could produce the number of grps that

of its demographic reach things like

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.210 
of its demographic reach things like
that<00:03:09.690> in<00:03:09.989> a<00:03:10.349> very<00:03:10.380> similar<00:03:10.829> way<00:03:10.950> that<00:03:11.160> you

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
that in a very similar way that you

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.470 
that in a very similar way that you
would<00:03:11.310> think<00:03:11.430> about<00:03:11.549> advertising<00:03:11.970> campaign

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480
