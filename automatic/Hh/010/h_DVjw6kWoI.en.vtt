it's not
working<00:01:56.670> okay<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:59.060> we're<00:02:00.060> gonna<00:02:00.150> have<00:02:00.330> to<00:02:00.420> do

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
working okay so we're gonna have to do

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.899 
working okay so we're gonna have to do
this<00:02:00.690> the<00:02:01.130> old-fashioned<00:02:02.130> way<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:04.670> we<00:02:05.670> are

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
this the old-fashioned way and we are

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.870 
this the old-fashioned way and we are
going<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.210> apply<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.690> to<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.440> back<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:08.069> our

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
going to apply that to the back of our

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.530 
going to apply that to the back of our
hair<00:02:09.979> strands<00:02:10.979> now<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.430> typically<00:02:12.270> do<00:02:12.510> this

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
hair strands now I typically do this

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.750 
hair strands now I typically do this
before<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:13.020> even<00:02:13.200> start<00:02:13.500> parting<00:02:13.950> because<00:02:14.430> it

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
before I even start parting because it

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.750 
before I even start parting because it
makes<00:02:15.200> everything<00:02:16.200> easier<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.130> makes<00:02:17.160> my<00:02:17.489> hair

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
makes everything easier it makes my hair

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.320 
makes everything easier it makes my hair
um<00:02:18.030> easier<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.989> part<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:20.100> detangle<00:02:20.520> i<00:02:20.880> always

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
um easier to part to detangle i always

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.180 
um easier to part to detangle i always
put<00:02:21.630> some<00:02:21.810> type<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:21.989> leave<00:02:22.260> in<00:02:22.410> something<00:02:23.010> that

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
even start to manipulate it because as

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.860 
even start to manipulate it because as
you<00:02:32.400> can<00:02:32.519> see<00:02:32.700> my<00:02:32.910> hair<00:02:33.150> is<00:02:33.300> very<00:02:33.390> tightly

you can see my hair is very tightly

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.650 
you can see my hair is very tightly
coiled<00:02:34.250> curls<00:02:35.250> back<00:02:35.459> on<00:02:35.670> itself<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.300> it<00:02:36.540> can

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
coiled curls back on itself and it can

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.820 
coiled curls back on itself and it can
be<00:02:36.780> quite<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.260> challenge<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.730> am<00:02:39.680> clipping<00:02:40.680> my

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830

and then take that section and start

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.570 
and then take that section and start
detangling<00:02:54.600> now<00:02:54.780> I'm<00:02:54.930> starting<00:02:55.380> from<00:02:55.769> the

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
detangling now I'm starting from the

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.310 
detangling now I'm starting from the
bottom<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.530> top<00:02:58.800> uh<00:02:59.489> this<00:03:00.360> ensures<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:01.110> lot
