00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
did so that's that and then I wanted to

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.740 
did so that's that and then I wanted to
show<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:13.530> guys<00:02:14.180> what<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.720> looks<00:02:15.989> like<00:02:16.140> inside

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
so here's the brush here it's very like

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.930 
so here's the brush here it's very like
flat<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.780> thin<00:02:22.079> and<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:23.519> brush<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:23.910> very

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
flat and thin and the brush is very

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.970 
flat and thin and the brush is very
bendy<00:02:24.600> when<00:02:24.780> you're<00:02:24.930> applying<00:02:25.200> as<00:02:25.500> well<00:02:25.739> so

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
bendy when you're applying as well so

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.550 
bendy when you're applying as well so
it's<00:02:26.100> very<00:02:26.370> manageable<00:02:26.870> but<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.110> only<00:02:28.260> thing

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
it's very manageable but the only thing

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.130 
it's very manageable but the only thing
I<00:02:28.829> can<00:02:29.280> complain<00:02:29.700> about<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.510> front<00:02:30.810> part<00:02:30.959> I

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
I can complain about is the front part I

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.750 
I can complain about is the front part I
wish<00:02:31.350> it<00:02:31.560> was<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.739> little<00:02:31.860> bit<00:02:32.160> thinner<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:32.489> I

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
wish it was a little bit thinner so I

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.819 
wish it was a little bit thinner so I
can<00:02:33.030> like<00:02:33.239> it<00:02:33.420> into<00:02:33.690> my<00:02:33.840> inner<00:02:34.170> corners<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.680> my

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
can like it into my inner corners of my

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.640 
can like it into my inner corners of my
lips<00:02:34.950> easier<00:02:35.790> but<00:02:36.180> this<00:02:36.660> brush<00:02:37.019> does<00:02:37.350> the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
lips easier but this brush does the

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.500 
lips easier but this brush does the
trick<00:02:38.010> though<00:02:38.220> it's<00:02:38.489> not<00:02:38.610> just<00:02:38.940> L'Oreal

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510
