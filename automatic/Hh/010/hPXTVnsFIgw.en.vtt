00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
will be making it bigger but definitely

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.259 
will be making it bigger but definitely
enhancing<00:04:00.570> it<00:04:01.280> now<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.700> charts<00:04:02.970> look<00:04:03.150> to

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
be completely done in our uncovered I

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.759 
be completely done in our uncovered I
think<00:04:06.450> it's<00:04:06.570> so<00:04:06.780> cool<00:04:07.019> how<00:04:07.230> they<00:04:07.380> are<00:04:07.470> going<00:04:07.590> to
