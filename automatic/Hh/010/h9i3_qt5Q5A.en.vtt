00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
that and then you have a shorter

that and then you have a shorter
statement<00:03:28.269> necklace<00:03:28.630> but<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.320> looks

different still because instead of being
long<00:03:31.630> it's<00:03:32.019> short<00:03:32.410> and<00:03:32.560> wrapped<00:03:32.859> and<00:03:33.190> probably

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
long it's short and wrapped and probably

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.220 
long it's short and wrapped and probably
