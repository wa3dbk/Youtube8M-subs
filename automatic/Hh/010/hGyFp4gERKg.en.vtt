 the kick of de jong stand in front of 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.880
 a rival and do 12 with autopase span 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.560
 and define the little time near the stick 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.420
 it is worth noting that to hold the kick of 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.979
 de jong that is not de jong but good is 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.780

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.970
 the one of xabi alonso this time it becomes 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.380
 Xabi Alonso has a lot of merit and here 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.659
 the car passes very beautiful so that to see 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.289
 cerquita defining the satin stick 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.479
 number 7 is xxx from alpha xxx the goal is 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.799

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.420
 ball takes it out forward and villas 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.039
 without thinking twice nothing else happen 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.920
 the midfield canvas throws a 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.869
 unstoppable zambombazo for the goalkeeper who 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.479
 a goal enters the whole squad 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.850

 winning the band and now for a center 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.460
 very good I think the forward cavani 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.950
 that they position themselves backs and made a 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.950
 spectacular Chilean that ends within 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.390
 the goal although this goal is worth 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.250
 a little the quality that does not know to 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.539
 perfect but it is certainly a great goal 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.420
 deserves to be in this ranking there you have 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.340
 the magnificent Chilean of a center 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.019
 band something number 5 of the chicken before in 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.570
 league master online the play starts with 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.190
 a buffon goal kick is to look 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.930
 the one who has it is that of higuaín and wayne 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.739
 from first to nasri and notice here comes 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.660
 the play 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.239
 Nasri beats and is going to give a pass up 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.340
 but he repents endured a scuffle 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.049
 hold the second and ends up defining 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.880
 with a subtle vaseline the second to 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.220
 the best is well the deception play 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.230
 is that the defender thinks I'm going to 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.299
 give the pass the one above then I remove 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.760
 the pass will pull the back to cover me 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.410
 try to take both times with separate 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.329
 entradones but it does not achieve it and it is the 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.549
 tie the 80's match to goal number 4 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.350

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.170
 moving in the typical stand 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.090
 these players are going to see how it takes 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.609
 already the first player now gets in 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.709
 half of david luiz and quini and just 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.930
 happening to the goalkeeper and defining from 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.790
 rabona takes three players in this 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.130
 played with great ease things like 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.540
 are and ends up passing the goalkeeper 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.680
 who ends up defining and empty door 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.989
 with a 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.420
 beautiful rabona that beautiful shot 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.069
 number 3 of xavi cracks in league master 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.870
 online as you can see the center is going to 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.299
 long the second suit but controls it 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.099
 he leaves her behind and now he touches her a little 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.189
 forward and plays bombshell 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:28.859
 fix because it sneaks all over the 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:31.439
 squad friends enter pafuera cobwebs 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:34.109

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:36.090
 where does this ball come in you see it there we go 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:39.629
 to move to the next goal goal number 2 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.950
 of 96 ttt is online to fix the sac is 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.109
 jones to the one who has the real madrid 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.849
 schalke first dribble a player who 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.069
 the second one is on the floor now 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.930
 see here how it came out to three players 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.060
 in the same dribble it has just arrived to 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.189
 pepe la pica now for rafael that 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.019
 hooked a first-ever volley 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.060
 to the square of the second post 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.469
 somewhat strange play 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.540
 I can tell you an anecdote because 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:01.950
 this has told me the the really 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.379
 I gave to do a couple of times and a dribble 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.599
 but the player ignored him then 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:09.180
 then he stopped and started again 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.650
 and so that piece of golazo came up here 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.079
 you have the winner of these weeks of 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.729
 sergio that that iron online in which 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.340
 start the play will be the one that ends and 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:18.959
 fix you first grand dribble is made 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.060
 rival and he returns to do the same 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.919
 equally effective dribble guarín now 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.320
 you eat a heel the typical 12 of 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.690
 buckle and now and you have the last pipe 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.150
 and ras definition and is before which the 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.210
 doorkeeper astonished then leaves as between that 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.620
 golazo that I personally remember a 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.660
 little to the footprint although it is not very 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.729
 seemed like it is in the detail 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.949
 that is a carrerón of about 70 meters 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.750
 more or less from their own area and that 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.460
 ends in a goal without more hope that I have 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.840

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.430
