and<00:00:18.539> they'll<00:00:18.660> have<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.840> lot<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.020> power<00:00:19.230> either

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
is a little awkward to drive I've been

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.670 
is a little awkward to drive I've been
driving<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.450> for<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> little<00:01:45.750> while<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:46.890> steers

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
driving it for a little while it steers

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.230 
driving it for a little while it steers
it<00:01:49.680> steers<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.220> handles<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.640> little<00:01:50.880> bit<00:01:51.000> rough

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
it steers and handles a little bit rough

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.030 
it steers and handles a little bit rough
I've<00:01:51.479> actually<00:01:51.750> taken<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.259> side<00:01:52.470> panels<00:01:52.860> off

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
I've actually taken the side panels off

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.760 
I've actually taken the side panels off
they're<00:01:53.340> sitting<00:01:53.610> over<00:01:53.790> here<00:01:54.500> I've<00:01:55.500> taken

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
they're sitting over here I've taken

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.109 
they're sitting over here I've taken
these<00:01:55.890> off<00:01:56.040> because<00:01:56.219> I've<00:01:56.399> had<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.640> work<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:57.000> it

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
these off because I've had to work on it

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.959 
these off because I've had to work on it
to<00:01:57.180> get<00:01:57.299> bit<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:58.890> easier<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.340> leave

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
to get bit so it's just easier to leave

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.219 
to get bit so it's just easier to leave
them<00:02:00.090> often<00:02:00.509> put<00:02:00.930> them<00:02:01.020> back<00:02:01.140> on<00:02:01.350> for<00:02:01.619> now<00:02:03.229> so

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
them often put them back on for now so

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.350 
them often put them back on for now so
far<00:02:04.500> I've<00:02:04.770> had<00:02:05.430> good<00:02:05.579> luck<00:02:05.729> finding<00:02:05.969> most<00:02:06.240> of

carburetor right here this is this is
your<00:02:33.810> carburetor<00:02:34.290> this<00:02:34.770> little<00:02:35.010> part<00:02:35.220> is<00:02:35.520> only

in<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.470> front<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:39.230> think<00:02:40.230> one<00:02:40.350> of<00:02:40.380> my<00:02:40.560> problem<00:02:40.830> I

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
in the front I think one of my problem I

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.500 
in the front I think one of my problem I
had<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.220> couple<00:02:41.550> of<00:02:41.640> vacuum<00:02:42.000> lines<00:02:42.150> were<00:02:42.330> off

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
had is a couple of vacuum lines were off

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.270 
had is a couple of vacuum lines were off
and<00:02:43.170> we're<00:02:43.350> still<00:02:43.560> trying<00:02:43.710> to<00:02:43.860> figure<00:02:44.070> out<00:02:44.160> I

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
and we're still trying to figure out I

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.960 
and we're still trying to figure out I
don't<00:02:44.370> actually<00:02:44.640> have<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:46.640> diagram<00:02:47.640> of<00:02:47.910> how

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
don't actually have a a diagram of how

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.350 
don't actually have a a diagram of how
these<00:02:48.270> go<00:02:48.600> in<00:02:49.020> that<00:02:49.200> that's<00:02:49.850> been<00:02:50.850> a<00:02:50.880> bit<00:02:51.120> of<00:02:51.210> my

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
these go in that that's been a bit of my

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.160 
these go in that that's been a bit of my
problem<00:02:52.550> we're<00:02:53.550> just<00:02:53.760> kind<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.030> guessing<00:02:54.270> I've

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
problem we're just kind of guessing I've

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.170 
problem we're just kind of guessing I've
had<00:02:55.320> a<00:02:55.350> couple<00:02:55.500> people<00:02:55.680> look<00:02:56.070> at<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.400> but

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
had a couple people look at it but

had a couple people look at it but
nobody's<00:02:57.600> really<00:02:57.780> sure<00:02:57.900> how<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.380> goes

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
nobody's really sure how it goes

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
choke that's what this is just an

don't see right now where's it moved it
back<00:03:24.530> right<00:03:25.530> there<00:03:25.740> good<00:03:26.670> side<00:03:26.880> up<00:03:27.300> under<00:03:27.660> this

back right there good side up under this
right<00:03:28.110> here<00:03:28.260> there's<00:03:29.209> you<00:03:30.209> can<00:03:30.360> remove<00:03:30.570> all

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
these panels the other two are a lot

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.350 
these panels the other two are a lot
harder<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.430> get<00:03:32.550> off<00:03:32.610> so<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.560> don't<00:03:34.560> have<00:03:34.740> to

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
harder to get off so I don't have to

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.660 
harder to get off so I don't have to

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
the back of it here that's the that's

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.380 
the back of it here that's the that's
ignition<00:03:41.970> coil<00:03:42.530> and<00:03:43.530> I<00:03:44.160> replaced<00:03:44.820> it<00:03:45.000> it

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
ignition coil and I replaced it it

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.070 
ignition coil and I replaced it it
wasn't<00:03:45.570> bad

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
wasn't bad

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.150 
wasn't bad
but<00:03:46.380> I<00:03:46.800> thought<00:03:47.160> maybe<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.550> was<00:03:48.530> this<00:03:49.530> they

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
but I thought maybe it was this they

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.890 
but I thought maybe it was this they
weren't<00:03:50.400> sure<00:03:50.580> what<00:03:51.060> it<00:03:51.090> is<00:03:51.180> if<00:03:51.540> you<00:03:51.630> look<00:03:51.780> it

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
weren't sure what it is if you look it

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
weren't sure what it is if you look it
up<00:03:51.990> on<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.800> row<00:03:53.010> Quetta<00:03:53.220> site<00:03:53.550> it's<00:03:54.090> called<00:03:54.180> an

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
up on the row Quetta site it's called an

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.910 
up on the row Quetta site it's called an
exhaust<00:03:56.180> air<00:03:57.180> valve

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
exhaust air valve

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.920 
exhaust air valve
it<00:03:58.920> connects<00:04:00.440> right<00:04:01.440> down<00:04:01.620> here<00:04:02.690> into<00:04:03.690> the

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
it connects right down here into the

it connects right down here into the
back<00:04:04.050> of<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.350> exhaust<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:05.010> we're<00:04:05.370> not<00:04:05.459> real

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
back of the exhaust so we're not real

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.760 
back of the exhaust so we're not real
sure<00:04:05.670> what<00:04:05.970> that<00:04:06.120> does<00:04:06.330> but<00:04:06.780> it's<00:04:07.470> a<00:04:07.530> breather

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
sure what that does but it's a breather

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.180 
sure what that does but it's a breather
of<00:04:07.980> some<00:04:08.190> sort<00:04:10.220> if<00:04:11.220> you<00:04:11.400> remove<00:04:11.780> these<00:04:12.780> two

can't<00:04:32.150> really<00:04:32.330> see<00:04:32.510> it<00:04:33.040> but<00:04:34.040> inside<00:04:34.370> of<00:04:34.400> that

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
can't really see it but inside of that

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.370 
can't really see it but inside of that
that's<00:04:34.760> where<00:04:34.910> you're<00:04:35.000> gonna<00:04:35.090> be<00:04:35.180> your<00:04:35.390> your

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
that's where you're gonna be your your

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.710 
that's where you're gonna be your your
CI<00:04:39.280> box<00:04:40.280> and<00:04:40.580> a<00:04:40.640> couple<00:04:40.970> other<00:04:41.150> things<00:04:41.210> you

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
CI box and a couple other things you

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.170 
CI box and a couple other things you
have<00:04:42.290> to<00:04:42.320> get<00:04:42.470> to<00:04:42.620> do<00:04:42.740> thing<00:04:43.670> about<00:04:43.790> replacing

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
have to get to do thing about replacing

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.180 
have to get to do thing about replacing
that<00:04:44.420> I'm<00:04:44.630> thinking<00:04:44.870> mine<00:04:45.140> might<00:04:45.350> might<00:04:45.980> might

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
that I'm thinking mine might might might

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.170 
that I'm thinking mine might might might
be<00:04:46.220> faulty<00:04:46.850> this<00:04:47.810> was<00:04:47.990> sitting<00:04:48.170> around<00:04:49.180> I'm

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
be faulty this was sitting around I'm

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.600 
be faulty this was sitting around I'm
assuming<00:04:50.720> for<00:04:50.870> probably<00:04:51.230> about<00:04:51.380> a<00:04:51.530> year<00:04:51.650> it's

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
assuming for probably about a year it's

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.190 
assuming for probably about a year it's
gonna<00:04:52.730> be<00:04:52.820> my<00:04:53.030> guess<00:04:53.270> there's<00:04:53.570> nine<00:04:53.720> miles<00:04:53.990> on

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
gonna be my guess there's nine miles on

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
gonna be my guess there's nine miles on
it<00:04:54.230> we<00:04:54.920> got<00:04:55.070> to<00:04:55.160> take<00:04:55.280> carburetor<00:04:55.730> off<00:04:56.140> and

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
it we got to take carburetor off and

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.050 
it we got to take carburetor off and
clean<00:04:58.220> it<00:04:58.340> out<00:04:58.430> clean<00:04:58.850> the<00:04:58.940> Jets<00:04:59.180> so<00:05:00.280> and<00:05:01.280> check

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
clean it out clean the Jets so and check

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.430 
clean it out clean the Jets so and check
the<00:05:02.180> float<00:05:02.420> so<00:05:02.570> it<00:05:02.690> makes<00:05:02.870> your<00:05:02.960> nuts<00:05:03.140> messed

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
the float so it makes your nuts messed

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.300 
the float so it makes your nuts messed
up<00:05:03.910> the<00:05:04.910> gas<00:05:05.120> tank<00:05:05.150> here<00:05:05.630> same<00:05:05.930> thing<00:05:06.160> there<00:05:07.160> is

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
up the gas tank here same thing there is

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:18.430 
up the gas tank here same thing there is
a<00:05:09.610> switch<00:05:10.610> for<00:05:11.150> your<00:05:11.330> gas<00:05:11.510> tank<00:05:17.050> you<00:05:18.050> can<00:05:18.170> see

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
a switch for your gas tank you can see

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.040 
a switch for your gas tank you can see
it<00:05:18.560> right<00:05:18.740> here<00:05:19.510> yeah<00:05:20.510> there's<00:05:20.750> a<00:05:20.840> little

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
it right here yeah there's a little

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.970 
it right here yeah there's a little
switch<00:05:21.200> right<00:05:21.260> here<00:05:21.940> there's<00:05:22.940> a<00:05:23.950> up<00:05:24.950> down<00:05:25.400> and

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
switch right here there's a up down and

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.450 
switch right here there's a up down and
in<00:05:27.980> half<00:05:28.310> and<00:05:29.350> if<00:05:30.350> we<00:05:30.530> found<00:05:30.680> this<00:05:30.950> bike<00:05:31.130> all

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
in half and if we found this bike all

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.570 
in half and if we found this bike all
there<00:05:31.640> is<00:05:31.790> is<00:05:32.030> off<00:05:32.300> there's<00:05:32.810> no<00:05:33.020> reserve<00:05:33.580> some

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
there is is off there's no reserve some

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.920 
there is is off there's no reserve some
say<00:05:34.910> there's<00:05:35.120> a<00:05:35.180> reserve<00:05:35.450> but<00:05:35.660> the<00:05:35.750> newer

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
say there's a reserve but the newer

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.600 
say there's a reserve but the newer
models<00:05:36.230> might<00:05:36.410> be<00:05:36.530> a<00:05:36.560> little<00:05:36.740> different<00:05:36.950> and

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
models might be a little different and

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.080 
models might be a little different and
we<00:05:37.700> put<00:05:37.880> an<00:05:37.970> inline<00:05:38.710> filter<00:05:39.710> on<00:05:40.040> this<00:05:40.310> it

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
we put an inline filter on this it

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.500 
we put an inline filter on this it
didn't<00:05:41.360> come<00:05:41.540> on<00:05:41.570> this<00:05:41.840> bike<00:05:43.150> it's<00:05:44.150> probably<00:05:44.480> a

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
didn't come on this bike it's probably a

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.060 
didn't come on this bike it's probably a
good<00:05:44.630> idea<00:05:44.690> to<00:05:44.960> do<00:05:45.140> so<00:05:47.590> these<00:05:48.590> little<00:05:48.860> clamps

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
good idea to do so these little clamps

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.770 
good idea to do so these little clamps
as<00:05:49.370> you<00:05:49.460> can<00:05:49.610> see<00:05:49.730> here<00:05:49.850> on<00:05:49.970> all<00:05:50.270> the<00:05:50.420> vacuum

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
as you can see here on all the vacuum

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.050 
as you can see here on all the vacuum
lines<00:05:51.040> most<00:05:52.040> of<00:05:52.160> them<00:05:52.310> aren't<00:05:52.490> very<00:05:52.610> strong

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
lines most of them aren't very strong

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.000 
lines most of them aren't very strong
but<00:05:53.690> the<00:05:53.870> vacuum<00:05:54.080> line<00:05:54.350> seemed<00:05:54.650> to<00:05:54.740> hold<00:05:54.890> on

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010 
but the vacuum line seemed to hold on

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.210 
but the vacuum line seemed to hold on
okay<00:05:55.340> I<00:05:56.020> did<00:05:57.020> perform<00:05:57.380> an<00:05:57.560> alignment<00:05:57.800> on<00:05:58.040> this

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
okay I did perform an alignment on this

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.290 
okay I did perform an alignment on this
with<00:05:58.400> some<00:05:58.610> rods<00:06:00.460> from<00:06:01.460> a<00:06:01.550> couple<00:06:01.820> of<00:06:01.880> diagrams

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
with some rods from a couple of diagrams

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.500 
with some rods from a couple of diagrams
I've<00:06:02.510> just<00:06:02.690> seen<00:06:03.670> turned<00:06:04.670> out<00:06:04.790> okay<00:06:05.090> I<00:06:05.120> think<00:06:05.300> I

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
I've just seen turned out okay I think I

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.730 
I've just seen turned out okay I think I
figured<00:06:06.020> it<00:06:06.110> out<00:06:06.140> pretty<00:06:06.320> good

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
figured it out pretty good

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.220 
figured it out pretty good
that's<00:06:07.130> how<00:06:07.340> to<00:06:07.400> do<00:06:07.610> it<00:06:07.640> I<00:06:07.960> really<00:06:08.960> would<00:06:09.080> like

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.230 
that's how to do it I really would like

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:15.430 
that's how to do it I really would like
somebody<00:06:09.560> to<00:06:09.650> do<00:06:09.800> a<00:06:09.830> a<00:06:12.190> video<00:06:13.190> on<00:06:13.400> how<00:06:13.610> to<00:06:13.640> do<00:06:14.440> an

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
somebody to do a a video on how to do an

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.590 
somebody to do a a video on how to do an
alignment<00:06:15.800> on<00:06:16.160> one<00:06:16.340> of<00:06:16.370> these<00:06:16.610> so<00:06:17.270> if<00:06:17.450> you've

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 
alignment on one of these so if you've

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.390 
alignment on one of these so if you've
got<00:06:17.780> that<00:06:17.990> time<00:06:18.290> and<00:06:18.590> can<00:06:18.860> do<00:06:19.010> it<00:06:19.160> that<00:06:19.310> would

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
got that time and can do it that would

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.110 
got that time and can do it that would
be<00:06:19.520> great

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
be great

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.150 
be great
took<00:06:20.810> it<00:06:20.900> to<00:06:20.990> a<00:06:21.020> cam<00:06:21.440> dealer<00:06:21.650> they<00:06:21.860> didn't<00:06:22.100> even

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 
took it to a cam dealer they didn't even

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.870 
took it to a cam dealer they didn't even
want<00:06:22.340> to<00:06:22.370> look<00:06:22.550> at<00:06:22.760> it<00:06:23.380> of<00:06:24.380> course<00:06:24.650> so<00:06:25.250> I<00:06:25.580> don't

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
want to look at it of course so I don't

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.800 
want to look at it of course so I don't
I<00:06:25.940> don't<00:06:26.060> want<00:06:26.270> to<00:06:26.330> pay<00:06:26.420> them<00:06:26.540> to<00:06:26.600> do<00:06:26.690> it

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
I don't want to pay them to do it

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.260 
I don't want to pay them to do it
anyways<00:06:27.110> what<00:06:27.860> I<00:06:27.890> did<00:06:28.100> wasn't<00:06:28.310> that<00:06:28.490> hard<00:06:28.790> but

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
anyways what I did wasn't that hard but

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.770 
anyways what I did wasn't that hard but
I<00:06:29.300> just<00:06:29.720> if<00:06:30.380> you<00:06:30.440> look<00:06:30.650> up<00:06:30.800> online<00:06:31.010> for<00:06:31.780> trike

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
I just if you look up online for trike

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.060 
I just if you look up online for trike
alignment<00:06:33.320> all<00:06:33.380> you're<00:06:33.530> gonna<00:06:33.620> find<00:06:33.830> is<00:06:33.980> a

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
alignment all you're gonna find is a

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.340 
alignment all you're gonna find is a
recumbent<00:06:34.580> trike<00:06:34.790> the<00:06:34.940> little<00:06:35.120> bicycles<00:06:35.350> they

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:36.350 
recumbent trike the little bicycles they

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.750 
recumbent trike the little bicycles they
show<00:06:36.560> a<00:06:36.590> few<00:06:36.890> different<00:06:36.920> versions<00:06:37.490> of<00:06:37.640> that

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760 
show a few different versions of that

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.180 
show a few different versions of that
which<00:06:37.940> this<00:06:38.150> is<00:06:38.330> probably<00:06:39.080> somewhat<00:06:39.530> similar

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
which this is probably somewhat similar

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 
but on much larger scale so it's harder

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.909

you<00:06:42.720> can't<00:06:42.900> exactly<00:06:43.139> lift<00:06:43.500> this<00:06:43.620> off<00:06:43.770> the

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 
you can't exactly lift this off the

you can't exactly lift this off the
ground<00:06:44.100> and<00:06:44.430> play<00:06:44.639> with<00:06:44.759> the<00:06:44.850> little<00:06:44.970> bars

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210

like<00:06:45.449> they're<00:06:45.630> showing<00:06:45.960> you<00:06:46.080> so<00:06:46.289> I<00:06:46.560> had<00:06:47.550> a

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
like they're showing you so I had a

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.370 
like they're showing you so I had a
better<00:06:47.789> example<00:06:48.060> of<00:06:48.330> how<00:06:48.419> to<00:06:48.479> do<00:06:48.720> it<00:06:48.750> I<00:06:49.050> heard

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 
better example of how to do it I heard

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.170 
better example of how to do it I heard
people<00:06:49.560> build<00:06:49.889> their<00:06:50.009> own<00:06:50.039> frames<00:06:50.520> to<00:06:50.880> try<00:06:51.120> to

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 
people build their own frames to try to

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.210 
people build their own frames to try to
use<00:06:51.479> to<00:06:51.750> do<00:06:52.289> the<00:06:52.410> alignment<00:06:52.860> to<00:06:52.979> make<00:06:53.099> it
