00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.580
 the stability law fired yesterday 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.510
 evening by the government contains aspects 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.469
 positive and also some aspects shadows 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.349
 positive 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.320
 the fact that for example on the side of the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.690
 resource retrieval 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.220
 the part of the vaults is completed 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.350
 carried out by the attempt to reduce expenses 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.930
 rather than an increase in 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.420
 revenue that would be seen when 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.149
 the waters in which we sail absolutely 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.640
 misplaced attempt to increase the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.559
 incentives for companies to hire 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.879
 permanent workers a 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.960
 finance itself by raising capital on 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.789
 risk are confirmed in the building sector 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.160
 and so on then there is obviously the 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.960
 The main provision is represented 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.960
 from the reduction of the tax wedge 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:01.469
 of identity around 3 billion for the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.799
 next year overall in the arc 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.520
 of the three-year period around 10 billion 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.140
 this should favor an increase from 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.100
 arrival of farini for the square king 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.680
 so the question is 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.570
 companies also have an incentive to 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.939
 assume more by ending up reducing the 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.500
 cost of their shadows 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:22.450
 the fact that from the point of view 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.080
 quantitative these interventions are 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.690
 very limited a wedge cut 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.729
 tax of only 3 billion will end up 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.009
 increase very little perhaps even 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.159
 the demand imperceptibly 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.580
 internal in our country and therefore a 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.740
 dismiss only in a very limited way 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.819
 competitiveness to our companies 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.909
 furthermore it is partly the benefit 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:51.759
 following a tax reduction 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.259
 could be offset by the effects 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.080
 which we do not yet know in detail 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:59.229
 of the tax audit on 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.549
 immovable and of the cut that comes 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:05.890
 ventilated certain income tax deductions and 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.810
 finally the last negative aspect is the 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.250
 made that these spending cuts I have 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.459
 first imagined I am all in all 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.519
 still no linear cuts have been made 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.390
 a redevelopment project of the 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:22.530
 expense to be decided in the camps 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.530
 efficiency is more limited
