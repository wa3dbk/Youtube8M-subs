00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.439
 main difference round bangs from straight 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.720
 is that when cutting the last 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.730
 we cut the hair at the temples shorter 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.920
 and leave the hair in the middle on 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.410
 nose bridge a little longer using this 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.009
 technique you can create a graphic 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.870
 straight line bangs when cutting short 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.579
 straight bangs are extremely important as 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.350
 can more accurately highlight the required 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.390
 sector and gently recruit strands 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.040
 highlight a large triangular sector on 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.600
 frontal parietal zone of the head 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.820
 then work horizontal 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.600
 parting to achieve maximum 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.309
 graphic and spectacular bang lines 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.060
 fix the hair with a comb and 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.640
 cut strands with little or no tension 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.520
 start cutting in the middle and move 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.170
 towards the temples 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.309
 try to focus on the brows 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.870
 help you create the right cut line 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:09.400
 when you cut your bangs constantly 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:12.260
 think about whether it fits your model 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.740
 constantly check how haircut changes 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.740
 face shape 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.240
 instead of holding the hair 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.159
 fingers and use a comb you 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.159
 will see better your actions 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.610
 sometimes different colors may interfere with you 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.170
 in which neighboring strands are painted 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.240
 try to abstract from them 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.110
 Imagine the hair as in 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.110
 black and white 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.120
 to avoid excessive graduation 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.370
 cut the bang without a delay 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.370
 using natural hair fall 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:09.630
 now you can see what's in front 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.860
 cut line descends resemble yea 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.080
 mastering data technique requires 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.630
 practice you have to repeatedly 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.260
 train until your skills become 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.260
 perfect 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.629
 after hair is dried by the hair dryer we 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.310
 modifying bangs 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.769
 the changes we make are minimal 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.129
 especially compared to already made 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.129
 work 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.420
 we can soften the cut line 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.710
 lifting hair and creating quite 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.710
 small graduation
