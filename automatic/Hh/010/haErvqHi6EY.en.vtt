of the few birds acrobatic fly we're now
gonna<00:02:22.560> have<00:02:22.769> a<00:02:22.800> demonstration<00:02:23.580> we<00:02:23.700> hope<00:02:23.910> of

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
gonna have a demonstration we hope of

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.290 
gonna have a demonstration we hope of
just<00:02:24.480> how<00:02:24.690> smart<00:02:28.550> about<00:02:29.550> me<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:29.760> just<00:02:30.060> want<00:02:30.239> to

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
just how smart about me I just want to

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.089 
just how smart about me I just want to
show<00:02:30.450> how<00:02:30.630> clever<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:31.080> how<00:02:31.500> he<00:02:31.560> does<00:02:31.769> it<00:02:31.920> now

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
show how clever is how he does it now

show how clever is how he does it now
this<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.519> problem<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.120> very<00:02:33.360> few<00:02:33.660> animals

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
this is a problem that very few animals

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.309 
this is a problem that very few animals
that<00:02:34.110> like<00:02:34.380> birds<00:02:34.680> can<00:02:35.040> work<00:02:35.190> out<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.900> food<00:02:37.140> is

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
that like birds can work out the food is

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.460 
that like birds can work out the food is
down<00:02:37.560> there<00:02:37.890> no<00:02:41.720> it's<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.750> bit<00:02:42.900> hard<00:02:43.140> room<00:02:43.319> today

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
down there no it's a bit hard room today

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.140 
down there no it's a bit hard room today
I've<00:02:43.709> made<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.040> string<00:02:44.280> thinner<00:02:44.610> which<00:02:45.000> is

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
I've made the string thinner which is

00:02:45.150 --> 00:03:14.569 
I've made the string thinner which is
more<00:02:45.299> tough<00:02:45.569> for<00:02:45.810> him<00:02:51.769> come<00:02:52.769> on<00:02:52.799> Brad<00:03:13.549> you<00:03:14.549> have

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
more tough for him come on Brad you have

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.640 
more tough for him come on Brad you have
to<00:03:14.850> train<00:03:15.359> him<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.989> do<00:03:16.230> that

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
to train him to do that

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.170 
to train him to do that
or<00:03:16.709> was<00:03:16.889> it<00:03:16.920> something<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:17.489> you<00:03:17.609> realized<00:03:18.060> he

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
or was it something that you realized he

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.270 
or was it something that you realized he
naturally<00:03:18.540> because<00:03:19.230> he's<00:03:19.440> naturally<00:03:19.980> so

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
naturally because he's naturally so

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.129 
naturally because he's naturally so
inquisitive<00:03:20.670> all<00:03:21.090> these<00:03:21.239> birds<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:21.840> actually

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
so inquisitive and so clever did he sort

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.180 
so inquisitive and so clever did he sort
of<00:03:24.389> work<00:03:24.600> it<00:03:24.750> out<00:03:24.870> for<00:03:25.079> himself<00:03:25.230> never<00:03:25.829> trying

that when he was three months old he
went<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.620> try<00:03:31.799> and<00:03:31.950> get<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.160> at<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.370> gray<00:03:32.519> I

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
went to try and get it at the gray I

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.340 
went to try and get it at the gray I
thought<00:03:32.790> I<00:03:32.819> can't<00:03:33.120> get<00:03:33.329> it<00:03:33.510> went<00:03:33.989> on<00:03:34.079> the<00:03:34.109> perch

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
thought I can't get it went on the perch

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.930 
thought I can't get it went on the perch
pulled<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.769> string<00:03:34.889> that<00:03:35.100> gave<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.489> thought

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
pulled a string that gave it a thought

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.970 
pulled a string that gave it a thought
mmm<00:03:36.359> that's<00:03:36.540> not<00:03:36.660> working<00:03:37.109> within<00:03:37.440> 10<00:03:37.799> minutes

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980

mmm that's not working within 10 minutes
you've<00:03:38.220> mastered<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.819> so<00:03:39.299> you<00:03:39.630> never<00:03:39.750> actually

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
you've mastered it so you never actually

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.330 
you've mastered it so you never actually
trained<00:03:40.260> them<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.440> do<00:03:40.560> anything<00:03:40.799> they're<00:03:41.130> just

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.400 
but Chris what is happening that's a I
don't<00:05:06.570> know<00:05:06.720> what<00:05:07.050> it<00:05:07.169> is<00:05:07.200> is<00:05:07.440> a<00:05:09.260> it's<00:05:10.260> on<00:05:10.380> a

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
don't know what it is is a it's on a

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.150 
don't know what it is is a it's on a
chimney

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
chimney

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.210 
chimney
yeah<00:05:11.340> and<00:05:11.610> it's<00:05:11.729> smoking<00:05:12.600> like<00:05:12.690> a<00:05:12.750> chimney

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
yeah and it's smoking like a chimney

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.610 
yeah and it's smoking like a chimney
looks<00:05:14.220> like<00:05:14.430> it's<00:05:14.639> smoking<00:05:15.330> itself<00:05:15.660> and<00:05:16.410> we've

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
looks like it's smoking itself and we've

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.200 
looks like it's smoking itself and we've
seen<00:05:16.919> this<00:05:17.070> in<00:05:17.250> other<00:05:17.340> species<00:05:17.880> and<00:05:18.090> the

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
seen this in other species and the

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.450 
seen this in other species and the
thought<00:05:18.450> is<00:05:18.690> that<00:05:18.720> it's<00:05:19.050> using<00:05:19.620> the<00:05:19.770> smoke<00:05:20.070> to

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
thought is that it's using the smoke to

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.310 
thought is that it's using the smoke to
you<00:05:20.850> know<00:05:20.970> get<00:05:21.180> rid<00:05:21.210> of<00:05:21.510> an<00:05:21.600> infection<00:05:22.169> in

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
you know get rid of an infection in

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.290 
you know get rid of an infection in
terms<00:05:22.530> of<00:05:22.710> lice<00:05:23.040> or<00:05:23.430> something<00:05:23.850> that's<00:05:24.000> in<00:05:24.150> its

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
terms of lice or something that's in its

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.290 
terms of lice or something that's in its
feathers<00:05:24.660> I've<00:05:24.840> seen<00:05:25.140> that<00:05:25.289> before<00:05:25.440> and<00:05:26.300> that

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
feathers I've seen that before and that

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.090 
feathers I've seen that before and that
it<00:05:27.450> will<00:05:27.630> smoke<00:05:28.169> itself<00:05:28.590> to<00:05:28.740> get<00:05:28.890> rid<00:05:29.070> of

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
it will smoke itself to get rid of

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.980 
it will smoke itself to get rid of
exactly<00:05:29.610> that<00:05:29.789> it<00:05:30.030> was<00:05:30.120> like<00:05:30.240> I<00:05:30.270> did<00:05:30.840> with

them and spray them with formic acid and

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.350 
them and spray them with formic acid and
the<00:05:37.440> and<00:05:37.830> the<00:05:37.919> crow<00:05:38.160> family<00:05:38.430> the<00:05:38.700> corvids<00:05:39.180> are
