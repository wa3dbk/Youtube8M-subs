the updating going to the house so I

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.330 
the updating going to the house so I

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
you what I've gotten done so far I hope

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.300 
you what I've gotten done so far I hope
then<00:00:20.340> I'm<00:00:20.550> at<00:00:20.760> least<00:00:21.119> past<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.840> midway<00:00:22.080> point

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
then I'm at least past the midway point

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.290 
then I'm at least past the midway point
when<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.430> comes<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.699> working<00:00:23.880> on<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.180> house

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
when it comes to working on the house

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.609 
when it comes to working on the house
it's<00:00:24.510> kind<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.689> slow<00:00:24.900> down<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.170> little<00:00:25.380> bit

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
it's kind of slow down a little bit

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.599 
it's kind of slow down a little bit
because<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.189> basically<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.060> 12<00:00:27.510> B<00:00:27.630> 1<00:00:27.660> project

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
because it is basically a 12 B 1 project

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.740 
because it is basically a 12 B 1 project
except<00:00:29.609> for<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.789> floor<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.240> did<00:00:30.420> have<00:00:30.570> some

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
the process of moving am I the only one

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.199 
the process of moving am I the only one
who's<00:04:07.620> kind<00:04:07.860> of<00:04:07.890> like<00:04:08.070> a<00:04:08.100> hoarder<00:04:08.730> whenever<00:04:09.090> it

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
who's kind of like a hoarder whenever it

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.850 
who's kind of like a hoarder whenever it

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
comes to like boxes of wires and

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.020 
comes to like boxes of wires and
electronics<00:04:13.860> like<00:04:13.950> I<00:04:14.100> don't<00:04:14.160> really<00:04:14.340> hoard<00:04:14.880> a

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
electronics like I don't really hoard a

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.909 
electronics like I don't really hoard a
whole<00:04:15.269> lot<00:04:15.480> of<00:04:15.510> stuff<00:04:15.840> but<00:04:16.169> when<00:04:16.380> it<00:04:16.500> comes<00:04:16.680> to

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
whole lot of stuff but when it comes to

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.390 
whole lot of stuff but when it comes to
wiring<00:04:17.669> and<00:04:18.090> things<00:04:18.479> I'm<00:04:19.019> have<00:04:19.620> a<00:04:19.650> tendency<00:04:20.250> to

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
wiring and things I'm have a tendency to

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.839 
wiring and things I'm have a tendency to
hold<00:04:20.549> on<00:04:20.760> probably<00:04:21.270> more<00:04:21.419> than<00:04:21.539> I

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 
hold on probably more than I

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:29.529 
hold on probably more than I
and<00:04:22.849> then<00:04:23.419> here's<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:25.569> bedroom<00:04:27.819> and<00:04:28.819> I<00:04:29.360> did

end up putting up a new ceiling fan in
here<00:04:39.169> it's<00:04:39.620> actually<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:40.129> same<00:04:40.159> type<00:04:40.729> of<00:04:40.759> fan

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
here it's actually the same type of fan

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:48.580 
here it's actually the same type of fan
that's<00:04:42.199> some<00:04:45.669> in<00:04:46.689> the<00:04:47.689> living<00:04:47.990> room<00:04:48.169> I<00:04:48.349> still

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:08.629 
bathrooms I haven't done anything but

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:11.290 
bathrooms I haven't done anything but
getting<00:05:08.840> new<00:05:08.930> toilets<00:05:09.139> and<00:05:09.729> did<00:05:10.729> get<00:05:10.940> the<00:05:11.120> new

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
getting new toilets and did get the new

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.529 
getting new toilets and did get the new
flooring<00:05:11.810> down<00:05:12.129> so<00:05:13.129> there<00:05:13.340> you<00:05:13.460> go<00:05:13.490> I<00:05:14.000> guess

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
flooring down so there you go I guess

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.930 
flooring down so there you go I guess
that's<00:05:14.930> I<00:05:15.440> hope<00:05:15.949> that's<00:05:16.159> about<00:05:16.490> midway

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
that's I hope that's about midway

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.649 
that's I hope that's about midway

through painting slow process when

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:24.159 
through painting slow process when
you're<00:05:20.810> one<00:05:21.020> to<00:05:21.139> be<00:05:21.259> wanting<00:05:21.620> it<00:05:21.879> so<00:05:22.990> we<00:05:23.990> are

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
you're one to be wanting it so we are

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.920 
you're one to be wanting it so we are
definitely<00:05:24.349> making<00:05:24.740> progress<00:05:24.919> though<00:05:25.539> so<00:05:26.539> let

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
definitely making progress though so let

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.080 
definitely making progress though so let
me<00:05:27.020> know<00:05:27.139> what<00:05:27.319> you<00:05:27.500> think<00:05:27.729> what<00:05:28.729> should<00:05:28.940> I<00:05:29.029> do
