00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
last week and took me a couple days

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.260 
last week and took me a couple days
before<00:00:26.239> I<00:00:26.480> actually<00:00:26.509> watched<00:00:27.230> it<00:00:27.500> but<00:00:28.239> when<00:00:29.239> I

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
before I actually watched it but when I

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.330 
before I actually watched it but when I
did<00:00:29.689> the<00:00:30.079> first<00:00:30.110> thing<00:00:30.619> that<00:00:30.800> crossed<00:00:31.040> my<00:00:31.309> mind

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
did the first thing that crossed my mind

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.210 
did the first thing that crossed my mind
was<00:00:31.910> that<00:00:31.939> she<00:00:32.450> was<00:00:32.630> cast<00:00:33.220> absolutely

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
was that she was cast absolutely

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.840 
was that she was cast absolutely
perfectly<00:00:34.840> but<00:00:35.840> I<00:00:36.110> wasn't<00:00:36.950> really<00:00:37.070> sure<00:00:37.430> if

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
perfectly but I wasn't really sure if

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.170 
perfectly but I wasn't really sure if
he's<00:00:38.210> cute<00:00:38.600> enough<00:00:38.809> to<00:00:38.870> play<00:00:39.170> Christian<00:00:39.620> Grey

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
he's cute enough to play Christian Grey

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.840 
he's cute enough to play Christian Grey
um<00:00:41.649> but<00:00:42.649> the<00:00:42.800> second<00:00:43.160> thing<00:00:43.309> that<00:00:43.339> crossed<00:00:43.699> my

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
um but the second thing that crossed my

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.099 
um but the second thing that crossed my
mind<00:00:43.969> was<00:00:44.530> that<00:00:46.000> Fifty<00:00:47.000> Shades<00:00:47.030> is<00:00:47.629> what<00:00:48.079> I

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:48.109 
mind was that Fifty Shades is what I

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:51.729 
mind was that Fifty Shades is what I
always<00:00:48.499> intended<00:00:48.829> to<00:00:49.070> call<00:00:50.059> my<00:00:50.269> grey<00:00:50.749> addicted

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
always intended to call my grey addicted

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.489 
always intended to call my grey addicted
to<00:00:51.859> color<00:00:52.100> and<00:00:52.539> it's<00:00:53.539> been<00:00:53.749> a<00:00:53.780> really<00:00:54.350> long

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:54.499 
to color and it's been a really long

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:57.639 
to color and it's been a really long
time<00:00:54.559> since<00:00:55.190> I've<00:00:55.429> added<00:00:55.730> any<00:00:56.089> new<00:00:56.659> designs<00:00:57.350> to

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
time since I've added any new designs to

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.610 
time since I've added any new designs to
this<00:00:57.800> series<00:00:58.280> and<00:00:58.780> I<00:00:59.780> thought<00:00:59.989> what<00:01:00.589> better

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
this series and I thought what better

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.950 
this series and I thought what better
time<00:01:01.159> to<00:01:01.699> add<00:01:02.359> a<00:01:02.420> new<00:01:03.170> design<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:04.960> obviously

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
time to add a new design so obviously

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.620 
time to add a new design so obviously
I'm<00:01:06.110> not<00:01:06.320> using<00:01:06.800> 50<00:01:07.580> different<00:01:07.729> nail<00:01:08.060> polishes

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
I'm not using 50 different nail polishes

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.830 
I'm not using 50 different nail polishes
that<00:01:08.659> would<00:01:09.050> require<00:01:09.170> a<00:01:09.740> much<00:01:10.250> bigger<00:01:10.520> cup<00:01:10.909> but

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
that would require a much bigger cup but

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.840 
that would require a much bigger cup but
I<00:01:11.870> am<00:01:12.110> using<00:01:12.700> six<00:01:13.700> colors<00:01:14.180> which<00:01:14.930> is<00:01:15.490> one<00:01:16.490> more

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
I am using six colors which is one more

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.120 
I am using six colors which is one more
than<00:01:16.910> I<00:01:17.300> think<00:01:17.360> all<00:01:17.780> my<00:01:18.020> other<00:01:18.260> addicted<00:01:19.010> to

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
than I think all my other addicted to

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.480 
than I think all my other addicted to
colors<00:01:19.460> I<00:01:19.490> think<00:01:19.730> they<00:01:20.030> all<00:01:20.240> use<00:01:20.510> five<00:01:21.280> but<00:01:22.280> if

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
colors I think they all use five but if

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.100 
colors I think they all use five but if
you'd<00:01:22.730> like<00:01:22.910> to<00:01:23.120> see<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.420> names<00:01:23.690> of<00:01:23.960> the

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
you'd like to see the names of the

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.890 
you'd like to see the names of the
specific<00:01:24.590> polishes<00:01:25.130> those<00:01:26.000> will<00:01:26.270> all<00:01:26.420> be<00:01:26.450> down

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
specific polishes those will all be down

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.970 
specific polishes those will all be down
in<00:01:27.410> the<00:01:28.040> information<00:01:28.670> box<00:01:28.880> I'm<00:01:29.720> using

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
in the information box I'm using

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.420 
in the information box I'm using
multiple<00:01:30.980> different<00:01:31.100> brands<00:01:31.910> got<00:01:32.780> OPI<00:01:33.650> Orly

soya<00:01:35.800> nail<00:01:36.800> zinc<00:01:37.130> finger<00:01:37.550> paints<00:01:38.000> so<00:01:38.750> a<00:01:38.780> lot<00:01:39.170> of

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
soya nail zinc finger paints so a lot of

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.910 
soya nail zinc finger paints so a lot of
times<00:01:39.470> people<00:01:39.680> ask<00:01:40.100> if<00:01:40.610> you<00:01:41.360> have<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:42.020> stick

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
times people ask if you have to stick

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.980 
times people ask if you have to stick
with<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.160> same<00:01:43.340> brand<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:44.510> really<00:01:44.630> don't

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
with the same brand you really don't

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.470 
with the same brand you really don't
sometimes<00:01:45.710> it<00:01:46.130> can<00:01:46.250> just<00:01:46.280> be<00:01:46.460> a<00:01:46.820> little

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
sometimes it can just be a little

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.330 
sometimes it can just be a little
trickier<00:01:47.960> to<00:01:48.080> find<00:01:48.290> colors<00:01:48.680> that<00:01:48.950> work<00:01:49.100> well

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
trickier to find colors that work well

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.980 
trickier to find colors that work well
together<00:01:49.550> but<00:01:50.390> definitely<00:01:50.900> possible<00:01:52.300> so<00:01:53.300> once

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
together but definitely possible so once

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.990 
together but definitely possible so once
you<00:01:54.110> have<00:01:54.200> your<00:01:54.260> bowls<00:01:54.620> I<00:01:54.800> built<00:01:55.100> in<00:01:55.370> your<00:01:55.820> cup

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
you have your bowls I built in your cup

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.390 
you have your bowls I built in your cup
of<00:01:56.150> room-temperature<00:01:56.630> filtered<00:01:57.470> water<00:01:57.620> go

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
of room-temperature filtered water go

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.840 
of room-temperature filtered water go
ahead<00:01:58.790> and<00:01:59.060> draw<00:01:59.600> up<00:01:59.870> to<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:00.290> top<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:00.850> then

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
ahead and draw up to the top and then

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.870 
ahead and draw up to the top and then
down<00:02:02.180> to<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.570> bottom<00:02:03.040> that<00:02:04.040> kind<00:02:04.370> of<00:02:04.490> helps<00:02:04.760> to

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
down to the bottom that kind of helps to

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.510 
down to the bottom that kind of helps to
just<00:02:05.150> stretch<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.140> bull's<00:02:06.350> eye<00:02:06.530> out<00:02:06.770> make<00:02:07.130> it

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
just stretch the bull's eye out make it

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.160 
just stretch the bull's eye out make it
a<00:02:07.580> little<00:02:07.760> bit<00:02:07.910> easier<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.390> draw<00:02:08.660> your<00:02:08.840> petals

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
a little bit easier to draw your petals

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.960 
a little bit easier to draw your petals
and<00:02:10.360> I'm<00:02:11.360> going<00:02:11.569> to<00:02:11.599> be<00:02:11.750> drawing<00:02:11.989> these<00:02:12.230> petals

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
and I'm going to be drawing these petals

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.550 
and I'm going to be drawing these petals
with<00:02:13.970> a<00:02:14.269> little<00:02:14.900> bit<00:02:15.110> of<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:16.099> wave<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.430> them<00:02:17.030> and

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
with a little bit of a wave to them and

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.670 
with a little bit of a wave to them and
that's<00:02:18.560> just<00:02:19.099> a<00:02:19.609> really<00:02:20.209> simple<00:02:20.450> way

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
that's just a really simple way

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.399 
that's just a really simple way
to<00:02:23.290> randomize<00:02:24.290> them<00:02:24.620> just<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:25.010> little<00:02:25.040> bit<00:02:26.409> not

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
to randomize them just a little bit not

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.550 
to randomize them just a little bit not
completely<00:02:28.069> and<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:29.209> actually<00:02:29.480> would<00:02:30.439> be

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
completely and it actually would be

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.750 
completely and it actually would be
easier<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.010> see<00:02:31.129> on<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:32.540> nail<00:02:32.750> if<00:02:32.989> I<00:02:33.109> did<00:02:33.349> them

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
easier to see on the nail if I did them

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.240 
easier to see on the nail if I did them
vertically<00:02:34.760> as<00:02:34.909> opposed<00:02:35.299> to<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:36.109> ended<00:02:36.650> up<00:02:36.769> with

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
vertically as opposed to I ended up with

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.729 
vertically as opposed to I ended up with
these<00:02:37.400> going<00:02:38.349> horizontally<00:02:39.349> on<00:02:39.439> my<00:02:39.560> nail

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
these going horizontally on my nail

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.899 
these going horizontally on my nail
would<00:02:40.700> also<00:02:40.849> be<00:02:41.180> easier<00:02:41.719> to<00:02:41.870> get<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.260> very

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
would also be easier to get the very

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.589 
would also be easier to get the very
Wiggly<00:02:44.260> astoria<00:02:45.260> spots<00:02:45.799> if<00:02:46.040> I<00:02:46.159> was<00:02:46.340> dipping

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
Wiggly astoria spots if I was dipping

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.709 
Wiggly astoria spots if I was dipping
fewer<00:02:47.599> nails<00:02:47.900> at<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.260> time<00:02:48.530> but<00:02:49.489> like<00:02:50.329> I<00:02:50.450> said<00:02:50.510> it

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:50.719 
fewer nails at a time but like I said it

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:53.470 
fewer nails at a time but like I said it
just<00:02:50.900> adds<00:02:51.170> a<00:02:51.530> little<00:02:52.250> bit<00:02:52.370> more<00:02:52.849> of<00:02:52.939> a<00:02:53.030> random

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
just adds a little bit more of a random

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.800 
just adds a little bit more of a random
factor<00:02:53.989> than<00:02:54.939> drawing<00:02:55.939> completely<00:02:56.480> smooth

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
factor than drawing completely smooth

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.129 
factor than drawing completely smooth
petals<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.849> have<00:02:58.849> my<00:02:59.000> nails<00:02:59.209> prepped<00:02:59.659> with<00:02:59.900> the

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:00.139 
petals I have my nails prepped with the

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.349 
petals I have my nails prepped with the
darkest<00:03:00.560> gray<00:03:00.819> I'm<00:03:01.819> going<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.060> be<00:03:02.150> dipping

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
darkest gray I'm going to be dipping

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.119 
darkest gray I'm going to be dipping
these<00:03:02.659> three<00:03:03.049> all<00:03:03.650> together<00:03:04.510> just<00:03:05.510> going<00:03:05.810> to

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
these three all together just going to

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:11.170 
these three all together just going to
line<00:03:07.129> them<00:03:07.370> up<00:03:07.430> in<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:08.000> cup<00:03:08.269> and<00:03:08.629> then<00:03:10.180> dip

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
line them up in the cup and then dip

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.250 
line them up in the cup and then dip
them<00:03:11.480> all<00:03:11.689> in<00:03:13.239> with<00:03:14.239> my<00:03:14.419> orange<00:03:14.659> stick<00:03:14.870> I'm

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
them all in with my orange stick I'm

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.879 
them all in with my orange stick I'm
going<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.620> reach<00:03:15.919> in<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:17.019> clean<00:03:18.019> up<00:03:18.230> that

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
going to reach in and clean up that

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:21.490 
going to reach in and clean up that
little<00:03:19.129> bit<00:03:19.340> of<00:03:19.370> excess<00:03:20.000> polish<00:03:20.510> left<00:03:21.169> on<00:03:21.349> the

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
little bit of excess polish left on the

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.459 
little bit of excess polish left on the
surface<00:03:22.120> so<00:03:23.120> that<00:03:23.299> that<00:03:23.480> doesn't<00:03:23.719> stick<00:03:24.290> on

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:24.469 
surface so that that doesn't stick on

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:25.659 
surface so that that doesn't stick on
top<00:03:24.680> of<00:03:24.859> my<00:03:25.010> design

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:25.669 
top of my design

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:28.930 
top of my design
and<00:03:26.449> then<00:03:26.989> I'm<00:03:27.169> just<00:03:27.199> going<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:27.590> slowly<00:03:28.280> pull

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
and then I'm just going to slowly pull

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.960 
and then I'm just going to slowly pull
my<00:03:29.060> nails<00:03:29.329> out<00:03:29.540> and<00:03:32.379> there<00:03:33.379> you<00:03:33.560> can<00:03:33.709> see<00:03:33.970> the

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
my nails out and there you can see the

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.559 
my nails out and there you can see the
colors<00:03:35.620> turn<00:03:36.620> into<00:03:36.949> kind<00:03:37.489> of<00:03:37.549> a<00:03:37.669> gradient<00:03:39.040> I

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
colors turn into kind of a gradient I

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.879 
colors turn into kind of a gradient I
really<00:03:41.569> like<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.870> way<00:03:41.989> this<00:03:42.139> turned<00:03:42.409> out<00:03:42.560> I

more colors using a water marble kind of

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.929 
more colors using a water marble kind of
the<00:03:48.349> more<00:03:48.590> testing<00:03:49.099> you<00:03:49.189> end<00:03:49.340> up<00:03:49.430> having<00:03:49.699> to<00:03:49.790> do
