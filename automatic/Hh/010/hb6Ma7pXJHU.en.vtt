00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.039 
level pokemon is level 34 so at this
point<00:01:58.380> he<00:01:58.740> will<00:01:58.920> have<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.939> for<00:02:00.149> alligator<00:02:00.689> or<00:02:01.020> a

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
point he will have a for alligator or a

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.649 
point he will have a for alligator or a
Meganium<00:02:01.790> but<00:02:02.790> he<00:02:02.880> would<00:02:03.000> not<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.390> will<00:02:03.509> not

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
Meganium but he would not you will not

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.300 
Meganium but he would not you will not
have<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> typhlosion<00:02:04.710> because<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.040> explosion

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
have a typhlosion because that explosion

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.190 
have a typhlosion because that explosion
involves<00:02:05.850> at<00:02:05.939> level<00:02:06.180> 36<00:02:06.659> so

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
involves at level 36 so

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.740 
involves at level 36 so
he<00:02:08.440> will<00:02:08.560> still<00:02:08.770> have<00:02:09.009> a<00:02:09.039> cool<00:02:09.340> avah<00:02:09.629> on<00:02:10.629> a

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
he will still have a cool avah on a

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.040 
he will still have a cool avah on a
plane<00:02:11.200> by<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.500> rules<00:02:11.830> are<00:02:12.129> we<00:02:12.480> so<00:02:13.480> yeah

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
plane by the rules are we so yeah

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.380

sneasel<00:02:14.680> goes<00:02:14.830> down<00:02:15.160> I<00:02:15.580> guess<00:02:15.760> that's<00:02:15.970> his<00:02:16.120> new

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390

sneasel goes down I guess that's his new
Pokemon<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:17.190> think<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.370> only<00:02:18.400> thing<00:02:18.640> I<00:02:18.849> can
