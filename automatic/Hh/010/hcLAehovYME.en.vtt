00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
glitch needs lag and to work and in

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.729 
glitch needs lag and to work and in
single-player<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.660> can't<00:00:49.230> really<00:00:49.379> have<00:00:49.559> that

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
single-player you can't really have that

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.639 
single-player you can't really have that
much<00:00:49.890> lag<00:00:50.180> without<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.559> putting<00:00:52.559> around

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
much lag without like putting around

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.290 
much lag without like putting around
bunch<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.190> random<00:00:53.430> objects<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.090> doesn't

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
bunch of random objects and that doesn't

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.600 
bunch of random objects and that doesn't
really<00:00:54.420> work<00:00:54.570> too<00:00:54.629> well<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.140> pitch<00:00:55.610> okay

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
really work too well for the pitch okay

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.729 
really work too well for the pitch okay
so<00:00:57.059> first<00:00:57.449> thing<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.719> do<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.410> take<00:00:58.680> a

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
so first thing you do is you take a

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.340 
so first thing you do is you take a
square<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.340> whatever<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.840> put<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
square of whatever and you put it in the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.910 
square of whatever and you put it in the
first<00:01:01.680> thick<00:01:02.070> layer<00:01:02.370> then<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.629> go<00:01:03.960> into<00:01:04.170> tools

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
first thick layer then you go into tools

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.950 
first thick layer then you go into tools
bag<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.760> get<00:01:06.210> out<00:01:06.740> plasma<00:01:07.740> tool<00:01:07.979> on<00:01:08.960> plasma

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
bag and get out plasma tool on plasma

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.340 
bag and get out plasma tool on plasma
PHY<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:12.170> then<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:14.509> then<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.540> get<00:01:15.840> out<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
PHY it then you then you get out the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.060 
PHY it then you then you get out the
control<00:01:16.979> inator<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:18.509> place<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.110> right<00:01:19.830> on

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
control inator and you place it right on

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.280 
control inator and you place it right on
there<00:01:21.799> um<00:01:23.090> make<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.119> trigger<00:01:24.509> radius<00:01:24.990> bigger

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
there um make a trigger radius bigger

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.660 
there um make a trigger radius bigger
out<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:28.040> make<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.159> trigger<00:01:29.369> raiders

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
out so you can make the trigger raiders

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.990 
out so you can make the trigger raiders
be<00:01:29.850> here<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.329> can<00:01:30.810> actually<00:01:31.700> get<00:01:32.700> into<00:01:32.880> it

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
be here so you can actually get into it

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.140 
be here so you can actually get into it
because<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.409> too<00:01:34.619> small<00:01:35.390> so<00:01:36.390> get<00:01:36.630> one<00:01:38.150> make

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
because it is too small so get one make

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.330 
because it is too small so get one make
that<00:01:39.329> smaller<00:01:39.680> okay<00:01:40.700> now<00:01:42.380> to<00:01:43.380> do<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.829> you're

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
that smaller okay now to do this you're

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:52.969 
that smaller okay now to do this you're
going<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.729> have<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.390> go<00:01:46.430> fly<00:01:47.430> mode<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:51.979> get

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
going to have to go fly mode and get

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.940 
going to have to go fly mode and get
your<00:01:53.130> feet<00:01:53.960> like<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.380> look<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:55.770> you're

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
that I'm invisible I can go through the

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.650 
that I'm invisible I can go through the
poppet<00:02:30.070> and<00:02:30.100> stuff<00:02:30.340> but<00:02:30.490> I<00:02:30.550> cannot<00:02:30.880> move<00:02:31.210> from

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
poppet and stuff but I cannot move from

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.760 
poppet and stuff but I cannot move from
side<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:31.960> side<00:02:32.110> or<00:02:32.700> jump<00:02:33.700> or<00:02:33.940> slap<00:02:34.180> or<00:02:34.390> anything

so<00:02:36.150> that's<00:02:37.150> where<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.780> control<00:02:38.230> inator<00:02:38.500> comes

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
so that's where the control inator comes

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.340 
so that's where the control inator comes
in<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:39.010> can<00:02:39.190> press<00:02:39.850> triangle<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.690> get<00:02:40.870> into<00:02:41.230> it

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350
