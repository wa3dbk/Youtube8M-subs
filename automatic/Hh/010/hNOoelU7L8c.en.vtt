the woods today you're likely to find
someone<00:00:15.330> there<00:00:15.540> picking<00:00:16.470> up<00:00:16.590> sticks<00:00:17.369> for

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
someone there picking up sticks for

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
their wood burning stove and the theory

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.140 
their wood burning stove and the theory
of<00:00:20.400> course<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.740> the<00:00:22.740> fuel<00:00:23.039> you<00:00:23.279> get<00:00:23.519> for

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
of course is that the fuel you get for

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.420 
of course is that the fuel you get for
free<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.859> the<00:00:25.859> cheapest<00:00:26.369> fuel<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.880> all

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.010

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
enthusiast town would as a renewable

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.709 
enthusiast town would as a renewable
fuel<00:00:34.770> burn<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:36.120> can<00:00:36.270> grow<00:00:36.450> another

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
fuel burn it and you can grow another

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.139 
fuel burn it and you can grow another
tree<00:00:37.050> which<00:00:37.350> absorbs<00:00:38.010> greenhouse<00:00:38.460> gases<00:00:38.940> to

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
tree which absorbs greenhouse gases to

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.810 
tree which absorbs greenhouse gases to
balance<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.690> ones<00:00:39.899> you've<00:00:40.110> given<00:00:40.410> off<00:00:40.820> stoves

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
balance the ones you've given off stoves

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.819 
balance the ones you've given off stoves
like<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.540> one<00:00:42.750> going<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.290> London<00:00:43.649> have

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
like this one going in in London have

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.010 
like this one going in in London have
been<00:00:43.860> booming<00:00:44.370> because<00:00:45.239> they're<00:00:45.539> supposedly

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
been booming because they're supposedly

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.560 
been booming because they're supposedly
green<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.860> there's<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.700> claim<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.120> even<00:00:48.480> if

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
green and there's a claim that even if

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.560 
green and there's a claim that even if
you<00:00:48.690> pay<00:00:48.930> for<00:00:49.170> wood<00:00:49.350> you're<00:00:49.800> saving<00:00:50.219> money<00:00:50.570> if

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
you pay for wood you're saving money if

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.240 
you pay for wood you're saving money if
we<00:00:51.780> were<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.989> spend<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.260> thousand<00:00:52.680> pounds<00:00:52.829> on

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
we were to spend a thousand pounds on

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.420 
we were to spend a thousand pounds on
gas<00:00:54.140> we<00:00:55.140> would<00:00:55.289> get<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.530> same<00:00:55.559> heat<00:00:55.980> benefit

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
gas we would get the same heat benefit

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.430 
gas we would get the same heat benefit
from<00:00:56.579> spending<00:00:56.940> approximately<00:00:57.180> 700<00:00:58.170> pounds

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
from spending approximately 700 pounds

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.770 
from spending approximately 700 pounds
on<00:00:58.559> wood<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.820> there's<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.120> there's<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.480> large

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
on wood and so there's a there's a large

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.729 
on wood and so there's a there's a large
cost<00:01:01.050> saving<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.590> be<00:01:01.680> made<00:01:03.170> time<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.199> test<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
cost saving to be made time to test the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.620 
cost saving to be made time to test the
chimney<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.580> use<00:01:05.729> many<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.090> these<00:01:06.240> stoves

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
chimney you can use many of these stoves

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:14.410 
chimney you can use many of these stoves
in<00:01:06.930> smokeless<00:01:07.320> zones<00:01:08.210> and<00:01:11.119> start<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.240> fire<00:01:12.479> and

away<00:01:33.799> why<00:01:34.799> did<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.070> go<00:01:35.280> for<00:01:35.579> wood<00:01:35.930> well<00:01:36.930> I

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
away why did you go for wood well I

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.020 
away why did you go for wood well I
wanted<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.470> focal<00:01:37.860> point<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.369> knew<00:01:38.520> I'd<00:01:38.670> feel

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
wanted a focal point I knew I'd feel

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.700 
wanted a focal point I knew I'd feel
warmer<00:01:39.540> if<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.750> could<00:01:39.930> see<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.259> wood<00:01:40.439> burning

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
warmer if I could see the wood burning

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.730 
warmer if I could see the wood burning
and<00:01:41.130> also<00:01:41.729> be<00:01:41.909> warmer<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.600> thought<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.500> could

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
and also be warmer I thought I could

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.440 
and also be warmer I thought I could
turn<00:01:43.890> down<00:01:44.130> my<00:01:44.310> central<00:01:44.670> heating<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.210> save

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
turn down my central heating and save

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.969 
turn down my central heating and save
some<00:01:45.689> money<00:01:45.840> because<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.439> wood<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.710> cheaper

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
some money because the wood is cheaper

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.539 
some money because the wood is cheaper
than<00:01:47.130> gas<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.850> will<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.540> be<00:01:48.920> scavenging<00:01:49.920> for

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
than gas and will you be scavenging for

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.230 
than gas and will you be scavenging for
wood<00:01:50.759> well<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.780> might<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.259> bit<00:01:52.820> in<00:01:53.820> other<00:01:54.060> words

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
wood well I might a bit in other words

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.749 
wood well I might a bit in other words
in<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.659> woods<00:01:54.840> not<00:01:55.140> out<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.350> skips<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.340> places

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
in the woods not out of skips and places

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.819 
in the woods not out of skips and places
like<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.420> yes<00:01:58.020> if<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.259> think<00:01:58.500> I'm<00:01:58.619> allowed

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
like that but yes if I think I'm allowed

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.520 
like that but yes if I think I'm allowed
to<00:01:59.100> take<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.310> word<00:01:59.579> then<00:01:59.850> I<00:01:59.939> probably<00:02:00.149> will<00:02:00.530> if

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
to take the word then I probably will if

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.980 
to take the word then I probably will if
there<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> saving<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:02.759> not<00:02:03.030> instant<00:02:03.659> this

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
there is a saving it's not instant this

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.929 
there is a saving it's not instant this
installation<00:02:04.560> including<00:02:05.490> lining<00:02:05.850> the

chimney and capping off the other

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.430 
chimney and capping off the other
chimneys<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:07.979> costing<00:02:08.459> 3,000<00:02:09.300> pounds<00:02:09.810> but

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
chimneys is costing 3,000 pounds but

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.260 
chimneys is costing 3,000 pounds but
think<00:02:11.009> of

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
think of
