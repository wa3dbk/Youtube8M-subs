 the word revolution which so loves 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.210
 apply to this modelka manufacturer 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.460

 plastic materials are well matched all 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.400
 looks expensive and progressively wanted 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.680
 would say at its price but it will seem 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.960
 most overly overestimated and about 3 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.780
 and 7 thousand dollars in European markets 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.550

 name or extend 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.530
 she is really beautiful but not the most 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.360
 practical firstly because of such 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.159
 TV designs takes longer 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.869
 spaces on the surface and not everywhere 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.570
 now such a huge tv can 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.280
 put the second unstable if not 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.740
 counting with the center of gravity this 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.570
 the big guy can tip over on the front 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.010

 opens when you click on it 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.610

 at 1200 as far as intellectual 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.530
 component, it is actually the same 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.420
 as in 2012 models only everything 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.220
 improved simplified with an attempt 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.780
 improve technology so 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.780
 we continue to happily wave our hands and 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.319
 scream on TV to find a common language 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.150
 interface familiar and attractive 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.920

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.389
 approximated plasma quality 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.730
 the image is also high and the glasses themselves 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.180
 lightweight and comfortable enough and nothing 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.799
 add 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.159
 it only remains to enjoy this
