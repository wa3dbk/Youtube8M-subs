00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.320 
holla meets just like that big feature
right<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.950> crosses<00:00:35.310> over<00:00:35.430> into<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:35.850> many<00:00:35.970> areas

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.330

I'm a living testimony to holla meat
being<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.330> really<00:00:39.600> fun<00:00:40.050> mode<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.590> skateboarding

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
being a really fun mode of skateboarding

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.560 
being a really fun mode of skateboarding
we're<00:00:41.550> really<00:00:41.670> excited<00:00:41.940> about<00:00:42.150> it's<00:00:42.360> actually

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
we're really excited about it's actually

we're really excited about it's actually
one<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.750> more<00:00:42.810> fun<00:00:43.050> things<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.320> we're

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
one of the more fun things that we're

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.380 
one of the more fun things that we're
doing<00:00:43.590> another<00:00:44.250> way<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.520> play

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.029 

our<00:00:49.390> guy<00:00:49.539> isn't<00:00:49.870> dead<00:00:50.170> when<00:00:50.469> he<00:00:50.589> wipes<00:00:50.800> out

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
our guy isn't dead when he wipes out

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.950 
our guy isn't dead when he wipes out
it's<00:00:51.399> not<00:00:51.519> like<00:00:51.699> a<00:00:51.730> lost<00:00:52.000> control<00:00:52.449> it's<00:00:52.750> still

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
it's not like a lost control it's still

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.069 
it's not like a lost control it's still
a<00:00:52.989> continuous<00:00:53.739> game<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:55.239> have<00:00:55.390> control<00:00:55.750> while

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
a continuous game you have control while

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.619 
a continuous game you have control while
he's<00:00:56.289> falling<00:00:56.739> to<00:00:56.980> like<00:00:57.280> spin<00:00:57.699> a<00:00:57.729> flip<00:00:58.449> own

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
he's falling to like spin a flip own

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.930 
he's falling to like spin a flip own
angle<00:00:59.379> him<00:00:59.500> back<00:00:59.739> you<00:01:00.430> can<00:01:00.579> use<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.760> left

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
angle him back you can use the left

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.130 
angle him back you can use the left
stick<00:01:01.059> to<00:01:01.180> actually<00:01:01.420> tweak<00:01:01.600> your<00:01:01.719> body<00:01:01.899> it's

in<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.009> same<00:01:06.039> direction<00:01:06.250> go<00:01:07.090> into<00:01:07.299> a

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
in the same direction go into a

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.050 
in the same direction go into a
cannonball<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.979> can<00:01:09.159> counteract<00:01:09.520> that<00:01:09.700> spin

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
cannonball you can counteract that spin

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.330 
cannonball you can counteract that spin
by<00:01:10.240> pushing<00:01:10.479> one<00:01:10.750> way<00:01:10.930> open<00:01:11.649> up<00:01:11.740> your<00:01:11.890> body<00:01:12.100> to

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
by pushing one way open up your body to

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.790 
by pushing one way open up your body to
slow<00:01:12.549> down<00:01:12.670> your<00:01:12.940> spin

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.470 

we've<00:01:18.280> always<00:01:18.430> had<00:01:18.640> great<00:01:18.850> physics<00:01:19.330> in<00:01:19.420> the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
we've always had great physics in the

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.940 
we've always had great physics in the
white<00:01:19.600> boats<00:01:19.810> but<00:01:20.050> now<00:01:20.230> they<00:01:20.440> really<00:01:20.770> like

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
white boats but now they really like

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.560 
white boats but now they really like
come<00:01:21.430> to<00:01:21.580> life

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
come to life

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.540 
come to life
just<00:01:24.170> having<00:01:24.770> control<00:01:25.130> while<00:01:25.310> you're<00:01:25.430> playing

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
just having control while you're playing

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.990 
just having control while you're playing
a<00:01:25.790> game

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.540 

that's<00:01:28.540> awesome<00:01:28.870> and<00:01:29.280> then<00:01:30.280> once<00:01:30.430> you're

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
that's awesome and then once you're

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.390 
that's awesome and then once you're
actually<00:01:30.610> falling<00:01:31.060> he<00:01:31.150> was<00:01:31.270> cracking<00:01:31.480> open

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
actually falling he was cracking open

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.890 
actually falling he was cracking open
when<00:01:33.400> you've<00:01:33.550> left<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.940> ground<00:01:34.150> too<00:01:34.390> you<00:01:34.690> hit

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
when you've left the ground too you hit

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.270 
when you've left the ground too you hit
the<00:01:34.990> ground<00:01:35.080> how<00:01:35.350> far<00:01:35.620> did<00:01:35.740> you<00:01:35.800> actually<00:01:35.860> fall

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
the ground how far did you actually fall

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.550 
the ground how far did you actually fall
like<00:01:36.580> down<00:01:36.760> to<00:01:36.790> the<00:01:37.060> one<00:01:37.690> centimeter<00:01:38.290> for<00:01:38.470> all

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
like down to the one centimeter for all

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
like down to the one centimeter for all
you<00:01:38.680> Canadians<00:01:39.220> on<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:41.350> speed<00:01:41.680> at<00:01:42.010> which<00:01:42.070> you

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
you Canadians on the speed at which you

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.300 
you Canadians on the speed at which you
bail

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.679 

how<00:01:45.430> long<00:01:45.640> you<00:01:45.759> dragged<00:01:46.030> on<00:01:46.180> the<00:01:46.240> ground<00:01:46.479> when

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
how long you dragged on the ground when

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.050 
how long you dragged on the ground when
you<00:01:46.720> feel<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:48.220> intensity<00:01:48.250> of<00:01:48.729> your<00:01:48.759> impact

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
you feel the intensity of your impact

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.910 
you feel the intensity of your impact
within<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.479> multiple<00:01:49.810> impacts<00:01:50.110> did<00:01:50.619> you<00:01:50.740> go

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
within the multiple impacts did you go

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.280 
within the multiple impacts did you go
elbow<00:01:51.490> to<00:01:51.670> wrist<00:01:51.850> finger<00:01:52.420> or<00:01:52.689> did<00:01:52.899> your<00:01:53.020> wrist

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
elbow to wrist finger or did your wrist

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.539 
elbow to wrist finger or did your wrist
hit<00:01:53.470> first<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:53.979> then<00:01:54.100> you<00:01:54.159> kind<00:01:54.310> of<00:01:54.340> rolled

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
hit first and then you kind of rolled

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.100 
hit first and then you kind of rolled
over<00:01:54.759> onto<00:01:54.909> your<00:01:54.970> elbow<00:01:55.240> we<00:01:55.810> actually<00:01:56.020> know

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
over onto your elbow we actually know

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.630 
over onto your elbow we actually know
the<00:01:56.229> order<00:01:56.380> in<00:01:56.530> which<00:01:56.560> you<00:01:56.649> hit<00:01:56.860> things<00:01:57.100> did

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
the order in which you hit things did

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.800 
the order in which you hit things did
you<00:01:57.759> run<00:01:57.880> into<00:01:58.000> people<00:01:58.180> did<00:01:58.570> you<00:01:58.630> run<00:01:58.750> into
