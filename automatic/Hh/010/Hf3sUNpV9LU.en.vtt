how I knew that we were gonna be in for

how I knew that we were gonna be in for
a<00:02:33.160> long<00:02:33.250> game<00:02:33.760> because<00:02:34.090> there's<00:02:34.270> no<00:02:34.450> way<00:02:34.630> that

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
a long game because there's no way that

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.620 
a long game because there's no way that
we<00:02:35.830> can<00:02:36.040> have<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.580> same<00:02:36.760> performance<00:02:37.150> that<00:02:37.510> we

really low so I know I can't really

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.590 
really low so I know I can't really
defend<00:03:14.590> Westbrook<00:03:15.130> but<00:03:15.940> I<00:03:16.000> definitely<00:03:16.269> think

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
defend Westbrook but I definitely think

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.509 
defend Westbrook but I definitely think
like<00:03:16.810> kg<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:17.410> ray<00:03:17.560> allen<00:03:17.590> and<00:03:18.160> peers<00:03:18.370> that

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
like kg and ray allen and peers that

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.789 
like kg and ray allen and peers that
they<00:03:18.670> have<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.840> awareness<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.530> go<00:03:20.680> ahead

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
they have the the awareness to go ahead

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.170 
they have the the awareness to go ahead
and<00:03:21.220> make<00:03:21.400> sure<00:03:21.430> they'd<00:03:21.730> only<00:03:21.850> what<00:03:22.150> three

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
and make sure they'd only what three

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.920 
and make sure they'd only what three

point shooter wide wide open on on a 23

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.539 
point shooter wide wide open on on a 23
and<00:03:26.110> that's<00:03:26.260> exactly<00:03:26.440> what<00:03:26.830> happens<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.370> more

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
and that's exactly what happens the more

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.789 
and that's exactly what happens the more
zone<00:03:27.790> I<00:03:27.820> did<00:03:28.180> which<00:03:28.750> I<00:03:28.930> felt<00:03:29.110> like<00:03:29.290> it<00:03:29.620> was<00:03:29.739> a

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
zone I did which I felt like it was a

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.949 
zone I did which I felt like it was a
better<00:03:29.950> chance<00:03:30.220> for<00:03:30.610> me<00:03:30.820> to<00:03:30.850> stop<00:03:31.690> them

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
better chance for me to stop them

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.410 
better chance for me to stop them
because<00:03:32.350> it<00:03:32.830> kind<00:03:33.130> of<00:03:33.190> prevented<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:33.820> driving

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
because it kind of prevented the driving

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.270 
because it kind of prevented the driving

you know hand and I think as a team that
can<00:04:04.630> be<00:04:04.720> built<00:04:04.870> for<00:04:05.110> success<00:04:05.470> but<00:04:05.680> we<00:04:05.799> got<00:04:05.920> to

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
can be built for success but we got to

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.080 
can be built for success but we got to
go<00:04:06.100> ahead<00:04:06.160> and<00:04:06.310> get<00:04:06.370> our<00:04:06.430> deepest<00:04:06.760> together

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
go ahead and get our deepest together

go ahead and get our deepest together
and<00:04:07.630> I<00:04:07.720> know<00:04:07.810> it<00:04:07.989> all<00:04:08.110> starts<00:04:08.410> with<00:04:08.500> me<00:04:08.739> I<00:04:08.980> know

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
and I know it all starts with me I know

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.100 
and I know it all starts with me I know
I<00:04:09.489> need<00:04:09.610> to<00:04:09.790> stop<00:04:10.150> I'm<00:04:10.480> having<00:04:10.870> so<00:04:10.989> many

security<00:04:21.400> because<00:04:21.610> I<00:04:21.790> get<00:04:22.000> way<00:04:22.180> too<00:04:22.240> many

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
security because I get way too many

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.450 
security because I get way too many
turnovers<00:04:22.660> and<00:04:23.140> that<00:04:23.260> contributes<00:04:23.770> to<00:04:24.430> a

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
turnovers and that contributes to a

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.070 
turnovers and that contributes to a
whole<00:04:24.880> lot<00:04:25.090> of<00:04:25.120> fast<00:04:25.390> break<00:04:25.600> points<00:04:25.870> for<00:04:26.020> the

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
whole lot of fast break points for the

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.930 
whole lot of fast break points for the
other<00:04:26.200> team<00:04:26.410> right<00:04:27.130> I<00:04:27.160> pretty<00:04:27.460> much<00:04:27.550> it<00:04:27.790> gets

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
other team right I pretty much it gets

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.400 
other team right I pretty much it gets
subbed<00:04:28.150> out<00:04:28.300> for<00:04:28.510> the<00:04:28.570> entire<00:04:28.660> quarter<00:04:29.260> right

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
subbed out for the entire quarter right

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.900 
subbed out for the entire quarter right
here<00:04:29.560> because<00:04:29.830> I<00:04:29.980> end<00:04:30.190> up<00:04:30.280> getting<00:04:30.610> another

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
here because I end up getting another

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.760 
here because I end up getting another
far<00:04:31.210> right<00:04:31.390> there<00:04:31.600> I'll<00:04:32.020> deduct<00:04:32.230> my<00:04:32.530> fourth

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
far right there I'll deduct my fourth

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.400 
far right there I'll deduct my fourth
foul<00:04:32.950> but<00:04:33.670> what<00:04:33.790> time<00:04:33.970> I<00:04:34.000> come<00:04:34.180> back<00:04:34.210> is<00:04:34.450> 77<00:04:35.020> 283

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
foul but what time I come back is 77 283

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.410 
foul but what time I come back is 77 283
I<00:04:35.680> mean<00:04:35.890> that's<00:04:36.010> not<00:04:36.280> that<00:04:36.490> much<00:04:36.730> of<00:04:37.000> a<00:04:37.210> lead

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
I mean that's not that much of a lead

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.020 
I mean that's not that much of a lead
right<00:04:37.630> there<00:04:37.840> you<00:04:38.380> know<00:04:38.530> we're<00:04:38.710> still<00:04:39.070> in<00:04:39.490> the

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
right there you know we're still in the

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.170 
right there you know we're still in the
game<00:04:40.320> but<00:04:41.320> the<00:04:41.710> more<00:04:42.010> like<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.610> closer<00:04:42.850> closer

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
game but the more like the closer closer

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.790 
game but the more like the closer closer
we<00:04:43.420> got<00:04:43.540> the<00:04:43.810> further<00:04:44.050> and<00:04:44.230> further<00:04:44.440> they

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
we got the further and further they

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.620 
we got the further and further they
pulled<00:04:45.040> away<00:04:45.220> that<00:04:45.580> makes<00:04:45.730> any<00:04:45.850> sense<00:04:45.970> they

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
pulled away that makes any sense they

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.910 
pulled away that makes any sense they
just<00:04:46.780> started<00:04:46.870> hitting<00:04:47.230> shot<00:04:47.590> after<00:04:47.770> shot

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
just started hitting shot after shot

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.560 
just started hitting shot after shot
after<00:04:48.130> shot<00:04:48.400> and<00:04:48.940> it<00:04:49.030> got<00:04:49.150> to<00:04:49.270> a<00:04:49.300> point<00:04:49.330> where

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
after shot and it got to a point where

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.750 
after shot and it got to a point where
you<00:04:50.380> know<00:04:50.530> if<00:04:50.800> we<00:04:50.950> were<00:04:51.070> to<00:04:51.190> miss<00:04:51.340> two<00:04:51.550> three
