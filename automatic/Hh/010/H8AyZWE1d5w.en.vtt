00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 very good two we are going well here mysterium 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.730
 I go here we are with one of pokemon in 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.710
 solutions and how do you see this in the part 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.170
 start because if you have read in the 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.940
 title today is to beat how to get to 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.429
 mega 6-3 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.940
 mega shifter because in this game 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:22.080
 I was mega and as a gift of beta 1.1 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.279
 well they put mega 63 then what 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.769
 we have to do obviously 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.359
 we have to go to before the gift 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.539
 mysterious and to remove so be and as 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.759
 less comes to a been this been does 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.770
 a little special because we received it 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.469
 ok and now we have to go find it 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.550
 pokemon center then we started 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.010
 we started normal fire I'm here already in 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.789
 the team to catch what we talk about 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.190
 with this man and as you see we receive a 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.140
 to be either a being or not then 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.780
 obviously it is going to have to upload it to 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.449
 level to evolve what to turn off 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.030
 shift trino and as you can see it takes 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.859
 Equipped gas ypf trip of the district is 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.040
 good flame what attacks have good 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.400
 have shit attack because obviously 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.040
 so I'm going to do it's going to be raise it and 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.480
 I'm going to show you how it looks like 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.820
 evolves and here the level of evolution 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.650
 and ring and finally we're going to see the 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.950
 characteristics that it has so we 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.950
 we see 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.030
 good guys as you see we have here 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.650
 and ashley and then up to 32 and 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.900
 just at the worst with material about 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.180
 directly 32 and it's just what I 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.900
 I wanted to learn is your bonfire on 32 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.540
 I do not want your 42 and solve 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.250
 then yes and now what we have to 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.400
 do as all well you will know then 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.400
 shifter and then evolves in a way 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.690
 something special special more than anything 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.950
 evolves with the leaf stone that the 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.950
 I have here was wrong 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.540
 dragon tree here is the stone leaf I have two 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:58.300
 and obviously it will give 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:01.100
 evolve well free well I wanted to 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.660
 fast what I wanted was to evolve 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.640
 hash and just to 32 because 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.080
 just 32 revolutions 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.850
 ossío divisions before 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.009
 when usually the chieftains just 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.860
 shifting the disney nobody learns 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.810
 hurricane hurricane is gale 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.300
 attack that is very powerful 110 of 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.010
 power that has 70 precision can 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.510
 fail yes but it is very powerful and you will say 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.330
 in case it is special because if it is special and 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.760
 we have nasty plot that was already coming 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.830
 taught with the gift and it also came 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.360
 this attack reason win then with some 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.630
 cycles we are going to check the attack 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.060
 special very much and obviously with 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.400
 hurricane then let's burst I'll 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.720
 keep wearing the set and for now 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.060
 travel synthesis is not going to be the last 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.680
 synthesis attack you will see that it left you 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.750
 I know if I leave behind pride but good 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.700
 I'm going to keep taking it and I'm going to 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.290
 show what my final set of 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.180
 steve tree and I hope you like two 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.159
 centuries and now we see 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.810
 well guys we're here with shift and 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.450
 at the level nothing more and nothing less than the 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.650
 level 44 because well then because at 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.209
 level 44 just learn digester that 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.709
 it is an attack that is one last esteem 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.579
 let the special attack go down when 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.769
 you attack but here you have leader are 120 of 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.079
 power position plus the nastic 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:17.519
 that would be 260 power plus 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:19.530
 hurling would then be 110 double 220 and 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.690
 then we can put it give press pulse 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.210
 what 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.760
 the emt or anywhere or if you go to 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.290
 I remember movement alone will teach me 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.140
 now I have left with synthesis you can 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.310
 put tar pulse obviously because 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.320
 this sinister type and store of the year with 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.970
 is in favor so it's good in 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.440
 the titles take away from us 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.300
 digester either if you want to remove the 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.800
 trolling then you can remove it because 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.960
 also rose edith it is true that also 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.140
 it has it and well then you can remove it 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:48.140
 but then if I did not achieve here yes geek 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.610
 a skill that is not is not to not me 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.110
 do stripper dadme gasista and have 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.810
 a life that has gone away dense let's go 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.870
 to go outside to equip the mega 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.860
 stone and adopted is one is an attack 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:05.560
 what is a new forgiveness skill 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.560
 stone here we give you 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:13.270
 and we are going to leave to see the aspect 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.130
 of mega shift and to see how it hits 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.670
 evidently around here pokemon bass 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.440
 level and then it will not be very complicated 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:25.410
 but well let's go here me right here 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:28.500
 or here we are not going to surf here below 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.780
 and good the skill is mega 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.360
 shifter and what it does is that you up the 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.440
 speed when there is darkness and what 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.190
 does this mean that when there 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.190
 neglects well 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.820
 what does it mean darkness there is an attack 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.720
 found the bookstore that teaches 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:50.050
 how it was achieved 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.050
 how do you get pink rossi 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.490
 and there the attack is called new moon 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.440
 that makes this nest world is like well 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.630
 sunny for example that does not serve as 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.060
 sunny day but the other way around I do not know what 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.760
 there is much alone there is much darkness and 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.460
 does this well as day 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.220
 sunny power or that makes you 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.130
 you take the turn of the solar ray new moon 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.380
 prevents the turn of the new attack that 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.020
 it is called the canon mole that is cannon 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.580
 mole that learns what you learn and trike 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.800
 with you learned and I'm not sure but 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.780
 pink and if I want learn and from the táchira 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.910
 he also learns then we use this 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.620
 attack and if we only put these three then 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.360
 we have an arcane for free during 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.320
 five shifts that I believe endures 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.660
 to new moon then also the shift and the 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.250
 face are enhanced speed with the 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.630
 skill you will be where he with what 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.030
 which we have two because they are so many 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.310
 with the attack this newman so good 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.960
 let's see how it hits this I'm here 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.020
 where we have to be free around 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.210
 is level 23 evidently value 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:54.200
 to die let's see the revolution there 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:58.870
 there we are wall street is very handsome or 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.870
 it is more scary than before 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:07.320
 we will be in when 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:10.240
 when you attack with these characteristics 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.920
 it's upside down noventera goes up but well no 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.720
 it has it they have the ability is euros 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.550
 attacks by silicone 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.070
 I already said how it was achieved in the video of 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:21.430
 how to get a delta I've said before 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:23.580
 but it's the ninety-odd emt I think 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.580
 is 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:29.860
 if I have it here is my 62 'new moon' 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.620
 is how you see good the sky 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.460
 It darkens and night falls and 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.470
 increases the power of the programs of 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.620
 sinister type of ghost type and in addition 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:40.570
 does it have the lunar cannon so that it does not 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.130
 have to spend a shift loading it 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.050
 So, well, you guys already know that 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:47.670
 you can put any in place of hurricane 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:49.960
 or instead of me that I know what you want and 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:51.280
 roser and also to rosell also because 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.320
 they have an arcane in mine does not have it 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.780
 because it is the remove but future in a 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.880
 future I'm going to put the 4 can permeate 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.660
 I'll put on heart scales so they go 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.110
 I hope you've liked girls 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.460
 much this video that you do not vote because the 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.900
 true that seems easy because these 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.030
 videos cost more than you think 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.530
 that everything see you so nothing 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.820
 likes liked subscribing for more and 

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.840
 see you in the next video just from 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.470
 until next time 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.470
 ah 

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:17.249
 ah
