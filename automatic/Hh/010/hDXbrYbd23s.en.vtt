you run one wit and feed runs another

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.729 
you run one wit and feed runs another
way<00:00:45.030> but<00:00:45.750> just<00:00:45.809> for<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.230> we're<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:46.469> going

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
way but just for this we're just going

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
so we're just going to run out hopefully

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.790 
so we're just going to run out hopefully

no one cares I just one now you got Matt
bond<00:00:59.070> yeah<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:01.890> what<00:01:02.129> f<00:01:02.370> map<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:03.000> good<00:01:03.270> for<00:01:03.600> is

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
bond yeah so what f map is good for is

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.429 
bond yeah so what f map is good for is
when<00:01:04.439> you're<00:01:04.979> running<00:01:05.220> around<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:06.439> obviously

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
when you're running around and obviously

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.160 
when you're running around and obviously
you<00:01:07.590> can<00:01:07.950> see<00:01:08.280> people's<00:01:08.790> faces<00:01:09.060> when<00:01:09.659> they're

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
you can see people's faces when they're

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.960 
you can see people's faces when they're
just<00:01:10.350> above<00:01:10.710> ground<00:01:11.040> like<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.520> crappy

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
just above ground like this crappy

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.230 
just above ground like this crappy
little<00:01:12.090> basis<00:01:12.680> that<00:01:13.680> aren't<00:01:13.920> eating<00:01:14.010> good<00:01:14.310> but

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
little basis that aren't eating good but

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.480 
little basis that aren't eating good but
what<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.750> really<00:01:15.900> want<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.619> find<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.159> those

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
what you really want to find is those

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.749 
what you really want to find is those
underground<00:01:18.240> bases<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.740> can't<00:01:20.100> see<00:01:20.520> in

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
underground bases then you can't see in

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.120 
underground bases then you can't see in
the<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.540> have<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.930> use<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.320> map<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.979> you're

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
the you have to use of map so you're

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.440 
the you have to use of map so you're
just<00:01:23.369> running<00:01:23.549> around<00:01:23.759> with<00:01:24.060> F<00:01:24.240> map<00:01:24.509> and

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
just running around with F map and

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.700 
just running around with F map and
you're<00:01:27.450> going<00:01:27.780> around<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.320> will<00:01:28.409> show<00:01:28.650> you

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
you're going around and it will show you

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.719 
you're going around and it will show you
where<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.189> claimed<00:01:29.490> land<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.530> so<00:01:31.530> you'll<00:01:32.310> see

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
where the claimed land is so you'll see

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.990 
where the claimed land is so you'll see
that<00:01:33.060> its<00:01:33.240> clam<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.990> you'll<00:01:34.470> know<00:01:34.680> it's<00:01:35.549> most

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
that its clam and you'll know it's most

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.969 
that its clam and you'll know it's most
likely<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.479> base<00:01:36.720> if<00:01:36.990> people<00:01:37.320> don't<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.710> run

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
likely a base if people don't just run

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.859 
likely a base if people don't just run
around<00:01:38.100> climbing<00:01:38.700> land<00:01:38.909> cuz<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.390> takes<00:01:39.420> away

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
around climbing land cuz it takes away

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.810 
around climbing land cuz it takes away
their<00:01:39.990> power<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.500> stuff<00:01:40.770> okay<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.400> your

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
their power and stuff okay so your

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.359 
their power and stuff okay so your
example<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.840> my<00:01:43.020> plane<00:01:43.259> land<00:01:43.500> okay<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.100> see

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
example of my plane land okay so see

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.100 
example of my plane land okay so see
this<00:01:44.490> whole<00:01:44.610> base<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:45.390> obviously<00:01:45.840> ready

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
this whole base it's obviously ready

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.289 
this whole base it's obviously ready
because<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:46.380> right<00:01:46.649> out<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.799> her<00:01:47.040> butt<00:01:48.030> right

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
because it's right out of her butt right

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.870 
because it's right out of her butt right
out<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.450> warp<00:01:48.689> all<00:01:48.869> see<00:01:49.860> okay<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.700> see

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
out of warp all see okay so you see

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.609 
out of warp all see okay so you see
these<00:01:51.030> little<00:01:51.149> like<00:01:51.360> letters<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.140> stuff<00:01:52.350> and

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
these little like letters and stuff and

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.280 
these little like letters and stuff and
all<00:01:52.740> these<00:01:52.829> numbers<00:01:53.720> that<00:01:54.720> means<00:01:54.960> that's

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
all these numbers that means that's

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.440 
all these numbers that means that's
claimed<00:01:56.159> one<00:01:56.460> that's<00:01:56.880> what<00:01:57.090> you're<00:01:57.210> looking

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450
