00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.250
 ah 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.980
 yes 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.510
 all right 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:43.510
 and this when they put me in the face this 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:47.100
 first thing I saw was him 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.480
 well what about the game of d 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.460
 also finger game 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.370
 what about the new game called a 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:59.750
 killer something like that a killer that jett 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.130
 and then this one says it will be said 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.090
 that will be good the games that had 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.090
 good graphics 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.710
 that will be a collective 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.569
 and so 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.540
 this is the new game that will be released but 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.650
 does not say date says the date of 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.650
 when are you going to take it out 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:27.340
 but as you watched the video put this 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:27.340
 opinion to see what wave they thought 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.160
 because he says that I'm telling you 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.959
 that is addictive that has good 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.930
 graphics even say also until 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.310
 is going to be multiplayer as you come to add 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.080
 new player all and nothing that 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.080
 multiplayer that you can not and that 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.250
 and here says mad finger games are 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.480
 happy like his new 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.040
 exciting zombies but a killer 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.069
 Experience the chaotic new city 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.720
 york 'devastated by a zombie virus of 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.130
 the war for the survival of the 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.840
 humanity that has just begun 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.800
 available in June that is going to come out in 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:10.590
 June but it is not on the exact date 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:13.970
 so the first on 2 the xxx 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.970
 missing 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.609
 like three months two and a half months three 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.609
 months for the game to come out and then 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.000
 Well, let's see what they will see how to see 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.769
 if it's as massive as a wheat day or is 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.680
 worse than already trigger I do not think it's 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.629
 worse or more 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.959
 who knows about the audience to 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:38.370
 viatri that the fans do not because 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.660
 also the trick is the raffles of the riva 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.920
 from to trigger 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.280
 and then 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:50.280
 here is the official page of the game 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.010
 and see what wave to see how is the 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.319
 game 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.459
 and apparently I think it's not going to come out in 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.459
 facebook but who knows 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.810
 Well, I do not think that the time 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.810
 Android house devices 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:11.300
 for many for many 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.840
 but for facebook it seems that not who 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.840
 knows 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.030
 that they think is better than the trigger 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.030
 2nd 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.020
 because it is worse or what 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.000
 Remove the audience from behind 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.680
 what's up when they say to see what wave 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.120
 what do you think about the new game to see what 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.729

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.889

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:37.360
