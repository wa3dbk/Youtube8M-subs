some of these skeptic Bible studies here
and<00:00:24.480> this<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.779> very<00:00:25.140> important<00:00:25.619> issue<00:00:25.830> here

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
and this is a very important issue here

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.300 
and this is a very important issue here
central<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.720> idea<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.260> Christianity<00:00:29.070> is

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
central to the idea of Christianity is

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.849 
central to the idea of Christianity is
the<00:00:29.340> idea<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.000> Jesus<00:00:30.240> was<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.080> Messiah<00:00:31.320> that

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
the idea that Jesus was the Messiah that

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.370 
the idea that Jesus was the Messiah that
was<00:00:32.189> forecast<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.329> Old<00:00:33.480> Testament<00:00:33.630> and

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
was forecast in the Old Testament and

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.620 
was forecast in the Old Testament and
that<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.040> method<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.460> salvation<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:36.480> is

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
that the method of salvation that is

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.110 
that the method of salvation that is
offered<00:00:37.140> by<00:00:37.170> Jesus<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.980> somehow<00:00:38.190> compatible

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
offered by Jesus is somehow compatible

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.049 
offered by Jesus is somehow compatible
with<00:00:39.840> salvation<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.309> Old<00:00:41.430> Testament<00:00:41.940> or

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
with salvation in the Old Testament or

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.479 
with salvation in the Old Testament or
the<00:00:42.120> methods<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.230> atonement<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.890> should<00:00:44.100> say<00:00:44.309> in

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
the methods of atonement I should say in

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.310 
the methods of atonement I should say in
the<00:00:44.579> Old<00:00:44.700> Testament<00:00:45.090> it's<00:00:45.510> kind<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.050> sketchy

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
the Old Testament it's kind of sketchy

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.810 
the Old Testament it's kind of sketchy
whether<00:00:46.649> or<00:00:46.770> not<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.010> Jews<00:00:47.219> had<00:00:47.430> any<00:00:47.579> concept

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
whether or not the Jews had any concept

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.600 
whether or not the Jews had any concept
of<00:00:48.210> an<00:00:48.360> afterlife<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:49.500> they<00:00:49.680> did<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:49.920> blood

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
of an afterlife but they did have blood

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.360 
of an afterlife but they did have blood
sacrifices<00:00:51.300> for<00:00:51.750> atonement<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:53.010> idea

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
sacrifices for atonement and the idea

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.279 
sacrifices for atonement and the idea

from the pagans that they got their idea

it was from the pagans that they got
this<00:06:47.340> idea<00:06:47.580> and<00:06:48.120> that's<00:06:49.050> why<00:06:49.410> they<00:06:50.040> came<00:06:50.340> up

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490 
this idea and that's why they came up

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.390 
this idea and that's why they came up
with<00:06:50.520> such<00:06:50.940> a<00:06:51.270> convoluted<00:06:52.400> Byzantine

with such a convoluted Byzantine
