00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
percent increasing capacity I'm sure we

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.329 
percent increasing capacity I'm sure we
can<00:00:25.839> manage<00:00:25.960> that<00:00:26.380> additional<00:00:26.800> girth<00:00:27.009> quick

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
improvement over the DC 16 as I've

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.369 
improvement over the DC 16 as I've
occasionally<00:00:48.820> handed<00:00:49.420> this<00:00:49.600> battery<00:00:50.019> off<00:00:50.199> to

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
people and they've been unable to figure

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.150 
people and they've been unable to figure
out<00:00:52.059> how<00:00:52.570> much<00:00:52.809> capacity<00:00:53.559> is<00:00:53.649> left<00:00:53.920> on<00:00:54.070> the

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
out how much capacity is left on the

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.520 
out how much capacity is left on the
battery<00:00:54.339> and<00:00:54.670> there's<00:00:55.179> no<00:00:55.390> real<00:00:55.809> firm<00:00:56.230> action

right<00:00:59.050> here<00:00:59.109> you<00:00:59.499> kind<00:00:59.769> of<00:00:59.920> push<00:01:00.309> it<00:01:00.339> and<00:01:00.699> it's

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
right here you kind of push it and it's

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.910 
right here you kind of push it and it's
got<00:01:00.999> a<00:01:01.030> rubbery<00:01:01.539> feel<00:01:01.899> to<00:01:02.140> it<00:01:02.260> so<00:01:02.649> I<00:01:02.710> can

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
got a rubbery feel to it so I can

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.680 
got a rubbery feel to it so I can
totally<00:01:03.219> appreciate<00:01:03.519> how<00:01:04.150> some<00:01:04.390> people<00:01:04.510> have

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
totally appreciate how some people have

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.570 
totally appreciate how some people have
missed<00:01:05.050> being<00:01:05.470> able<00:01:05.620> to<00:01:05.800> check<00:01:05.980> the<00:01:06.100> capacity

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580

now<00:01:12.310> nokia<00:01:12.640> was<00:01:12.670> kind<00:01:12.910> enough<00:01:12.970> to<00:01:13.120> hook<00:01:13.300> us<00:01:13.390> up

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
now nokia was kind enough to hook us up

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.090 
now nokia was kind enough to hook us up
