00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
this is the extreme scooters XE 499 it's

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.440 
this is the extreme scooters XE 499 it's
got<00:00:47.680> about<00:00:47.890> foot<00:00:48.190> by<00:00:48.370> one<00:00:48.579> horse<00:00:48.879> wrapped<00:00:49.270> up

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
got about foot by one horse wrapped up

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.680 
got about foot by one horse wrapped up
in<00:00:49.660> a<00:00:49.719> big<00:00:49.930> city<00:00:50.200> to<00:00:50.559> stroke<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:52.149> exhaust<00:00:52.510> is

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
in a big city to stroke the exhaust is

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.750 
in a big city to stroke the exhaust is
actually<00:00:53.110> shorter<00:00:53.559> so<00:00:53.710> you<00:00:53.829> get<00:00:54.039> less<00:00:54.460> back

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
actually shorter so you get less back

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.490 
actually shorter so you get less back
pressure<00:00:55.030> so<00:00:55.300> you<00:00:55.420> get<00:00:55.570> best<00:00:55.809> acceleration

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
pressure so you get best acceleration

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.560
