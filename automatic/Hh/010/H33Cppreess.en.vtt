 this is the best way to achieve this 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.220
 it is to improve theater and mutu must 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.270
 start by reinforcing a prelude 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.290
 selects attributes made 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.900

 put especially hard for a 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.860
 overcapacity it's not going to do that it's okay 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.590
 block for the rest it is necessary that 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.090
 it's a good average for 3 years and this 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.740
 after we have to personalize we're going 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:32.650

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.690

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.860
 take vis-Ã -vis here I make a pass 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.360
 1 episode per day 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.190
 so I do not have that much time anyway 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.780
 hard it depends on maybe quoted from 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.810
 thematic also matches kind of 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:43.090
 I do not know if it's possible to 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.280
 to do like it's walking an episode that has 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:49.210
 a big match - finally in between 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.350
 drive more or less so that's it 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.030
 that's all for this episode me I say 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.280
 the next come to see the 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:57.910
 suite and liked the video it would make me very 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:07:01.500
 fun and it will make you cool with everything 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.500
