law is only used for you know governors
of<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.500> state<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.489> they<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:06.140> mobilize<00:01:07.140> on

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.980 
is trying to grab more and more power
whether<00:01:32.090> whether<00:01:33.090> he's<00:01:33.390> doing<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.810> because

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990

that he wasn't feeling a lot of guilt
feeling<00:01:44.850> election<00:01:45.439> that<00:01:46.439> um<00:01:46.829> he<00:01:47.340> wasn't<00:01:47.640> able

to stop the attacks of 911 and he feels
that<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:51.180> know<00:01:51.299> as<00:01:52.189> as<00:01:53.390> your<00:01:54.390> president<00:01:54.600> that

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
that you know as as your president that

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.770 
that you know as as your president that
he<00:01:55.229> needs<00:01:56.040> all<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.640> power<00:01:56.820> they<00:01:57.060> can<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.570> try

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
he needs all the power they can to try

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.859 
he needs all the power they can to try
and<00:01:57.810> prevent<00:01:58.229> another<00:01:59.159> attack<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.869> but

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
and prevent another attack like that but

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.289 
and prevent another attack like that but
this<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.829> just<00:02:01.860> wrong<00:02:02.189> he's<00:02:02.490> going<00:02:02.850> too<00:02:03.030> far

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
this is just wrong he's going too far

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.920 
this is just wrong he's going too far
there's<00:02:03.719> no<00:02:04.409> other<00:02:04.590> ways<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.070> can<00:02:05.310> protect

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
there's no other ways you can protect

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.419 
there's no other ways you can protect
ourselves<00:02:07.330> so<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:09.590> looks<00:02:09.860> like<00:02:09.950> there's<00:02:10.310> going

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
ourselves so it looks like there's going

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.990 
ourselves so it looks like there's going
to<00:02:10.520> be<00:02:10.580> a<00:02:10.670> grassroots<00:02:11.510> effort<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:12.590> try<00:02:12.860> and

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
to be a grassroots effort to try and

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.300 
to be a grassroots effort to try and
have<00:02:14.000> Congress<00:02:14.540> repeal<00:02:14.930> this<00:02:15.110> because<00:02:15.470> it

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
have Congress repeal this because it

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.230 
have Congress repeal this because it
occurred<00:02:17.240> so<00:02:17.540> quickly<00:02:17.930> this<00:02:18.110> bill<00:02:18.760> I<00:02:19.760> guess

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.330
