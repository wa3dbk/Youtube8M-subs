with it but I thought might be alright
so<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.300> ran<00:01:03.540> here<00:01:03.810> and<00:01:04.140> what<00:01:04.680> you're<00:01:04.769> gonna<00:01:04.860> be

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
so I ran here and what you're gonna be

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.590 
so I ran here and what you're gonna be
doing<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.460> you're<00:01:05.549> gonna<00:01:05.700> be<00:01:05.880> killing<00:01:06.150> level

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.840 
doing is you're gonna be killing level
20<00:01:06.990> bats<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.560> believe<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.369> global

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
20 bats and I believe this is a global

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.870 
20 bats and I believe this is a global
drop<00:01:09.390> between<00:01:09.630> all<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.470> bats<00:01:10.680> but<00:01:11.369> if<00:01:11.579> you<00:01:11.670> can

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
drop between all the bats but if you can

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.940 
drop between all the bats but if you can
kill<00:01:12.060> level<00:01:12.390> 20s<00:01:12.780> why<00:01:13.350> not<00:01:13.590> kill<00:01:14.010> level<00:01:14.340> 20s

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
kill level 20s why not kill level 20s

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.990 
kill level 20s why not kill level 20s
kind<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.010> makes<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> most<00:01:17.460> sense<00:01:17.580> if<00:01:17.909> you

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
kind of makes the most sense if you

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.280 
kind of makes the most sense if you
think<00:01:18.210> about<00:01:18.300> it<00:01:18.600> why<00:01:18.720> would<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.930> waste<00:01:19.110> your

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
think about it why would you waste your

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.500 
think about it why would you waste your
time<00:01:19.409> killing<00:01:19.710> level<00:01:20.040> 64<00:01:20.550> bats<00:01:20.790> when<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
time killing level 64 bats when you

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.910 
time killing level 64 bats when you
could<00:01:21.659> be<00:01:21.750> killing<00:01:21.990> these<00:01:22.200> level<00:01:22.530> 20<00:01:22.770> bats

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
could be killing these level 20 bats

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.860 
could be killing these level 20 bats
which<00:01:23.130> drop<00:01:23.370> the<00:01:23.520> same<00:01:23.729> thing<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.330> at<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
which drop the same thing and at the

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.230 
which drop the same thing and at the
same<00:01:24.990> drop<00:01:25.290> rate<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:26.250> right<00:01:26.729> now<00:01:26.880> there<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.210> a
