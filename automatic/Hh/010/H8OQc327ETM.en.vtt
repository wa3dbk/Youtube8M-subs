[fizz, sip]

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.320
Aahhh!

LGR:
What?

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.620
Here it is, Christmas Eve,

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.120
and I'm looking at Psycho Santa.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.500
What's wrong with me?

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.020
What's right with me?

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.460
I am the Lazy Game Reviewer
and I look at weird games like this,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.900
and Psycho Santa is friggin' weird.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.860
It's a game from 1993,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.260
released exclusively through
the magazine The One Amiga.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.100
And it was developed by Bullfrog Productions.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.260
Yes. *That* Bullfrog.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.100
The same guys responsible for
the Populous games, Theme Park,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.480
and a bunch of other friggin' awesome stuff.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.900
I'd love to think Peter Molyneux had
something to do with something this ridiculous,

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.840
but that's probably just wishful thinking

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.100
The credits credit Michael C. Diskett,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.260
Gary Carr

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.560
and Kevin Earl.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.320
Uh, Diskett sounds like a bit of a fishy name... to me.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.540
Either that or that's just
freakishly appropriate for a coder.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.700
Whatever the case, this is Psycho Santa

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.140
and it starts off with that music that
you've been hearing in the background,

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.860
which is actually pretty catchy.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.460
The gameplay begins with you
presumably taking over Santa's soul,

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.560
assuming control of his body and his sleigh,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.280
which is conveniently attached to
two weird, gravity-defying reindeer.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.300
You're just kind of roaming around
through the fluttering snowflakes,

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.280
dodging... things... in the sky.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.080
Eh, you know, you may as well just throw
away any preconceived notions you may have

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.840
for what a Christmas game should be
because the only one this follows

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.180
is that presents have to be delivered.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.740
Otherwise, you have death demons in the sky

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.840
and other impossible flying
creatures trying to kill you.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.840
Not exactly a storybook Christmas.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.360
Unless, perhaps, your storybook was written
by Dr. Seuss under the influence of stupid.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.760
At the beginning of each level, you're given a goal,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.780
which is to make a certain number of houses happy.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.460
That's right: not the children, the houses.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.660
Man, I feel bad now. Always buying
gifts for my loved ones over the years

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.200
and ignoring my house this entire time.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.340
And this seems like a simple enough goal

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.220
with a Defender-esque landscape
to cover, enemies to avoid

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.580
and a supply of presents to
deliver to the houses below.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.340
But an issue arises

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.120
when you realize that Santa is a psycho,

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.160
and for some reason tosses the
presents from the rear of the sleigh

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.160
instead of straight down, or forward.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.320
This makes for some of the most awkward
gift delivery I have ever experienced

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.460
and it adds a thick layer of
annoyingness to the gameplay

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.040
that really shouldn't be there.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.380
So you're constantly battling
against yourself to try and stay

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.240
above the houses and avoid all
the damaging crap flying at you.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.620
Yes, folks. This is the game.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.060
Back and forth and back and forth

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.160
and forth and back and back and forth

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160
and forth-back until you
move on to the bonus level.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.840
Here, you find that Santa has apparently
beaten and robbed Commander Keen

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.540
and now has a pogo stick.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.360
And the goal is to grab all the
presents from this massive tree

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.840
before time massively runs out.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.360
That was stupid. Why did I say that?

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.880
It was pretty straightforward here,
but you have to be at just the right angle

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.340
to collect each present, and it's
got that weird gameplay element

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.160
that requires you to press Jump

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.080
at just the right time in
order to jump even higher.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.880
It's that trampoline feeling,

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.400
and I've never, ever been
good at these kinds of things

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.700
and I'm not very fond of this one either.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.360
At all. Nope.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.020
Then it's on to the next level,

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.960
which is really the same as the first level

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.100
except with more houses to please

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.160
and more crap to avoid.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.320
Eventually, the inevitable happens
and you'll be out of presents to deliver.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.200
mainly because of Santa's unreasonable fear

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.040
of just dropping things directly below him.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.460
What you've gotta do is go and
confront a death demon thing

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.500
at the top of the sky...

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.100
and smack it with snowballs. In the face.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.060
Listening to it scream in both
channels of audio until it dies.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.180
And when it does, it will explode

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.820
into a bunch of presents which you
need to gather before they hit the ground.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.500
And that is Psycho Santa, such as it is.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.040
It's a free game that came with a magazine

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.560
and you can tell.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.040
I mean, what do you expect?

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.820
Well, I'll tell you what I expected

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.120
and that is a game that lives up
to its own psycho moniker.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.640
I can imagine a lot more psycho of a Santa

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.820
than one who just refuses
to drop presents properly.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.820
That's not psycho! That's stupid!

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.180
I guess I just somehow envisioned
Santa as an axe murderer

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.180
or something simple like that, but alas,

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.760
this is not that game.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.440
But as it is, it's just not
worth recommending at all

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.860
because it's devoid of
any interesting gameplay,

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.960
and what it does have is repetitive at best.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.720
Apparently, there was going to be a more
complete Psycho Santa experience by Bullfrog,

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.960
but I can't find any evidence
of that actually happening.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.400
And that's too bad because the game
does have some pretty sweet stuff.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.320
It's got music and a name.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.660
Ehâ€“ ughhh...

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.720
[chuckles]

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.380
Well, actually, that's all it has.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.980
So never mind. If you have the
full game, I don't really care.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.900
Merry freakin' Christmas
and have a happy whatever.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.220

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.980
