camera as well as transfer to the phone

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.710 
camera as well as transfer to the phone
as<00:03:43.560> well<00:03:43.799> our<00:03:44.400> second<00:03:44.819> model<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.920> DSC<00:03:46.920> QX<00:03:47.720> 100

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
as well our second model is DSC QX 100

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.259 
as well our second model is DSC QX 100
so<00:03:49.620> this<00:03:49.769> is<00:03:49.889> our<00:03:50.040> second<00:03:50.430> lens<00:03:50.609> style<00:03:50.879> camera

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
so this is our second lens style camera

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.509 
so this is our second lens style camera
this<00:03:51.629> is<00:03:51.690> a<00:03:51.840> larger<00:03:52.200> model<00:03:52.530> uses<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.040> larger

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
this is a larger model uses a larger

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.879 
this is a larger model uses a larger
image<00:03:53.819> sensor<00:03:54.180> it's<00:03:54.659> the<00:03:54.900> same<00:03:55.139> image<00:03:55.530> sensor

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
image sensor it's the same image sensor

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.949 
image sensor it's the same image sensor
and<00:03:56.099> lens<00:03:56.310> combination<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.269> we<00:03:57.420> use<00:03:57.629> in<00:03:57.870> our

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
and lens combination that we use in our

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.190 
and lens combination that we use in our
recently<00:03:58.440> introduced<00:03:58.859> rx100<00:03:59.549> mark<00:04:00.090> 2<00:04:00.359> so<00:04:01.079> it

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
recently introduced rx100 mark 2 so it

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.099 
recently introduced rx100 mark 2 so it
has<00:04:01.409> the<00:04:01.859> one<00:04:02.400> inch<00:04:02.609> 20<00:04:03.239> megapixel<00:04:03.750> sensor

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
has the one inch 20 megapixel sensor

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.430 
has the one inch 20 megapixel sensor
it's<00:04:04.980> much<00:04:05.430> larger<00:04:05.700> than<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.409> sensors<00:04:07.409> that

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
it's much larger than the sensors that

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.830 
it's much larger than the sensors that
you'd<00:04:07.739> see<00:04:07.920> in<00:04:07.950> typical<00:04:08.269> compact<00:04:09.269> cameras<00:04:09.629> and

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
you'd see in typical compact cameras and

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.449 
you'd see in typical compact cameras and
it<00:04:10.019> also<00:04:10.169> has<00:04:10.560> a<00:04:10.889> 3.6<00:04:11.790> x<00:04:12.030> carl<00:04:12.480> zeiss<00:04:13.459> Vario

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
it also has a 3.6 x carl zeiss Vario

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.839 
it also has a 3.6 x carl zeiss Vario
sonar<00:04:15.000> t-star<00:04:15.989> lens<00:04:16.349> with<00:04:17.220> a<00:04:17.250> very<00:04:17.519> bright

widest<00:04:18.599> aperture<00:04:18.900> of<00:04:19.250> f-18<00:04:20.250> so<00:04:20.519> this<00:04:20.639> is<00:04:20.789> great

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
widest aperture of f-18 so this is great

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.689 
widest aperture of f-18 so this is great
for<00:04:21.269> low-light<00:04:22.079> shooting<00:04:22.500> it<00:04:22.949> also<00:04:23.099> helps<00:04:23.610> you

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
for low-light shooting it also helps you

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.000 
for low-light shooting it also helps you
with<00:04:23.849> defocused<00:04:24.449> backgrounds<00:04:25.110> it's<00:04:25.650> a<00:04:25.740> much

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
with defocused backgrounds it's a much

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.939 
with defocused backgrounds it's a much
more<00:04:26.190> advanced<00:04:26.699> camera<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:27.840> build<00:04:28.080> our<00:04:28.349> second

this Xperia One style camera is on and

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.180 
this Xperia One style camera is on and
simply<00:04:50.070> by<00:04:50.310> touching<00:04:50.370> them<00:04:50.880> together<00:04:51.979> it<00:04:52.979> will

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
simply by touching them together it will

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.939 
simply by touching them together it will
launch<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:54.360> PlayMemories<00:04:54.720> app<00:04:55.110> directly<00:04:55.680> and

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
maintained just like the other model we

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.110 
maintained just like the other model we
have<00:06:08.520> a<00:06:09.320> spring-loaded<00:06:10.320> mount<00:06:10.880> so<00:06:11.880> we<00:06:11.970> can

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
have a spring-loaded mount so we can

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.440 
have a spring-loaded mount so we can
unfold<00:06:12.600> these<00:06:12.780> two<00:06:13.080> arms<00:06:13.500> here<00:06:13.890> and<00:06:14.450> then

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 
unfold these two arms here and then

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.180 
unfold these two arms here and then
simply<00:06:16.020> and<00:06:16.170> easily<00:06:16.380> attach<00:06:17.010> it<00:06:17.250> to<00:06:17.400> the<00:06:17.520> phone

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
simply and easily attach it to the phone

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.720 
simply and easily attach it to the phone
if<00:06:20.190> you'd<00:06:20.460> like<00:06:20.580> to<00:06:20.760> operate<00:06:21.180> them<00:06:21.330> together
