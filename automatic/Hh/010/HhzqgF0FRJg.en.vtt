located just down the street that we

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.680 
located just down the street that we
bring<00:01:04.430> natural<00:01:04.790> gas<00:01:04.940> into<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:05.330> front<00:01:05.570> our

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
bring natural gas into the front our

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.840 
bring natural gas into the front our
kept<00:01:06.080> going<00:01:06.320> to<00:01:06.560> wind<00:01:06.740> up<00:01:06.890> with<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:07.520> abundance

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
kept going to wind up with the abundance

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.400 
kept going to wind up with the abundance
of<00:01:07.940> natural<00:01:08.270> gas<00:01:08.390> we<00:01:08.660> could<00:01:08.870> have<00:01:09.020> down<00:01:09.230> here

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
of natural gas we could have down here

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.590 
of natural gas we could have down here
in<00:01:09.500> South<00:01:09.680> Texas<00:01:09.920> and<00:01:10.370> so<00:01:10.850> on<00:01:10.970> these<00:01:11.090> capstone

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
in South Texas and so on these capstone

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.720 
in South Texas and so on these capstone
with<00:01:11.870> a<00:01:11.900> no-brainer<00:01:12.410> it's<00:01:12.920> a<00:01:13.040> big<00:01:13.220> cost<00:01:13.460> saver

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
with a no-brainer it's a big cost saver

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.640 
with a no-brainer it's a big cost saver
what<00:01:14.150> we<00:01:14.270> supply<00:01:14.600> our<00:01:14.660> own<00:01:14.780> you<00:01:15.050> know<00:01:15.140> have<00:01:15.410> the

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
what we supply our own you know have the

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.380 
what we supply our own you know have the
grid<00:01:15.830> lines<00:01:16.130> coming<00:01:16.610> from<00:01:16.700> utility<00:01:17.210> power

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
grid lines coming from utility power

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.360 
grid lines coming from utility power
really<00:01:17.990> all<00:01:18.140> we<00:01:18.290> need<00:01:18.440> is<00:01:18.560> one<00:01:18.770> of<00:01:18.800> these<00:01:18.950> c1

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
really all we need is one of these c1

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.910 
really all we need is one of these c1
thousands<00:01:20.000> but<00:01:20.210> with<00:01:20.930> these<00:01:21.050> extra<00:01:21.440> units<00:01:21.770> it

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
thousands but with these extra units it

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.040 
thousands but with these extra units it
gives<00:01:22.070> us<00:01:22.190> plenty<00:01:22.310> of<00:01:22.520> flexibility<00:01:23.270> capstone

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
gives us plenty of flexibility capstone

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.080 
gives us plenty of flexibility capstone
has<00:01:24.500> a<00:01:24.830> way<00:01:24.950> that<00:01:25.160> you<00:01:25.280> can<00:01:25.430> run<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.790> unit

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
has a way that you can run the unit

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.280 
has a way that you can run the unit
where<00:01:26.270> you<00:01:26.360> could<00:01:26.480> put<00:01:26.600> them<00:01:26.660> in<00:01:26.780> called<00:01:27.200> a

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
where you could put them in called a

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.650 
where you could put them in called a
spinning<00:01:27.530> reserve<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:28.310> you<00:01:28.400> can<00:01:28.580> use<00:01:28.850> all<00:01:29.390> the

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
spinning reserve and you can use all the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.090 
spinning reserve and you can use all the
turbines<00:01:30.080> or<00:01:30.320> you<00:01:30.410> can<00:01:30.530> set<00:01:30.710> them<00:01:30.740> up<00:01:30.890> with<00:01:30.920> a

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
turbines or you can set them up with a

turbines or you can set them up with a
cycle<00:01:31.550> you<00:01:31.760> don't<00:01:32.150> get<00:01:32.240> so<00:01:32.390> much<00:01:32.510> run<00:01:32.720> time<00:01:32.900> on

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
cycle you don't get so much run time on

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.630 
cycle you don't get so much run time on
each<00:01:33.140> engine<00:01:33.380> it<00:01:33.860> run<00:01:34.040> one<00:01:34.220> engine<00:01:34.520> for<00:01:34.610> a

each engine it run one engine for a
hundred<00:01:34.910> hours<00:01:35.000> then<00:01:35.240> it'll<00:01:35.450> shut<00:01:35.570> down

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
hundred hours then it'll shut down

we<00:01:41.840> really<00:01:42.200> had<00:01:42.380> to<00:01:42.470> have<00:01:42.590> something<00:01:43.010> that<00:01:43.160> was

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
we really had to have something that was

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.950 
we really had to have something that was
environmentally<00:01:44.120> friendly<00:01:44.540> that<00:01:44.690> would<00:01:44.810> not

environmentally friendly that would not

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.290 
environmentally friendly that would not
impact<00:01:45.350> our<00:01:45.620> emissions<00:01:46.220> permit<00:01:46.700> enough<00:01:47.150> to

impact our emissions permit enough to
where<00:01:47.450> we<00:01:47.600> would<00:01:47.780> actually<00:01:47.930> have<00:01:48.260> to<00:01:48.380> endure

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800

production<00:01:49.310> of<00:01:49.400> that<00:01:49.520> facility<00:01:49.670> in

you<00:01:51.780> know<00:01:51.870> they're<00:01:52.050> clean<00:01:52.290> running<00:01:52.620> I<00:01:52.770> mean

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
you know they're clean running I mean

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.500 
you know they're clean running I mean
that's<00:01:53.250> why<00:01:53.370> we<00:01:53.490> chose<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.730> I<00:01:54.060> think<00:01:54.330> having

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
that's why we chose it I think having

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.090 
that's why we chose it I think having
something<00:01:54.810> with<00:01:55.020> green<00:01:55.260> energy<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.710> very

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
something with green energy is very

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.460 
something with green energy is very
appealing<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.820> think<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.210> shows<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.050> direction

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
appealing I think it shows the direction

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.170 
appealing I think it shows the direction
that<00:01:58.560> pioneers<00:01:58.980> headed<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.580> where<00:01:59.880> we<00:02:00.000> want

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
that pioneers headed and where we want

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.760 
that pioneers headed and where we want
to<00:02:00.240> be<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.480> the<00:02:00.570> future<00:02:00.720> these<00:02:01.230> units<00:02:01.620> were
