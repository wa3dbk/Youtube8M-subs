00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.370 

there<00:01:34.350> we<00:01:34.470> go

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
there we go

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.630 
there we go
this<00:01:37.380> would<00:01:37.560> be<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.890> first<00:01:38.100> video<00:01:38.250> I've<00:01:38.490> ever

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
this would be the first video I've ever

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.370 
this would be the first video I've ever
seen<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:39.240> someone<00:01:39.540> installing<00:01:40.049> one<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.200> these

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
seen of someone installing one of these

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.149 
seen of someone installing one of these
I've<00:01:41.130> seen<00:01:41.400> ones<00:01:41.640> with<00:01:41.790> them<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.060> there<00:01:42.920> but<00:01:43.920> no

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
I've seen ones with them on there but no

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.859 
I've seen ones with them on there but no
one<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.820> anybody<00:01:45.299> installing<00:01:46.100> or<00:01:47.659> putting<00:01:48.659> one

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
one of anybody installing or putting one

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.990 
one of anybody installing or putting one
on<00:01:49.700> to<00:01:50.700> say<00:01:52.369> take<00:01:53.369> off<00:01:53.549> this<00:01:53.880> right<00:01:54.090> here

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
on to say take off this right here

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.219 
on to say take off this right here
take<00:01:57.000> off<00:01:57.150> this<00:01:57.360> clamp<00:02:00.710> this<00:02:01.710> one's<00:02:02.010> a<00:02:03.229> seven

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
take off this clamp this one's a seven

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.260 
take off this clamp this one's a seven
millimeter<00:02:04.410> I<00:02:05.540> guess<00:02:07.850> that's<00:02:08.850> what<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.090> got

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
millimeter I guess that's what I got

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.780 
millimeter I guess that's what I got
that's<00:02:09.450> what<00:02:09.600> it's<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:10.250> so<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.280> guess<00:02:11.520> it's<00:02:11.730> a

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
that's what it's it so I guess it's a

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.630 
that's what it's it so I guess it's a
set<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.150> mill<00:02:13.340> push<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.550> on<00:02:14.730> down<00:02:16.250> then<00:02:17.250> I

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
set of the mill push that on down then I

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.000 
set of the mill push that on down then I
have<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.060> different<00:02:18.570> size<00:02:18.990> clamped<00:02:19.590> in<00:02:19.709> stock

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
have a different size clamped in stock

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:29.510 
have a different size clamped in stock
on<00:02:20.580> that<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:22.350> that<00:02:22.650> one<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:22.890> eight<00:02:28.070> take<00:02:29.070> this

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
on that so that one to eight take this

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.440 
on that so that one to eight take this
hall<00:02:30.440> then<00:02:31.440> let's<00:02:32.400> start<00:02:32.580> cutting<00:02:32.940> my<00:02:33.090> tube

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
hall then let's start cutting my tube

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.870 
hall then let's start cutting my tube
apart<00:02:35.120> measuring<00:02:36.380> cutting<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:38.459> that<00:02:38.640> big

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
apart measuring cutting it to that big

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.490 
apart measuring cutting it to that big
piece<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.300> fit<00:02:39.480> on<00:02:39.630> there<00:02:39.840> probably<00:02:40.290> going<00:02:40.440> to

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
piece to fit on there probably going to

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.820 
piece to fit on there probably going to
have<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.709> cut<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.520> right<00:02:41.820> here<00:02:42.500> this<00:02:43.500> piece

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
have to cut this right here this piece

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.979 
have to cut this right here this piece
right<00:02:44.010> here<00:02:44.070> I'm<00:02:44.430> probably<00:02:44.580> not<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.820> cut<00:02:45.150> for

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
right here I'm probably not the cut for

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.410 
right here I'm probably not the cut for
the<00:02:46.080> larger<00:02:46.410> diameter<00:02:46.590> pipe

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
the larger diameter pipe

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.530 
the larger diameter pipe
but<00:02:48.920> you<00:02:49.920> got<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.070> sacrifice<00:02:50.280> for<00:02:50.820> your<00:02:50.940> or<00:02:51.420> to

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
but you got to sacrifice for your or to

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.190 
but you got to sacrifice for your or to
have<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.660> bowl<00:02:52.050> fella<00:02:52.320> on<00:02:52.800> it<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.070> guess

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
have a bowl fella on it I guess

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.600 
have a bowl fella on it I guess
hoses<00:02:58.560> on<00:02:58.709> there<00:03:00.590> just<00:03:01.590> keep<00:03:01.860> loosening<00:03:02.430> this

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
hoses on there just keep loosening this

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.820 
hoses on there just keep loosening this
thing<00:03:05.390> wish<00:03:06.390> I<00:03:06.510> get<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.780> set<00:03:06.989> this<00:03:07.170> up<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.650> where
