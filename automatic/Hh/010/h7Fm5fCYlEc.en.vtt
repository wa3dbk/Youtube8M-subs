eg<00:01:06.760> trivia<00:01:07.030> they<00:01:07.210> came<00:01:07.420> to<00:01:07.630> us<00:01:07.660> about<00:01:07.900> four

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
eg trivia they came to us about four

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.680 
eg trivia they came to us about four
years<00:01:08.770> ago<00:01:08.920> looking<00:01:09.640> for<00:01:09.700> places<00:01:10.060> to<00:01:10.270> do<00:01:10.450> it<00:01:10.570> at

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
years ago looking for places to do it at

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.540 
years ago looking for places to do it at
they<00:01:10.900> thought<00:01:11.080> we'd<00:01:11.230> be<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.380> good<00:01:11.560> fit<00:01:11.770> so<00:01:12.130> we

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
they thought we'd be a good fit so we

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.980 
they thought we'd be a good fit so we
gave<00:01:12.670> it<00:01:12.730> a<00:01:12.880> shot<00:01:12.910> we<00:01:13.180> started<00:01:13.480> off<00:01:13.570> just<00:01:13.600> one

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
gave it a shot we started off just one

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.260 
gave it a shot we started off just one
day<00:01:14.140> a<00:01:14.170> week<00:01:14.260> and<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:15.250> demand<00:01:15.580> was<00:01:15.730> there<00:01:15.970> so

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
day a week and the demand was there so

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.000 
day a week and the demand was there so
we<00:01:16.450> added<00:01:16.690> a<00:01:16.960> second<00:01:17.350> that<00:01:17.530> was<00:01:17.620> about<00:01:17.800> four

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
we added a second that was about four

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.230 
we added a second that was about four
years<00:01:18.160> ago<00:01:18.280> and<00:01:18.520> that's<00:01:18.580> probably<00:01:18.940> one<00:01:19.090> of<00:01:19.120> the

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
years ago and that's probably one of the

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.120 
years ago and that's probably one of the
better<00:01:19.360> decisions<00:01:20.020> I<00:01:20.290> ever<00:01:20.320> made<00:01:20.500> we<00:01:20.950> brought

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
better decisions I ever made we brought

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.490 
better decisions I ever made we brought
in<00:01:21.250> about<00:01:21.550> nine<00:01:21.790> months<00:01:21.940> ago<00:01:22.120> roughly<00:01:22.500> started

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
in about nine months ago roughly started

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.890
