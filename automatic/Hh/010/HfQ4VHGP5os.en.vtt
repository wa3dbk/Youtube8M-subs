 Alani Carey is with great embarrassment that I am going to try telling about life 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.990
 of a person 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.979
 he lived there for 90 years 

00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:11.979
 35 minutes of nations 

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:16.970
 I go into paranoia when they ask me to give my curriculum vitae June 46 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.109
 call 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.489
 summarize the life of a person commenting lessons 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.429
 that monster of you 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.429
 and that publisher was born in 1817 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.929
 and therefore 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.929
 Keep the world square first 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.720
 and goethe died in the first communion 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:45.270
 only job 10,000 euros a month flight Naples to relate our - Naples 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.270
 - I heard about the death of ettore the same day in which 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:51.980
 I heard my pregnant wife our second hand 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.430
 but play breaks and amp was born only 14 days after birth 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.080
 director of the same zodiac sign 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.420
 although I feel I always feel very inspired by the figure dd this 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.120
 father of Italian 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.290
 I only met you physically twice in Italy 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.860
 the post in 1995 because I asked him to do the introduction 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.220
 to a black to a book I had written that was nothing but my thesis degree 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.820
 who had a title that evening 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.890
 about me watch this 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.759
 I imagined that I don't care about Rome creating a sottsass ector 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.570
 it was an extreme point of change in the field of culture 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.000
 so I thought that only by looking to the south 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.210
 there could have been a possible evolution 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.289
 fundamental black tear you out 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.080
 a preface 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.010
 I succeeded because then 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.890
 it was easy to person 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.260

 super an interview of which you will now see an excerpt 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.320
 for a television program 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.410
 I say this because despite 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.900
 I go back to saying I had always been inspired by his figure 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.519
 I never wanted to get close 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.609
 I believe it is 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:14.659
 that he never suggested to me that it is not good to approach his mistakes is 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:18.139
 as if it were almost necessary to leave them in the now altar 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:22.329
 because otherwise then 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.859
 sistesi supero nikon ends there is an old Anglo-Saxon saying that 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.819
 and no one is ever a hero for his butler ie 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.349
 to stay too close to people and then lose strength 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.749

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:46.600
 but father certainly not 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.389
 I tell you because rector 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.259
 he always said he would never want physi 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:55.949
 or perhaps a brother, but not even because he was a torero only son he was happy with 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:58.699
 be an only child 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:00.179
 maybe and I say 

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:04.139
 but also a concept of friendship as a ector was a bourgeois concept 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:09.529
 friends facebook + many friends say it's I do things I see people hated everything 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:12.089

 you can be afraid with today's games 

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:42.909
 because we are really used to being much more permanent 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:46.569
