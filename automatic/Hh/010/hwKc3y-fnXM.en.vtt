00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.090

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.700

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:33.539
 immediately connected so on ipad thanks to 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:36.800
 usb cable provided so there itunes is in 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.800
 train him up 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.490
 so here it starts with a 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.570
 synchronization so we're still going 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.790
 click here to access the options of 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.160
 synchronization and so for 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.130
 sync an ipad an iphone or a 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.540
 ipod touch wifi that is without 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.830
 need to connect it via the cable 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.260
 usb with your mac 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.860
 just here so long teeth them 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.600
 summaries and in the option part so 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.150
 do not hesitate to go down if you do not 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.380
 do not see options right away 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.250
 tick synchronized with this ipad 1 wifi 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.150
 Once again, these cochet you 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.150
 click apply 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:31.210
 and over done so here I can 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:33.920
 ejected the ipad and i'm going to leave itunes 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.690
 I'm also going branches and ipad 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.620
 i'm going to leave i tunes and you go 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:42.280
 see that he will reappear without art 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.280
 need to plug it in 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.869
 I restart y twins 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.270
 so he found me my two devices 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.610
 so here i only have to select ipad 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.360
 mini have the iphone to perform 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.990
 changes in the 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.000
 synchronization 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.180
 so here I will not need to 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.340
 connect the two devices to my mac with 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.130
 a cable he will use the connection 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.680
 wi-fi available between devices 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.430
 to synchronize the information so 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.980
 it will necessarily go a little more slowly 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.530
 only with the cable so you have to do 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.750
 proof of a little more patience 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.489
 if you want to appear as 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.980
 in version 10 daikin the bar 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.660
 side here just go in 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.239
 representation display the bar 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.310
 side is so there you see a little 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:45.290
 more clearly the two devices that 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.200
 are available for modifications and 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.670
 therefore to a new synchronization 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.340
 if you eject the devices since 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.000
 you do not think you have two 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.370
 changes to make 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.450
 they dream they can you eject them 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.989
 directly by clicking on the small 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.799
 arrow here and they will reappear as soon as 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.989
 you will launch new itunes 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.730
 so that was a little trick 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.829
 you would have been more my with the cables 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.959
 checked this little box so in the 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.060
 long teeth the summaries and in the 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.989
 options to sync your devices 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.489
 wireless 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.630
 here I wish you a good 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.630
