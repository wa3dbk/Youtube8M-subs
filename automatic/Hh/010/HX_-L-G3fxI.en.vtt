00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
so that's actually not so bad um I'm

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.140 
so that's actually not so bad um I'm
feeling<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.490> little<00:03:28.700> bit<00:03:28.820> more<00:03:28.970> optimistic

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
feeling a little bit more optimistic

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.140 
feeling a little bit more optimistic
about<00:03:29.630> this<00:03:29.870> as<00:03:30.110> we<00:03:30.260> go<00:03:30.590> through<00:03:30.800> this<00:03:31.150> that's

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
about this as we go through this that's

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.650 
about this as we go through this that's
not<00:03:32.450> so<00:03:32.690> so<00:03:33.380> bad<00:03:33.620> at<00:03:33.770> all<00:03:33.890> now<00:03:34.760> I<00:03:34.790> think<00:03:34.940> you

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
not so so bad at all now I think you

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.940 
not so so bad at all now I think you
have<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:35.840> wait<00:03:36.140> until<00:03:36.290> you<00:03:36.470> can<00:03:36.560> sell<00:03:36.770> another

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
have to wait until you can sell another

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.650 
have to wait until you can sell another
car<00:03:37.250> I<00:03:37.280> think<00:03:37.400> it's<00:03:37.640> like<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:37.790> 45<00:03:38.060> minute<00:03:38.450> wait

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
car I think it's like a 45 minute wait

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.940 
car I think it's like a 45 minute wait
so<00:03:38.840> I'm<00:03:38.930> not<00:03:39.020> going<00:03:39.170> to<00:03:39.230> go<00:03:39.350> back<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:39.590> bother

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
so I'm not going to go back and bother

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.990 
so I'm not going to go back and bother
selling<00:03:40.690> another<00:03:41.690> z-type<00:03:42.580> but<00:03:43.580> what<00:03:43.820> I<00:03:43.850> am

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000
