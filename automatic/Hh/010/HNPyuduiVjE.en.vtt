00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.059
 hello everyone and welcome to my 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.460
 channel today i want to share with you 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.480
 recipe honey mask for skin around 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.639
 eye 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.160
 This mask is well toned and 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.270
 tighten the skin composition and pretty 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.939
 just the first one i take one teaspoon 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.460
 honey I took lime honey and 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.390
 pre- melted it on water 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.320
 I will now need 1 bathhouse 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:38.690
 spoon of oatmeal 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:41.180
 obsessed I will add 5 milliliters of protein 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.250
 egg 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.620
 This is how this mask looks like if you 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.160
 want to apply it only to the skin around 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.190
 eye 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.480
 then you can reduce all servings exactly in 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.219
 two times I will put it on the t-zone 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.100
 so well just as not zero 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.559
 my skin went down and stretched and so did 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.020
 Of course , on the main purpose 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:09.570
 this is for the skin around the eyes 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:14.990
 I take a brush of the usual which I put 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:19.759
 usually masks and begin to distribute 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:23.509
 first on the skin around the eyes that mask I 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:26.549
 I will impose it in several layers 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:29.420
 wait for a little while 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:35.390
 one layer then do the next layer and 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.390
 so about not yet done five times 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.710
 chassis 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.260
 but 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.370
 spitz 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.360
 and 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.600
 not 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.380
 exactly 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.560
 I, as always, could not resist 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.440
 inflicted 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.200
 this mask all over our face and also ours 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.210
 because I really like masks with honey 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.400
 since they are actually very cool 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:33.660
 1 do not tone up they nourish and moisturize and 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.090
 open pores that is if in 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.240
 Further, for example, you want to clean 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.900
 somewhere some points black clean then 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.570
 the best option is to make a mask with 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.850
 honey with any absolutely honey she is good 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.090
 will allow it to open the pores well and in 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.860
 further you will use 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.880
 something like the same strips i want 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.840
 do for the nose 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.880
 it's just a super option after 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.840
 I will sit with no 15 minutes using 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.370
 I will remove the sponge and put it 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.990
 nourishing cream thank you all for 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.990
 view and bye bye
