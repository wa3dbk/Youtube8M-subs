00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.340
 hello my name is saying it 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.450
 said 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.959
 along the day 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:10.449
 in the pre-salt 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:12.119
 ef 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:13.110
 sochi russia 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.959
 he said 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:16.369
 militia 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:17.310
 in the city 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.390
 everyday 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.689
 Erico accepted this year 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:22.359
 at 10 o'clock 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:23.249
 therefore 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:24.099
 today 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.119
 this video was a fan of the genoa and sub-18 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.669
 more precisely on politicians 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.620
 predicting an increase in the normal level 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.520
 new form 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.390
 of marx ideas 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.070
 but who is now starting on the computer 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.850
 and turn in 2001 no word how to use the days here 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.690
 It all started with a joke. 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.370
 I at the time lito to buy land in relation to the rules 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.930
 my wife 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.250
 Virginia 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.300
 So go, I'll go to sleep. 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.300
 he usually owned an election 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.860
 and you have with the services put more 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.580
 the fire 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.010
 so why am I here? 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.290
 It's a certain way the fish won in the Senate 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.630
 natalie wood s 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.400
 and you can put 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.600
 your voice 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.870
 with a speech of some photographs 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.399
 these models day 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.510
 is the maximum 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.480
 if it is not fulfilled 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.450
 and with that career 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.700
 doing various categories I did 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.640
 I would come back 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.110
 the images 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.720
 after placing context 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.640
 hence he said something 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.640
 and this relation is 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.130
 the city hall layout complements 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.130
 company specific 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.609
 I started to rethink 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:05.430
 the details 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.800
 now there are several ways to release a little bigger 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.169
 there is form 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:13.679
 15% 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:15.189
 and there 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.670
 You already read the way you want to donate. 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:21.009
 what's up 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:25.119
 to the extent that you are winning the actors and lgn in brazil 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:27.139
 The informations 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:29.129
 what do you think it's necessary? 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.930
 after you do this 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:31.850
 the end of government 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.029
 at this moment 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:35.769
 will depend on the energy 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:36.969
 thus 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:39.749
 free 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:41.139
 winners 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.549
 are simpler models 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.339
 the probe of the mobile exxon and servitec election 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:50.090
 I'm not much of forensic science 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.629
 Yes it's true 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.260
 and then they formed 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.409
 that well placed goalkeeper 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.540
 so they end up no more 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.779
 times 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.210
 here are some proven pictures 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.909
 photograph 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.259
 11 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:06.999
 college colleagues 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:09.729
 the idea is that the program fava 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:11.849
 instead of the same way 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.039
 May 15 

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:16.649
 so here 

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:18.539
 does not exist 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:21.209
 the ability to produce energy 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.209
 requires a minimum of 20 stab wounds in the head 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.069
 at the time of day the same can be done 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.769
 the psi 20 follows session if your name is reimbursed 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.650
 and create history is engaged 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:45.319
 Do you have money, we want to dream about the Catalan title? 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.869
 He then told me about 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:52.369
 and continued with the images 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:53.769
 of the case 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.599
 also related 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.779
 in the alex sequence 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:58.649
 the image 

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:01.389
 processing process 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.079
 nassau other 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.079
 the years 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.899
 in the late afternoon 

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:08.439
 and the images 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:10.159
 then it's the turn of the presentation 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.199
 it has a hardcover 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:16.930
 which makes the material more resistant than the brazilian by 1 to 0 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.180
 with freedom 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.809
 a larger format 

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:24.599
 It's a 65 year old monologue. 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.700
 I got some information 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.710
 it's not the guidelines 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.110
 how the banks of the rs 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.330
 monteiro 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.370
 in lisbon in march 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.240
 for this Friday at the reception 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.360
 by the middle 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.180
 and I will support a recovery period in April 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:45.599
 good for her 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:50.270
 information and held and played as little or as little as possible. 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.059
 price occurs is that up to April
