blow up the shag Oh hot on the lab along

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.050 
blow up the shag Oh hot on the lab along
with<00:00:27.579> it<00:00:27.789> isn't<00:00:28.720> that<00:00:28.750> right<00:00:29.310> yeah<00:00:30.310> but

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
there's a trick to using it tell me

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:42.740 
there's a trick to using it tell me
about<00:00:33.820> it

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:01:01.439 

well<00:00:43.440> what<00:00:43.740> do<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.890> think

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.229 

the<00:01:02.260> Shagga<00:01:02.500> hogs<00:01:02.769> booster<00:01:03.190> unit<00:01:03.489> uses<00:01:03.879> liquid

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
the Shagga hogs booster unit uses liquid

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.200 
the Shagga hogs booster unit uses liquid
fuel<00:01:04.770> the<00:01:05.770> fuel<00:01:06.040> tanks<00:01:06.430> are<00:01:06.549> in<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.729> main<00:01:06.939> wing

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
fuel the fuel tanks are in the main wing

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.179 
fuel the fuel tanks are in the main wing
of<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.450> weapons<00:01:07.780> lab<00:01:08.020> in<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:08.439> hangar<00:01:08.770> housing

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 
of the weapons lab in the hangar housing

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.280 
of the weapons lab in the hangar housing
the<00:01:09.280> Shagga<00:01:09.520> hot<00:01:09.790> itself<00:01:10.180> so<00:01:10.750> I<00:01:10.780> should<00:01:11.080> blow

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
the Shagga hot itself so I should blow

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.859 
the Shagga hot itself so I should blow
up<00:01:11.409> the<00:01:11.530> tanks<00:01:12.009> that's<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.850> basic<00:01:13.180> idea<00:01:13.299> it

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
up the tanks that's the basic idea it

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.090 
up the tanks that's the basic idea it
should<00:01:14.170> be<00:01:14.320> enough<00:01:14.530> to<00:01:14.649> blow<00:01:14.830> up<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.070> entire

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
should be enough to blow up the entire

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.109 
should be enough to blow up the entire
hangar<00:01:16.530> there<00:01:17.530> are<00:01:17.649> four<00:01:18.009> fuel<00:01:18.369> tanks<00:01:18.820> in

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
hangar there are four fuel tanks in

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.719 
hangar there are four fuel tanks in
order<00:01:20.110> to<00:01:20.259> destroy<00:01:20.619> the<00:01:20.799> hangar<00:01:21.190> you'll<00:01:21.549> have

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
order to destroy the hangar you'll have

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.850 
order to destroy the hangar you'll have
to<00:01:21.880> set<00:01:22.119> explosives<00:01:22.509> on<00:01:22.930> each<00:01:23.200> of<00:01:23.409> those<00:01:23.530> tanks

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
to set explosives on each of those tanks

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.070 
to set explosives on each of those tanks
all<00:01:24.369> four<00:01:24.880> of<00:01:24.909> them<00:01:25.180> it<00:01:25.509> should<00:01:25.750> be<00:01:25.840> no<00:01:26.020> sweat

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
all four of them it should be no sweat

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
besides the scientists had the day off

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.440 
besides the scientists had the day off
today<00:01:29.680> so<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.610> hangar<00:01:30.909> is<00:01:30.970> completely

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
today so the hangar is completely

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.980
