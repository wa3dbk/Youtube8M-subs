out<00:00:51.000> people<00:00:51.180> first<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:52.079> got<00:00:52.289> your<00:00:52.890> area<00:00:53.280> you

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
out people first you got your area you

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.819 
out people first you got your area you
know<00:00:53.730> we're<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.840> eastern<00:00:55.260> coast<00:00:55.289> because

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
know we're on the eastern coast because

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.500 
know we're on the eastern coast because
we<00:00:56.100> don't<00:00:56.280> want<00:00:56.430> connection<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.030> be<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> problem

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
we don't want connection to be a problem

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.170 
we don't want connection to be a problem
if<00:00:57.840> one<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.680> us<00:00:58.739> has<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> bad<00:00:59.250> connection<00:00:59.550> all<00:00:59.969> of

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
if one of us has a bad connection all of

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.069 
if one of us has a bad connection all of
us<00:01:00.210> are<00:01:00.300> going<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.570> have<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> bad<00:01:00.899> connection

us are going to have a bad connection

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.210 
us are going to have a bad connection
thus<00:01:01.890> we<00:01:02.629> pretty<00:01:03.629> much<00:01:03.750> cannot<00:01:04.260> choose<00:01:04.920> as<00:01:05.100> a

the<00:02:44.190> wind<00:02:44.370> there<00:02:44.550> is<00:02:44.670> on<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:44.910> game<00:02:45.830> but<00:02:46.830> I'll

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
the wind there is on the game but I'll

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.560 
the wind there is on the game but I'll
really<00:02:47.190> do<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.520> lot<00:02:47.670> in<00:02:47.760> public<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:49.310> up<00:02:50.570> but

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
really do it a lot in public and up but

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.699 
really do it a lot in public and up but
that's<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.840> reason<00:02:52.170> we're<00:02:52.290> just<00:02:52.440> trying<00:02:52.650> to

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
that's the reason we're just trying to

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.250 
that's the reason we're just trying to
weed<00:02:52.860> people<00:02:53.070> out<00:02:53.310> because<00:02:54.270> even<00:02:54.810> with<00:02:55.050> that

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
weed people out because even with that

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.990 
weed people out because even with that
criteria<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.160> think<00:02:56.400> what<00:02:56.520> he<00:02:56.610> said<00:02:56.760> there's

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
criteria I think what he said there's

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.640 
criteria I think what he said there's
like<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.209> hundred<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.720> two<00:02:57.780> hundred<00:02:57.959> interests

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
like a hundred to two hundred interests

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.210 
like a hundred to two hundred interests
already<00:02:59.070> and<00:02:59.900> we<00:03:00.900> have<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.230> slowly<00:03:01.560> weed<00:03:01.920> those

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
already and we have to slowly weed those

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.720 
already and we have to slowly weed those
down<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:03.209> two<00:03:03.810> about<00:03:04.050> 30<00:03:04.680> or<00:03:04.920> so<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.370> then<00:03:05.459> we

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
down to two about 30 or so and then we

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.580 
down to two about 30 or so and then we
have<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:06.060> play<00:03:06.330> with<00:03:06.660> 30<00:03:06.930> different<00:03:07.170> people

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
have to play with 30 different people

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.510 
have to play with 30 different people

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
which is going to take two or three

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.970 
which is going to take two or three
weeks<00:03:08.989> because<00:03:09.989> you<00:03:10.230> can't<00:03:10.440> just<00:03:10.560> play<00:03:10.739> one<00:03:10.950> or

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
weeks because you can't just play one or

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.729 
weeks because you can't just play one or
two<00:03:11.100> games<00:03:11.520> to<00:03:12.239> weed<00:03:12.420> out<00:03:12.450> 30<00:03:12.870> people<00:03:13.350> and<00:03:13.530> see

to<00:03:52.290> do<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.590> same<00:03:52.769> thing<00:03:53.100> what<00:03:53.430> he<00:03:53.519> loves<00:03:53.760> the

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
to do the same thing what he loves the

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.539 
to do the same thing what he loves the
win<00:03:54.090> I<00:03:54.330> love<00:03:55.049> the<00:03:55.170> win<00:03:57.170> and<00:03:58.170> I<00:03:59.070> think<00:03:59.430> that

win I love the win and I think that

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.890 
win I love the win and I think that
pretty<00:03:59.730> much<00:03:59.790> answers<00:03:59.910> all<00:04:00.330> that<00:04:00.510> question

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
pretty much answers all that question

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.720 
pretty much answers all that question
that's<00:04:01.049> reason<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.680> criterias<00:04:02.340> there<00:04:02.489> mainly

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
that's reason the criterias there mainly

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.610 
that's reason the criterias there mainly
to<00:04:02.970> weed<00:04:03.180> down<00:04:03.390> people<00:04:03.840> because<00:04:04.140> we<00:04:04.260> can't<00:04:04.500> we

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
to weed down people because we can't we

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.340 
to weed down people because we can't we
don't<00:04:04.769> have<00:04:04.920> time<00:04:05.190> to<00:04:06.060> sit<00:04:06.269> here<00:04:06.510> even<00:04:07.019> if<00:04:07.170> even

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
don't have time to sit here even if even

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.940 
don't have time to sit here even if even
if<00:04:07.799> we<00:04:08.040> did<00:04:08.310> tryouts<00:04:08.850> you<00:04:09.299> know<00:04:09.530> ten<00:04:10.530> hours<00:04:10.890> a

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
if we did tryouts you know ten hours a

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.680 
if we did tryouts you know ten hours a
day<00:04:11.250> it<00:04:11.519> would<00:04:11.730> probably<00:04:11.880> take<00:04:12.030> two<00:04:12.329> months<00:04:12.570> to

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
day it would probably take two months to

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.240 
day it would probably take two months to
put<00:04:12.930> a<00:04:12.959> game<00:04:13.170> battle<00:04:13.410> together<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.829> team<00:04:14.010> just

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
put a game battle together the team just

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.159 
put a game battle together the team just
trying<00:04:14.610> everybody<00:04:15.060> how<00:04:15.269> wanted<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:15.690> try<00:04:15.959> out

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
trying everybody how wanted to try out

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.590 
trying everybody how wanted to try out
it's<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.070> same<00:04:17.280> thing<00:04:17.310> back<00:04:17.700> when<00:04:17.910> I<00:04:17.940> had<00:04:18.209> VR

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
it's the same thing back when I had VR

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.199 
it's the same thing back when I had VR
joker<00:04:19.079> doing<00:04:19.260> one-on-ones<00:04:19.950> he<00:04:20.160> did<00:04:20.340> over<00:04:20.579> 300

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
joker doing one-on-ones he did over 300

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.909 
joker doing one-on-ones he did over 300
10<00:04:21.419> ones<00:04:21.780> it<00:04:21.989> got<00:04:22.109> to<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:22.349> point<00:04:22.380> where<00:04:22.680> people

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
10 ones it got to the point where people

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.710 
10 ones it got to the point where people
that<00:04:23.070> couldn't<00:04:23.370> even<00:04:23.700> stand<00:04:23.910> up<00:04:24.120> against<00:04:24.570> him

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
that couldn't even stand up against him

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.960 
that couldn't even stand up against him
so<00:04:25.320> we<00:04:25.440> had<00:04:25.530> to<00:04:25.620> throw<00:04:25.800> criteria<00:04:26.460> on<00:04:26.580> that<00:04:26.760> as

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
so we had to throw criteria on that as

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.410 
so we had to throw criteria on that as
well

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420
