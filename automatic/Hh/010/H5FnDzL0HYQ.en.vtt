amongst the three or two of you I'd have
to<00:01:23.969> say<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.149> think<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.600> probably<00:01:25.049> better<00:01:25.259> with

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
to say I think it's probably better with

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:27.020 
to say I think it's probably better with
two<00:01:25.710> people<00:01:26.100> because<00:01:26.369> three<00:01:26.670> people<00:01:26.939> it

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
two people because three people it

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.179 
two people because three people it
becomes<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.509> little<00:01:28.020> bit<00:01:28.170> complicated<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
becomes a little bit complicated and the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.590 
becomes a little bit complicated and the
experience<00:01:29.670> gets<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.909> little<00:01:30.090> bit<00:01:30.270> watered

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
experience gets a little bit watered

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.330 
experience gets a little bit watered
down<00:01:30.750> as<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.320> have<00:01:31.500> less<00:01:31.740> control<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.280> to

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
down as you have less control so to
