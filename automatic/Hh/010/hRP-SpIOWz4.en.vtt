00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
it's kind of like a replacement for the

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.849 
it's kind of like a replacement for the
official<00:00:18.270> bumper<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.930> it's<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.560> cheaper

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
official bumper and it's a cheaper

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
version and also in some aspects it's

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.560 
version and also in some aspects it's
probably<00:00:23.039> nicer<00:00:23.340> version<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:24.000> for<00:00:24.180> official

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570
