yeah<00:00:00.240> that's<00:00:00.450> better<00:00:03.890> next<00:00:04.890> go<00:00:05.040> in<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.279> front

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
yeah that's better next go in the front

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.370 
yeah that's better next go in the front
view<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.970> add<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:07.730> cylinder<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:09.200> just<00:00:10.200> choose

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
view and add a cylinder and just choose

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.740 
view and add a cylinder and just choose
okay<00:00:10.740> you<00:00:10.980> don't<00:00:11.070> need<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.570> mess<00:00:12.570> with<00:00:12.690> that

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
okay you don't need to mess with that

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.240 
okay you don't need to mess with that
too<00:00:13.019> much<00:00:15.109> make<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.199> about<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.619> size<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.160> you

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
too much make it about that size and you

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.279 
too much make it about that size and you
can<00:00:17.279> turn<00:00:17.640> off<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:18.090> for<00:00:18.900> now<00:00:21.289> you'll

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
can turn off that for now you'll

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.089 
can turn off that for now you'll
probably<00:00:22.410> want<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:23.390> make<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.570> about<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.920> size

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
probably want to make it about the size

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:36.139 
probably want to make it about the size
of<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.490> handle<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.029> lengths<00:00:34.880> let's<00:00:35.880> squish

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
of the handle and lengths let's squish

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:49.240 
of the handle and lengths let's squish
it<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.420> little<00:00:36.600> bit

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:57.310 

seems<00:00:50.250> like<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> good<00:00:50.670> size

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.380 

then<00:00:58.100> what<00:00:58.280> you<00:00:58.370> want<00:00:58.520> to<00:00:58.579> do<00:00:58.730> is<00:00:58.910> go<00:00:59.090> into<00:00:59.210> line

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
then what you want to do is go into line

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.000 
then what you want to do is go into line
select<00:00:59.750> mode<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:00.200> select<00:01:00.320> all<00:01:00.590> these<00:01:00.739> lines

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
select mode and select all these lines

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.580 
select mode and select all these lines
but<00:01:01.640> not<00:01:01.790> the<00:01:01.970> edges<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:05.020> click<00:01:06.020> subdivide

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
but not the edges and click subdivide

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.130 
but not the edges and click subdivide
you<00:01:07.430> should<00:01:07.640> get<00:01:07.790> a<00:01:07.820> line<00:01:08.000> in<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:08.240> center<00:01:11.140> do

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
you should get a line in the center do

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.630 
you should get a line in the center do
it<00:01:12.260> again<00:01:14.560> except<00:01:15.560> now<00:01:15.740> select<00:01:16.070> just<00:01:16.430> these

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
it again except now select just these

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.859 
it again except now select just these
lines<00:01:17.350> and<00:01:18.350> move<00:01:18.530> them<00:01:18.770> apart<00:01:22.390> right<00:01:23.390> so<00:01:23.720> it

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
lines and move them apart right so it

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:32.440 
lines and move them apart right so it
lines<00:01:24.140> up<00:01:24.500> right<00:01:24.770> about<00:01:25.040> there<00:01:31.030> this<00:01:32.030> center

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
lines up right about there this center

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.350 
lines up right about there this center
line<00:01:33.100> can<00:01:34.100> be<00:01:34.190> scaled<00:01:34.460> out<00:01:34.820> a<00:01:34.880> little<00:01:35.180> bit<00:01:35.420> so

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
line can be scaled out a little bit so

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.510 
line can be scaled out a little bit so
can<00:01:38.360> this<00:01:38.479> one<00:01:40.690> but<00:01:41.690> only<00:01:42.050> in<00:01:42.229> only<00:01:42.800> in<00:01:43.280> one

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
can this one but only in only in one

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.999 
can this one but only in only in one
direction<00:01:43.670> so<00:01:44.149> it<00:01:44.270> doesn't<00:01:44.570> get<00:01:44.750> thicker<00:01:45.080> up

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
direction so it doesn't get thicker up

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.999 
direction so it doesn't get thicker up
and<00:01:46.310> down<00:01:46.460> only<00:01:46.820> left<00:01:47.390> and<00:01:47.600> right<00:01:48.050> from<00:01:48.979> the

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
and down only left and right from the

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.279 
and down only left and right from the
top<00:01:49.220> view<00:01:50.440> this<00:01:51.440> I<00:01:51.920> would<00:01:52.789> scale<00:01:53.090> it<00:01:53.240> to<00:01:54.080> match

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
top view this I would scale it to match

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:01.090 
top view this I would scale it to match
up<00:01:54.530> with<00:01:54.680> it<00:01:54.860> pretty<00:01:55.070> well<00:01:59.800> then<00:02:00.800> I<00:02:00.920> would<00:02:01.070> just

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
up with it pretty well then I would just

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.310 
up with it pretty well then I would just
do<00:02:01.340> an<00:02:01.460> extrude<00:02:01.790> and<00:02:02.140> Merchant<00:02:03.140> Center<00:02:05.320> so

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
do an extrude and Merchant Center so

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:20.260 
do an extrude and Merchant Center so
there<00:02:06.650> aren't<00:02:07.040> as<00:02:07.130> many<00:02:07.159> hard<00:02:07.610> edges

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:37.350 

make<00:02:20.810> sure<00:02:20.990> you<00:02:21.110> set<00:02:21.290> up<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.500> smooth

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.200 

I<00:02:37.450> think<00:02:38.200> at<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.440> ends<00:02:38.830> I<00:02:38.980> would<00:02:39.190> scale<00:02:40.030> it

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
I think at the ends I would scale it

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:49.530 
I think at the ends I would scale it
down<00:02:40.240> a<00:02:40.360> bit

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.670 

again<00:02:50.349> I'm<00:02:50.470> not<00:02:50.590> doing<00:02:50.830> this<00:02:50.980> perfectly<00:02:52.680> just

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
again I'm not doing this perfectly just

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:01.920 
again I'm not doing this perfectly just
a<00:02:53.769> general<00:02:54.129> idea<00:03:00.060> you'll<00:03:01.060> want<00:03:01.299> to<00:03:01.390> separate

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
a general idea you'll want to separate

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.710 
a general idea you'll want to separate
these<00:03:02.230> vertices<00:03:02.799> with<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.760> white<00:03:03.939> key

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
these vertices with the white key

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.899 
these vertices with the white key
I<00:03:06.840> would<00:03:07.840> also<00:03:07.989> select<00:03:08.440> these<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:09.159> separate

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 
I would also select these and separate

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:20.930 
I would also select these and separate
those

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.010 

go<00:03:21.720> back<00:03:21.900> into<00:03:22.170> front<00:03:23.100> view<00:03:23.400> again<00:03:24.020> they're

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
go back into front view again they're

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.150 
go back into front view again they're
actually<00:03:25.320> going<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.620> top<00:03:25.800> view<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:28.160> don't

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
actually going the top view and don't

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.520 
actually going the top view and don't
move<00:03:29.250> your<00:03:29.430> cursor<00:03:29.610> if<00:03:30.270> it<00:03:30.450> does<00:03:30.630> accidentally

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
move your cursor if it does accidentally

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.700 
move your cursor if it does accidentally
get<00:03:31.650> off<00:03:31.740> you<00:03:31.920> can<00:03:32.070> press<00:03:32.280> shift<00:03:32.520> C<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.710> that

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
get off you can press shift C and that

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.370 
get off you can press shift C and that
will<00:03:34.830> Center<00:03:35.160> everything<00:03:35.400> on<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.700> screen<00:03:36.380> but

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
will Center everything on the screen but

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:44.330 
will Center everything on the screen but
add<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.620> Taurus<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:42.470> you<00:03:43.470> can<00:03:43.620> experiment<00:03:43.980> with

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
add a Taurus and you can experiment with

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.240 
add a Taurus and you can experiment with
the<00:03:45.050> settings<00:03:46.050> of<00:03:46.410> it<00:03:46.560> but<00:03:46.770> for<00:03:46.950> now<00:03:47.070> I'll<00:03:47.220> just

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
the settings of it but for now I'll just

00:03:47.250 --> 00:04:26.680 
the settings of it but for now I'll just
use<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.760> default

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:53.810 

now

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:24.010 

stop

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.520 

and<00:05:24.530> set<00:05:24.830> it<00:05:24.920> to<00:05:24.950> smooth<00:05:25.250> and<00:05:26.260> that's<00:05:27.260> kind<00:05:27.470> of

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
and set it to smooth and that's kind of

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:34.810 
and set it to smooth and that's kind of
ridiculous<00:05:27.860> looking<00:05:32.350> so<00:05:33.640> you'll<00:05:34.640> definitely

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
ridiculous looking so you'll definitely

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:41.980 
ridiculous looking so you'll definitely
want<00:05:35.300> to<00:05:35.360> mess<00:05:35.600> with<00:05:35.630> the<00:05:35.870> settings<00:05:36.020> I<00:05:40.990> would

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
want to mess with the settings I would

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.410 
want to mess with the settings I would
turn<00:05:42.170> them<00:05:42.350> my<00:05:42.620> the<00:05:43.100> minor<00:05:43.310> rated<00:05:43.640> radius<00:05:44.210> up

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.420 
turn them my the minor rated radius up

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:51.640 
turn them my the minor rated radius up
to<00:05:44.570> about<00:05:47.620> 0.28<00:05:48.620> and<00:05:49.520> the<00:05:50.480> major<00:05:50.690> radius<00:05:51.170> up<00:05:51.470> to

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
to about 0.28 and the major radius up to

00:05:51.650 --> 00:06:20.040 
to about 0.28 and the major radius up to
about<00:05:52.090> 1.3<00:05:55.510> 0.8
