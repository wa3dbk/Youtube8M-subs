 Translator: Helena Bedalli Reviewer: Besnik Bleta 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:14.797
 It will be in these moments 

00:00:14.797 --> 00:00:17.539
 any aspiring teacher 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.190
 who is working on a 60 page article, 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.700
 based on any old theory of education, 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.893
 designed by a professor who does not live anymore, 

00:00:28.893 --> 00:00:31.611
 wondering what the connection is 

00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:33.251
 with which it is being taken 

00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:35.779
 with what he wants to achieve, 

00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:38.005
 that is to become a teacher, 

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:42.119
 change lives, and give sparks of magic. 

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:47.003
 There will be at this moment any aspiring teacher, 

00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:48.959
 in any educational institution, 

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:51.967
 contemplating a professor who just leans 

00:00:51.967 --> 00:00:54.091
 in the least attractive way possible 

00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:59.265
 about attracting students. 

00:00:59.265 --> 00:01:00.915
 There will be at this moment 

00:01:00.915 --> 00:01:03.114
 any teacher in the first year of work 

00:01:03.114 --> 00:01:05.666
 absorbed in the curriculum 

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.996
 striving to give meaning to the standards, 

00:01:07.996 --> 00:01:11.186
 which is trying to give meaning to the proper assessment of students, 

00:01:11.186 --> 00:01:12.825
 while repeating itself 

00:01:12.825 --> 00:01:15.039
 without vacation, 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:16.997
 "Do not smile by November," 

00:01:16.997 --> 00:01:19.080
 for so they had learned it 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.102
 during his educational program. 

00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:24.958
 There will be a pupil at this moment 

00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.642
 who is inventing a way 

00:01:26.642 --> 00:01:29.130
 to convince a mother or a father 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.638
 that is very, very sick 

00:01:30.638 --> 00:01:34.511
 and that he can not go to school tomorrow. 

00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:36.260
 On the other hand, now 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.009
 there are wonderful educators 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.758
 who share information with others, 

00:01:39.758 --> 00:01:41.532
 information that is so divisive with others 

00:01:41.532 --> 00:01:44.179
 that the students, sitting in banks, 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.682
 expect to be amazed to fall 

00:01:48.682 --> 00:01:51.267
 even a drop of sweat from the face of this person 

00:01:51.267 --> 00:01:54.312
 so that they may absorb all that knowledge. 

00:01:54.312 --> 00:01:58.030
 There will be somewhere a person 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.391
 which has caught the attention of the public, 

00:02:01.391 --> 00:02:04.283
 a person who is stripping a powerful narrative 

00:02:04.283 --> 00:02:05.959
 around a world 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.514
 which, people who hear, 

00:02:07.514 --> 00:02:09.880
 they have never imagined or seen before, 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.398
 but if you close your eyes tightly, 

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:14.037
 can imagine that world, 

00:02:14.037 --> 00:02:18.032
 because the story is so convincing. 

00:02:18.032 --> 00:02:21.170
 There will be a person who can tell the public 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.074
 raise your hands up 

00:02:23.074 --> 00:02:24.724
 and they shall remain so until he says to them, 

00:02:24.724 --> 00:02:26.468
 "Get your hands off." 

00:02:26.468 --> 00:02:28.136
 Get it now. 

00:02:28.136 --> 00:02:29.540
 People will then say, 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.403
 "Chris, you describe the person 

00:02:32.403 --> 00:02:34.427
 who is doing some mischievous training courses, 

00:02:34.427 --> 00:02:36.960
 but at the same time describe powerful educators as well. 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.494
 If you are talking about the world of education, 

00:02:38.494 --> 00:02:40.092
 or that of urban education in particular, 

00:02:40.092 --> 00:02:42.138
 these people will neutralize each other, 

00:02:42.138 --> 00:02:44.384
 and here we are left. " 

00:02:44.384 --> 00:02:46.886
 The truth is, people I described 

00:02:46.886 --> 00:02:48.602
 as a master of teaching, 

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:50.939
 as a master of knitting the narrative, 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:52.890
 as a master of confession 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.488
 have long since departed from the classrooms. 

00:02:56.488 --> 00:02:58.870
 People who have the skills of teaching 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.192
 and attracting the listener 

00:03:00.192 --> 00:03:03.112
 nor have any idea what the teacher's certification means. 

00:03:03.112 --> 00:03:05.174
 It does not matter whether they are graduates 

00:03:05.174 --> 00:03:08.435
 go, to pretend 

00:03:08.435 --> 00:03:10.739
 that they have some education. 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.471
 And this is painful for me. 

00:03:12.471 --> 00:03:15.470
 It is sorrowful because the people I described, 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.237
 it does not interest the learning process, 

00:03:18.237 --> 00:03:20.095
 want to be effective teachers, 

00:03:20.095 --> 00:03:21.447
 but they do not have an example. 

00:03:21.447 --> 00:03:23.192
 I'm paraphrasing Mark Twain. 

00:03:23.192 --> 00:03:25.722
 Mark Twain says that proper preparation, 

00:03:25.722 --> 00:03:27.122
 or teaching, 

00:03:27.122 --> 00:03:30.738
 is so powerful that it transforms evil morality into good, 

00:03:30.738 --> 00:03:33.410
 fraudulent practices in the power of attorney, 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.994
 can change people and transform them 

00:03:35.994 --> 00:03:38.595
 in angels. 

00:03:38.595 --> 00:03:40.898
 The people I described earlier 

00:03:40.898 --> 00:03:42.888
 proper preparation for teaching did not take, 

00:03:42.888 --> 00:03:44.972
 in any college or university, 

00:03:44.972 --> 00:03:48.967
 but simply being in the same space with those who inspire. 

00:03:48.967 --> 00:03:51.210
 Find out where these are! 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.276
 At the barber shop, 

00:03:53.276 --> 00:03:56.464
 in repertory concerts and, most importantly, 

00:03:56.464 --> 00:03:58.112
 in black churches. 

00:03:58.112 --> 00:04:01.031
 I am concerned with the idea of ​​this idea called Pedagogy of Pentecost. 

00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:03.341
 Who among you was in the black church? 

00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:05.650
 I see some hands raised. 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.013
 If you go to the black church, 

00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:08.624
 their preacher begins, 

00:04:08.624 --> 00:04:11.510
 but he understands that he should engage listeners, 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.356
 so it starts with a play like word game 

00:04:13.356 --> 00:04:15.040
 many times, at first, 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.858
 then makes a stop, 

00:04:16.858 --> 00:04:19.039
 and he thinks, "Lord, they have no mind here." 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:20.640
 So he says, "Can you do mine?" 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.626
 Public: Amin. 

00:04:21.626 --> 00:04:23.925
 Chris Emdin: Do not you do me an amish? Public: Amin. 

00:04:23.925 --> 00:04:27.257
 CE: And, unexpectedly, everyone is re-established. 

00:04:27.257 --> 00:04:29.317
 The preacher raises his voice to draw attention. 

00:04:29.317 --> 00:04:31.978
 Then he lowers his voice, as hearsay, 

00:04:31.978 --> 00:04:33.851
 whenever people want to concentrate on it, 

00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:36.108
 and these are the skills we need 

00:04:36.108 --> 00:04:38.183
 for the most engaging teachers. 

00:04:38.183 --> 00:04:39.621
 So why educate teachers 

00:04:39.621 --> 00:04:41.694
 gives theory and theory only, 

00:04:41.694 --> 00:04:43.930
 speaks about standards and tells you all 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.874
 these things that have nothing to do 

00:04:45.874 --> 00:04:49.190
 with basic skills, the magic you need 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.159
 to attract the public, to attract a student? 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:55.177
 So, I say we have to reformulate the education of teachers, 

00:04:55.177 --> 00:04:57.962
 so that we can focus on content, yes, 

00:04:57.962 --> 00:05:00.268
 to focus on theory, yes, for this, 

00:05:00.268 --> 00:05:01.839
 but content and theory, 

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:04.443
 in the absence of the magical 

00:05:04.443 --> 00:05:07.354
 in teaching and learning, are not valid. 

00:05:07.354 --> 00:05:10.109
 People often say, "The magic is simply magical." 

00:05:10.109 --> 00:05:11.490
 There are teachers who, 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.954
 despite all the challenges, they have these skills, 

00:05:13.954 --> 00:05:16.675
 enter these schools and are able to attract listeners, 

00:05:16.675 --> 00:05:17.969
 and the leader approaches and says, 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:20.897
 "How good is it, if it were all of my teachers so capable." 

00:05:20.897 --> 00:05:22.940
 And when they try to describe where the work is going, 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.170
 to say, "There is something magical ..." 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.432
 I'm here to tell you that 

00:05:26.432 --> 00:05:28.890
 this magical can be taught. 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.237
 The magic can be taught. 

00:05:31.237 --> 00:05:34.049
 The magic can be taught. 

00:05:34.049 --> 00:05:35.580
 How can they be taught? 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.251
 You teach them by allowing people 

00:05:37.251 --> 00:05:38.656
 to attend those places 

00:05:38.656 --> 00:05:40.258
 where the enchantment is tangible. 

00:05:40.258 --> 00:05:42.990
 If you want to be an aspirant teacher for urban education, 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.272
 you have to abandon the university's limitations 

00:05:45.272 --> 00:05:47.030
 and go to the neighborhood. 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.140
 You have to go and spend some time with the barber, 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.522
 to go to the black church, 

00:05:50.522 --> 00:05:51.977
 you should see these people 

00:05:51.977 --> 00:05:53.780
 who have the ability to attract 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.560
 and keep track of what they are doing. 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.560
 In the time of teacher preparation, at my university, 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.954
 I started a project where every student 

00:06:00.954 --> 00:06:05.546
 who attends, sits and watches repertoire concerts. 

00:06:05.546 --> 00:06:07.769
 Watch the way the rappers move, 

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:09.302
 as they speak with their hands. 

00:06:09.302 --> 00:06:12.282
 Study the way they walk proudly on the stage 

00:06:12.282 --> 00:06:14.488
 Listen to their metaphors and their analogies 

00:06:14.488 --> 00:06:16.100
 and start learning these little things 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.900
 that, if practiced enough, 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.589
 become the key to the magical. 

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:21.850
 Learn that if you hold your eyes 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.353
 a student and raise a little eyebrow, 

00:06:24.353 --> 00:06:25.820
 there is no need for words 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.393
 because they know that it means you want more of them. 

00:06:29.393 --> 00:06:31.848
 If we can transform teacher education, 

00:06:31.848 --> 00:06:34.110
 to focus on teacher learning 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.063
 how to create it magical 

00:06:36.063 --> 00:06:39.860
 then, fap! we can resurrect the dead classes, 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.574
 we can give the spark to the imagination, 

00:06:41.574 --> 00:06:43.290
 and change education. 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.384
 Thank you. 

00:06:46.384 --> 00:06:49.223
 (Applause)
