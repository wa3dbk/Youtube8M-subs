lysosomes<00:04:32.880> are<00:04:33.120> a<00:04:33.210> special<00:04:34.140> type<00:04:34.170> of<00:04:34.380> vacuole

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
lysosomes are a special type of vacuole

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.600 
lysosomes are a special type of vacuole
these<00:04:35.520> contain<00:04:35.940> digestive<00:04:36.780> enzymes<00:04:37.280> so<00:04:38.280> if

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
these contain digestive enzymes so if

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.870 
these contain digestive enzymes so if
you<00:04:39.000> were<00:04:39.300> to<00:04:39.360> bust<00:04:40.020> open<00:04:40.230> a<00:04:40.680> lysosome<00:04:41.250> within

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
you were to bust open a lysosome within

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.630 
you were to bust open a lysosome within
the<00:04:42.000> cell<00:04:42.240> it<00:04:42.480> would<00:04:42.990> destroy<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:44.100> cell<00:04:44.340> it

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
the cell it would destroy the cell it

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.960 
the cell it would destroy the cell it
would<00:04:44.820> eat<00:04:45.030> the<00:04:45.240> cell<00:04:45.420> alive<00:04:45.780> basically

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
would eat the cell alive basically

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
would eat the cell alive basically
lysosomes<00:04:47.970> are<00:04:48.120> different<00:04:48.480> because<00:04:48.570> they

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
lysosomes are different because they

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.070 
lysosomes are different because they
have<00:04:49.230> not<00:04:49.560> won<00:04:49.820> membrane<00:04:50.820> but<00:04:51.120> two<00:04:51.420> membranes

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
have not won membrane but two membranes

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.340 
have not won membrane but two membranes
so<00:04:52.920> two<00:04:53.240> phospholipid<00:04:54.240> bilayers<00:04:54.750> instead<00:04:55.230> of

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
so two phospholipid bilayers instead of

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.580 
so two phospholipid bilayers instead of
just<00:04:55.470> one<00:04:56.480> next<00:04:57.480> we<00:04:57.600> have<00:04:57.750> peroxisomes

organisms<00:07:01.470> that<00:07:01.770> are<00:07:01.920> capable<00:07:02.160> of

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:02.640 
organisms that are capable of

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.840 
organisms that are capable of
photosynthesis<00:07:03.600> you<00:07:04.590> have<00:07:04.770> Luca<00:07:05.220> plast<00:07:05.520> or

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:05.850 
photosynthesis you have Luca plast or

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.960 
photosynthesis you have Luca plast or
amyloplasts<00:07:06.510> that<00:07:07.410> store<00:07:07.740> a<00:07:08.040> molecule<00:07:08.520> called

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:08.970 
amyloplasts that store a molecule called

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.130 
amyloplasts that store a molecule called
starch<00:07:09.980> chromic<00:07:10.980> last<00:07:11.220> store<00:07:11.820> pigments<00:07:12.480> which

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:13.140 
starch chromic last store pigments which

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.880 
starch chromic last store pigments which
are<00:07:13.470> involved<00:07:14.130> with<00:07:14.400> color<00:07:15.890> different

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:16.890 
are involved with color different

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.620 
are involved with color different
pigments<00:07:17.040> produce<00:07:17.580> different<00:07:17.880> colors<00:07:18.300> red

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:18.630 
pigments produce different colors red

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.410 
pigments produce different colors red
white<00:07:18.660> green<00:07:19.200> blue<00:07:19.860> what<00:07:20.340> have<00:07:20.520> you<00:07:20.550> and<00:07:20.880> then

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:21.420 
white green blue what have you and then

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.420 
white green blue what have you and then
you<00:07:21.510> have<00:07:21.690> chloroplasts<00:07:22.530> which<00:07:22.650> contain<00:07:23.280> the

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:23.430 
you have chloroplasts which contain the

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.700 
you have chloroplasts which contain the
molecule<00:07:23.910> chlorophyll<00:07:24.630> and<00:07:24.870> these<00:07:25.320> are<00:07:25.590> the

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:25.710 
molecule chlorophyll and these are the

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.940 
molecule chlorophyll and these are the
sites<00:07:25.950> of<00:07:26.100> photosynthesis<00:07:27.060> and<00:07:27.680> finally<00:07:28.680> we

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:28.950 
sites of photosynthesis and finally we

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.580 
sites of photosynthesis and finally we
have<00:07:29.190> organelles<00:07:29.910> called<00:07:30.120> centrioles<00:07:30.870> which

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:31.590 
have organelles called centrioles which

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.190 
have organelles called centrioles which
are<00:07:31.770> involved<00:07:32.160> in<00:07:32.370> cell<00:07:32.670> division<00:07:33.120> you<00:07:33.780> really

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:34.200 
are involved in cell division you really

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.880 
are involved in cell division you really
only<00:07:34.380> find<00:07:34.710> these<00:07:34.890> in<00:07:34.920> animal<00:07:35.460> cells<00:07:36.620> but<00:07:37.620> this

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:37.890 
only find these in animal cells but this

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.040 
only find these in animal cells but this
is<00:07:38.070> all<00:07:38.220> I<00:07:38.250> have<00:07:38.550> for<00:07:38.790> cellular<00:07:39.450> structures<00:07:39.870> in

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.050 
is all I have for cellular structures in

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.830 
is all I have for cellular structures in
my<00:07:40.890> next<00:07:41.280> two<00:07:41.520> videos<00:07:41.730> i'll<00:07:42.240> be<00:07:42.420> going<00:07:42.720> over

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 
my next two videos i'll be going over

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.290 
my next two videos i'll be going over
the<00:07:43.140> differences<00:07:43.740> between<00:07:43.770> plant<00:07:44.700> and<00:07:44.940> animal

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:45.300 
the differences between plant and animal

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.180 
the differences between plant and animal
cells<00:07:45.720> i'll<00:07:46.470> show<00:07:46.530> you<00:07:46.680> pictures<00:07:47.160> of

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:47.190 
cells i'll show you pictures of

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.520 
cells i'll show you pictures of
everything<00:07:47.790> so<00:07:48.420> hopefully<00:07:49.080> it'll<00:07:49.230> make<00:07:49.380> it<00:07:49.500> a

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:49.530 
everything so hopefully it'll make it a

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.430 
everything so hopefully it'll make it a
little<00:07:49.830> bit<00:07:49.980> more<00:07:50.130> sense
