00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:03.100
 accepted as we have mentioned 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.880
 a typical replica 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.410
 by proposing that the whole psyche is formed by actions of action 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.019
 internalized 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.759
 that are externalized in any material working 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.449
 transforming 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:17.689
 what relationship 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.589
 we could establish increments as dissimilar as they are 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.199
 some psychic structures 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:25.960
 and see it 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.539
 we proposed then that the work of art were projection and are morose 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:32.970
 or with more precision 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.100
 omo morfa 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.740
 of the structures of the artist in the work 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.740
 which would fall in the xerez and miku in structural terms 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.510
 so that better revelation actor is understood 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.510
 we would present it by means of pediatricians 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.470
 in this graphic 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.720
 we represent the sets by two or ovals 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.649
 the elements inside 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:59.350
 by two points in each of them the lines represent relationships between 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.420
 The elements 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.199
 we have defined with elements and injuries 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:04.649
 2 structures 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:08.459
 we relate the elements of the two structures with red lines 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.039
 when we relate now 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:13.770
 the relationships of both structures 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.240
 we have defined graphically 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.090
 the notion this physical humor 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.450
 we can point 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.640
 as a curious fact that the notion of somo racism 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.500
 does not require that elements with relationships 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.500
 feel the same nature we could say then 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.320
 that if the first flight represents the author and the second to the work 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.780
 both of them 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.170
 authors and works 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.210
 sony are delinquent in their structures 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.790
 so we have intervened likewise 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.510
 to the viewer within this scheme which we assumed 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.179
 a psyche of internalized actions 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:49.950
 and therefore structural 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.340
 similar 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.619
 there the actress 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.259
 we introduce now 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.439
 a third structure that we call spectator we relate in 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:00.610
 this moment 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.140
 the state elements this structure with the elements of the previous ones and 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.240
 later the relations themselves structures of the artist 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.179
 are projected onto the work of art 

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:14.499
 and cataracts 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:17.819
 because similar structures that the viewer has 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.239
 there is therefore a relation of that morcillo mo that guarantees the 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.790
 intersubjectivity the objective to arrive therefore of the work of art a 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:29.889
 objectivity 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:32.519
 structural that goes through 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.199
 similarly 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:38.639
 artist o'grady viewer introduce into the theory 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.299
 the notion of structure 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.829
 allows us to say things that we could not say before 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:45.860
 We can see 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.230
 the structural relationship in addition between the notes written in a month pentagram 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:53.480
 hands 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.909
 that touch the corresponding keys 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.169
 to the notes of the staff 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.109
 if we remove from the pianist 4% 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.989
 the movement of the keys and the hammer blow on the strings 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.250
 the dimension that has 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.969
 the fun that is transmitted between the strings to the air 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:13.249
 and that finally arrives 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:17.199
 to a recorder the edison recorder 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:21.339
 where a barb 

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:23.560
 deepening his master 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.729
 in some wax cylinders that gillard 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:28.599
 later 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.090
 these and others 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.449
 are picked up again by a pubalgia 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.589
 play the sound 

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:36.849
 we can say 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.279
 so 

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:40.609
 that all these structures 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.059
 have 

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:44.349
 a structural relationship 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.019
 A relationship 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.099
 Smoke morcillo similarity structure 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.209
 and that are similar in addition 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.809
 to the structures with which 8 pm wrote the score sony said morton 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:58.699
 as well 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:00.900
 to the structures that are generated 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:07.000
 and with which he collected an intervening board the note of the polonaise act 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.779
 each one the scheme that we presented previously is very simple 

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:13.609
 and it serves 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:18.129
 that is why the basic relationships between artists, works and spectators 

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:23.759
 as we see in this other scheme the artist owns more than inma elements 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.759
 relationships I want you to overturn the work of art 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.710
 not only the artist is structurally richer 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.320
 as we see here also the spectator we go to same structures as the 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:37.969
 we presented previously 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:39.289
 but nevertheless 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.879
 only capture a part of what is present 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:44.490
 in the work of art 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.589
 this guarantees the construction of new structures 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.780
 by the viewer to the extent that I learned to see hartl 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.759
 both in the creation 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.259
 as the catchment 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.320
 how a spectator of the work of art there is an enrichment 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.729
 both the artist and the spectator 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.219
 It is a process of self-knowledge 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:10.650
 in Mexico 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.150
 in those works to be reflected there in those works 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:17.719
 and of construction and own personality 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:20.919
 this afternoon you already have 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.619
 and learn to read interiorize those that are not known 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:28.629
 in the line that we have added and has maintained 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:32.759
 lines that go between the work and the viewer relating them 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:34.210
 moves between 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.710
 this construction of new senses of the work 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.469
 and of new structures of perception 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:42.749
 of the viewer 

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:45.820
 a process that never ends checki 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.599
 permanently impossible to find him 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:50.379
 new 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:54.069
 game of having new senses new interpretations 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:56.930
 the question 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.020
 that represent the work of art the answer is very simple 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.059
 represents the internal structures of the act 

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:06.490
 that are externalized 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.150
 not only those that he owns 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.260
 also attacks forge to the extent that the ics 

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:16.369
 here and as we have seen in their exchange with the cultural world and 

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:17.400
 natural 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.400
 they showed their knowledge they say 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.520
 they are objective insofar as they are shared with their community of belonging 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:29.339
 artists and spectators 

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:33.589
 this knowledge also made inÃ©s interaction 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.210
 among lemon spectators 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:44.110
 we have presented so far the psychological conditions of art one 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.259
 of the central themes that we set out to investigate in our work 

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:52.399
 you know your ideas and the conditions for later 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.629
 social of art 

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:57.629
 for that we had to evolve slowly 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:03.240
 from the notion of similar artistic community speaks of scientific community 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.749
 tito moscow 

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:06.289
 walking around 

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:09.960
 the sociology of the fields 10 burdiel 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.850
 and the original psychosocial theory changed by incorporating the languages 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.399
 proper to the 

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:19.399
 the evolution of life precisions form 

00:07:20.249 --> 00:07:21.809
 all these changes 

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:24.809
 they did not involve giving up or crazy 

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:27.569
 what happened next 

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:28.740
 moon bouquets 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.139
 in another act 

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:32.259
 another military 

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:34.759
 I was simply 

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:39.749
 narrate the beginning of a research program that if they continue until 

00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:42.749
 the moment
