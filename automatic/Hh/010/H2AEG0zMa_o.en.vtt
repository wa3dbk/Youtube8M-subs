that<00:00:31.619> had<00:00:31.920> more<00:00:32.160> Pop<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:33.090> little<00:00:33.329> bit

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
that had more Pop and a little bit

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.360 
that had more Pop and a little bit
higher<00:00:33.660> performance<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.800> wanted<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.190> lower

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
higher performance you wanted a lower

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.280 
higher performance you wanted a lower
moi<00:00:35.790> which<00:00:36.180> ultimately<00:00:36.329> means<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:37.079> lighter

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
moi which ultimately means a lighter

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
sweet spot with less vibration and you

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.060 
sweet spot with less vibration and you
told<00:00:42.300> us<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.600> know<00:00:42.690> what<00:00:42.870> with<00:00:43.050> graphics<00:00:43.469> less

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
told us you know what with graphics less

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.069 
told us you know what with graphics less
is<00:00:44.309> more<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.149> can<00:00:45.239> see<00:00:45.360> here<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:45.719> really

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
is more so you can see here we really

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.900 
is more so you can see here we really
tone<00:00:46.320> down<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.649> graphics<00:00:47.100> quite<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> bit<00:00:49.910> and

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
tone down the graphics quite a bit and

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.090 
tone down the graphics quite a bit and
then<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.090> want<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.449> get<00:00:51.570> into<00:00:51.719> our<00:00:52.079> white<00:00:52.320> out<00:00:52.469> FP

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
then I want to get into our white out FP

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.130 
then I want to get into our white out FP
moi<00:00:53.610> chart<00:00:54.090> which<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.539> moment<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.989> inertia

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.590 
moi chart which is the moment of inertia
this<00:00:55.680> ultimately<00:00:56.160> means<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.820> swing<00:00:57.120> way<00:00:57.300> and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
this ultimately means the swing way and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.090 
this ultimately means the swing way and
the<00:00:57.930> best<00:00:58.079> way<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.289> described<00:00:58.710> moment<00:00:59.039> of

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
the best way I described moment of

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.319 
the best way I described moment of
inertia<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.550> how<00:00:59.730> quick<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.059> can<00:01:00.090> get<00:01:00.239> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
inertia is how quick I can get the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.139 
inertia is how quick I can get the
bathroom<00:01:00.690> here<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.710> here<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.730> way<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.910> do

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
bathroom here to here and the way you do

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.700 
bathroom here to here and the way you do
that<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.359> by<00:01:03.570> tweaking<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.049> balance<00:01:04.409> points

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
that is by tweaking the balance points

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.100 
that is by tweaking the balance points
on<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> bat<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.610> you'll<00:01:05.760> see<00:01:05.939> here<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.270> um

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
on the bat so you'll see here that um

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.990 
on the bat so you'll see here that um
some<00:01:07.710> bats<00:01:07.920> were<00:01:08.130> unloaded<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.700> few<00:01:08.880> years

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
some bats were unloaded in a few years

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000 
some bats were unloaded in a few years
ago<00:01:09.180> they<00:01:09.390> were<00:01:09.420> really<00:01:09.750> popular<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.380> an<00:01:10.650> mo<00:01:10.950> to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
ago they were really popular in an mo to

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.010 
ago they were really popular in an mo to
bat<00:01:11.280> meant<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.939> weight<00:01:12.090> was<00:01:12.240> distributed<00:01:12.869> and

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
bat meant the weight was distributed and

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.510 
bat meant the weight was distributed and
then<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.530> was<00:01:13.680> really<00:01:13.860> great<00:01:14.159> for<00:01:14.340> two

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
then this was really great for two

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.120 
then this was really great for two
things<00:01:14.820> home<00:01:15.479> runs<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.990> strikeouts<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:17.009> was

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
things home runs and strikeouts it was

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.399 
things home runs and strikeouts it was
really<00:01:17.400> hard<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.700> control<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.720> we<00:01:18.930> tried<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.290> do

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
really hard to control so we tried to do

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.960 
really hard to control so we tried to do
is<00:01:19.560> tweak<00:01:19.799> our<00:01:19.950> balance<00:01:20.280> point<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> frenzy

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
is tweak our balance point in the frenzy

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.490 
is tweak our balance point in the frenzy
four-point-oh<00:01:21.600> we<00:01:21.720> had<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.869> pretty<00:01:22.049> centered

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
four-point-oh we had a pretty centered

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.080 
four-point-oh we had a pretty centered
balance<00:01:22.860> point<00:01:23.130> girls<00:01:23.729> had<00:01:23.880> tried<00:01:24.060> to

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
balance point girls had tried to

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.810 
balance point girls had tried to
absolutely<00:01:24.869> loved<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.259> but<00:01:25.770> if<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.220> felt

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
absolutely loved it but if you felt

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.310 
absolutely loved it but if you felt
thought<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.119> felt<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.420> little<00:01:27.570> heavy<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.200> was

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
thought it felt a little heavy that was

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.140 
thought it felt a little heavy that was
a<00:01:28.350> feedback<00:01:28.799> we<00:01:28.979> got<00:01:29.130> from<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.340> girls<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:30.060> we

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
a feedback we got from the girls so we

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.109 
a feedback we got from the girls so we
dropped<00:01:30.329> our<00:01:30.770> my<00:01:31.770> pointer<00:01:32.250> our<00:01:32.520> balance<00:01:32.909> point

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
dropped our my pointer our balance point

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.179 
dropped our my pointer our balance point
down<00:01:33.299> even<00:01:33.600> more<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.710> going<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.860> swing

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
down even more so it's going to swing

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.920 
down even more so it's going to swing
even<00:01:35.430> later<00:01:35.790> feel<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> little<00:01:36.390> bit<00:01:36.540> later<00:01:36.750> in

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
even later feel a little bit later in

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.270 
even later feel a little bit later in
your<00:01:37.020> hand<00:01:37.079> because<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.770> way<00:01:37.979> it's<00:01:38.070> going<00:01:38.189> to

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
your hand because the way it's going to

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.260 
your hand because the way it's going to
be<00:01:38.340> closer<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.670> your<00:01:38.790> hand<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.150> you're

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
be closer to your hand so you're

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.370 
be closer to your hand so you're
ultimately<00:01:39.450> going<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.840> have<00:01:39.990> more<00:01:40.200> control

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
ultimately going to have more control

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.950 
ultimately going to have more control
and<00:01:40.890> what<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.820> does<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.240> allows<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
and what that does is it allows for the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.050 
and what that does is it allows for the
best<00:01:43.290> swing<00:01:43.560> speed<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.009> possible<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.939> get

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
best swing speed is possible to get

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.819 
best swing speed is possible to get
through<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.420> zone<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:46.140> get<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.380> optimal

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
through the zone to get the optimal

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.249 
through the zone to get the optimal
results<00:01:47.450> so<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.540> can<00:01:48.659> see<00:01:48.810> here<00:01:49.049> this<00:01:49.200> is

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
results so you can see here this is

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.319 
results so you can see here this is

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
popular bat last year and you can see

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.859 
popular bat last year and you can see
here<00:02:02.189> based<00:02:02.430> on<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.759> chart<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.509> we<00:02:03.630> really

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
here based on the chart that we really

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.630 
here based on the chart that we really
listened<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.350> guys<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.770> did<00:02:05.070> brought<00:02:05.490> it

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
listened to you guys and did brought it

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.920 
listened to you guys and did brought it
down<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> lot<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.299> our<00:02:06.420> swing<00:02:06.630> way<00:02:06.750> it's<00:02:06.869> gonna

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
down a lot so our swing way it's gonna

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.889 
down a lot so our swing way it's gonna
feel<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.259> lot<00:02:07.469> lighter<00:02:07.710> in<00:02:07.979> your<00:02:08.009> hands

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
feel a lot lighter in your hands

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.470 
feel a lot lighter in your hands
the<00:02:10.470> next<00:02:10.709> chart<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:11.009> want<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.310> go<00:02:11.430> over<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.819> our

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
the next chart I want to go over is our

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.199 
the next chart I want to go over is our
anti-shock<00:02:13.379> construction<00:02:14.129> and<00:02:14.610> what<00:02:14.849> this<00:02:14.970> is

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
anti-shock construction and what this is

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.520 
anti-shock construction and what this is
if<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.480> guys<00:02:15.629> played<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.170> ever<00:02:16.290> got<00:02:16.500> a

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
if you guys played and you ever got a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.500 
if you guys played and you ever got a
stinger<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.129> it<00:02:17.189> just<00:02:17.370> kills<00:02:17.610> your<00:02:17.730> hands<00:02:18.120> you

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
stinger and it just kills your hands you

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.600 
stinger and it just kills your hands you
don't<00:02:18.689> want<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.079> bad<00:02:19.349> so<00:02:19.829> we're<00:02:20.099> on<00:02:20.250> really

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
don't want that bad so we're on really

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.250 
don't want that bad so we're on really
wanted<00:02:20.849> to<00:02:20.909> focus<00:02:21.030> on<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:21.540> can<00:02:21.780> we<00:02:21.900> let<00:02:22.079> our

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
wanted to focus on this can we let our

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.899 
wanted to focus on this can we let our
glass<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.739> carbon<00:02:23.069> fiber<00:02:23.250> layers<00:02:23.610> at<00:02:23.790> an

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
glass and carbon fiber layers at an

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.670 
glass and carbon fiber layers at an
angle<00:02:24.329> or<00:02:24.450> differently<00:02:24.870> on<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.170> taper<00:02:25.379> of<00:02:25.560> the

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
angle or differently on the taper of the

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.500 
angle or differently on the taper of the
bat<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:26.310> it's<00:02:26.340> going<00:02:26.519> to<00:02:26.579> absorb<00:02:26.730> most<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.390> the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
bat so it's going to absorb most of the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.929 
bat so it's going to absorb most of the
shock<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.109> answer<00:02:28.769> was<00:02:28.950> we<00:02:29.159> could<00:02:29.459> so

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
shock and the answer was we could so

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.750 
shock and the answer was we could so
what<00:02:30.090> we<00:02:30.209> ended<00:02:30.450> up<00:02:30.540> doing<00:02:30.599> is<00:02:31.019> from<00:02:31.230> about

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
what we ended up doing is from about

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.890 
what we ended up doing is from about
right<00:02:32.760> about<00:02:32.939> here<00:02:33.180> all<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.510> way<00:02:33.569> down<00:02:33.780> the

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
right about here all the way down the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.899 
right about here all the way down the
taper<00:02:34.109> is<00:02:34.500> we<00:02:34.739> learned<00:02:34.980> our<00:02:35.099> glass<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.640> carbon

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
taper is we learned our glass and carbon

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.729 
taper is we learned our glass and carbon
fiber<00:02:36.090> layers<00:02:36.390> differently<00:02:37.019> so<00:02:37.470> it's<00:02:37.620> going

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
fiber layers differently so it's going

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.589 
fiber layers differently so it's going
to<00:02:37.799> absorb<00:02:37.950> most<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.549> the<00:02:38.670> shot<00:02:38.909> then<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.480> can

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
to absorb most of the shot then you can

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.119 
to absorb most of the shot then you can
see<00:02:39.750> on<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:39.989> chart<00:02:40.230> right<00:02:40.470> here<00:02:40.530> which<00:02:41.010> is

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
see on this chart right here which is

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.589 
see on this chart right here which is
going<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.310> be<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.549> frenzy<00:02:41.909> four-point-oh

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
going to be the frenzy four-point-oh

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.869 
going to be the frenzy four-point-oh
versus<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.139> whiteout<00:02:43.349> and<00:02:43.709> how<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.519> lines

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
versus the whiteout and how the lines

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.399 
versus the whiteout and how the lines
kind<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.299> really<00:02:45.510> thick<00:02:45.810> at<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:45.989> frenzy

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
kind of really thick at the frenzy

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.379 
kind of really thick at the frenzy
four-point-oh<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.280> how<00:02:47.609> it's<00:02:47.790> much<00:02:48.030> thinner

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
four-point-oh and how it's much thinner

with the new anti shack construction in
the<00:02:50.879> whiteout<00:02:51.120> FP<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:52.290> once<00:02:52.500> again<00:02:52.620> what<00:02:53.010> does

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
the whiteout FP so once again what does

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.069 
the whiteout FP so once again what does

that ultimately mean for you it means if

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.420 
that ultimately mean for you it means if

a baseball bat they're going to focus on
two<00:03:07.230> zones<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:08.129> when<00:03:08.280> one's<00:03:08.519> going<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.760> be<00:03:08.939> from

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
two zones so when one's going to be from

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.690 
two zones so when one's going to be from
right<00:03:09.329> here<00:03:09.689> to<00:03:10.470> right<00:03:10.709> here<00:03:11.129> which<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.549> the

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
did with the white out at p was we said

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.710 
did with the white out at p was we said
what<00:03:17.370> if<00:03:17.459> we<00:03:17.489> break<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.910> barrel<00:03:18.329> down<00:03:18.510> to

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
what if we break the barrel down to

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.990 
what if we break the barrel down to
three<00:03:18.959> zones<00:03:19.199> so<00:03:19.769> zone<00:03:20.129> one<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:20.669> going<00:03:20.819> to<00:03:20.910> be

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
three zones so zone one is going to be

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000 
three zones so zone one is going to be
right<00:03:21.180> here<00:03:21.209> zone<00:03:21.660> choose<00:03:21.930> a<00:03:21.959> sweet<00:03:22.319> spot<00:03:22.560> the

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
right here zone choose a sweet spot the

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.170 
right here zone choose a sweet spot the
sweet<00:03:23.250> spots<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.579> sweet<00:03:23.790> spot<00:03:23.970> no<00:03:24.150> matter

sweet spots the sweet spot no matter

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.360 
sweet spots the sweet spot no matter
what<00:03:24.569> we<00:03:24.690> do<00:03:24.840> with<00:03:24.989> it<00:03:25.169> in<00:03:25.379> zone<00:03:25.829> 3<00:03:26.099> s<00:03:26.159> right

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
what we do with it in zone 3 s right

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.099 
what we do with it in zone 3 s right
here<00:03:26.609> and<00:03:27.090> what<00:03:27.299> we<00:03:27.389> said<00:03:27.629> is<00:03:27.750> what<00:03:27.930> if<00:03:28.019> we

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
here and what we said is what if we

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.330 
here and what we said is what if we
developed<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.530> carbon<00:03:28.859> fiber<00:03:29.040> lyrics

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
developed the carbon fiber lyrics

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.729 
developed the carbon fiber lyrics
differently<00:03:29.730> in<00:03:29.849> zone<00:03:30.060> 1<00:03:30.329> and<00:03:30.359> zone<00:03:30.599> 3<00:03:31.230> would

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
differently in zone 1 and zone 3 would

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.559 
differently in zone 1 and zone 3 would
it<00:03:31.769> increase<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.549> performance<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.329> bat

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
it increase the performance of the bat

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.210 
it increase the performance of the bat
and<00:03:34.019> I<00:03:34.139> think<00:03:34.379> you<00:03:34.440> can<00:03:34.500> see<00:03:34.769> here<00:03:34.980> on<00:03:35.099> this

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
and I think you can see here on this

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.800 
and I think you can see here on this

what asaa you triple sa NSA NCAA that's

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.030 
what asaa you triple sa NSA NCAA that's
how<00:03:43.139> they're<00:03:43.290> going<00:03:43.409> to<00:03:43.470> do<00:03:43.590> all<00:03:43.620> their<00:03:43.889> on

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
how they're going to do all their on

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.830 
how they're going to do all their on
field<00:03:44.340> testing<00:03:44.940> so<00:03:45.389> the<00:03:45.540> lower<00:03:45.720> the

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
field testing so the lower the

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
compression the hotter the bat is and

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.849 
compression the hotter the bat is and
you<00:03:48.329> can<00:03:48.479> see<00:03:48.629> here<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.049> frenzy<00:03:49.349> for<00:03:49.530> point<00:03:49.769> I

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
you can see here the frenzy for point I

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.319 
you can see here the frenzy for point I
was<00:03:49.949> going<00:03:50.069> to<00:03:50.159> be<00:03:50.250> on<00:03:50.280> top<00:03:50.579> and<00:03:50.849> it's<00:03:51.030> more<00:03:51.209> of

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
was going to be on top and it's more of

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.689 
was going to be on top and it's more of
a<00:03:51.449> bell<00:03:51.659> curve<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.229> then<00:03:52.859> the<00:03:52.979> whiteout<00:03:53.220> FP<00:03:53.669> is

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:53.699 
a bell curve and then the whiteout FP is

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:55.280 
a bell curve and then the whiteout FP is
going<00:03:53.879> to<00:03:53.940> be<00:03:54.030> on<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.209> bottom<00:03:54.389> because<00:03:54.780> it's<00:03:55.139> a

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
going to be on the bottom because it's a

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.110 
going to be on the bottom because it's a
depression<00:03:55.799> test<00:03:56.099> you<00:03:56.489> can<00:03:56.519> see<00:03:56.819> that<00:03:57.000> it's

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
depression test you can see that it's

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.399 
depression test you can see that it's
going<00:03:57.209> to<00:03:57.269> be<00:03:57.419> hotter<00:03:57.720> right<00:03:57.870> out<00:03:58.199> of<00:03:58.229> the

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
going to be hotter right out of the

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.020 
going to be hotter right out of the
wrapper<00:03:58.590> than<00:03:58.889> the<00:03:58.979> frenzy<00:03:59.340> four-point-oh

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
wrapper than the frenzy four-point-oh

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.969 
wrapper than the frenzy four-point-oh
was<00:04:00.269> but<00:04:00.840> you<00:04:00.930> can<00:04:01.049> also<00:04:01.229> see<00:04:01.530> where<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.799> vast

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:01.979 
was but you can also see where the vast

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.069 
was but you can also see where the vast
improvement<00:04:02.639> his<00:04:02.729> own<00:04:02.909> three<00:04:03.209> was<00:04:03.389> so<00:04:03.870> if<00:04:03.989> a

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
improvement his own three was so if a

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.809 
improvement his own three was so if a
girl<00:04:04.290> hits<00:04:04.530> more<00:04:04.769> towards<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.310> bottom<00:04:05.489> of<00:04:05.729> the

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
girl hits more towards the bottom of the

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.219 
girl hits more towards the bottom of the
barrel<00:04:06.180> she's<00:04:06.599> going<00:04:06.750> to<00:04:06.810> get<00:04:06.900> a<00:04:06.959> much<00:04:07.199> better

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:07.229 
barrel she's going to get a much better

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:08.479 
barrel she's going to get a much better
hit<00:04:07.680> it's<00:04:07.829> going<00:04:07.859> to<00:04:07.979> be<00:04:08.099> much<00:04:08.250> better

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
hit it's going to be much better

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.759 
hit it's going to be much better
performing<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:09.299> much<00:04:09.419> more<00:04:09.629> forgiving<00:04:10.260> so

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
performing and much more forgiving so

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.219 
performing and much more forgiving so
you<00:04:10.859> can<00:04:10.979> see<00:04:11.159> that<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.459> whiteout<00:04:12.150> FP<00:04:12.840> with

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:13.229 
you can see that the whiteout FP with

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:15.979 
you can see that the whiteout FP with
the<00:04:13.440> 3d<00:04:14.280> technology<00:04:14.970> has<00:04:15.359> really<00:04:15.599> increased

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
the 3d technology has really increased

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.620 
the 3d technology has really increased
our<00:04:16.409> sweet<00:04:16.709> spot<00:04:16.739> pretty<00:04:17.579> dramatically<00:04:18.150> if

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
our sweet spot pretty dramatically if

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.629 
our sweet spot pretty dramatically if
you<00:04:18.810> look<00:04:19.019> at<00:04:19.200> it<00:04:19.409> on<00:04:19.529> the<00:04:19.680> chart<00:04:19.979> it<00:04:20.190> pretty

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
you look at it on the chart it pretty

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.260 
you look at it on the chart it pretty
much<00:04:20.849> from<00:04:21.000> about<00:04:21.299> four<00:04:21.630> inches<00:04:21.930> to

29 inches is going to have almost the
same<00:04:24.460> compression<00:04:24.849> levels<00:04:25.419> which<00:04:25.569> means<00:04:25.780> it's

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
same compression levels which means it's

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.719

going to perform about the same which is

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.969 
going to perform about the same which is

going<00:04:36.340> to<00:04:36.400> show<00:04:36.610> our<00:04:36.789> temperature<00:04:37.180> gauge<00:04:37.449> that

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
going to show our temperature gauge that

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.749 
going to show our temperature gauge that
measures<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:38.110> sweet<00:04:38.500> spot<00:04:38.740> and<00:04:39.039> you<00:04:39.069> can<00:04:39.580> see

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 
measures the sweet spot and you can see

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.089 
measures the sweet spot and you can see
here<00:04:39.940> once<00:04:40.150> again<00:04:40.389> that<00:04:40.569> zone<00:04:40.780> 3<00:04:41.169> has<00:04:41.620> just<00:04:41.949> had

translation out to it translations to if

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.050 
translation out to it translations to if
you<00:04:50.139> get<00:04:50.259> that<00:04:50.409> inside<00:04:50.770> pitch<00:04:50.830> and<00:04:51.400> you<00:04:51.789> just

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
you get that inside pitch and you just

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.820 
you get that inside pitch and you just
missed<00:04:52.389> the<00:04:52.479> sweet<00:04:52.840> spot<00:04:53.199> and<00:04:53.440> you<00:04:53.470> get<00:04:53.650> it<00:04:53.770> a

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
missed the sweet spot and you get it a

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.230 
missed the sweet spot and you get it a
little<00:04:53.979> bit<00:04:54.159> inside<00:04:54.460> it's<00:04:54.909> going<00:04:55.060> to<00:04:55.120> be<00:04:55.210> a

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
little bit inside it's going to be a

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.360 
little bit inside it's going to be a
much<00:04:55.479> more<00:04:55.720> forgiving<00:04:56.259> bat<00:04:56.440> and<00:04:56.710> ultimately

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
much more forgiving bat and ultimately

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.230 
much more forgiving bat and ultimately
going<00:04:57.550> to<00:04:57.639> be<00:04:57.729> a<00:04:57.759> little<00:04:57.970> bit<00:04:58.120> better

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
going to be a little bit better

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.960 
going to be a little bit better
performing<00:04:58.870> when<00:04:59.020> you<00:04:59.110> miss<00:04:59.289> it<00:04:59.470> the<00:04:59.620> ball

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.309 

next<00:05:03.970> I<00:05:04.150> want<00:05:04.270> to<00:05:04.419> get<00:05:04.539> into<00:05:04.659> what<00:05:04.870> is<00:05:04.990> our<00:05:05.110> bat

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:05.319 
next I want to get into what is our bat

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.170 
next I want to get into what is our bat
made<00:05:05.560> out<00:05:05.740> of<00:05:05.919> and<00:05:06.130> how<00:05:06.280> is<00:05:06.430> it<00:05:06.460> constructed

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
made out of and how is it constructed

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.080 
made out of and how is it constructed
our<00:05:07.630> bat<00:05:07.840> is<00:05:07.960> made<00:05:08.139> out<00:05:08.289> of<00:05:08.319> black<00:05:08.500> onyx<00:05:09.400> carbon

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
our bat is made out of black onyx carbon

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.059 
our bat is made out of black onyx carbon
we<00:05:10.659> machine<00:05:11.080> roll<00:05:11.289> our<00:05:11.409> bachelor<00:05:11.889> are<00:05:11.949> going

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:12.069 
we machine roll our bachelor are going

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:14.159 
we machine roll our bachelor are going
to<00:05:12.130> be<00:05:12.190> consistent<00:05:12.789> from<00:05:12.940> bad<00:05:13.120> to<00:05:13.330> bat<00:05:13.509> and<00:05:13.840> we

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
to be consistent from bad to bat and we

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.499 
to be consistent from bad to bat and we
spied<00:05:14.469> will<00:05:14.650> roll<00:05:14.830> our<00:05:15.009> bats<00:05:15.280> but<00:05:16.000> I<00:05:16.030> spy<00:05:16.300> will

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:16.509 
spied will roll our bats but I spy will

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:18.659 
spied will roll our bats but I spy will
roll<00:05:16.690> I<00:05:16.719> mean<00:05:17.110> we<00:05:17.560> take<00:05:17.770> a<00:05:17.800> bat<00:05:18.099> and<00:05:18.280> typically

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
roll I mean we take a bat and typically

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.760 
roll I mean we take a bat and typically
what<00:05:18.880> we<00:05:18.909> used<00:05:19.180> to<00:05:19.270> do<00:05:19.449> is<00:05:19.690> we<00:05:20.110> used<00:05:20.289> to<00:05:20.440> roll<00:05:20.620> it

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
what we used to do is we used to roll it

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.999 
what we used to do is we used to roll it
like<00:05:20.919> this<00:05:21.159> and<00:05:22.229> you<00:05:23.229> can<00:05:23.379> see<00:05:23.530> here<00:05:23.770> it's<00:05:23.889> the

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:24.009 
like this and you can see here it's the

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:25.890 
like this and you can see here it's the
scene<00:05:24.280> well<00:05:24.819> when<00:05:24.940> you<00:05:24.969> had<00:05:25.090> to<00:05:25.240> see<00:05:25.419> my<00:05:25.569> Nevada

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
scene well when you had to see my Nevada

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:26.969 
scene well when you had to see my Nevada
it's<00:05:26.050> going<00:05:26.229> to<00:05:26.289> make<00:05:26.380> it<00:05:26.530> a<00:05:26.620> little<00:05:26.770> bit

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
it's going to make it a little bit

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.730 
it's going to make it a little bit
weaker<00:05:27.219> so<00:05:27.759> what<00:05:27.880> we<00:05:28.060> do<00:05:28.300> is<00:05:28.479> we<00:05:28.960> roll<00:05:29.349> it<00:05:29.500> on<00:05:29.590> an

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
weaker so what we do is we roll it on an

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.439 
weaker so what we do is we roll it on an
angle<00:05:29.889> which<00:05:30.400> is<00:05:30.550> essentially<00:05:31.030> called<00:05:31.240> our

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
angle which is essentially called our

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:34.920 
angle which is essentially called our
spray<00:05:31.690> roll<00:05:31.930> roll<00:05:33.300> and<00:05:34.300> as<00:05:34.419> you<00:05:34.599> can<00:05:34.719> see<00:05:34.750> right

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
spray roll roll and as you can see right

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.469 
spray roll roll and as you can see right
here<00:05:35.440> that's<00:05:35.919> going<00:05:36.130> to<00:05:36.219> be<00:05:36.250> no<00:05:36.669> seams<00:05:37.060> so<00:05:37.330> it's

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
here that's going to be no seams so it's

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:43.680 
here that's going to be no seams so it's
going<00:05:37.569> to<00:05:37.659> be<00:05:37.750> more<00:05:37.960> durable<00:05:42.419> next<00:05:43.419> I<00:05:43.539> just

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
going to be more durable next I just

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.149 
going to be more durable next I just
want<00:05:43.870> to<00:05:43.930> go<00:05:44.050> over<00:05:44.289> everything<00:05:44.800> that<00:05:44.979> we

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159 
want to go over everything that we

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:46.649 
want to go over everything that we
discussed<00:05:45.580> already<00:05:45.819> and<00:05:46.210> just<00:05:46.240> kind<00:05:46.569> of

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:46.659 
discussed already and just kind of

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:48.330 
discussed already and just kind of
review<00:05:46.990> it<00:05:47.139> and<00:05:47.259> the<00:05:47.710> bat<00:05:47.860> is<00:05:47.979> made<00:05:48.159> out<00:05:48.310> of

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
review it and the bat is made out of

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.999 
review it and the bat is made out of
black<00:05:48.699> onyx<00:05:49.270> carbon<00:05:49.810> its<00:05:50.050> features<00:05:50.440> our<00:05:50.590> 3z
