00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
like this it seems like mitsubishi has

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.120 
like this it seems like mitsubishi has
really<00:01:35.600> thought<00:01:35.840> out<00:01:36.110> where<00:01:36.860> you<00:01:36.950> might<00:01:37.100> want

door<00:01:42.170> handle<00:01:42.590> mounted<00:01:43.130> cup<00:01:43.550> holders<00:01:43.940> as<00:01:44.300> well

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
door handle mounted cup holders as well

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.480

as<00:01:44.600> cup<00:01:44.780> holders<00:01:45.110> in<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:45.409> center<00:01:45.740> I<00:01:45.920> also<00:01:46.220> like

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
as cup holders in the center I also like

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.969 
as cup holders in the center I also like
the<00:01:46.610> fact<00:01:46.850> that<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.300> center<00:01:48.229> armrest<00:01:48.530> slides

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
the fact that the center armrest slides

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.910 
the fact that the center armrest slides
forward<00:01:49.520> or<00:01:49.760> back<00:01:50.060> I<00:01:50.420> think<00:01:50.840> that<00:01:50.990> just<00:01:51.350> gives

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
forward or back I think that just gives

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.830 
forward or back I think that just gives
the<00:01:52.130> vehicle<00:01:52.729> a<00:01:53.000> feel<00:01:53.270> of<00:01:53.300> a<00:01:53.479> little<00:01:53.720> more

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
the vehicle a feel of a little more

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.750 
the vehicle a feel of a little more
expensive<00:01:54.200> vehicle<00:01:54.770> than<00:01:54.920> what<00:01:55.130> you<00:01:55.280> paid<00:01:55.490> for

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
expensive vehicle than what you paid for

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.120
