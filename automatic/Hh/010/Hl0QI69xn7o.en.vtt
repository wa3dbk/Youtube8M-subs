you probably should start on the sides
because<00:01:49.560> they're<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> bit<00:01:50.040> more<00:01:50.070> flexible<00:01:50.820> but

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
because they're a bit more flexible but

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.530

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
it and it'll pop right off I'm going to

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.050 
it and it'll pop right off I'm going to

you can see the Junction's right here

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.140 
you can see the Junction's right here
those<00:02:19.800> are<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.040> four<00:02:20.250> screws<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.730> had<00:02:20.850> removed

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
easiest place to start because there's a

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.420 
easiest place to start because there's a
big<00:02:29.760> gap<00:02:30.000> here<00:02:30.390> for<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.230> for<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:31.980> peripherals
