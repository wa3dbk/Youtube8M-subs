00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.730
 good for all dear friends 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.350
 welcome back in the company of these 86 o 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.019
 shoot a video a little bit special 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.670
 meanwhile I'm recording with htc one m8 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.580
 because I wanted to try a little 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.160
 video recording of the camera 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.529
 front of this beautiful terminal in 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.810
 many on tweets and on facebook on the various 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.710
 social network but you have asked but which one 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.960
 according to you the phone to buy in 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.660
 this 2014 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.469
 we have to buy the htc one m8 we have to 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.690
 buy samsung galaxy s 5 but e 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.640
 this is a wonderful question then 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.860
 so far as I can be concerned 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.899
 these are personal opinions I could 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.039
 definitely try a lot more juan m8 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.320
 because heaven has been abundant for a month now 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.750
 I could only try the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.649
 presentation is however in a couple of 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.570
 days 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:00.149
 the galaxy s 5 can not be turned on a 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.970
 bit of light in the meantime put by a little bit 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:08.250
 of light there is then it is the good hdc but 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.229
 8 is a fantastic device because in 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.820
 aluminum because it has one 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.340
 software customization indeed 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.090
 incredible really important and da 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:22.780
 an optimization of everything really in 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.820
 spectacularly and the software 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.100
 inside android treats traits 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.350
 made the most of the absence and I do 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.509
 duty the absence is something that makes you 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.469
 falling in love with the device is 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:38.610
 practically an interface that it takes from 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:43.600
 immediately and understand it or if not clearly 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.209
 this one m8 can't can't please me 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.700
 many times you asked me but the 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:52.689
 camera the investment camera 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.429
 like the camera is not that of the lamp 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.429
 lc 20 which is not a camera 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:02:00.640
 highest levels is a camera expanse 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:03.159
 and I repeat if it happens he put us 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.280
 inside an m8 a camera from 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.549
 16 to 20 megapixels to bund competition 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.129
 part returns because it had rosol 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.829
 aluminum you wanted a terminal 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:18.180
 android really at aesthetic levels like 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:20.650
 an iphone or brushed aluminum a 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.639
 a terminal that to hold in ad 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.920
 have spectacular and therefore would have so 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:30.430
 routed the competition in one 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.260
 almost absolute way it happens instead 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.290
 he continues with his ultra pixel has 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.389
 put a secondary camera for 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.639
 make a lot of effects 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:41.709
 beautiful inside of a use for 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:45.130
 as far as multimedia is concerned 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.170
 put the stereo speakers a sound again 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.000
 improved and therefore even more audio 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.079
 in short, you've seen it all 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.239
 review then ultimately for me 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:57.880
 for my use htc one m8 is a 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.650
 device absolutely to be promoted 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.200
 this does not mean that I recommend you 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.720
 the htc one m8 for charity 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.459
 during this month so many 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.319
 zero in short but now but that phoned 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.190
 ai that is but what is that thing? 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:15.069
 this htc one and m8 a cites list 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.750
 samsung galaxy s 5 over and samsung a 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.569
 commercial level at the media level 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.669
 it's much stronger than wrong 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.690
 even this does not mean either 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:25.419
 best 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.210
 indeed I think there is or not as far as I am 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:31.260
 concerns this year 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.070
 i feel htc after changing so many 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.780
 smartphone 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.640
 I must say I finally arrived at a 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.790
 balance point among many 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.480
 s5 features a good product is 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.190
 an expansion of the s4 have been 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.260
 many things have been improved 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.500
 introduced new technologies such as the 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.230
 Swiss heartbeat sensor in the 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.330
 back of samsung galaxy s 5 to 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.850
 16 megapixel camera that anyway 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.440
 he works well but in my opinion it was 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.250
 introduced a settings menu 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.200
 really dispersive was introduced a 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.440
 browser that is not at level 3 no. 3 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.500
 therefore it is not at the top of the range e 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:14.070
 there are functions inside instead s5 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.440
 that make me turn up my nose too much 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.360
 so it's not a top of the range device 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.210
 for how much it can concern then for you 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.440
 may be the best smartphone of the 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:26.160
 world but for me 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.160
 absolutely no ip67 resistant 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.220
 to water to splashes but I always feel 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.400
 say be careful not to throw this s5 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.650
 in the water so there are many but in 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.960
 this device which in any case at the 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.780
 launch sold that they are anyway 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:47.460
 truly promoting wherever I am 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.710
 I recommend one thing if you like samsung 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.260
 however you are a fanatic of the house 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.630
 OK then 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.520
 go and see this s5 anyway 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.470
 go and buy it 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.150
 I tell you attention because this htc 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.700
 is doing a great job 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.070
 personally I chose it without a shadow of 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.980
 doubt juan n 8 for me wins in 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.360
 any field against s5 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.600
 maybe it won't be better for you 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.630
 smartphone but for me and 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:18.690
 hdc one l 8 certainly one of the top of 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.460
 range really at the top of this 2014 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.880
 for today it's all we feel about our neighbor 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.880
 video
