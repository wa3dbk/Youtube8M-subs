00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.289
 the monstrous city of Sao Paulo 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.840
 gigantic very large we take as 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.640
 20 thousand years to get to the stadium and that 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.490
 that we came by car to my back 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.100
 is one of the venues of the cup of 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.750
 world the corinthias stadium and it's 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.000
 where are going to play several matches 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.950
 of the world cup between them 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.980
 obviously the inaugural game between 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.489
 brazil and croatia the weather is a bit 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.930
 the rain is a bit cloudy 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.260
 moments we can also be 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.800
 feeling and the stadium is not yet 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.380
 finished still has many things for 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.090
 get ready behind my back here in this 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.760
 part we are seeing one of the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.180
 headers that are part of the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.610
 stadium and they are not ready yet and so 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.129
 also tell them that they are temporary 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.710
 these headers are not going to be all the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.580
 time in the stadium they are simply 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.250
 put for 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.800
 the world cup and the best way to 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.110
 come to the stadium because it's in the subway 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.000
 because it is very far from the center of the 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.460
 city then to people who love each other 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.220
 come the day of the matches as the 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.770
 best way is on public transport 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.590
 is simply walking the metro and 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.690

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.750
