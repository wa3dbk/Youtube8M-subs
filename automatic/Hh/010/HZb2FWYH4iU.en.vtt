gym today I wasn't feeling particularly

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.770 
gym today I wasn't feeling particularly
a<00:00:06.980> hundred<00:00:07.980> percent<00:00:08.069> because<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.360> my<00:00:09.480> elbow

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
a hundred percent because of my elbow

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.959 
a hundred percent because of my elbow
started<00:00:10.380> acting<00:00:10.679> up<00:00:10.769> again<00:00:10.889> on<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.429> squad's<00:00:11.759> I

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
started acting up again on the squad's I

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.120 
started acting up again on the squad's I
actually<00:00:12.120> had<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.420> move<00:00:12.570> my<00:00:12.630> my<00:00:13.620> hands<00:00:13.860> out<00:00:14.099> a

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
actually had to move my my hands out a

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.039 
actually had to move my my hands out a
little<00:00:14.370> bit<00:00:14.580> which<00:00:15.089> affected<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.719> squats

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
little bit which affected the squats

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.320 
little bit which affected the squats
themselves<00:00:16.710> I've<00:00:17.490> been<00:00:17.760> working<00:00:18.060> really<00:00:18.210> hard

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
themselves I've been working really hard

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.349 
themselves I've been working really hard
to<00:00:18.690> keep<00:00:18.869> my<00:00:18.930> upper<00:00:19.230> back<00:00:19.350> tight<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:20.090> get<00:00:21.090> a

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
to keep my upper back tight and get a

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.450 
to keep my upper back tight and get a
really<00:00:21.720> good<00:00:21.840> starting<00:00:22.230> position<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.800> when<00:00:23.430> I

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
really good starting position and when I

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.580 
really good starting position and when I
let<00:00:23.730> my<00:00:23.880> hands<00:00:24.240> out<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.420> little<00:00:24.750> bit<00:00:24.930> on<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.410> bar

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
let my hands out a little bit on the bar

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.620 
let my hands out a little bit on the bar
it<00:00:25.920> D<00:00:26.490> load<00:00:26.699> some<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.060> stress<00:00:27.330> on<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
it D load some of the stress on the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.740 
it D load some of the stress on the
elbow<00:00:27.930> but<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.830> also<00:00:29.310> makes<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.150> harder<00:00:30.510> for<00:00:30.539> me

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
elbow but it also makes it harder for me

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.569 
elbow but it also makes it harder for me
to<00:00:30.779> keep<00:00:30.990> my<00:00:31.140> back<00:00:31.289> tight<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.340> did<00:00:32.550> that

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
to keep my back tight and so I did that

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.400 
to keep my back tight and so I did that
545<00:00:33.270> right<00:00:33.480> there<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.780> then<00:00:33.840> drop<00:00:34.110> back<00:00:34.230> down

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
545 right there and then drop back down

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.520 
545 right there and then drop back down
to<00:00:34.530> 500<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.160> did<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.340> for<00:00:35.489> eight<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:37.320> reps

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
to 500 and did it for eight and the reps

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.160 
to 500 and did it for eight and the reps
themselves<00:00:38.129> were<00:00:38.250> not<00:00:38.719> particularly<00:00:39.719> hard

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
themselves were not particularly hard

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.869 
themselves were not particularly hard
but<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.379> made<00:00:40.620> them<00:00:40.770> way<00:00:40.890> harder<00:00:41.250> because<00:00:41.430> my

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
but I made them way harder because my

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.920 
but I made them way harder because my
hand<00:00:42.210> started<00:00:42.540> sliding<00:00:43.110> out<00:00:43.550> just<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.760> it

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
hand started sliding out just to it

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.130 
hand started sliding out just to it
adjust<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.800> elbow<00:00:47.780> perkiness<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.960> guess

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
adjust to the elbow perkiness I guess

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.450 
adjust to the elbow perkiness I guess
and<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.440> lost<00:00:49.649> some<00:00:49.860> upper<00:00:50.070> back<00:00:50.219> tightness

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
and so I lost some upper back tightness

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.189 
and so I lost some upper back tightness
and<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.910> my<00:00:51.030> chest<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.690> see<00:00:51.840> my<00:00:51.960> chest

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
and so you my chest you see my chest

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.479 
and so you my chest you see my chest
starts<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.500> collapse<00:00:52.649> way<00:00:52.890> earlier<00:00:53.219> than<00:00:53.309> i

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
starts to collapse way earlier than i

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.590 
starts to collapse way earlier than i
would<00:00:53.640> normally<00:00:53.670> want<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.469> but<00:00:56.510> in<00:00:57.510> terms

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
would normally want it to but in terms

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.099 
would normally want it to but in terms
of<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.260> actual<00:00:58.410> workout<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:58.980> felt<00:00:59.370> all<00:00:59.550> right

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
of the actual workout I felt all right

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.420 
of the actual workout I felt all right
after<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.469> moved<00:01:01.680> over<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:01.949> did<00:01:02.219> some

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
after this I moved over and did some

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.119 
after this I moved over and did some
bench<00:01:02.640> pressing<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.619> worked<00:01:04.619> my<00:01:04.680> way<00:01:04.769> up<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.010> a

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
bench pressing and worked my way up to a

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.670 
bench pressing and worked my way up to a
365<00:01:05.760> single<00:01:06.180> which<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.780> pretty<00:01:07.260> long<00:01:07.409> pause

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
365 single which is a pretty long pause

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.109 
365 single which is a pretty long pause
single<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.340> that's<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.729> heaviest<00:01:08.850> i've

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
single and it's that's the heaviest i've

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.240 
single and it's that's the heaviest i've
gone<00:01:09.240> since<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.720> meat<00:01:09.900> where<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.080> bench<00:01:10.290> 385<00:01:10.650> in

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
gone since the meat where I bench 385 in

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.820 
gone since the meat where I bench 385 in
the<00:01:11.369> competition<00:01:12.030> setting<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.689> felt<00:01:13.650> pretty

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
the competition setting and felt pretty

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.260 
the competition setting and felt pretty
good<00:01:13.979> about<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.700> then<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.119> did<00:01:15.240> some

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
good about that and then I did some

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.260 
good about that and then I did some
deadlifts<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:17.119> did<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.170> 635<00:01:20.270> conventional

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
deadlifts and did a 635 conventional

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.179 
deadlifts and did a 635 conventional
pull<00:01:21.450> move<00:01:21.780> my<00:01:21.960> feet<00:01:22.140> out<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.590> did<00:01:22.740> two<00:01:22.950> more

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
pull move my feet out and did two more

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.749 
pull move my feet out and did two more
solid<00:01:23.729> pull<00:01:23.880> sumo<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.270> then<00:01:24.509> one<00:01:24.689> more<00:01:24.869> where

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
solid pull sumo and then one more where

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.460 
solid pull sumo and then one more where
the<00:01:26.759> bar<00:01:26.939> dropping<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.840> me<00:01:27.990> readjusting<00:01:28.439> my

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
the bar dropping and me readjusting my

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.620 
the bar dropping and me readjusting my
hands<00:01:28.799> kind<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.189> slid<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.060> bar<00:01:30.150> out<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.509> my

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
hands kind of slid the bar out to my

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.819 
hands kind of slid the bar out to my
fingertips<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.229> didn't<00:01:31.439> have<00:01:31.560> his<00:01:31.650> get<00:01:31.799> a

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
fingertips so I didn't have his get a

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.560 
fingertips so I didn't have his get a
grip<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.310> last<00:01:32.490> rep<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.119> only<00:01:33.360> hit

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
grip on the last rep and so I only hit

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.880 
grip on the last rep and so I only hit
the<00:01:33.720> two<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.049> then<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.229> third<00:01:34.380> when<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.619> got<00:01:34.770> it

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the two and then the third when I got it

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.260 
the two and then the third when I got it
to<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.070> top<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:35.490> let<00:01:35.670> go<00:01:35.820> before<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.119> held

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
to the top and just let go before I held

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.560 
to the top and just let go before I held
for<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.450> lockout<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.990> then<00:01:37.650> just<00:01:37.890> did<00:01:38.070> some

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
for the lockout and then just did some

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.179 
for the lockout and then just did some
basic<00:01:39.570> hypertrophy<00:01:40.229> things<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:40.920> what<00:01:41.159> I

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
basic hypertrophy things but what I

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.539 
basic hypertrophy things but what I
really<00:01:41.430> want<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.610> talk<00:01:41.729> about<00:01:41.909> today<00:01:42.210> is

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549

yourself in between all these sets
because<00:02:12.800> I<00:02:12.980> bet<00:02:13.310> people<00:02:13.340> on<00:02:14.000> YouTube<00:02:14.330> think

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
because I bet people on YouTube think

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.770 
because I bet people on YouTube think
that<00:02:15.610> think<00:02:16.610> that<00:02:16.670> you're<00:02:16.910> some<00:02:17.120> you're<00:02:17.510> some

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
that think that you're some you're some

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.050 
that think that you're some you're some
big<00:02:17.810> tough<00:02:18.200> guy<00:02:18.410> or<00:02:18.769> something<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.489> there's

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
big tough guy or something and there's

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.640 
big tough guy or something and there's
just<00:02:20.269> this<00:02:20.390> other<00:02:20.569> side<00:02:20.840> that<00:02:21.110> they<00:02:21.200> don't<00:02:21.380> see

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
just this other side that they don't see

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.100 
just this other side that they don't see
and<00:02:21.980> it's<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:23.480> was<00:02:23.599> thinking<00:02:23.900> about<00:02:23.959> that

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
and it's and I was thinking about that

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.290 
and it's and I was thinking about that
and<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.739> be<00:02:24.860> honest<00:02:25.190> it's<00:02:25.370> probably<00:02:25.910> closer<00:02:26.150> to

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
and to be honest it's probably closer to

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.580 
and to be honest it's probably closer to
how<00:02:26.900> I<00:02:26.930> really<00:02:27.530> am<00:02:27.650> most<00:02:28.280> of<00:02:28.519> the<00:02:28.610> time<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:29.090> I

with<00:02:52.880> bigger<00:02:53.090> weights<00:02:53.239> that<00:02:53.390> I'm<00:02:53.510> lifting<00:02:53.660> but

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
with bigger weights that I'm lifting but

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.080 
with bigger weights that I'm lifting but
I<00:02:54.319> like<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.340> think<00:02:55.459> that<00:02:55.580> people<00:02:55.790> are<00:02:56.060> more

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
I like to think that people are more

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.390 
I like to think that people are more
interested<00:02:56.360> in<00:02:56.870> what<00:02:56.959> I<00:02:57.019> have<00:02:57.110> to<00:02:57.380> say<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:57.799> so

interested in what I have to say and so
I<00:02:58.430> guess<00:02:58.700> this<00:02:58.850> is<00:02:59.000> kind<00:02:59.150> of<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.330> official

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
I guess this is kind of the official

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.470 
I guess this is kind of the official
announcement<00:03:00.319> that<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:01.030> tonight<00:03:02.030> when<00:03:02.330> i<00:03:02.360> get
