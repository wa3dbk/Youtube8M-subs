00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.930
 Fly by plane for 50 or 60 Euro Colts and across Europe 

00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:11.490
 Billigflieger make it allegedly possible in principle year but says the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.830
 Stiftung Warentest test buyers bays for their test loads of flights 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.599
 attempted rebookings and cancellations looked the general

 Terms and Conditions and Respondents via a Reader Call in 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.939
 Internet more than a thousand readers 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.559
 The only airline with a certain reputation balance with 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:33.870
 acceptable prices and a relatively good name is TUIfly 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.879
 which are in both points so the price and the book and enters the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.149
 Information with well-rated as cheap as claimed are the flights in the 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:44.339
 Usually not 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:48.600
 Taxes and fees are still mostly added even though the airlines 

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:51.680
 actually only with child prices may advertise 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.860
 but they prefer to stick to their salami tactics 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.220
 a few euros for it a few euros for the service due to their luggage 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.290
 to beat since May 5 times 10 times 15 euros 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.690
 still cheap flying goes 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.500
 the 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.360
 Biking absolute Billigheimer 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.200
 Ryanair and Easyjet are back in the lead when prices are percent 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.570
 still very cheap but not so pro b 4 at 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.600
 The last test two years ago has become a horror of following Germanwings as well 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.740
 something has become porr and TUIfly Examiner has become even cheaper 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.050
 However, was due to special action 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.929
 rebooking, however, goes into the money and a stop emergency is often the way 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.840
 even taxes and airport fees which is not allowed 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.620
 German Wings paid in one case, only 48 cents 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.800
 and that's almost fun three months later flying with the 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.270
 cheap airlines do not give 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.229
 Tom Popper Thorn he explains and you can actually fly very cheap 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.920
 but it does not actually make a lot of fun to get in the bath when getting started 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.579
 many so much transport reminds or by four applicants 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.460
 Announcements and competitions had the impression of some 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.360
 Flying a coffee means flying is really no fun 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.149
 but it is still quite cheap indeed 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:14.800
 What the testers did not like is not completely legal either 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.310
 Often additional pricing options when booking on the Internet are already 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.830
 Default who did not pay attention has scares one 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.110
 Cancellation insurance even if he did not 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.040
 wanted and still a horse foot there are the terms and conditions 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.060
 are for the customer often disadvantageous and partly naughty me 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:39.689
 all about low-cost airlines what to look for and what the flights really 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:44.409
 Costs can be found in the March issue of test or on the Internet 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:44.969
 under test
