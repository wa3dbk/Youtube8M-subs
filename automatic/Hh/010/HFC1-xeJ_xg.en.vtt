00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 yes, even today I'm a champion anyway 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.660
 Welcome to a long 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.760
 longed for commas on a channel yes 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.230
 long has it been since the last time 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.880
 I heard the voice in one 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.990
 video of me I have just 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.089
 looked it up because it myself 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.230
 interested and it would have the new 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.420
 have been hitchhikers 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.000
 2014 then still a video about 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.350
 correction the adwords warfare 1 yes 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.269
 terrible game because we are all the more 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.500
 talk about it and I probably the guests before 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.340
 many asked when will come again and again 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.260
 why somehow yesterday something 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.059
 that would be just say a little bit 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.880
 what the gameplay here as in the background 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.350
 there is a round with 2 my favorite 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.660
 cd and there is a dtm also script with 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.390
 the ak 47 my graduation was the end 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.960
 predator of the harrier and the ac 130 and 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.390
 the score is 33 3 so a pretty 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.399
 good game I think you have to say 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.530
 I 've got that about two-three 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.600
 weeks of playing and have the first time 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.449
 played with two for weeks and months 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.910
 because yes it is not playing so well anymore 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.860
 as before because nothing more going for it is 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.689
 a partly only tdm lobbies and 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.229
 with luck, only without domination 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.090
 and otherwise it will hardly be played anymore 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.909
 The noise has generally tld 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.890
 more and more on the consoles about it though 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.299
 still a nice gameplay here 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.590
 he plays for the background and thinker 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.290
 was the most anyone of you here 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.850
 happy if you have such an old cad / cam 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.439
 the life from the old part to the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.140
 example one to two or black ops 1 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.430
 because most of them are from the cfd 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.299
 youtube so bring only consider 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.770
 about 24 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.210
 I personally do not like the games 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.950
 I look also to this 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.390
 So I read most of the videos 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.180
 Run in the background or could 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.729
 rhi and do something else me 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.409
 I do not like the gameplay like that 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.460
 and we should have written down here 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.869
 have already for a long time can 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.509
 I have made comments to me 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.680
 I wrote down a few margin notes 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.210
 Yesterday I addressed 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.350
 Some asked when we got a video again 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.170
 comes and that I have yesterday 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.369
 reached launched, yes, but also very 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.350
 in my opinion, I was successful 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.969
 also the first time live stream something 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.070
 bigger announced with the short video 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.619
 on youtube and on facebook 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.070
 and I was still 40 50 yesterday 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.200
 spectator 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.110
 I now have my twitter channel 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.110
 loudly sums up 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.030
 100 followers and I guess that's it 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.860
 okay 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.940
 yes how come you are sure to stream 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.650
 I am and I have a new one 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.750
 internet page good month 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.650
 I had a 16,000 lead before 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.630
 Of these, 12 came to 13,000 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.430
 and yes with me were the streets 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.710
 the people were opened 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.380
 relocated and since then I have from the 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.360
 telekom 100,000 line runs everything 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.310
 great with upload and download and no 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.780
 I also know that means longer 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.360
 The videos will be twenty 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.860
 Thirty or forty because many 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.680
 People are sure to get a complete match from 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.760
 cisco matchmaking or facebook is yes 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.230
 eh no one sees the play 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.150
 and now he can quite a long time 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.470
 In any case , I still have to 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.520
 to record something for work and 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.090
 this is not a problem 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.250
 more 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.630
 But I want to come to the whole thing now 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.760
 not set it that way yet 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.980
 but it will always go on gradually 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.600
 longer videos are coming and maybe 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.600
 something to my live stream 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.040
 yes I'm still relatively new and had to 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.750
 still many things set 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.060
 in terms of a live stream so to 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.010
 example plugins and here chat commands 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.269
 and overlays and what I do not know 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.720
 all because there are so many possibilities 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:19.720
 as I said everything has to be imitated 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.430
 and when to ask when livestreams 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.500
 it's always different but that's different 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.690
 so the week picks i would say 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.310
 maybe only 12 hours in the evening 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.140
 depending on the closed 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.150
 But it may be me on the weekend 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.850
 since day about six ships performance 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.680
 and endurance or twelve now loose 24 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.790
 I spent hours on the existence 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.380
 takes is a little bit 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.690
 I have five hours three last night 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.130
 stream and it definitely has the 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.590
 lots of fun the people were good 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.170
 have asked questions and none 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.060
 I know, but it was still a bit 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.100
 exhausting you can say but thinkable 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.230
 after descendants the whole then so 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.570
 roll with experience and then it is 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.830
 no problem anymore 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.630
 What venus say is exactly that now 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.760
 not everything I have been to 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.200
 had if one or 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.490
 other questions are new again 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.470
 I do not know any comments yet 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.600
 I would now somehow not fixed 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.750
 But I plan for next week 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.890
 just 1 planned because black ops 300 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.200
 announced but I want that in 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.610
 address the next topic and otherwise 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.860
 it may be that one or the other 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.140
 gta 5 video is coming now because am 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.720
 Tuesday is the official release 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.050
 on the pc many have already others 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.180
 Load feeling I would still make 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.130
 and personally got it can 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.910
 make for example about my sponsor in 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.560
 Europe 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.660
 then I get ten percent of the 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.400
 provision that is no extra 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.930
 extra costs or if you others 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.010
 want to bring players could be happy there 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.810
 do not support 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.910
 otherwise if we should not follow 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.110
 Also youtube channel as it may like 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.790
 I think this afternoon in 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.510
 Berlin again for two three hours Cisco 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.430
 stream live 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.080
 and then even with spectators 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.460
 play better than if you were still 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.150
 nobody should have done you can 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.310
 like to do that 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.140
 and yes to change the videos i hope 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.280
 fallen by it always says to 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.280
 next time your tip
