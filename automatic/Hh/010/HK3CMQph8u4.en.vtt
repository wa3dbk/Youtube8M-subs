00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
the next voice command is to look up

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.070 
the next voice command is to look up
definitions<00:03:37.480> so<00:03:38.480> this<00:03:38.600> is<00:03:38.720> somewhat<00:03:39.050> like

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
definitions so this is somewhat like

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.410 
definitions so this is somewhat like
doing<00:03:39.530> Google<00:03:39.740> search<00:03:40.070> but<00:03:40.460> you<00:03:40.940> get<00:03:41.150> special

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
doing Google search but you get special

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.720 
doing Google search but you get special
results<00:03:41.990> at<00:03:42.110> the<00:03:42.230> top<00:03:42.440> so<00:03:42.980> let's<00:03:43.010> say<00:03:43.400> if<00:03:43.610> we

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
results at the top so let's say if we

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.580 
results at the top so let's say if we
want<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:44.210> know<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.930> definition<00:03:45.050> of<00:03:45.470> a

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
want to know the definition of a

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.850 
want to know the definition of a
particular<00:03:46.130> word<00:03:46.370> you<00:03:47.090> can<00:03:47.270> just<00:03:47.510> ask<00:03:47.990> through

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
particular word you can just ask through

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.170 
particular word you can just ask through
the<00:03:48.980> Google<00:03:49.220> search<00:03:49.370> which<00:03:49.550> is<00:03:49.580> here<00:03:49.850> and<00:03:50.060> it

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
the Google search which is here and it

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.150 
the Google search which is here and it
will<00:03:50.270> tell<00:03:50.570> you<00:03:50.720> so<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.380> command<00:03:51.680> for<00:03:51.830> this<00:03:51.980> is

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
will tell you so the command for this is

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.920 
will tell you so the command for this is
called<00:03:52.400> define<00:03:52.880> and<00:03:53.180> then<00:03:53.390> you<00:03:53.450> say<00:03:53.600> the<00:03:53.750> word

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
called define and then you say the word

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.560 
called define and then you say the word
so<00:03:54.620> for<00:03:54.800> example<00:03:55.250> tap<00:03:55.610> on<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:55.880> microphone<00:03:56.000> and

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
so for example tap on the microphone and

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:03.130 
so for example tap on the microphone and
I'm<00:03:56.810> gonna<00:03:56.930> say<00:03:57.730> define<00:03:58.730> suspicious<00:04:02.020> and<00:04:03.020> as

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
I'm gonna say define suspicious and as

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.620 
I'm gonna say define suspicious and as
you<00:04:03.230> can<00:04:03.410> see<00:04:03.620> now<00:04:03.800> it<00:04:04.160> will<00:04:04.280> load<00:04:04.490> up<00:04:04.520> and<00:04:04.910> as

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
you can see now it will load up and as

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.850 
you can see now it will load up and as
you<00:04:05.750> can<00:04:05.900> see<00:04:06.170> it<00:04:07.130> gave<00:04:07.370> me<00:04:07.490> the<00:04:07.610> results<00:04:08.860> with

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
you can see it gave me the results with

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:16.190 
you can see it gave me the results with
all<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:10.190> definitions

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.840 

in<00:04:17.200> some<00:04:17.530> cases<00:04:17.799> as<00:04:18.130> you<00:04:18.160> can<00:04:18.400> see<00:04:18.580> it<00:04:18.730> will

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
in some cases as you can see it will

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.470 
in some cases as you can see it will
even<00:04:19.030> give<00:04:19.870> you<00:04:19.900> voice<00:04:20.820> to<00:04:21.820> explain<00:04:22.210> to<00:04:22.330> you

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
even give you voice to explain to you

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.030 
even give you voice to explain to you
what<00:04:22.660> the<00:04:22.780> definition<00:04:23.290> is<00:04:23.380> this<00:04:23.590> even<00:04:23.860> works

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
what the definition is this even works

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.160 
what the definition is this even works
for<00:04:24.160> there<00:04:24.880> are<00:04:24.970> such<00:04:25.360> questions<00:04:25.840> we're<00:04:26.020> gonna

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
for there are such questions we're gonna

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.140 
for there are such questions we're gonna
have<00:04:26.290> a<00:04:26.320> look<00:04:26.440> at<00:04:26.590> this<00:04:26.710> in<00:04:27.010> the<00:04:27.130> next<00:04:27.310> command

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
have a look at this in the next command

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.540 
have a look at this in the next command
so<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:28.750> next<00:04:28.960> non<00:04:29.470> command<00:04:29.920> is<00:04:30.190> to<00:04:30.220> ask

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
so the next non command is to ask

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.220 
so the next non command is to ask
questions<00:04:31.150> now<00:04:31.420> this<00:04:31.630> doesn't<00:04:31.900> really<00:04:32.020> have<00:04:32.200> a

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
questions now this doesn't really have a

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.140 
questions now this doesn't really have a
particular<00:04:32.470> command<00:04:33.250> it<00:04:33.670> doesn't<00:04:34.000> have<00:04:34.090> a

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
particular command it doesn't have a

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.520 
particular command it doesn't have a
particular<00:04:34.660> word<00:04:34.840> which<00:04:35.020> you<00:04:35.110> need<00:04:35.200> to<00:04:35.260> say

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
basically just say a question and it

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.770 
basically just say a question and it
should<00:04:38.950> find<00:04:39.280> a<00:04:39.400> result<00:04:39.700> for<00:04:39.850> you<00:04:40.000> for<00:04:40.390> example

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
should find a result for you for example

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.280 
should find a result for you for example

shown so very useful the next command is

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.450 
shown so very useful the next command is
navigation<00:05:08.200> so<00:05:08.710> this<00:05:08.890> command<00:05:09.190> is<00:05:09.280> live

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
navigation so this command is live

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.300 
navigation so this command is live

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
which you are not aware of where the

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.830 
which you are not aware of where the
location<00:05:14.560> of<00:05:14.980> particular<00:05:15.490> places<00:05:15.850> you<00:05:16.630> can

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
location of particular places you can

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.230 
location of particular places you can
easily<00:05:17.290> navigate<00:05:17.410> to<00:05:17.860> it<00:05:18.010> through<00:05:18.430> voice<00:05:18.640> so

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
easily navigate to it through voice so

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.600 
easily navigate to it through voice so
for<00:05:19.480> example<00:05:19.930> I<00:05:20.080> want<00:05:20.800> to<00:05:20.919> navigate<00:05:21.070> to<00:05:21.490> the

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
for example I want to navigate to the

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.130 
for example I want to navigate to the
nearest<00:05:21.730> bus<00:05:22.090> station<00:05:22.300> so<00:05:22.690> let's<00:05:22.870> give<00:05:22.990> it<00:05:23.080> a

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
nearest bus station so let's give it a

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.560 
nearest bus station so let's give it a
try<00:05:23.320> the<00:05:23.980> command<00:05:24.220> for<00:05:24.430> this<00:05:24.550> is<00:05:24.730> navigate<00:05:25.540> to

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
try the command for this is navigate to

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.080 
try the command for this is navigate to
so<00:05:26.350> let's<00:05:26.530> give<00:05:26.860> it<00:05:26.919> a<00:05:26.980> try<00:05:27.190> tap<00:05:27.850> on<00:05:27.970> the

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
so let's give it a try tap on the

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.659 
so let's give it a try tap on the
microphone<00:05:28.480> again<00:05:28.630> and<00:05:29.020> also<00:05:29.890> for<00:05:30.310> this<00:05:30.460> you

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
microphone again and also for this you

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.870 
microphone again and also for this you
will<00:05:30.760> need<00:05:30.880> to<00:05:30.940> have<00:05:31.240> GPS<00:05:32.200> enabled<00:05:33.070> in<00:05:33.610> order

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
will need to have GPS enabled in order

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.340 
will need to have GPS enabled in order
to<00:05:34.030> for<00:05:34.300> it<00:05:34.390> to<00:05:34.419> navigate<00:05:34.720> and<00:05:35.140> scan<00:05:35.640> anyways

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
to for it to navigate and scan anyways

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.590 
to for it to navigate and scan anyways
open<00:05:38.350> up<00:05:38.470> the<00:05:38.590> microphone<00:05:39.130> and<00:05:39.340> say<00:05:40.060> navigate

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
open up the microphone and say navigate
