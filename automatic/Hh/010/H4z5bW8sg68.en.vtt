00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.259
 otherwise I would quickly have looked here on the map of a loved one 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.259
 the 2008 companion is underway 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.030
 9 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.900
 lidl 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.550
 9 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.550
 9 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.240
 the essence of homework plus that exactly 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.700
 to be in institute where children the students from school located around us 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.300
 moorish 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.300
 have been able to make the house under supervision after school 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.660
 There are many students there who are currently using it 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.660
 about thirty children per day for homework assistance 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.579
 that varies from children who come two days, only children who come five days 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.940
 And that will be a wrong in the first year of the incident all ages on this 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.940
 the children have from the first year of secondary school up to and including her probation 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:29.349
 students in the buoy seen today at school and I thought it was 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.900
 after the prime minister to the new students that comensha is always nice to see 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.390
 and 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.500
 for example, the kicks that mainly display life have some drama 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.650
 nothing with it but are also people who do not say everything still everything you 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.709
 tells the striker 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.389
 the girl was between the player and I already have three there is going to be this 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:46.959
 want to be a comedy actor circumcised 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.139
 and that's it is all show 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.639
 well i don't tell too many people 4 so much information every year 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:53.810
 do something to milk out 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.289
 that you can do your exam with shooting mail 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.289
 with the bridge large bridge was more a cleaner after the weak team 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.809
 afterwards I've been here for six years 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:07.770
 attend this school for five years 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.999
 don't be guilty 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:12.039
 the school 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:13.429
 always be 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:14.849
 and much more 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.459
 he has already scored twenty times there, and schools have collapsed 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.329
 Huub Koch 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.019
 the biggest part 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.189
 at the fair 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:42.689
 and all of them 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.449
 an ap 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:46.840
 get there 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.840
 the party congress in Arnhem 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:56.009
 this says that Piet Velthuizen is on when it's on 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:59.009
 I have been working on you in a completely different world 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.359
 standard hatch 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.889
 And that is wise that actually does not know exactly how much 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.889
 at least you would say that 

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:11.850
 found your talents 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.850
 with sitting here 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.940
 I see that you are busy with all sorts of chemical experiments later 

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:42.319
 is also better than having to figure out what jawad is 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:45.259
 also one in which way the more precise 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.259
 the first half of the money must also have to be put up 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.120
 in this yes 7 this time they were sure and investigations started there 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.600
 The lemon-flavored tap water feasts on both Bosnians each in the food 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:05.030
 throws later he also took other region does well but also think it will be 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.979
 even those of the evening it was busy seeing many students 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.979
 I've seen in the past I've even seen students 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:15.150
 I went to the high school where it was very busy I try 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.439
 yet all departments are somewhat frightening 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:21.319
 I think it is a successful evening this is all a bit 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:22.539
 enthusiastic 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:23.870
 I think so 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.110
 printed matter does 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.770
 more youth culture the new ford has modern media school 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.029
 what exactly is in it 

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:32.980
 but ugly modern media 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.300
 is working with modules from paul portes texel there is also written afterwards 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.499
 photo editing 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:43.689
 and then we get there maybe other times about a piece of website 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:44.370
 to work 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.620
 and we also heard a website 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.460
 so that is modern media and it is of course a fairly new profession and 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.949
 we are now able to be the students enthusiastic you can see there 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:58.129
 you see the his concerts the results were booked 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:02.399
 We always start the first lesson meter makes but a buyer is German 

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:03.819
 even imagine 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:07.089
 and from that point go to see what is a plus level of the 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:09.360
 students and then posted books 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.550
 it turned out that they are the first chapters 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.220
 neatly mastered 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.479
 the counter you know just chosen five hours to start and adjourned 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:18.800
 see the results behind you 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.759
 hour a beautiful beautiful result with 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:23.759
 everyone made with enthusiasm 

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:32.120
 when this financial impulse by the agents exactly engages the supporters 

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:35.860
 had additional refugees because it was also necessary to ensure that we 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.169
 the best to make but for the stock 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:41.740
 greenports abroad so that the leading group is in turn 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.060
 and that I always wonder is it is very difficult now with players 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.059
 went to have a nice look in the couple that finished March 9 

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:51.740
 other the cadets and the innocent 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.550
 a large part a jar itself is filled with water we put apartment 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.360
 let's say what is suddenly on the brake 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.779
 the school football can use the coloring agent to resist 

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:03.779
 in the minus on the hour they found the cost the basis 

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:06.020
 we have a problem 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.550
 the one looks very little compassionate 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.750
 set the viewer I think
