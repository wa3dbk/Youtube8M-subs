the<00:00:32.550> metal<00:00:33.149> work<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.110> was<00:00:34.260> quite<00:00:34.410> chuffed

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
the metal work so I was quite chuffed

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.190 
the metal work so I was quite chuffed
when<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:34.980> arrived<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.610> everything<00:00:36.239> seems<00:00:37.079> to

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
when it arrived and everything seems to

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.530 
when it arrived and everything seems to
be<00:00:37.260> almost<00:00:37.500> as<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.010> thought<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.340> would<00:00:38.460> be<00:00:38.610> one

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
be almost as I thought it would be one

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.790 
be almost as I thought it would be one
of<00:00:39.600> my<00:00:39.690> brackets<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.260> double<00:00:40.350> wrong<00:00:40.680> my

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
of my brackets and double wrong my

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.760 
of my brackets and double wrong my
rounds<00:00:41.129> out<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.460> cutter<00:00:42.020> which<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.170> minor

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
rounds out the cutter which is a minor

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.139 
rounds out the cutter which is a minor
problem<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.399> since<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.760> got<00:00:44.879> around<00:00:44.940> that

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
problem but since it got around that

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.959 
problem but since it got around that
okay<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> moment<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.800> pour<00:00:47.070> all<00:00:47.250> these<00:00:47.460> wild

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.100 

bolts<00:00:50.969> screws<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> end<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:54.050> the<00:00:55.050> idea

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
bolts screws on the end of it the idea

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.170 
bolts screws on the end of it the idea
being<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.160> didn't<00:00:56.489> really<00:00:56.730> want<00:00:57.090> to

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
being is that I didn't really want to

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.290 
being is that I didn't really want to
put<00:00:57.390> any<00:00:57.570> glass<00:00:58.199> or<00:00:58.620> or<00:00:59.100> anything<00:00:59.789> wooden<00:01:00.180> top

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
put any glass or or anything wooden top

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.180 
put any glass or or anything wooden top
here<00:01:00.539> because<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.899> want<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.559> whole<00:01:01.739> place<00:01:02.039> to

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
here because I want the whole place to

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.090 
here because I want the whole place to
look<00:01:02.340> fairly<00:01:03.149> spacious<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:04.019> open<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:05.040> I

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
look fairly spacious and open and I

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.620 
look fairly spacious and open and I
don't<00:01:05.280> want<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.640> sound<00:01:05.820> too<00:01:06.060> echoey<00:01:06.420> as

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
don't want it to sound too echoey as

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.609 
don't want it to sound too echoey as
well<00:01:06.840> because<00:01:07.049> there's<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> lot<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.470> hard

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
well because there's a lot of hard

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.039 
well because there's a lot of hard
surfaces<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.369> more<00:01:08.909> glass<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.510> think<00:01:09.540> would

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
surfaces and more glass I think would

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.109 
surfaces and more glass I think would
would<00:01:10.740> mean<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.070> would<00:01:11.159> be<00:01:11.189> quite<00:01:11.460> echoing<00:01:11.939> so

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
would mean it would be quite echoing so

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.399 
would mean it would be quite echoing so
that's<00:01:12.450> why<00:01:12.600> we've<00:01:12.750> gone<00:01:12.869> with<00:01:13.049> way<00:01:13.229> up

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
that's why we've gone with way up

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.810 
that's why we've gone with way up
I<00:01:14.960> found<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.080> Riggin<00:01:16.380> wire<00:01:16.560> system<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.610> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
I found the Riggin wire system on the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.719 
I found the Riggin wire system on the
internet<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.930> basically<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.799> get<00:01:20.009> wire<00:01:20.369> with

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
internet and basically you get wire with

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.609 
internet and basically you get wire with
various<00:01:21.180> different<00:01:21.540> ends<00:01:21.900> connected<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.560> it

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
various different ends connected to it

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.200 
various different ends connected to it
and<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.400> just<00:01:23.610> thread<00:01:23.970> them<00:01:24.180> through

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
and you just thread them through

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.030 
and you just thread them through
whatever<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.140> want<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.320> throw<00:01:25.439> through<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.860> my

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
whatever you want to throw through in my

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.609 
whatever you want to throw through in my
case<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.520> balustrade<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.259> then<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.380> cut

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
case the balustrade and then you cut

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:39.480 
case the balustrade and then you cut
them<00:01:28.770> with<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:28.979> special<00:01:29.579> pliers

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.219 

the<00:01:40.490> ends<00:01:40.790> are<00:01:40.850> then<00:01:41.000> finished<00:01:41.450> off<00:01:41.659> with<00:01:41.930> a

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
the ends are then finished off with a

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.109 
the ends are then finished off with a
special<00:01:42.439> fitting<00:01:42.979> which<00:01:43.159> uses<00:01:43.549> grub<00:01:43.820> screws

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
special fitting which uses grub screws

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.359 
special fitting which uses grub screws
to<00:01:44.329> clamp<00:01:44.600> on<00:01:44.840> to<00:01:45.049> the<00:01:45.140> wire<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:45.619> then<00:01:46.250> you

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
to clamp on to the wire and then you

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.249 
to clamp on to the wire and then you
screw<00:01:46.700> it<00:01:46.790> into<00:01:47.000> a<00:01:47.240> threaded<00:01:47.780> fitting<00:01:48.170> that

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
screw it into a threaded fitting that

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.080 
screw it into a threaded fitting that
goes<00:01:48.439> into<00:01:48.649> the<00:01:48.830> wall<00:01:49.009> it's<00:01:49.640> really<00:01:49.729> quite

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
goes into the wall it's really quite

00:01:50.090 --> 00:02:11.920 
goes into the wall it's really quite
clever<00:02:09.729> so<00:02:10.729> this<00:02:10.880> is<00:02:11.000> move-in<00:02:11.480> day

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
clever so this is move-in day

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.850 
clever so this is move-in day
I<00:02:12.670> have<00:02:13.670> no<00:02:13.880> fixed<00:02:14.150> abode<00:02:14.360> as<00:02:14.989> of<00:02:15.260> 12<00:02:15.560> o'clock
