actually two ways of add mating on the
first<00:00:09.570> way<00:00:09.750> is<00:00:10.280> inside<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.639> animator<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.719> the

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
first way is inside the animator and the

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.799 
first way is inside the animator and the
second<00:00:13.530> way<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.679> by<00:00:13.920> scripting<00:00:14.580> so<00:00:14.969> I'm<00:00:15.599> going

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
second way is by scripting so I'm going

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.570

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
easier to work with snout animate object

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.720 
easier to work with snout animate object
we<00:00:34.260> need<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.469> click<00:00:34.680> on<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.250> I'm<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.489> going

now<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.790> going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> add<00:01:12.240> its<00:01:12.689> position<00:01:13.380> to

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
now this is going to add its position to

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.179 
now this is going to add its position to
this<00:01:14.250> keyframe<00:01:14.580> here<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.470> so<00:01:16.470> now<00:01:16.650> let's<00:01:16.950> go<00:01:17.159> to

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
this keyframe here so so now let's go to

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.230 
this keyframe here so so now let's go to
let's<00:01:18.030> say<00:01:18.330> 2<00:01:19.259> seconds<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.130> let's<00:01:20.640> click<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:21.030> 2

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
let's say 2 seconds so let's click on 2

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.140 
let's say 2 seconds so let's click on 2
seconds<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.470> let's<00:01:22.799> move<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.250> cube<00:01:23.729> a

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
seconds and let's move this cube a

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.350 
seconds and let's move this cube a
little<00:01:24.659> bit<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.439> left<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.189> it's<00:01:27.060> going<00:01:27.270> to

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
little bit to the left and it's going to

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.039 
little bit to the left and it's going to
automatically<00:01:28.080> create<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.920> keyframe<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:30.049> let's

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
automatically create a keyframe so let's

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.319 
automatically create a keyframe so let's
close<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.009> let's<00:01:33.000> play<00:01:34.159> this<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.610> boom

close this and let's play this and boom
you<00:01:36.720> see<00:01:36.930> your<00:01:37.140> cube<00:01:37.530> start<00:01:37.920> started<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.759> move

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
you see your cube start started to move

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.020 
you see your cube start started to move
and<00:01:39.350> click<00:01:40.350> on<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.619> animation<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:42.000> can

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
and click on the animation you can

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.740 
and click on the animation you can
actually<00:01:42.750> set<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.409> loop<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:44.420> if<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.659> have

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750

like I know some so if wants your
animation<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.899> loop<00:01:49.049> that's<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.710> way<00:01:50.180> that's

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
animation to loop that's the way that's

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.249 
animation to loop that's the way that's
the<00:01:51.390> way<00:01:51.420> you're<00:01:51.689> going<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.899> do<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.729> yeah

show you how to animate by script so
let's<00:02:01.469> just<00:02:01.770> leave<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.250> clip<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:04.200> let's

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
let's just leave this clip and let's

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.920 
let's just leave this clip and let's
create<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.280> new<00:02:05.340> script<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.450> right<00:02:06.780> click

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
create a new script so right click

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.720 
create a new script so right click
create<00:02:07.680> JavaScript<00:02:08.489> oh<00:02:09.289> dang<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.619> sir

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
create JavaScript oh dang that sir

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.820 
create JavaScript oh dang that sir
c-sharp<00:02:12.390> scripts<00:02:14.840> want<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:16.019> JavaScript<00:02:16.590> like

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
c-sharp scripts want a JavaScript like

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.000 
c-sharp scripts want a JavaScript like
this<00:02:16.950> one<00:02:17.129> okay<00:02:17.400> so<00:02:17.580> let's<00:02:18.180> name<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.450> a

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
this one okay so let's name it a

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:27.130 
this one okay so let's name it a
animation<00:02:20.120> test<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:23.810> let's<00:02:24.810> bring<00:02:25.019> it<00:02:25.140> up

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
animation test and let's bring it up

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.850 
animation test and let's bring it up
also<00:02:29.360> let's<00:02:30.360> attach<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:31.049> through<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.739> the

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
also let's attach this through to the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.320 
also let's attach this through to the
cube<00:02:32.129> so<00:02:32.340> we<00:02:32.430> don't<00:02:32.610> forget<00:02:32.760> it

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
cube so we don't forget it

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:41.869 
cube so we don't forget it
okay<00:02:33.599> so<00:02:36.650> okay<00:02:37.650> so<00:02:37.829> um<00:02:38.400> let's<00:02:39.269> remove<00:02:39.720> this<00:02:40.879> ok

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
okay so okay so um let's remove this ok

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.319 
okay so okay so um let's remove this ok
so<00:02:42.110> inside<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.349> function<00:02:44.040> update<00:02:44.670> what<00:02:45.180> we

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
so inside the function update what we

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.710 
so inside the function update what we
can<00:02:45.510> do<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:46.110> move<00:02:46.319> the<00:02:46.680> object<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.400> by<00:02:47.760> typing

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
can do to move the object is by typing

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.039 
can do to move the object is by typing
in<00:02:48.900> transform<00:02:49.849> dot<00:02:50.849> rotate<00:02:51.629> and<00:02:53.660> let's<00:02:54.660> put

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
in transform dot rotate and let's put

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:00.140 
in transform dot rotate and let's put
something<00:02:55.500> like<00:02:56.450> zero<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:58.910> let's<00:02:59.910> make<00:03:00.090> it

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
something like zero and let's make it

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.930 
something like zero and let's make it
rotate<00:03:00.540> like<00:03:01.879> two<00:03:02.879> times<00:03:03.739> time<00:03:04.739> dot<00:03:05.160> delta

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
rotate like two times time dot delta

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.990 
rotate like two times time dot delta
time<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.959> let's<00:03:07.799> save<00:03:08.280> that<00:03:09.319> and<00:03:10.319> let's<00:03:10.940> try<00:03:11.940> it

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
time so let's save that and let's try it

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.039 
time so let's save that and let's try it
out<00:03:12.530> so<00:03:14.329> as<00:03:15.530> you<00:03:16.530> guys<00:03:16.650> can<00:03:16.859> see<00:03:16.919> it's<00:03:17.370> rotating

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
out so as you guys can see it's rotating

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:23.409 
out so as you guys can see it's rotating
it's<00:03:19.049> pretty<00:03:19.290> slow<00:03:19.650> but<00:03:20.569> yeah<00:03:21.569> we<00:03:22.139> can<00:03:22.380> like

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
it's pretty slow but yeah we can like

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:28.150 
it's pretty slow but yeah we can like
make<00:03:24.419> it<00:03:24.840> well<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.290> don't<00:03:25.560> know<00:03:25.620> what's<00:03:25.859> say<00:03:26.099> ten
