00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.820
 we have new arnold movie 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.210
 schwarzenegger the first thing we have 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.630
 that being a trailer the title was going to be 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.550
 ten but in the end they have changed 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.790
 sabotage 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:18.610
 that I do say it well and it's the story of 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.330
 a few corrupt cops that you see 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.970
 who are left with the money seized from 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.939
 of a drug trafficker or something like that 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:32.110
 then we do not know how to divide up what 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:34.989
 do with it and then it is falling from one in 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.290
 one is ten policemen and you do not know 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.690
 who has is the killer before 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.690
 called ten because it was based on the 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.120
 agatha christie's account of the ten 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.879
 negritos that I think the story if I do not 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.870
 wrong is about some characters that are 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:55.989
 cited to spend a weekend in a 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.570
 island do not know who has 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:02.680
 invited and then they go they are dying of one 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.600
 in one a bit similar to the argument of 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.200
 in hunters of minds I think that 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.290
 the movie called something like that in the 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.080
 cast aside as the falsetto 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.780
 we can find sam worthington the 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.110
 protagonist of 'avatar' completely 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:25.080
 peeled and with a very rare knob 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.890
 I wish that is later to your blog 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.840
 He leaves with about 100 appointments and wearing 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.530
 capture with you gives you a host and to 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.830
 that does not have two who else knows what goes out 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.440
 me of the enos the protagonist of the series 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.590
 the killing and that of brad woman 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.479
 pitt in of a world zeta also 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.580
 we have to have howard that was the 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.210
 castilla de guerra de guerra on ironman 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.830
 one 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.690
 olivia williams and then as for the 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.000
 deal is already 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.690
 who is the director of the director is 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.220
 davis yesterday that was the screenwriter of the 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.970
 movie, I like it a lot, it's 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.479
 training day 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.660
 he was also the director of knock watch and 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.880
 I think they put him without truce director 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.720
 that he likes the theme of the police 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.080
 corrupt and this roll and that figure as 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.240
 co-writer the thriller the trailer is 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.570
 it's pretty good it looks like having 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.550
 enough action that the actors are 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.010
 more or less pretty good and 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.160
 competent you can can be 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.530
 pretty good the movie the bad thing because 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.680
 the other screenwriter of the movie in the 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.140
 portal where the skip woods and has been the 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.990
 screenwriter of the pieces of landmarks that 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.390
 is that we are going to hit him 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.390
 and lock him in a hole why the guys 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.340
 it's bad from the bad radial 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.720
 in the two movies that I hate this 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:00.660
 uncle are haiti men origins wolf that 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.209
 is that I do not buy it is not the 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.970
 I do not want it I do not want to erase it 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.070
 of my mind and the other one is with the last 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.650
 practice have made crystal jungle ' 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.520
 a good day to die a good day to 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.940
 die 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.910
 what a disgust movie is out there 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.550
 bruce willis see your uncle the son no 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.770
 Charisma has the value that I do not care 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.500
 it does not matter if it is loaded hard 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.840
 is loaded in 100 the blues willie seems 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.080
 that there is no danger, it seems that 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.080
 is there 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.159
 finally a disgust then I hope that the 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:41.060
 rewriting where the director of the 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:44.209
 levitate movie yesterday so I have more 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.209
 weight that the skip woods script and not 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.280
 can leave a movie more or less how much 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.530
 less entertaining because between cast and 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.650
 in the director at least he paints well 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:58.010
 thing and then nothing more to say I leave you 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.290
 the link of the trailer here below and see 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.099
 when it opens and see if the movie and 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.620
 it is part of the ball if the balance 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.870
 falls in the weight of the weak yesterday that as 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.120
 scriptwriter and director has movies or 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.920
 fall on the side of the scales of scripts 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.269
 that we fight for me not to write 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.250
 millions that do not reproduce 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.220
 absolutely nothing and you miss out on 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.260
 him and nothing more to say give like 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.910
 subscribe to the channel and see all the 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.910
