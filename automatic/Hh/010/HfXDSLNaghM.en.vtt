00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
all right I have to get rained out and I

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.120 
all right I have to get rained out and I
ran<00:00:23.760> out<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.119> boards<00:00:24.689> right<00:00:25.470> there<00:00:25.710> close<00:00:26.070> to

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
ran out of boards right there close to

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.019 
ran out of boards right there close to
the<00:00:26.369> corner<00:00:27.740> what<00:00:28.740> it's<00:00:29.250> looking<00:00:29.580> pretty<00:00:29.730> good

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
the corner what it's looking pretty good

the corner what it's looking pretty good
I'm<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:34.070> think<00:00:35.719> it's<00:00:36.719> turning<00:00:36.870> out<00:00:37.140> pretty<00:00:37.290> good

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
week so I can't go get boards and work

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.700 
week so I can't go get boards and work
out<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.190> rain<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:48.079> it<00:00:49.079> comes<00:00:49.230> stopped<00:00:49.469> here

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
inside and where the gate is one happy

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.840 
inside and where the gate is one happy
okay<00:01:10.650> honey<00:01:10.830> tell<00:01:11.070> there's<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.340> gate<00:01:11.520> can<00:01:11.760> you

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
okay honey tell there's a gate can you

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.130 
okay honey tell there's a gate can you
stay<00:01:14.850> here<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.090> twelve-foot<00:01:15.689> gate<00:01:15.869> right<00:01:16.080> there

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
stay here a twelve-foot gate right there

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.020 
stay here a twelve-foot gate right there
Emily<00:01:17.540> all<00:01:18.540> right<00:01:19.250> that's<00:01:20.250> all<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.430> now

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.980 

well<00:01:24.030> I'm<00:01:24.420> finished<00:01:25.080> with<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.860> section<00:01:26.990> of

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
well I'm finished with this section of

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.090 
well I'm finished with this section of
the<00:01:28.170> fence<00:01:28.619> are<00:01:29.189> basically<00:01:30.150> finished

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
the fence are basically finished

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.210 
the fence are basically finished
that's<00:01:32.100> no<00:01:32.430> walkthrough<00:01:33.090> gate<00:01:34.130> from<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
that's no walkthrough gate from the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.050 
that's no walkthrough gate from the
inside<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:36.030> course<00:01:36.650> in<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.950> section<00:01:38.700> leading

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
inside of course in the section leading

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.840 
inside of course in the section leading
from<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.270> walk<00:01:39.540> through<00:01:40.170> over<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.340> corner

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
from the walk through over to the corner

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:51.539 
from the walk through over to the corner
and<00:01:43.880> then<00:01:46.369> then<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.490> turns<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.149> goes<00:01:48.299> down

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.770 

for<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.780> gate<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.869> I<00:01:56.049> got<00:01:56.229> two<00:01:56.439> gates<00:01:56.710> here

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
for the gate and I got two gates here

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.649 
for the gate and I got two gates here
they're<00:01:59.369> two<00:02:00.369> six-foot<00:02:01.090> gates<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:03.399> I<00:02:04.240> can't

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
they're two six-foot gates and I can't

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.029 
they're two six-foot gates and I can't
open<00:02:04.960> them<00:02:05.079> yet<00:02:05.259> so<00:02:05.289> I<00:02:05.439> don't<00:02:05.619> really<00:02:05.770> know<00:02:06.009> if

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
open them yet so I don't really know if

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.719 
open them yet so I don't really know if
they<00:02:06.929> if<00:02:07.929> I<00:02:08.110> got<00:02:08.289> them<00:02:08.410> right<00:02:08.619> or<00:02:08.799> not<00:02:08.920> because

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
they if I got them right or not because

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.850 
they if I got them right or not because
I<00:02:10.299> still<00:02:10.989> have<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.290> test<00:02:11.500> them<00:02:11.620> because<00:02:11.830> I

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
I still have to test them because I

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:19.170 
I still have to test them because I
think<00:02:12.069> I<00:02:13.230> have<00:02:14.370> this<00:02:15.370> board<00:02:16.950> screwed<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.400> this

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
think I have this board screwed to this

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.870 
think I have this board screwed to this
gate<00:02:21.330> on<00:02:22.330> all<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:23.049> way<00:02:23.230> down<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.880> I<00:02:25.630> think<00:02:26.260> I

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
gate on all the way down and I think I

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:34.110 
gate on all the way down and I think I
have<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:29.290> board<00:02:30.480> nailed<00:02:31.480> only<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.410> this<00:02:33.120> part

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
have this board nailed only to this part

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.339 
have this board nailed only to this part
of<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.329> gate<00:02:35.489> so<00:02:36.489> if<00:02:36.819> I<00:02:37.360> accidentally<00:02:38.140> got<00:02:38.290> a

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
of the gate so if I accidentally got a

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.120 
of the gate so if I accidentally got a
screw<00:02:38.680> into<00:02:38.890> one<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.400> these<00:02:39.579> on<00:02:39.970> this<00:02:40.180> side

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
screw into one of these on this side

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.720 
screw into one of these on this side
anywhere<00:02:42.130> down<00:02:42.370> or<00:02:43.410> in<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.620> center<00:02:44.890> or<00:02:45.190> the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
anywhere down or in the center or the

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.729 
anywhere down or in the center or the
other<00:02:45.970> end<00:02:46.269> then<00:02:46.599> the<00:02:46.690> gates<00:02:46.900> won't<00:02:47.079> open<00:02:47.290> but

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
other end then the gates won't open but

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.100 
other end then the gates won't open but
I<00:02:47.799> think<00:02:48.069> I<00:02:48.160> got<00:02:48.340> them<00:02:48.430> right<00:02:48.750> but<00:02:49.750> right<00:02:49.900> now

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
I think I got them right but right now

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.660 
I think I got them right but right now
I've<00:02:50.319> got<00:02:50.349> this<00:02:51.129> post<00:02:51.579> stuck<00:02:51.879> in<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.090> ground

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.039 

to<00:02:55.180> give<00:02:55.900> me<00:02:55.989> something<00:02:56.260> to<00:02:56.440> push<00:02:57.370> against

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
to give me something to push against

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.340 
to give me something to push against
while<00:02:59.049> I<00:02:59.079> was<00:02:59.410> building<00:02:59.620> the<00:03:00.120> fence<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:02.079> I

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
while I was building the fence and I

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:09.330 
while I was building the fence and I
also<00:03:02.560> have<00:03:04.049> two<00:03:05.049> screws<00:03:07.829> holding<00:03:08.829> the<00:03:09.100> two

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
also have two screws holding the two

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.319 
also have two screws holding the two
gates<00:03:09.579> together<00:03:11.700> so<00:03:12.700> I<00:03:12.730> haven't<00:03:13.000> really

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
gates together so I haven't really

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.229 
gates together so I haven't really
tested<00:03:13.600> two<00:03:13.989> gates<00:03:14.200> yet<00:03:14.470> but<00:03:14.829> that's<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:16.030> back

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
tested two gates yet but that's the back

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:23.280 
tested two gates yet but that's the back
side<00:03:16.600> of<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:18.400> fence<00:03:20.819> and<00:03:21.819> with<00:03:22.299> the<00:03:22.569> deadly

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
side of the fence and with the deadly

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.229 
side of the fence and with the deadly
and<00:03:23.470> in<00:03:23.560> front<00:03:23.799> of<00:03:23.859> gate<00:03:24.069> now<00:03:26.400> but<00:03:27.400> at<00:03:27.549> the<00:03:28.060> back

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
and in front of gate now but at the back

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.190 
and in front of gate now but at the back
side

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.730 

look<00:03:32.200> pretty<00:03:32.950> straight<00:03:34.500> everything<00:03:35.500> looks

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
look pretty straight everything looks

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.210 
look pretty straight everything looks
fairly<00:03:36.370> good<00:03:36.580> and<00:03:37.360> then<00:03:37.960> it<00:03:38.110> turns<00:03:38.500> and<00:03:39.070> goes

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
fairly good and then it turns and goes

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.570 
fairly good and then it turns and goes
back<00:03:39.520> toward<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:40.120> front<00:03:40.390> of<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.840> house<00:03:41.580> or

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
back toward the front of the house or

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.240 
back toward the front of the house or
toward<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.030> road<00:03:45.210> anyway<00:03:46.210> that's<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.660> inside

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
toward the road anyway that's the inside

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:56.490 
toward the road anyway that's the inside
let's<00:03:48.250> take<00:03:48.580> a<00:03:48.610> look<00:03:48.850> at<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.060> outside

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.590 

my<00:03:57.630> homemade<00:03:58.680> latch<00:03:59.850> um<00:04:00.850> I<00:04:01.060> know<00:04:01.120> I'm<00:04:01.420> gonna

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
my homemade latch um I know I'm gonna

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.490 
my homemade latch um I know I'm gonna
replace<00:04:01.990> that<00:04:03.390> right<00:04:04.390> now<00:04:04.630> it<00:04:04.810> serves<00:04:05.050> the

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
replace that right now it serves the

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:18.120 
replace that right now it serves the
purpose<00:04:08.820> was<00:04:09.820> t<00:04:10.060> it<00:04:10.090> in<00:04:16.410> all<00:04:17.410> right<00:04:17.560> from<00:04:17.980> the

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
purpose was t it in all right from the

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.550 
purpose was t it in all right from the
outside<00:04:18.579> there's<00:04:19.570> a<00:04:19.630> little<00:04:19.959> bump<00:04:20.140> here<00:04:20.260> I

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
outside there's a little bump here I

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.730 
outside there's a little bump here I
just<00:04:20.590> walked<00:04:21.010> through<00:04:22.500> and<00:04:23.500> then<00:04:25.740> little

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
just walked through and then little

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.210 
just walked through and then little
4-foot<00:04:27.310> walk<00:04:28.240> through<00:04:28.600> and<00:04:28.870> then<00:04:29.020> it<00:04:29.200> lines<00:04:29.920> up

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
4-foot walk through and then it lines up

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.910 
4-foot walk through and then it lines up
with<00:04:30.540> house<00:04:31.540> or<00:04:31.930> mobile<00:04:32.140> home<00:04:32.260> and<00:04:32.680> then<00:04:32.800> it

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
with house or mobile home and then it

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.280 
with house or mobile home and then it
turns<00:04:33.250> right<00:04:33.640> here<00:04:33.850> on<00:04:33.910> this<00:04:34.000> corner<00:04:34.330> and

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
turns right here on this corner and

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:45.840 
turns right here on this corner and
angles<00:04:35.860> in<00:04:36.070> toward<00:04:36.730> the<00:04:39.750> gates<00:04:41.880> there<00:04:44.850> right

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
angles in toward the gates there right

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.600 
angles in toward the gates there right
in<00:04:46.000> there<00:04:46.290> and<00:04:47.290> then<00:04:47.740> it<00:04:47.860> angles<00:04:48.220> back<00:04:48.400> out

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
in there and then it angles back out

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.610 
in there and then it angles back out
toward<00:04:49.230> toward<00:04:50.230> the<00:04:50.380> road<00:04:51.990> you<00:04:52.990> can<00:04:53.050> see<00:04:53.380> by

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
toward toward the road you can see by

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:00.780 
toward toward the road you can see by
the<00:04:53.680> land<00:04:54.400> more<00:04:54.820> than<00:04:55.060> anything<00:04:56.669> think<00:04:57.669> so<00:04:59.790> but

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
the land more than anything think so but

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:07.310 
the land more than anything think so but
anyway<00:05:02.280> done<00:05:03.280> with<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.669> fence<00:05:05.730> for<00:05:06.730> now

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
anyway done with the fence for now

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.200 
anyway done with the fence for now
eventually<00:05:08.320> we're<00:05:08.770> gonna<00:05:08.890> go<00:05:09.130> out<00:05:09.730> toward<00:05:10.150> the

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
eventually we're gonna go out toward the

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.620 
eventually we're gonna go out toward the
road<00:05:10.480> with<00:05:10.750> it<00:05:10.780> but<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:12.550> main<00:05:12.850> thing<00:05:13.240> is<00:05:13.270> we've

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
road with it but the main thing is we've

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
through with the outside part and then

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.190 
through with the outside part and then
we're<00:05:25.170> just<00:05:25.200> gonna<00:05:25.470> work<00:05:25.620> on<00:05:25.830> the<00:05:25.950> gate<00:05:27.200> and

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
we're just gonna work on the gate and

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.600 
we're just gonna work on the gate and

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:39.070 
get the hinges and what happy I'm happy
the<00:05:32.850> way<00:05:33.030> it<00:05:33.180> loose<00:05:35.750> but<00:05:36.750> that's<00:05:36.960> my<00:05:37.320> better
