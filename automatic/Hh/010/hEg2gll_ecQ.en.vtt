I<00:00:46.680> was<00:00:47.489> really<00:00:47.579> proud<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.360> waxing

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
I was really proud of it and like waxing

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.010 
I was really proud of it and like waxing
it<00:00:48.930> for<00:00:49.920> 42s<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> beginning<00:00:51.239> were<00:00:51.629> an

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
it for 42s in the beginning were an

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.900 
it for 42s in the beginning were an
option<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:52.980> then<00:00:53.070> they<00:00:53.190> evolved<00:00:53.550> into<00:00:53.760> their

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
option and then they evolved into their

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.299 
option and then they evolved into their
own<00:00:54.059> separate<00:00:54.539> model<00:00:54.989> right<00:00:55.140> correct<00:00:55.739> after<00:00:56.280> I

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
own separate model right correct after I

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.670 
own separate model right correct after I
think<00:00:56.550> 71<00:00:57.270> they<00:00:57.449> started<00:00:57.809> as<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> know<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.559> was

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
think 71 they started as a know it was

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.860 
think 71 they started as a know it was
an<00:00:58.770> option<00:00:58.859> package<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.750> think<00:01:00.750> it's

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
an option package I think it's

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.470 
an option package I think it's
interesting<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.940> muscle<00:01:02.940> cars<00:01:03.180> they<00:01:03.420> were

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
interesting that muscle cars they were

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.539 
interesting that muscle cars they were
cool<00:01:03.809> up<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.140> 68<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.739> then<00:01:04.799> they<00:01:04.949> were<00:01:05.070> cool<00:01:05.339> up

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
cool up to 68 and then they were cool up

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.260 
cool up to 68 and then they were cool up
to<00:01:05.670> 69<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.570> now<00:01:07.409> they're<00:01:07.740> 70<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.369> 70<00:01:08.820> ones<00:01:09.060> are

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
to 69 and now they're 70 and 70 ones are

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.240 
to 69 and now they're 70 and 70 ones are
being<00:01:09.420> embraced<00:01:09.900> by<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.590> community<00:01:11.130> why

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
being embraced by that the community why

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.640 
being embraced by that the community why
do<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.400> think<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.640> change<00:01:12.170> I'm<00:01:13.170> not<00:01:13.409> sure<00:01:13.619> I

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
do you think the change I'm not sure I

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.670 
do you think the change I'm not sure I
think<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.979> 70s<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.790> know<00:01:15.119> early<00:01:15.659> 70<00:01:16.140> was<00:01:16.409> your

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
think the 70s you know early 70 was your

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.800 
think the 70s you know early 70 was your
big<00:01:16.890> horsepower<00:01:17.159> year<00:01:17.520> 69<00:01:18.030> 70<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.540> know<00:01:18.689> what

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
big horsepower year 69 70 I know what

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.910 
big horsepower year 69 70 I know what
for<00:01:18.930> Oldsmobile<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.590> was<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.799> high

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
for Oldsmobile that was the high

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.910 
for Oldsmobile that was the high
horsepower<00:01:20.250> year<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.439> and<00:01:22.439> then<00:01:22.560> after<00:01:22.830> that

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
horsepower year and and then after that

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.440 
horsepower year and and then after that
I<00:01:22.979> think<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.310> know<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.490> starts<00:01:23.729> declining<00:01:23.909> and

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
I think you know it starts declining and

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.390 
I think you know it starts declining and
so<00:01:24.689> I'm<00:01:25.290> presumably<00:01:25.860> something<00:01:26.040> do<00:01:26.220> with<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
so I'm presumably something do with the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.770 
so I'm presumably something do with the
availability<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.970> cars<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.479> maybe<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
availability of cars and maybe the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.499 
availability of cars and maybe the
generation<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.650> getting<00:01:28.740> older<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:30.030> see<00:01:30.270> four

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
generation is getting older you see four

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.300 
generation is getting older you see four
four<00:01:30.720> twos<00:01:30.930> around<00:01:31.350> but<00:01:31.740> they're<00:01:31.920> they're<00:01:32.280> not

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
four twos around but they're they're not

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.490 
four twos around but they're they're not
everywhere<00:01:32.880> they're<00:01:33.119> not<00:01:33.329> rare<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.290> they're

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
everywhere they're not rare but they're

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.170 
everywhere they're not rare but they're
you<00:01:35.070> know<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.490> there's<00:01:35.670> not<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.790> whole<00:01:35.970> lot<00:01:36.150> of

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
you know that there's not a whole lot of

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.780 
you know that there's not a whole lot of
them<00:01:36.299> out<00:01:36.450> there<00:01:36.829> they<00:01:37.829> weren't<00:01:37.979> appreciated

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
them out there they weren't appreciated

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.550 
them out there they weren't appreciated
and<00:01:39.000> didn't<00:01:39.360> get<00:01:39.540> restored<00:01:39.720> enough<00:01:40.259> or<00:01:40.439> there

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
and didn't get restored enough or there

weren't enough to begin with or are we
gonna<00:01:42.990> see<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> lot<00:01:43.409> more<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.680> them<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:43.950> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
gonna see a lot more of them in the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.440 
gonna see a lot more of them in the
future<00:01:44.159> as<00:01:44.460> they<00:01:44.579> get<00:01:44.700> more<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.939> more<00:01:44.970> popular

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
future as they get more and more popular

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.450 
future as they get more and more popular
I<00:01:45.720> don't<00:01:46.710> think<00:01:46.829> there<00:01:46.920> were<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.130> many<00:01:47.250> of

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
I don't think there were that many of

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.740 
I don't think there were that many of
them<00:01:47.549> made<00:01:47.729> in<00:01:47.880> comparison<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.390> Chevelle's

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
them made in comparison to Chevelle's

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.539 
them made in comparison to Chevelle's
and<00:01:49.049> Camaros<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.500> stuff<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.460> you

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
and Camaros and stuff like that so you

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.760 
and Camaros and stuff like that so you
got<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> point<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:52.140> know<00:01:52.259> also<00:01:52.619> with

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
got to a point and you know also with

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.950 
got to a point and you know also with
the<00:01:52.860> enough<00:01:53.399> power<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.790> they're<00:01:54.509> not<00:01:54.630> exactly

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
the enough power and they're not exactly

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.359 
the enough power and they're not exactly
cornering<00:01:55.470> cars<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.890> think<00:01:55.950> people<00:01:56.159> have

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
cornering cars so I think people have

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.249 
cornering cars so I think people have
taken<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.700> lot<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.880> them<00:01:57.090> out<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.930> know<00:01:58.020> trying

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
taken a lot of them out you know trying

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.139 
taken a lot of them out you know trying
to<00:01:58.290> corner<00:01:58.649> with<00:01:58.829> them<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.250> wrecked<00:02:00.000> them

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
to corner with them and wrecked them

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.539 
to corner with them and wrecked them
straight<00:02:00.960> line<00:02:01.140> car<00:02:01.439> yep<00:02:01.829> straight<00:02:02.070> line<00:02:02.310> car

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
straight line car yep straight line car

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.310 
straight line car yep straight line car
line<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:02.969> up<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.240> stand<00:02:03.450> on<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.659> you're<00:02:03.930> okay

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
line it up and stand on it you're okay

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.170 
line it up and stand on it you're okay
so<00:02:04.740> it's<00:02:04.890> how<00:02:05.460> many<00:02:05.610> horsepower<00:02:05.880> on<00:02:06.149> this

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
so it's how many horsepower on this

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.080 
so it's how many horsepower on this
cubic<00:02:06.780> inches<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.829> 455<00:02:08.489> it's<00:02:08.940> been

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
cubic inches this is a 455 it's been

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.780 
cubic inches this is a 455 it's been
bored<00:02:09.360> out<00:02:09.509> 60<00:02:09.929> over<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.379> it's<00:02:10.530> actually<00:02:10.790> 468

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
bored out 60 over so it's actually 468

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.820 
bored out 60 over so it's actually 468
and<00:02:12.239> it's<00:02:13.080> now

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
and it's now

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.970 
and it's now
475<00:02:14.670> horsepower<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.480> 650<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.530> torque<00:02:16.710> they

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
475 horsepower and 650 of torque they

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.100 
475 horsepower and 650 of torque they
came<00:02:17.160> from<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.430> factory<00:02:17.880> with<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.570> W<00:02:18.870> 30

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
came from the factory with the W 30

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.230 
came from the factory with the W 30
option<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.680> came<00:02:19.830> from<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.040> factory<00:02:20.400> at<00:02:20.490> 370

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
option that came from the factory at 370

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.090 
option that came from the factory at 370
horsepower<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.870> 500<00:02:22.350> foot-pounds<00:02:22.740> of<00:02:22.800> torque

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
horsepower and 500 foot-pounds of torque

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.430 
horsepower and 500 foot-pounds of torque
so<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.610> W<00:02:23.940> 30<00:02:24.180> option<00:02:24.630> that's<00:02:24.780> what<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.140> is<00:02:25.170> is

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
so the W 30 option that's what it is is

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.990 
so the W 30 option that's what it is is
the<00:02:25.560> higher<00:02:25.710> horsepower<00:02:25.950> motor<00:02:26.430> correct

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
the higher horsepower motor correct

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.370 
the higher horsepower motor correct
higher<00:02:27.270> horsepower<00:02:27.750> motor<00:02:28.020> it's<00:02:28.290> the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
higher horsepower motor it's the

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.550 
higher horsepower motor it's the
fiberglass<00:02:28.680> outside<00:02:29.400> air<00:02:29.550> induction<00:02:29.820> hood

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
fiberglass outside air induction hood

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.810 
fiberglass outside air induction hood
fiberglass<00:02:31.560> fenders<00:02:31.770> or<00:02:32.070> plastic<00:02:32.490> fenders

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
fiberglass fenders or plastic fenders

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.700 
fiberglass fenders or plastic fenders
actually<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.200> automatic

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
actually and in the automatic

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.170 
actually and in the automatic
transmission<00:02:35.040> version<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.850> they<00:02:35.910> call<00:02:36.060> an

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
transmission version of it they call an

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.630 
transmission version of it they call an
OWI<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:37.440> that<00:02:37.950> was<00:02:38.070> a<00:02:38.100> little<00:02:38.310> stiffer

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
OWI and that was a little stiffer

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.170 
OWI and that was a little stiffer
shifting<00:02:39.230> box<00:02:40.230> trailing<00:02:40.710> arms<00:02:41.070> and<00:02:41.340> then<00:02:41.460> what

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
shifting box trailing arms and then what

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.600 
shifting box trailing arms and then what
they<00:02:42.360> what<00:02:42.780> they<00:02:42.930> called<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.620> precision

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
they what they called a precision

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.340 
they what they called a precision
matched<00:02:44.910> engine<00:02:45.360> where<00:02:45.480> they<00:02:45.600> measured<00:02:46.230> all

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
matched engine where they measured all

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.840 
matched engine where they measured all
the<00:02:46.380> components<00:02:47.010> was<00:02:47.130> kind<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.430> first<00:02:47.640> one

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
the components was kind of the first one

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.370 
the components was kind of the first one
that<00:02:48.240> I'm<00:02:48.420> aware<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:48.960> they<00:02:49.080> started

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
that I'm aware of that they started

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.020 
that I'm aware of that they started
actually<00:02:49.500> measuring<00:02:49.950> components<00:02:50.460> making

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
actually measuring components making

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.699 
actually measuring components making
sure<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.270> tolerances<00:02:51.720> were<00:02:51.870> even<00:02:52.260> throughout

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
sure the tolerances were even throughout

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.220 
sure the tolerances were even throughout
the<00:02:52.860> motor<00:02:53.120> when<00:02:54.120> you're<00:02:54.300> at<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.450> car<00:02:54.690> show<00:02:54.720> and

the motor when you're at a car show and
you're<00:02:55.470> you're<00:02:55.740> going<00:02:55.890> by<00:02:56.160> all<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.340> Camaros

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
you're you're going by all the Camaros

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.080 
you're you're going by all the Camaros
and<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.330> Chevelle's<00:02:58.040> do<00:02:59.040> they<00:02:59.160> see<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.580> as<00:02:59.790> as

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
and the Chevelle's do they see you as as

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.000 
and the Chevelle's do they see you as as
the<00:03:00.480> redheaded<00:03:00.840> stepchild<00:03:01.440> or<00:03:01.770> are<00:03:01.860> they

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
the redheaded stepchild or are they

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.970 
the redheaded stepchild or are they

embracing you into that community I

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.290 
embracing you into that community I
think<00:03:04.980> normally<00:03:05.520> at<00:03:05.610> car<00:03:05.820> shows<00:03:05.850> no<00:03:06.240> matter

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
think normally at car shows no matter

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.570 
think normally at car shows no matter
what<00:03:06.570> you<00:03:06.720> have<00:03:06.870> if<00:03:07.080> you've<00:03:07.260> taken<00:03:08.040> care<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.370> it

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
what you have if you've taken care of it

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.460 
what you have if you've taken care of it
they<00:03:08.700> respect<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.300> you<00:03:09.930> know<00:03:10.080> I<00:03:10.110> mean<00:03:10.170> you

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
they respect you you know I mean you

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.690 
they respect you you know I mean you
look<00:03:10.590> at<00:03:10.650> any<00:03:10.830> car<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.070> may<00:03:11.280> not<00:03:11.430> particularly

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
look at any car you may not particularly

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.100 
look at any car you may not particularly
like<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:12.060> car<00:03:12.240> but<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:12.480> respect<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.900> amount

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
like the car but you respect the amount

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.510 
like the car but you respect the amount
of<00:03:13.140> work<00:03:13.320> that's<00:03:13.500> gone<00:03:13.590> into<00:03:13.650> repairing<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:14.400> or
