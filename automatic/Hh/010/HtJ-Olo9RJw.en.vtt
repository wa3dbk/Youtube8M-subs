00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
into my eyebrows now is that my okay

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.440 
into my eyebrows now is that my okay
eyebrows<00:01:12.450> I'm<00:01:12.780> just<00:01:13.260> gonna<00:01:13.700> lightly<00:01:14.700> go<00:01:15.180> in

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
eyebrows I'm just gonna lightly go in

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.359 
eyebrows I'm just gonna lightly go in
with<00:01:16.070> brown<00:01:17.330> because<00:01:18.330> my<00:01:19.290> hair<00:01:19.619> color<00:01:20.040> is

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
with brown because my hair color is

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.600

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.590 
this would be a better look than going
