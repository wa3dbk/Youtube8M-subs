00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.640 
you know I was like you know what
usually<00:04:22.120> typically<00:04:22.720> I<00:04:22.810> would<00:04:22.900> go<00:04:23.260> for<00:04:23.289> it

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
usually typically I would go for it

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.050 
usually typically I would go for it
because<00:04:23.740> he<00:04:23.919> does<00:04:24.099> get<00:04:24.250> bought<00:04:24.430> at<00:04:24.550> halftime
