bracket comes with each of these and
it's<00:00:12.630> fairly<00:00:12.960> simple<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.469> install<00:00:13.590> into<00:00:13.980> a

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
it's fairly simple to install into a

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.010 
it's fairly simple to install into a
bike<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.460> simply<00:00:14.759> just<00:00:14.940> put<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.540> on<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.750> frame

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
bike you simply just put it on the frame

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.990 
bike you simply just put it on the frame
you<00:00:16.260> slide<00:00:16.830> your<00:00:17.039> lock<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.430> through<00:00:17.730> the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
you slide your lock in through the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.550 
you slide your lock in through the
mechanism<00:00:18.630> there<00:00:18.840> I'll<00:00:19.080> show<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.350> how<00:00:19.529> all

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
mechanism there I'll show you how all

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.880 
mechanism there I'll show you how all
that<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.100> done<00:00:20.779> momentarily<00:00:21.779> but<00:00:22.470> first<00:00:22.529> we're

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
that is done momentarily but first we're

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:23.840 
that is done momentarily but first we're
going<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.039> show<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.279> how<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.640> actually

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
going to show you how this actually

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.820 
going to show you how this actually
operates<00:00:24.420> as<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:24.779> can<00:00:24.900> see<00:00:25.050> here<00:00:25.350> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
operates as you can see here the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.130 
operates as you can see here the
brackets<00:00:26.279> go<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.640> through<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.119> back<00:00:27.480> here<00:00:27.779> you

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
brackets go in through the back here you

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.390 
brackets go in through the back here you
can<00:00:28.260> see<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.710> where<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.010> tighten<00:00:29.340> them

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
can see this is where you tighten them

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.810 
can see this is where you tighten them
up<00:00:29.550> with<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> flathead<00:00:30.240> screwdriver<00:00:31.520> like<00:00:32.520> so

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
up with a flathead screwdriver like so

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.190 
up with a flathead screwdriver like so
righty<00:00:33.719> tighty<00:00:33.930> lefty<00:00:34.230> loosey

righty tighty lefty loosey

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.350 
righty tighty lefty loosey
after<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.290> remove<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.920> from<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.730> bracket

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
after you remove this from the bracket

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.760 
after you remove this from the bracket
itself<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:39.989> what<00:00:40.260> you'll<00:00:40.379> be<00:00:40.410> fitting

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
itself this is what you'll be fitting

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.500 
itself this is what you'll be fitting
the<00:00:40.860> locking<00:00:41.190> mechanism<00:00:41.640> through<00:00:41.910> like<00:00:42.210> this

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the locking mechanism through like this

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.690 
the locking mechanism through like this
and<00:00:42.750> operates<00:00:43.440> with<00:00:43.620> flathead<00:00:43.980> screws<00:00:44.340> which

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
and operates with flathead screws which

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.910 
and operates with flathead screws which
allow<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.180> open<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.260> as<00:00:46.350> wide<00:00:46.530> as<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.680> need

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
allow you to open it as wide as you need

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.420

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.600 
it works okay now we're going to go
ahead<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.380> put<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:07.710> our<00:01:07.830> bike<00:01:08.040> usually

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
ahead and put this on our bike usually

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.460 
ahead and put this on our bike usually
pick<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> nice<00:01:09.000> clean<00:01:09.930> area<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.290> frame

pick a nice clean area of the frame
we're<00:01:10.650> going<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.860> use<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.189> area<00:01:11.520> here<00:01:12.020> you

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
we're going to use this area here you

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.810 
we're going to use this area here you
simply<00:01:13.260> slide<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.799> around<00:01:13.920> make<00:01:14.580> sure<00:01:14.700> you're

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
simply slide it around make sure you're

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.690 
simply slide it around make sure you're
not<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.119> go<00:01:15.360> over<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> cable<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.229> then<00:01:16.920> put<00:01:17.640> it

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
not to go over the cable and then put it

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.330 
not to go over the cable and then put it
into<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.970> slots<00:01:18.240> back<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.950> that<00:01:19.950> back<00:01:20.130> side

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
into the slots back on that back side

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.890 
into the slots back on that back side
here<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:20.820> show<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.150> earlier<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.810> then

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
here as we show it earlier and then

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.070 
here as we show it earlier and then
tighten<00:01:22.200> down<00:01:22.229> with<00:01:22.380> these<00:01:22.619> two<00:01:22.680> screws<00:01:23.130> here

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
tighten down with these two screws here

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.520 
tighten down with these two screws here
just<00:01:25.080> about<00:01:25.290> tighten<00:01:25.740> as<00:01:25.860> far<00:01:26.640> as<00:01:26.759> we<00:01:26.909> can<00:01:27.030> go

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
just about tighten as far as we can go

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.539 
just about tighten as far as we can go
at<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.680> point<00:01:28.890> it's<00:01:29.009> probably<00:01:29.189> good<00:01:29.460> to

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
at this point it's probably good to

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.039 
at this point it's probably good to
adjust<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.000> kind<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.299> where<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.600> want<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.930> to

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
adjust it kind of where you want it to

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.969 
adjust it kind of where you want it to
be<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:32.960> notice<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> excess<00:01:34.409> here<00:01:34.619> at<00:01:34.799> this

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
be I notice the excess here at this

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.469 
be I notice the excess here at this
point<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.400> would<00:01:35.460> actually<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.820> slicing<00:01:36.240> this

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
point you would actually be slicing this

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.880 
point you would actually be slicing this
off<00:01:36.659> take<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> pair<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.200> scissors<00:01:37.409> shears

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
off take a pair of scissors shears

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.649 
off take a pair of scissors shears
whatever<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.670> can<00:01:38.790> find<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.329> cut<00:01:39.509> these
