00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
you'll notice on this frame that there

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:25.440 
you'll notice on this frame that there
is<00:01:20.829> one<00:01:21.159> flat<00:01:21.460> edge<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:24.149> there<00:01:25.149> is<00:01:25.270> one

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
is one flat edge and there is one

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.819 
is one flat edge and there is one
pointed<00:01:26.409> edge<00:01:28.350> basically<00:01:29.350> these<00:01:29.469> are<00:01:29.530> to

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
pointed edge basically these are to

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.379 
pointed edge basically these are to
space<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.609> frames<00:01:30.880> out

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:31.389 
space the frames out

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:34.319 
space the frames out
should<00:01:32.200> be<00:01:32.289> one<00:01:32.439> pointing<00:01:32.889> up<00:01:33.069> and<00:01:33.329> one

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
should be one pointing up and one

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.569 
should be one pointing up and one
pointing<00:01:34.719> down<00:01:34.899> first<00:01:35.560> thing<00:01:35.710> you<00:01:35.889> do<00:01:36.009> then<00:01:36.219> is

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
pointing down first thing you do then is

you lay it on the on your bench so using

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.870 
you lay it on the on your bench so using
the<00:01:39.520> GIMP<00:01:39.700> pins<00:01:41.219> place<00:01:42.219> it<00:01:42.369> on<00:01:42.429> the<00:01:42.520> flat<00:01:42.700> edge

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
the GIMP pins place it on the flat edge

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:51.300 
the GIMP pins place it on the flat edge
and<00:01:43.270> you<00:01:43.719> put<00:01:43.899> the<00:01:43.990> nail<00:01:44.170> in<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:51.009> don't<00:01:51.189> have

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.720 

nice<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.640> snug<00:03:25.880> to<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.780> button<00:03:27.110> and<00:03:27.260> then<00:03:27.950> you

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
nice and snug to the button and then you

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.050 
nice and snug to the button and then you
can<00:03:28.760> see<00:03:29.090> now<00:03:29.270> I<00:03:29.300> have<00:03:29.450> bent<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:30.200> lugs<00:03:30.620> round

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
can see now I have bent the lugs round

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.670 
can see now I have bent the lugs round
because<00:03:32.060> we<00:03:32.630> take<00:03:32.810> this<00:03:32.990> bar<00:03:33.200> that<00:03:33.230> we<00:03:33.470> moved

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
because we take this bar that we moved

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.180 
because we take this bar that we moved
out<00:03:33.890> of<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:34.280> top<00:03:34.940> bar<00:03:35.120> earlier<00:03:35.510> and<00:03:36.410> we<00:03:36.950> push

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
out of the top bar earlier and we push

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.080 
out of the top bar earlier and we push
it<00:03:38.230> over<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.320> top<00:03:39.500> of<00:03:39.530> them<00:03:39.740> which<00:03:40.520> traps<00:03:40.850> them

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
it over the top of them which traps them

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.870 
it over the top of them which traps them
that<00:03:41.330> holds<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:41.900> wax<00:03:42.110> in<00:03:42.440> place<00:03:42.680> so<00:03:43.670> that<00:03:43.790> if

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
that holds the wax in place so that if

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.540 
that holds the wax in place so that if
it<00:03:44.000> is<00:03:44.030> slightly<00:03:44.420> loose<00:03:44.600> it<00:03:44.840> won't<00:03:44.990> move

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
it is slightly loose it won't move

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.490 
it is slightly loose it won't move
around<00:03:46.550> so<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.150> trick<00:03:47.330> is<00:03:47.510> to<00:03:47.720> nail<00:03:48.470> it

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
around so the trick is to nail it

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.910 
around so the trick is to nail it
through<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.520> lug<00:03:49.959> in<00:03:50.959> each<00:03:51.200> of<00:03:51.380> these<00:03:51.470> videos

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
through the lug in each of these videos

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.900 
through the lug in each of these videos
that<00:03:51.950> they<00:03:52.220> make<00:03:52.430> through<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.120> wax<00:03:53.300> flow<00:03:54.910> just

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
that they make through the wax flow just

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:10.530 
that they make through the wax flow just
take<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.300> in<00:03:56.480> just<00:04:03.850> need<00:04:04.850> to<00:04:04.940> do<00:04:05.030> two<00:04:05.270> more<00:04:05.300> and

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:21.009 

then<00:04:11.540> third<00:04:12.200> and<00:04:12.380> final<00:04:12.770> one<00:04:17.260> and<00:04:18.310> that's<00:04:20.019> your

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
then third and final one and that's your

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.600 
then third and final one and that's your
completed<00:04:21.970> dm4<00:04:22.970> wax<00:04:23.270> frame
