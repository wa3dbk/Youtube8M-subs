the<00:01:35.829> number<00:01:36.250> 193<00:01:37.060> yeah<00:01:37.950> 1<00:01:38.950> 93<00:01:39.220> on<00:01:39.579> here<00:01:40.030> is

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
the number 193 yeah 1 93 on here is

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.899 
the number 193 yeah 1 93 on here is
taylor<00:01:41.560> mays<00:01:41.890> but<00:01:42.310> that's<00:01:42.460> just<00:01:42.610> in<00:01:42.820> the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
taylor mays but that's just in the

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.850 
taylor mays but that's just in the
commons<00:01:43.360> I<00:01:43.570> don't<00:01:43.960> see<00:01:44.110> a<00:01:44.140> plates<00:01:44.470> black

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.240 
commons I don't see a plates black
section<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:47.140> I'm<00:01:47.409> guessing<00:01:47.619> it's<00:01:47.950> just<00:01:48.159> the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
section so I'm guessing it's just the

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.490 
section so I'm guessing it's just the
common<00:01:48.610> 193<00:01:49.560> which<00:01:50.560> is<00:01:50.740> taylor<00:01:50.950> mays<00:01:52.350> but<00:01:53.350> it's

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
common 193 which is taylor mays but it's

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.380 
common 193 which is taylor mays but it's
probably<00:01:53.649> black<00:01:54.009> plate<00:01:54.430> i'm<00:01:54.909> guessing

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
probably black plate i'm guessing

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.030 
probably black plate i'm guessing
