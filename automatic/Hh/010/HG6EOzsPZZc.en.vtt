 I'm making this video today. 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.769
 to answer several questions or 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.090
 people or anyone to send 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.500
 comment on the cap and on YouTube and 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.780
 Facebook 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.890
 respect is asking which is the best 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.460
 that the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.820
 what is the best brand of pete cpf copy and 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.170
 a gps manuel more expensive or cheaper 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.130
 so many people ask me what the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.300
 best brand of gps 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.090
 today is the following you have to make a 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.040
 analysis to know is what shows the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:41.610
 person not using fgts 90% of people gps 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.640
 to today to address and radars 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.539
 that is to say, he wants to know which 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:53.039
 best brand of gps and which is the best 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:55.890
 gps a long time ago did a research and 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:00.180
 put 18 gps on the panel of the 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:04.379
 vehicle and were tested and placed 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.420
 offers more expensive to cheaper gps 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.820
 the best we played is what took 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.049
 best performance it uses several and 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.080
 put there in the GPS is cheaper ie 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.110
 I believe that this piece cheaper 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:22.080
 I was with a browser of it 's map. 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.180
 him well updated with it he just 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.340
 so it's a little better GPS GPS is best 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.610
 the one with the browser as well 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.250
 updated from s 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.079
 but it was and could also offer more 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.299
 cheap 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.380
 now if you ask which is the best 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.020
 software 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.680
 there is another story is a story 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.530
 for another video because obviously the gps 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.500
 more expensive and has better software and will 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.939
 run the map better you will get an answer 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.579
 is faster with a browser but this one 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.829
 video is making him take this 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.509
 doubt of the people ask me 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.250
 practically every day in which it is the 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.470
 best gps or the best is this 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.490
 the one with a larger browser 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.640
 updated 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:18.530
 the browser is what is the map nobody 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.270
