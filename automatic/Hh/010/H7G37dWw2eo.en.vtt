it's<00:01:18.119> probably<00:01:18.420> not<00:01:18.750> an<00:01:18.960> issue<00:01:19.110> but<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.770> sure

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
it's probably not an issue but you sure

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.440 
it's probably not an issue but you sure
could<00:01:20.250> add<00:01:20.460> something<00:01:20.729> like<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.210> if<00:01:21.360> you

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
could add something like that if you

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.690 
could add something like that if you
wanted<00:01:21.830> don't<00:01:22.830> add<00:01:22.950> something<00:01:23.220> that's<00:01:23.430> got<00:01:23.610> to

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
wanted don't add something that's got to

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.399 
wanted don't add something that's got to
absorb<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.119> bunch<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.420> moisture<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.020> suck<00:01:25.259> it

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409
