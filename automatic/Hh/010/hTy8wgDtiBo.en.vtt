00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:14.960
 it is now the second half of September from 30 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.790
 August for several nights in a row we 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.109
 freezing outdoors 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.859
 so the harvest is of course not all but in 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.000
 greenhouse 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.980
 look even what a good crop for me 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.220
 would you like to show you today 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.760
 a little thing for you 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.989
 it was convenient to grow tall and a 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.150
 correctly say indeterminant varieties 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:45.049
 greenhouse special greenhouse usually 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.299
 these are such tomatoes grow very tall 

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:49.400
 and the last harvest 

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:53.659
 he is already literally right under 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:56.720
 roof greenhouses are uncomfortable uncomfortable 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:59.470
 Tomato uncomfortable and us tomatoes to me 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.479
 convenient because when 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:06.650
 a tomato plant is tied up 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:09.650
 vertically then from great gravity 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.600
 Tomato brushes bend could 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.780
 swear or so fast and wrong 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.690
 the harvest is full 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.960
 Today I will show you how to tie up 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.930
 tomatoes so they all 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.500
 summer throughout the summer were here 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.860
 what level of my chest 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:35.870
 now the height of each plant is about 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:41.200
 three meters but I gradually word them 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:44.690
 first brush crop and descends below 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.420
 tied up again and so 3-4 times I do 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:51.950
 here now look at the covenant 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.140
 is at the beginning of the stem of any wild 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:01.210
 plants here take here in front of me 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:09.110
 is here comes the stalk out of the ground 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:10.509
 1 2 3 4 5 5 fruit brushes are already empty then 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.939
 there is a harvest 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.200
 they completely stalk lies on the ground 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:21.549
 now already 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:24.010
 and above 6 7 8 9 10 brushes are now 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:26.230
 higher upright and that's literally well 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.440
 what will the weather be what is the temperature 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.099
 it will be that there will be a couple more 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.760
 weeks 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:36.010
 be a tomato in a greenhouse 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.700
 although it is not heated here 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.739
 branch is made of glass and very 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.510
 warm good foundation is the essence 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.200
 important matters of the conditions of Siberia 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:52.920
 greenhouse without foundation even heated 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:56.159
 This is not the type of person and it turns out and harvest 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.230
 take off throughout the summer big and 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:02.099
 indeterminate varieties do not deliver to you 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.099
 no inconvenience 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.889
 here in my first film about growing 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:11.639
 automatons of this moment yet i am not 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:11.639
 showed
