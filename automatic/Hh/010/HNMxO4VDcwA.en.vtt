this<00:00:05.609> tutorial<00:00:05.850> is<00:00:06.390> on<00:00:06.629> applying<00:00:07.319> multiple

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
this tutorial is on applying multiple

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.220 
this tutorial is on applying multiple
materials<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.460> one<00:00:08.610> object<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.330> this<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.080> the

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
materials to one object and this is the

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.110 
materials to one object and this is the
finished<00:00:10.530> result<00:00:10.710> I'll<00:00:11.580> show<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:11.849> two<00:00:12.090> ways

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
finished result I'll show you two ways

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.480 
finished result I'll show you two ways
to<00:00:12.480> do<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:12.840> try<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.650> do<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:13.980> all<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.219> just<00:00:14.250> a

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
to do this try to do it all in just a

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.730 
to do this try to do it all in just a
few<00:00:14.639> minutes<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.120> I'm<00:00:16.109> going<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.289> try<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.529> do

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
few minutes and I'm going to try to do

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.500 
few minutes and I'm going to try to do
this<00:00:16.859> from<00:00:16.980> scratch<00:00:17.070> let<00:00:17.580> me<00:00:17.670> just<00:00:17.850> get<00:00:18.270> rid<00:00:18.420> of

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
this from scratch let me just get rid of

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.259 
this from scratch let me just get rid of
this<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.230> there's<00:00:19.470> no<00:00:19.680> cheating<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:23.269> my

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
this so that there's no cheating and my

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.000 
this so that there's no cheating and my
front<00:00:24.570> view<00:00:24.660> I'll<00:00:25.260> go<00:00:25.439> ahead<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.740> create<00:00:25.859> a

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
front view I'll go ahead and create a

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.040 
front view I'll go ahead and create a
plane<00:00:28.760> that<00:00:29.760> this<00:00:29.970> plane<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.599> just<00:00:30.810> made

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
plane that this plane that I just made

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.060 
plane that this plane that I just made
is<00:00:31.439> segmented<00:00:33.020> if<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.200> look<00:00:34.380> at<00:00:34.530> edit

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
is segmented if we look at edit

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.319 
is segmented if we look at edit
segmented<00:00:35.760> three<00:00:36.920> segments<00:00:37.920> each<00:00:37.980> direction

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
segmented three segments each direction

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.590 
segmented three segments each direction
okay<00:00:39.710> so<00:00:40.710> first<00:00:41.309> thing<00:00:41.520> I'll<00:00:41.670> do<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.210> just<00:00:42.239> zoom

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
okay so first thing I'll do is just zoom

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.690 
okay so first thing I'll do is just zoom
in<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.170> our<00:00:43.290> perspective<00:00:43.620> viewport<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.550> can

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
in on our perspective viewport so we can

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.369 
in on our perspective viewport so we can
see<00:00:44.879> everything<00:00:45.360> nice<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.200> big<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:48.170> we'll<00:00:49.170> go

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
see everything nice and big and we'll go

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.760 
see everything nice and big and we'll go

because<00:01:49.710> we<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:49.950> two<00:01:50.220> objects<00:01:50.759> here<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.180> I'm

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
because we have two objects here and I'm

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.899 
because we have two objects here and I'm
going<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.689> prove<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.680> just<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.979> second<00:01:53.399> so

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
going to prove that in just a second so

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.389 
going to prove that in just a second so
I'm<00:01:53.970> going<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.149> go<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.740> materials<00:01:55.740> again<00:01:56.040> grab

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
I'm going to go to materials again grab

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.230 
I'm going to go to materials again grab
my<00:01:56.579> next<00:01:56.820> material<00:01:57.200> applied<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.380> object<00:01:59.240> now

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
my next material applied to object now

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.170 
my next material applied to object now
we've<00:02:00.360> got<00:02:00.450> two<00:02:01.219> materials<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.460> looks<00:02:02.790> like<00:02:03.000> on

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
we've got two materials it looks like on

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.250 
we've got two materials it looks like on
one<00:02:03.390> object<00:02:03.540> but<00:02:03.960> really<00:02:04.320> what<00:02:04.500> I've<00:02:04.590> done

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
one object but really what I've done

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.250 
one object but really what I've done
is<00:02:05.700> when<00:02:06.700> I<00:02:06.730> did<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.060> detach<00:02:07.510> I<00:02:07.810> ended<00:02:07.990> up<00:02:08.020> with

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.260 
is when I did the detach I ended up with

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.570 
is when I did the detach I ended up with
two<00:02:08.560> different<00:02:08.979> sets<00:02:09.460> of<00:02:09.670> faces<00:02:10.570> okay<00:02:11.580> so

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
two different sets of faces okay so

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.430 
two different sets of faces okay so
that's<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.970> quick<00:02:13.270> and<00:02:13.600> easy<00:02:13.780> way<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.140> do<00:02:14.410> it

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
that's the quick and easy way to do it

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.050 
that's the quick and easy way to do it
the<00:02:14.680> problem<00:02:15.040> with<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.190> is<00:02:15.520> it<00:02:15.670> doesn't<00:02:15.700> work

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
the problem with that is it doesn't work

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.750 
the problem with that is it doesn't work
well<00:02:16.360> with<00:02:16.660> like<00:02:17.440> complex<00:02:17.980> characters<00:02:18.490> for

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
well with like complex characters for

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.910 
well with like complex characters for
example<00:02:18.990> because<00:02:19.990> then<00:02:20.230> when<00:02:20.380> you<00:02:20.440> move<00:02:20.650> one

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
example because then when you move one

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.060 
example because then when you move one
piece<00:02:21.190> that<00:02:21.460> the<00:02:21.550> piece<00:02:21.760> doesn't<00:02:22.120> move<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:23.070> if

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
piece that the piece doesn't move and if

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.980 
piece that the piece doesn't move and if
you<00:02:24.220> try<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.430> use<00:02:24.580> group<00:02:24.940> or<00:02:25.210> selection<00:02:25.720> sets

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
you try to use group or selection sets

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.070 
you try to use group or selection sets
or<00:02:26.410> select<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.130> link<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.660> could<00:02:28.660> have<00:02:28.780> problems

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
or select a link you could have problems

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.500 
or select a link you could have problems
certainly<00:02:30.070> with<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.220> character<00:02:30.670> so<00:02:31.270> here's<00:02:31.450> a

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
certainly with a character so here's a

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.390 
certainly with a character so here's a
better<00:02:31.690> way<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:31.930> do<00:02:32.110> all<00:02:32.230> that<00:02:32.410> let's<00:02:33.070> just<00:02:33.220> do

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
better way to do all that let's just do

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.930 
better way to do all that let's just do
another<00:02:33.640> one<00:02:34.830> well<00:02:35.830> back<00:02:36.070> to<00:02:36.100> our<00:02:36.250> front<00:02:36.580> view

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
another one well back to our front view

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:46.260 
another one well back to our front view
and<00:02:38.010> use<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.040> plane<00:02:39.370> again<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:44.850> this<00:02:45.850> time<00:02:46.090> what

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
and use a plane again and this time what

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.550 
and use a plane again and this time what
I'm<00:02:46.360> going<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:46.540> do<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.690> little<00:02:46.870> more<00:02:47.050> complex

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
I'm going to do a little more complex

modifier list drop-down to UVW map now I

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.629 
modifier list drop-down to UVW map now I
want<00:04:23.539> from<00:04:23.780> that<00:04:23.990> type<00:04:24.259> on<00:04:24.470> this<00:04:24.680> well<00:04:25.580> I

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
want from that type on this well I

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.790 
want from that type on this well I
probably<00:04:25.820> planar<00:04:26.270> map<00:04:26.570> but<00:04:27.199> it<00:04:27.289> depends<00:04:27.710> if

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
probably planar map but it depends if

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.839 
probably planar map but it depends if
it's<00:04:27.889> character<00:04:28.400> you<00:04:28.490> might<00:04:28.639> want<00:04:28.820> to

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
it's character you might want to

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:30.870 
it's character you might want to
cylindrical<00:04:29.330> map<00:04:29.509> or<00:04:29.720> something<00:04:29.900> else<00:04:30.199> and

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
cylindrical map or something else and

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.999 
cylindrical map or something else and
then<00:04:31.880> how<00:04:32.060> big<00:04:32.270> do<00:04:32.360> you<00:04:32.389> want<00:04:32.449> it<00:04:32.630> to<00:04:32.720> be

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
then how big do you want it to be

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:35.290 
then how big do you want it to be
normally<00:04:34.009> it<00:04:34.130> fits<00:04:34.430> pretty<00:04:34.639> good<00:04:34.880> on<00:04:35.000> its<00:04:35.150> own

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
normally it fits pretty good on its own

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.029 
normally it fits pretty good on its own
but<00:04:35.360> I<00:04:35.570> usually<00:04:35.780> click<00:04:36.199> fit<00:04:36.530> just<00:04:36.740> to<00:04:36.889> make

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
but I usually click fit just to make

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.689 
but I usually click fit just to make
sure<00:04:37.780> okay<00:04:38.780> now<00:04:39.169> what<00:04:39.380> I<00:04:39.410> want<00:04:39.680> to<00:04:39.740> do<00:04:39.919> I<00:04:40.130> want

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
sure okay now what I want to do I want

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:42.219 
sure okay now what I want to do I want
another<00:04:40.970> poly<00:04:41.300> select<00:04:41.509> because<00:04:41.780> I<00:04:41.870> have<00:04:41.990> two

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
another poly select because I have two

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.140 
another poly select because I have two
groups<00:04:42.530> here<00:04:42.740> donut<00:04:43.099> so<00:04:43.759> I'm<00:04:43.820> going<00:04:43.940> to<00:04:44.000> go<00:04:44.090> to

what

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.149 
what
well<00:05:02.150> before<00:05:02.419> we<00:05:02.659> did<00:05:02.960> UVW<00:05:03.560> mapping<00:05:03.740> so<00:05:04.039> let's

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 
well before we did UVW mapping so let's

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:08.260 
well before we did UVW mapping so let's
do<00:05:04.340> that<00:05:04.370> again<00:05:04.880> and<00:05:06.729> I<00:05:07.729> know<00:05:07.909> I'm<00:05:08.030> kind<00:05:08.210> of

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
do that again and I know I'm kind of

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.640 
do that again and I know I'm kind of
repeating<00:05:08.659> some<00:05:08.810> of<00:05:08.840> this<00:05:09.020> because<00:05:09.229> I<00:05:09.440> want

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
repeating some of this because I want

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.060 
repeating some of this because I want
you<00:05:09.710> to<00:05:09.770> see<00:05:09.949> the<00:05:10.070> logic<00:05:10.310> of<00:05:10.669> it<00:05:11.530> not<00:05:12.530> unwrap

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
you to see the logic of it not unwrap

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.399 
you to see the logic of it not unwrap
but<00:05:13.340> UVW<00:05:14.030> map<00:05:14.180> will<00:05:14.360> do<00:05:14.479> unwrap<00:05:14.840> another<00:05:15.139> time

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:15.409 
but UVW map will do unwrap another time

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:22.749 
but UVW map will do unwrap another time
and<00:05:17.889> slide<00:05:18.889> on<00:05:19.280> up<00:05:19.520> do<00:05:20.210> the<00:05:20.360> fit<00:05:21.340> map<00:05:22.340> channel

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:22.759 
and slide on up do the fit map channel

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:28.670 
and slide on up do the fit map channel
to<00:05:25.330> fit<00:05:26.680> ok

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
to fit ok

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.580 
to fit ok
so<00:05:29.160> we<00:05:29.340> should<00:05:29.610> be<00:05:29.639> good<00:05:29.970> let's<00:05:30.360> find<00:05:30.630> out<00:05:30.810> so

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
so we should be good let's find out so

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.499 
so we should be good let's find out so
I'm<00:05:31.710> going<00:05:31.860> to<00:05:31.919> just<00:05:32.160> go<00:05:32.910> to<00:05:32.940> well<00:05:33.330> I'm<00:05:33.389> going
