 We are in their car is taken off 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.120
 markus has completed the exit session 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.470
 that is, the first part is 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.750
 already around and now just the tech 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.860
 inspection that means as well as tÃ¼v 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.860
 acceptance of the formation 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.770
 we have done the continuing that 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.240
 means all technical approvals are 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.490
 through we can with tim on the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.220
 race track but only tomorrow that is 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.350
 today for us on thursday on the third 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.350
 test day in hockenheim test 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.520
 morning 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.650
 behind me you can see the test area where 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.080
 our guys just skid pad ridden 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.240
 that means we're all in for now 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.920
 the box and the car cleaned up until it 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.250
 shines then it's about design 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.550
 report breaks up 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.990
 a little bit but i believe after 3x 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.590
 meanwhile design pleases in 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.590
 border 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.409
 but 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.760
 what do you think how will we be weeks 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.739
 Of course they are very good because we 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.599
 We are extremely well prepared 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.190
 the technical approvals in one day 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.959
 and thus had today 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.180
 enough time to do test drives 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.379
 make last settings and yes 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.379
 we expect good chances 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.150
 I'm standing here with our two 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.530
 drivers uwe gareis and robin becker uwe 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.030
 what was that feeling on the 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.489
 It was an excellent feeling 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.870
 the car ran wonderfully we have 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.919
 enough grip and to be fast and 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.470
 I think that then with the 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.060
 proved lap times and the second 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.110
 partook of whether driven in and I 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.560
 I think I can do a bit more 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.470
 tell 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.660
 exactly robin, what are you looking at ? 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.060
 has definitely felt a good 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.759
 stand at the moment can do so very quickly 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.350
 be on the move 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.910
 The last rounds were made 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.650
 a bit sad, but I think so 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.099
 mastered quite well have a great time 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.289
 become 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:47.120
 Exactly I think the time was good 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.020
 what do you think how will the placement 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.910
 look for us 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.800
 so have to wait through it like that 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.229
 other teams form clearly there could 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.000
 you can not paint exact placements 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:59.500
 but it should definitely be in 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.500
 front mittelfeld be possible
