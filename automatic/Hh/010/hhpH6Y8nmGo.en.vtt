00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
the stability under braking I thought

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.569 
the stability under braking I thought
was<00:00:39.660> excellent<00:00:40.020> one<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.160> attributes<00:00:41.550> that

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
was excellent one of the attributes that

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.700 
was excellent one of the attributes that
we<00:00:41.730> try<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.910> put<00:00:42.180> into<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.540> tire<00:00:42.750> was<00:00:43.530> to

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
we try to put into the tire was to

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.290 
we try to put into the tire was to
stiffen<00:00:44.010> up<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> front<00:00:44.340> end<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:45.149> key

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
stiffen up the front end the key

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.080 
stiffen up the front end the key

you can enter corners a few miles an

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.569 
you can enter corners a few miles an
hour<00:01:57.869> faster<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.560> exit<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.979> few<00:01:59.130> miles<00:01:59.340> an<00:01:59.460> hour

quite<00:02:01.469> considerably<00:02:02.009> well<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.670> technologies

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
quite considerably well the technologies

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.300 
quite considerably well the technologies
we<00:02:03.299> have<00:02:03.329> are<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:04.049> main<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.380> roc<00:02:04.829> polymer<00:02:05.189> and

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
we have are the main to roc polymer and

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.219 
we have are the main to roc polymer and
nano<00:02:05.490> protec<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.210> basically<00:02:06.600> what<00:02:06.750> these<00:02:06.899> do

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
nano protec and basically what these do

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.320 
nano protec and basically what these do
is<00:02:07.409> when<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.369> temperatures<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.849> at<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.060> get

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
is when the temperatures of at I get

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.089 
is when the temperatures of at I get
really<00:02:09.539> really<00:02:09.629> high<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.440> stops<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.920> tire

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
really really high it stops the tire

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.040 
really really high it stops the tire
from<00:02:11.250> breaking<00:02:11.670> down<00:02:11.879> so<00:02:12.569> therefore<00:02:12.959> it

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
from breaking down so therefore it

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.850 
from breaking down so therefore it
creates<00:02:13.200> more

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
creates more

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.340 
creates more
ability<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.430> creates<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.730> longer<00:02:15.210> usage<00:02:16.050> of

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
ability and creates a longer usage of

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.160 
ability and creates a longer usage of
life<00:02:16.800> of<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.580> tire<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.060> yes<00:02:18.270> it<00:02:18.510> will<00:02:18.630> do<00:02:18.840> four

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
life of the tire so yes it will do four

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.160 
life of the tire so yes it will do four
or<00:02:19.200> five<00:02:19.290> thousand<00:02:19.860> miles<00:02:20.010> at<00:02:20.250> full<00:02:20.960> grip<00:02:21.960> or

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
or five thousand miles at full grip or

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.980 
or five thousand miles at full grip or
full<00:02:22.440> performance
