one<00:04:17.609> over<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.030> top<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:18.389> I<00:04:18.450> was<00:04:18.539> pretty

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
one over the top and I was pretty

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.940 
one over the top and I was pretty
convinced<00:04:18.870> is<00:04:19.200> gonna<00:04:19.350> be<00:04:19.410> quite<00:04:19.530> easy<00:04:19.650> because

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
convinced is gonna be quite easy because

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.770 
convinced is gonna be quite easy because
if<00:04:20.459> they<00:04:20.789> miss<00:04:21.030> their<00:04:21.180> first<00:04:21.450> one<00:04:21.659> you're

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
if they miss their first one you're

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.510 
if they miss their first one you're
usually<00:04:21.959> quite<00:04:22.440> convinced<00:04:22.950> that<00:04:23.099> they're<00:04:23.340> not

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
usually quite convinced that they're not

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.430 
usually quite convinced that they're not
going<00:04:23.640> to<00:04:23.700> be<00:04:23.820> doing<00:04:23.909> too<00:04:24.240> well<00:04:24.270> but<00:04:25.080> we<00:04:25.260> go

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
going to be doing too well but we go

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.560 
going to be doing too well but we go
through<00:04:25.470> so<00:04:26.039> many<00:04:26.250> penalties<00:04:26.760> through<00:04:27.270> this<00:04:27.360> I

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
through so many penalties through this I

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.770 
through so many penalties through this I
mean

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
mean

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.160 
mean
it<00:04:27.810> was<00:04:27.930> crazy<00:04:28.290> I<00:04:29.300> mean<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.450> his<00:04:30.810> keeper

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
it was crazy I mean the his keeper

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.410 
it was crazy I mean the his keeper
luckily<00:04:31.680> saves<00:04:31.980> mine<00:04:32.250> all<00:04:32.460> that<00:04:32.610> sort<00:04:32.880> of<00:04:33.180> fun

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
stuff but I'm usually quite good on the

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.710
