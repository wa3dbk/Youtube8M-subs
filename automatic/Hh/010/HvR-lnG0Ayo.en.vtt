00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:09.500
 dear friends, thanks to kindness 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:13.230
 of my friend facundo here present today 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.800
 I'm going to show you another scoop on 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.800
 renault logan 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.530
 Y 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:25.520
 let's start this by the low chassis 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.980
 I'm going to show you 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.380
 this suspension scheme 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.399
 the protection 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.140
 and we start with the rear train the 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.230
 typical old and beloved and it has 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.160
 checked rigid shaft spirals 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.870
 independent 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.270
 separated 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.270
 not for old it stops being 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.280
 has given very good results 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.600
 good in this case we have in the 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.600
 back to the drum 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:04.800
 to bs of course this that you see here is 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.800
 the sensor 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.180
 in this model we have a tank 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.180
 plastic fuel 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.610
 after 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.159
 and I want to show you this particularity 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.300
 some will like others not 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:25.210
 the exit of the coffee cuts to a 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.390
 respectable distance from the 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.090
 the good back hostel we have the 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.329
 profession 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.280
 of my beginnings oprisor the same 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.350
 protection that you have here in the tank 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.600
 hot gas 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.450
 and now we go to the details 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.250
 interesting about the protection of 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.530
 under the chassis in what it has to do 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.159
 with the painting before the villa in this 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.640
 case we see that Brazil is doing the 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.640
 good things 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.650
 protected well painted 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.050
 low socket 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.530
 the floor 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.670
 the crossbar 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.270
 comes painted 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.270
 In its whole 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.810
 we have here 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.810
 lambda probe catalyst 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.410
 and go back to the schemes 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.980
 suspension we can also say that it is 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:31.810
 an old and proven system that gives 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.050
 result the old dear macpherson 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.900
 with frame 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.090
 where the kneecap is mounted 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.810
 forward if we have disc brakes and 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.430
 what you see here is the sensor for 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.560
 detect the movement sent by the 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.520
 signal to the module of the time 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.470
 and another of the things to highlight the 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.590
 good protection of sheet metal 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.870
 as is the custom the reindeer to protect 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.349
 the crankcase of vital soils 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.810
 there goes that is the voice of my facundo friend 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.020
 it now appears that also understands 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.470
 mechanical with time 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:15.040
 is learning and kingdom also has 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.600
 aluminum crankcase and well I think that one 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.180
 of the reasons for it to come well 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.850
 protected is that 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.810
 the aluminum must be taken care of 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.810
 it's a good plug 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.760
 the part here we have this that you see here 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.490
 I'm calipan 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.370
 the homokinetic 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.350
 Y 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.970
 in general, this 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:47.410
 here we have another interesting detail 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:50.880
 the fuel pipes 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.040
 look protected with a plastic 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.850
 as well as the forgotten major goal of 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.650
 commented the rear axle comes 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:03.240
 with a plastic protector 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:06.480
 and what good if he ordered he put this 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:10.520
 seabra because so good this is the 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.520
