00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
then actually decided to pretty much

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.590 
then actually decided to pretty much
copy<00:00:33.710> the<00:00:34.100> original<00:00:34.190> bring<00:00:34.880> it<00:00:35.030> back<00:00:35.210> really

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
it's great but he looks great isn't it

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.490 
it's great but he looks great isn't it
yeah<00:00:37.670> I<00:00:37.700> didn't<00:00:38.060> think<00:00:38.180> I'd<00:00:38.270> like<00:00:38.420> it<00:00:38.660> as<00:00:39.260> much

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
yeah I didn't think I'd like it as much

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.040 
yeah I didn't think I'd like it as much
as<00:00:39.739> I<00:00:39.980> think<00:00:40.070> I<00:00:40.280> do<00:00:40.460> I<00:00:40.720> didn't<00:00:41.720> think<00:00:41.780> it<00:00:41.930> would

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
as I think I do I didn't think it would

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.500 
as I think I do I didn't think it would
because<00:00:42.170> I<00:00:42.290> thought<00:00:42.440> it<00:00:42.620> was<00:00:42.710> kind<00:00:42.920> of

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
because I thought it was kind of

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.670 
because I thought it was kind of
pigeon-holed<00:00:44.510> little<00:00:44.930> car<00:00:45.110> on<00:00:45.350> a<00:00:45.410> certain

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
pigeon-holed little car on a certain

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.830 
pigeon-holed little car on a certain
type<00:00:45.920> of<00:00:45.950> person<00:00:46.489> but<00:00:46.520> now<00:00:46.850> it's<00:00:47.270> really<00:00:47.570> quite

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
type of person but now it's really quite

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.190 
type of person but now it's really quite
cool

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.450 

look<00:00:50.680> at<00:00:50.860> this<00:00:51.070> a<00:00:51.630> little<00:00:52.630> vars<00:00:53.410> I've<00:00:53.920> heard<00:00:54.280> so

it's<00:01:44.410> in<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.650> front<00:01:44.860> far<00:01:45.220> more<00:01:45.370> conventional

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
it's in the front far more conventional

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.850 
it's in the front far more conventional
layout<00:01:46.180> but<00:01:46.480> you<00:01:46.570> do<00:01:46.750> get<00:01:46.900> a<00:01:46.960> very<00:01:47.050> handy<00:01:47.590> boot

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
layout but you do get a very handy boot

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
people find it a little bit

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.570 
people find it a little bit
disconcerting<00:02:34.390> with<00:02:34.900> this<00:02:35.050> huge<00:02:35.830> gap<00:02:36.280> between

all to accommodate this VW beetle look
to<00:02:43.660> drive<00:02:44.020> I've<00:02:44.410> always<00:02:44.800> found<00:02:45.010> them<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.370> little

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
to drive I've always found them a little

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.210 
to drive I've always found them a little
bit<00:02:45.790> clumsy<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:46.540> ponderous<00:02:47.020> despite<00:02:47.950> being

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
bit clumsy and ponderous despite being

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.949 
bit clumsy and ponderous despite being
based<00:02:48.430> on<00:02:48.550> a<00:02:48.610> fantastic<00:02:49.120> platform<00:02:49.450> like<00:02:49.840> the

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
based on a fantastic platform like the

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.870 
based on a fantastic platform like the
golf<00:02:50.320> it's<00:02:50.590> rather<00:02:50.920> vague<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.459> partly<00:02:51.760> that's

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
golf it's rather vague and partly that's

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.430 
golf it's rather vague and partly that's
because<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.420> shape<00:02:52.660> it's<00:02:52.930> difficult<00:02:53.380> to

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
because of the shape it's difficult to

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.530 
because of the shape it's difficult to
tell<00:02:53.650> where<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:53.860> front<00:02:54.130> wheels<00:02:54.370> are<00:02:54.640> but<00:02:55.420> then

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
tell where the front wheels are but then

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.180 
tell where the front wheels are but then
the<00:02:55.660> beetle<00:02:55.989> is<00:02:56.110> not<00:02:56.350> a<00:02:56.380> car<00:02:56.709> you'd<00:02:56.890> be<00:02:56.920> buying

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
the beetle is not a car you'd be buying

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.770 
the beetle is not a car you'd be buying
as<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.400> sports<00:02:57.700> car<00:02:57.970> I<00:02:58.000> guess<00:02:58.239> so<00:02:58.450> we<00:02:58.630> can

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
as a sports car I guess so we can

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.449 
as a sports car I guess so we can
probably<00:02:59.140> forgive<00:02:59.470> it<00:02:59.650> if<00:02:59.830> it<00:03:00.130> looks<00:03:00.310> this

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
probably forgive it if it looks this

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.770 
probably forgive it if it looks this
pretty

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.300 

now<00:03:04.780> one<00:03:04.930> of<00:03:04.960> the<00:03:05.140> criticisms<00:03:05.740> of<00:03:05.830> these<00:03:06.010> cars

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
now one of the criticisms of these cars

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.310 
now one of the criticisms of these cars
is<00:03:06.580> they've<00:03:06.790> been<00:03:06.970> fairly<00:03:07.450> expensive<00:03:07.960> a<00:03:08.140> bit

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
is they've been fairly expensive a bit

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.530 
is they've been fairly expensive a bit
of<00:03:08.410> a<00:03:08.530> pricey<00:03:08.800> side<00:03:09.160> yeah<00:03:09.610> when<00:03:10.240> they<00:03:10.360> first

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
of a pricey side yeah when they first

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.520 
of a pricey side yeah when they first
brought<00:03:10.750> them<00:03:10.900> out<00:03:11.020> there<00:03:11.170> was<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.320> big

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
brought them out there was a big

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.590 
brought them out there was a big
difference<00:03:11.950> in<00:03:12.190> you<00:03:12.730> know<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:13.000> price<00:03:13.210> that<00:03:13.450> we

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
difference in you know the price that we

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.270 
difference in you know the price that we
were<00:03:13.690> under<00:03:13.930> paying<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.290> UK<00:03:14.710> compared<00:03:15.130> to<00:03:15.190> the

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
were under paying the UK compared to the

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.890 
were under paying the UK compared to the
price<00:03:15.460> in<00:03:15.640> America<00:03:16.060> and<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.330> racks<00:03:16.510> in<00:03:16.600> Europe

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
price in America and the racks in Europe

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.210 
price in America and the racks in Europe
so<00:03:17.020> they<00:03:17.140> have<00:03:17.290> brought<00:03:17.500> that<00:03:17.620> down<00:03:17.830> a<00:03:17.890> bit<00:03:18.100> and

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
so they have brought that down a bit and

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.860 
so they have brought that down a bit and
wise<00:03:18.430> I<00:03:18.700> mean<00:03:18.970> this<00:03:19.180> when<00:03:19.360> it<00:03:19.450> was<00:03:19.540> new<00:03:19.690> was

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
wise I mean this when it was new was

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.630 
wise I mean this when it was new was
just<00:03:20.110> over<00:03:20.290> 14<00:03:20.650> grand<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:21.130> now<00:03:21.220> it's<00:03:21.400> just

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
just over 14 grand and now it's just

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.150 
just over 14 grand and now it's just
over<00:03:21.850> 12<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.840> it's<00:03:23.020> wasn't<00:03:23.320> even<00:03:23.470> 9,000<00:03:23.980> miles

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
over 12 and it's wasn't even 9,000 miles

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.080 
over 12 and it's wasn't even 9,000 miles
as<00:03:24.370> think<00:03:24.580> so

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
as think so

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.790 
as think so
so<00:03:25.480> it's<00:03:25.750> actually<00:03:25.840> a<00:03:26.080> same<00:03:26.320> thing<00:03:26.350> but<00:03:26.650> it's

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
so it's actually a same thing but it's

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.460 
so it's actually a same thing but it's
