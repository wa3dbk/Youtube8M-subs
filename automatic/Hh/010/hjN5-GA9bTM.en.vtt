00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:08.400
 jo people what everyone starts and 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.410
 Although with a upper body unit 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.509
 you have requested several times 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.009
 my upper body lower body plan times 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.460
 a little more training photos too 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.650
 see 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.320
 At the moment I have a lot to do 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.230
 so do klausurphase is right now 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.240
 on saturday partly in two days write 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.949
 I'm a klausur on Saturday what's up 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.140
 on a better Saturday morning a klausur too 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.859
 writing otherwise has a lot to do 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.019
 in the year 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.600
 so I can not so blatant fell 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.390
 bring training position but if I 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.190
 find the time as in the day I will 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.079
 definitely take the cam with the stream 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.170
 and a little bit of an insight 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.820
 ensure always in training 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.170
 yes, what's great to say to me 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.370
 I started with bank presses here 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.120
 you have a few will stop them 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.670
 I think so 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.680
 I filmed all the effort but me 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.660
 I think before that I have two more seats 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.449
 just so easy with the rod and so 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.969
 good 60 kilos 80 kilos and so on and so 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.520
 continue holding a relatively easy final 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.010
 stop it while holding the weight 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.530
 increased and the repetition is based yes 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.780
 So today there was that day 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.040
 an extremely high volume 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.390
 I would not recommend it to anyone 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.490
 this is really only for 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.290
 advanced people and I have on 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.840
 the day after a car system 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.689
 is made simply a scale that 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.040
 goes from 1 to 10 and says hey baby ten 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.900
 I'm muscle failure 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.570
 if him as we perhaps 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.329
 I went in and I had one 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.790
 strong light and I have so many sentences 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.619
 made like on ip 9 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.479
 or nine and a half respectively 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.299
 am a bit had to fail 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.189
 practically just before and where many sentences 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.659
 stopped as we went with the day 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.360
 the weight I believe in the day went 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.579
 three or four sentences and then that will 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.350
 reduced weight and it became it 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.689
 again for laws made with the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.259
 static weight until I just got in one 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.990
 certain repetition numbers rp nine resp 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.750
 99 half or eight and a half or as well 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.000
 always come so a relatively high 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.219
 burden on a relative 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.960
 load limit I say yes how 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.470
 So if you put all the sentences together 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.750
 counted all repetitions 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.910
 is an extremely high volume on the day 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.500
 I have been quiet for some days 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.600
 a little bit higher from the accident and here 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.850
 on some days a little less 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.760
 volume but on the day where it stops 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.890
 just a lot more because it just stopped 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.560
 more because the more sat in this 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.880
 desired area has packed but how 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.680
 said I usually drink too 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.570
 nothing with such a gross volume so 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.280
 I could do that three times a week 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.230
 definitely can not handle 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.240
 That's why the next unit is now 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.060
 probably a bit tomorrow 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.500
 slightly less voluminous 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.000
 So it's important if you're like that 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.530
 a high frequency worth that you just 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.970
 previously with auto regulation area 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.090
 works especially when you are intense 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.630
 yes, yes, training again fits 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.850
 So I believe in the first sentence 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.500
 at the first set heavy worker 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.600
 that we saw then was the break 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.459
 very very close so maybe 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.890
 thinks that one or the other not drive 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.100
 but they were definitely here 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.840
 I show how to properly bank 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.880
 so yes should definitely press 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.290
 very important we want man several times in 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.400
 the week expresses that correctly 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.260
 presses and you have seen yes I have 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.750
 my shoulder blades withdrawn and 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.880
 pushed down and I would 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.760
 Also recommend to anyone now independent 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.350
 that the mega so much healthier 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.239
 is for your shoulder if you are just in 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.190
 his style expresses no 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.260
 You can also breast a little bit more 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.790
 but gain muscle activation by doing so 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.730
 in that helmet elbow then 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.769
 I'll probably say a bar 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.330
 that takes away again but that 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.120
 it does not matter in any case 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.010
 best if you have a healthy healthy 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.090
 shoulder in ten years to have 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.860
 and activate your chest so maximum 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:53.799
 wanted which is I believe the 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:56.170
 last sentence at the flat bench press like 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.480
 said rather high volume so 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.280
 really eight or nine sentences only 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.410
 Bankprints after that have even more skew 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.670
 So bench press night as much as I would have 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.239
 actually done once I have the 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.830
 week had trained but there are 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.810
 just days where you feel stronger for like 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.489
 you feel better you just feel more 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.290
 volume and then I take 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.379
 also like to be with and for such kind 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.669
 daily experience because I live 

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:20.500
 can train intuitively and no 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.440
 Fixed specifications have the fixed specifications 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.449
 I definitely also you see her times 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.419
 I make a terrible bank press 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:31.300
 now without a break pacino and stop 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.039
 Eighth with the stretch triflex 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.389
 but of course akrri me that 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.460
 I'm not with us so I do not want to 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.520
 less breast muscle activation but 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.960
 I just want to have a reflex 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.620
 and that does not work in the break 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.090
 but nevertheless I always want to 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.150
 even the weight of what was pressing up 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.069
 The rod is not with a lot of say 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.990
 I'll work and then I'm in 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:54.490
 end effect itself we have all the way to 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.780
 shit because if I will soon 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.000
 a bit more lively then take 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.430
 I suddenly became stronger without 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.030
 that I am really strengthened yes 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.080
 Here you can see from the side 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.090
 Generally I always try relatively 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.120
 to press explosively because that too 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:13.810
 Most fibers will activate even if that 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.129
 weight if the weight is not so 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.199
 I'm still trying hard 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:18.430
 maximum speed or otherwise 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.930
 one is pretty heavy 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.219
 I still try at maximum 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.169
 accelerate even if it does not 

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:24.969
 It's fast but it's about the 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.380
 try to speed it up a bit 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:29.440
 this try gives you more 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.630
 give driver to be involved here 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.880
 I think I reduced and again 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.099
 The last sentence made at an angle 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.120
 bench press 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:38.889
 normally I go well on the 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.150
 Superset system that means I do 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:42.310
 first press banks then I do 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.930
 rowing scared or over 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.610
 press the head and then somehow 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.469
 Pull-ups but in the day I have 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.729
 really only bank the step 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:50.380
 Bench press made for chest and 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.360
 shoulder and then only the back 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.800
 that was it synonymous with the video if 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.300
 you liked the video then give 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.039
 me a thumbs up commented 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.690
 subscribes and shears the video 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.460
 otherwise I wish you one more 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.509
 we extremely happy to see you in the pack 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.509
 next video
