00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.199
 we will have washed our hands we will use 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.369
 single-use disposable latex gloves 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.829
 use 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.419
 then we take the club that 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.460
 what it does is concentrate the flow 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.340
 blood to be able to perform 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.590
 extraction correctly 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.940
 we leave the strips removed from the club 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.390
 so they do not bother us in the 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.390
 extraction 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.520
 we take cotton 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.789
 and alcohol and we soak it 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.030
 We palpated the area to choose the point 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.100
 puncture 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.809
 We disinfect it with alcohol or other 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.539
 antiseptic with help to a swab of 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.629
 Cotton always in circulation and inside 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.629
 out 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.699
 we take the moth and the bell 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.270
 and we attach the distal part of the 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.270
 moth to the bell 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.280
 we remove 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:30.689
 the cap of the moth and we inform 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.689
 the user of the prick 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.060
 with the non-dominant hand we fix the 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.759
 oats 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.799
 to thereby not move and 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.409
 we introduce the needle with the bevel towards 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.780
 outside 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.270
 we stabilize the moth with the thumb 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.600
 and with the other hand we are filling the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.600
 pipes 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.570
 when the tubes are already full 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.569
 we remove the club 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.569
 we prepare 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.120
 we remove the moth and press on 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.120
 the puncture site 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.820
 we throw 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.990
 the moth to the waste container 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.200
 health 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:45.340
 previously having put 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.340
 the security system 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.430
 and we put a plaster in the area of 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.430
 puncture
