similar to a previous case I reviewed

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.709 
similar to a previous case I reviewed
the<00:00:44.219> card<00:00:44.489> inja<00:00:44.879> which<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.149> also<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.480> little

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
carrying anything to begin with but my

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.040 
carrying anything to begin with but my
one<00:04:49.349> gripe<00:04:49.800> with<00:04:50.279> the<00:04:50.550> junior<00:04:51.090> is<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.569> elastic

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
one gripe with the junior is the elastic

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.450 
one gripe with the junior is the elastic
material<00:04:52.499> though<00:04:52.680> which<00:04:52.949> can<00:04:53.189> be<00:04:53.310> found

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
material though which can be found

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.149 
material though which can be found
flawed<00:04:53.849> in<00:04:54.120> almost<00:04:54.419> all<00:04:54.629> the<00:04:54.779> wallies<00:04:55.169> if<00:04:55.949> you

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:56.159 
flawed in almost all the wallies if you

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:57.499 
flawed in almost all the wallies if you
start<00:04:56.400> putting<00:04:56.639> in<00:04:56.819> a<00:04:56.909> certain<00:04:57.240> amount<00:04:57.449> of

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
start putting in a certain amount of

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.559 
start putting in a certain amount of
cards<00:04:57.960> I<00:04:58.229> have<00:04:58.800> three<00:04:59.099> plus<00:04:59.520> the<00:04:59.759> the<00:05:00.180> Instax

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:00.569 
cards I have three plus the the Instax

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:03.589 
cards I have three plus the the Instax
photo<00:05:00.659> here<00:05:01.099> if<00:05:02.099> the<00:05:02.639> elastic<00:05:03.120> will<00:05:03.240> start<00:05:03.479> to

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:03.599 
photo here if the elastic will start to

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:06.110 
photo here if the elastic will start to
stretch<00:05:03.900> and<00:05:04.110> hold<00:05:04.289> to<00:05:04.680> that<00:05:05.370> amount<00:05:05.639> of<00:05:05.819> cards

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
stretch and hold to that amount of cards

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.839 
stretch and hold to that amount of cards
so<00:05:06.330> say<00:05:07.080> I<00:05:07.110> would<00:05:07.319> have<00:05:07.409> put<00:05:07.590> in<00:05:07.710> only<00:05:08.039> one<00:05:08.550> card

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
so say I would have put in only one card

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:14.779 
so say I would have put in only one card
now<00:05:11.509> it'll<00:05:12.509> fall<00:05:12.689> out<00:05:12.719> easily<00:05:13.080> as<00:05:13.439> we<00:05:14.310> saw<00:05:14.520> in

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
now it'll fall out easily as we saw in

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:17.390 
now it'll fall out easily as we saw in
the<00:05:15.029> wall-e<00:05:15.240> stick<00:05:15.539> on<00:05:15.689> case<00:05:15.870> as<00:05:16.080> well<00:05:16.199> but<00:05:17.099> if

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
the wall-e stick on case as well but if

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.480 
the wall-e stick on case as well but if
we<00:05:17.610> go<00:05:17.789> back<00:05:17.969> to<00:05:18.240> just<00:05:19.080> the<00:05:19.199> standard<00:05:19.500> three

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
we go back to just the standard three

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.649 
we go back to just the standard three
cards<00:05:20.819> in<00:05:20.909> the<00:05:21.029> Instax<00:05:21.360> photo<00:05:22.339> because<00:05:23.339> it's

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:23.659 
cards in the Instax photo because it's

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:26.570 
cards in the Instax photo because it's
stretched<00:05:24.659> that<00:05:24.900> everything<00:05:25.439> stays<00:05:25.680> stuck

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
stretched that everything stays stuck

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.089 
stretched that everything stays stuck
and<00:05:26.849> still<00:05:27.210> in<00:05:27.330> and<00:05:27.509> anything<00:05:27.930> more<00:05:28.770> you<00:05:28.889> put

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
in is gonna stay in as well but again

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.029 
in is gonna stay in as well but again
more<00:05:31.169> you<00:05:31.259> put<00:05:31.409> in<00:05:31.500> it's<00:05:31.680> gonna<00:05:31.800> start<00:05:31.979> to

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
more you put in it's gonna start to

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:33.350 
more you put in it's gonna start to
stretch<00:05:32.310> that<00:05:32.490> and<00:05:32.699> you<00:05:32.759> won't<00:05:32.909> be<00:05:33.029> like<00:05:33.150> carry

stretch that and you won't be like carry

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.869 
stretch that and you won't be like carry
less<00:05:33.599> cards<00:05:33.960> than<00:05:34.080> that<00:05:34.279> and<00:05:35.279> that's<00:05:35.400> it<00:05:35.639> the
