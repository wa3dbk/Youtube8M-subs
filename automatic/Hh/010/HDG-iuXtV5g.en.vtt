 hormones change the smell of milk 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:59.440

 Good, my mother already made cheeses. 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.319
 many years ago here in the

 more on the property she produces cheeses 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.020
 and sold in the city in 2002 I went to 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.020
 Italy 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.149
 there I met 11 italian I ended up 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:05.679
 marrying him and always thinking about 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:07.119
 Back to Brazil, I tried to work. 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.989
 on some farms 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.220
 for cheeses and the production of 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.800
 goat breeding 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.500
 Let's see step by step how luciana does 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.690
 the Italian goat cheese since the 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.510
 producer lived in italy for several years 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.200
 where he improved the production technique 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.690
 because it filters the milk and 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.130
 to the fire for 20 minutes to make the 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.130
 pasteurizing this is a pasteurization 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.870
 clean it will reach a temperature of 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.060
 67 degrees 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.590
 you turn the fire off and carry it in water 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.710
 current to cool to 38 degrees 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.060
 after reaching the temperature of that year the 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.640
 38 degrees 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.740
 You'll put the Flemish there according to 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.720
 As the manufacturer I put a little bit 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:01.430
 past 50 minutes of clotting you 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.040
 will put it because I mess this salt well 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.790
 puts an average of 4 grams per liter 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.040
 milk because the salt will put a 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.960
 a little rennet that will help in 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.690
 identification of this cheese until the 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:18.380
 but very little and 0.25 ml 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.150
 kiss polito puts this 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.810
 painting 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.810
 I think well 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:32.209
 I will put this otis milk powder of 2 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:36.459
 liters where the milk will stay until the day 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.459
 following an average of 18 hours 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:44.450
 and here I am on top of the sink 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:48.079
 the best for this type of cheese one 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:52.849
 average temperature between 20 and 25 degrees 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:57.739
 next day will be with water and ready 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:04:01.669
 to be passed the way you can see 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.419
 the cheese mass is already separated from the 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:04.159
 sleep 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:08.120
 It's trickling down here now for some 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:10.969
 15 minutes when the dough will come down and 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.609
 be the size of the shape after the 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:15.949
 I take the pots and make the first cd 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:18.489
 while Luciana prepares the cheeses 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:20.120
 Let's go to her sister's estate. 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.229
 Ariana 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.960
 here she makes homemade sweet and 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:29.960
 chose the property to write 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.979
 two books tales tales and experiences 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.620
 of rural life 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.840
 for the writer and see in the field is 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.030
 synonym of quality of life 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.150
 I think it's worth it, yes. 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.159
 financially like this issue of 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.250
 quality of life on the property of 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:49.190
 luciana has cane planted grass 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.310
 leased with cattle but she wants to add 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.610
 value with two passions rural tourism 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.250
 with the construction of B and 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.620
 manufacture of artisanal cheeses if the 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.849
 small owner knows how to diversify 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.030
 property can not be a product 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:07.340
 diversify 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.250
 I think it makes a good life and 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.780
 Quiet - orders are scheduled 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.719

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:18.020
 franci's husband leaves a 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:20.960

 at least for these rural producers 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:40.040
 We can say that it worked right here. 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:43.730
 I think it's here for me to have a 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:47.090
