00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.240
 it 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.710
 we are at the bridle the bewitched by 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.210
 a little a sun-colored sugar that does not 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.220
 do not want to become my friend because the 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:45.559
 Japan How are you? 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:51.350
 well i have bilabo here thanks mr and 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:53.780
 expensive I treat a name can not the 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.160
 smile that is engraved on my head that 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:02.030
 have me as everyone presidents 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:05.720
 I have to defend my campaign yes I am 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.540
 not a president no one does not care I 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:13.119
 will you say novelties yeah you dare 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:15.930
 my pc because I do not have memory 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.330
 good 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.360
 already the quality is going to wait she's going to be 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.470
 augmented in this genre there already has 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.600
 started a little on the channel we already have 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.020
 saw some improvements here are some 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.460
 15-second stuff that took me a 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.160
 time to do it's great 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.670
 so that's kind of modification 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.380
 ie more stop motion over 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.210
 special tea with them a few 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.940
 improvements in effects 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.690
 special anyway because for 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.960
 the moment it's basic it's a basic 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.430
 very boring but it's a basic 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.950
 then creating two chains 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.590
 external so he for the cover is 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.310
 one for live that is to say that there 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.759
 would have a chain 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.119
 if you still want to extract for the 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.660
 runners 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.280
 because some did not want 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.690
 specially having cover on the 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.060
 string of the lips that understands right away is 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.390
 logical that you're brothel that's saved 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.790
 aliens like that it's good 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.140
 so if you 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.329
 to see them finally if you want rather 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.480
 listen to cover you can go 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:29.180
 directly on its chains like that in 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.670
 no more that you far from stuff on that one 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.500
 so the second channel has live 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.780
 it's because originally I do not like 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.150
 not m but the frmh like what I 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:45.200
 find it overflowing 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:49.700
 I like this job so there will be at 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.400
 naive with on the banner of the game we go 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.950
 say the one on the home page 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.230
 there will be every day and 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:02.480
 the time of the live so me no more than one 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.760
 per week I think and that's all 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.079
 if you want when his chain will be created 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.079
 you will just have 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.550
 I would just listen in bossert 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.800
 is like that you will be warned of 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:25.300
 Caribbean will happen that you know how 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.960
 not here we are a project 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.740
 with subscribers a project of these 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.720
 small series 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.110
 the number 9 issue in fact were 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.810
 there to announce it we will say it's the 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.540
 beginning but this series so there would be 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.850
 another video to say more 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.240
 information on stage but in this 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.860
 will be a bit like the bonus I made 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.930
 on my channel the audio bar and the 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.520
 frog watford 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.130
 wow the accent to check b an accent of 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.060
 marseille I am pale and marseille 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:02.500
 I do not even have that while 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:05.890
 me short yes just to say this video 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:10.360
 I do it at 2:40 of but it is not 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:14.280
 logical but I live the helmand lo 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.280
 it says so 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.880
 I will try to learn a little there 

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.770
 because often people go 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.450
 end up with one to five business backgrounds 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:26.430
 we still have on project dole here is a 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.710
 hall project with stop motion and 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.900
 the voices of people so I will ask for 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.350
 people there do not tell me I want to do 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.120
 part 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.280
 I'm not going to get a brothel 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.910
 to manage so here I'm doing a video 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.160
 for that the appearance of podcasts because 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.440
 that yes ludo lienne have not yet 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.490
 do the podcast I think at least not 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.260
 the French so on the first 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:53.850
 I will be finally I'm funny 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:57.660
 especially scared after videos with my 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:00.000
 drawings of stories there as I had 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.140
 made for the story the lidia decrypt 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.370
 not it was also for those who 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.760
 do not know it's stories that 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.820
 scares them 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.430
 I already wrote one in fact ya 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:11.250
 a lot of world records that I have 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.310
 created there they are good in my computer and 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.110
 who are just waiting to be 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:19.790
 concretized is put on the chain what 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:22.380
 does that soon you will really have to 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.140
 two new updates more and 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.490
 more videos of the original things 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:32.240
 so avoid increased and in addition to that 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.240
 here is me it's good 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:40.389
 art for children can be more precise 

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:45.579
 I repeat that curbing a whole series 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:48.999
 who puts no but me in two steps what 

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:49.809
 like that's not the kind of the next 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:51.519
 fennecs 

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:54.099
 I think I'll plan two days 

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:56.739
 to do it because it's really 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:58.179
 in addition you have it rightly I expected 

00:05:56.739 --> 00:05:59.559
 improve myself at the technical level for 

00:05:58.179 --> 00:06:02.049
 can do that because precisely the 

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:05.319
 final battle but they ask for 

00:06:02.049 --> 00:06:11.050
 daring special effects with 

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:13.749
 quote cgdd try so here's by 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.939
 therefore it will come out when you go out 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:18.909
 come back I do not know so besides 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:21.149
 to the ash trees and will come out before said town hall 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:27.429
 because the bloody mary is a it's 

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:29.739
 supposed to be the basis of horror and that 

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:32.799
 I want it to be a little season 

00:06:29.739 --> 00:06:34.389
 better done so the one I did by 

00:06:32.799 --> 00:06:37.569
 therefore it has been done twice 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:39.999
 I say only I think very much 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:42.519
 five days to do it so she 

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:43.989
 will not appear now here you are 

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:46.149
 can always watch a real that me 

00:06:43.989 --> 00:06:48.869
 motivates as we say that I say to gc 

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:48.869
 present him some stuff 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.780
 so that's it so do not expect 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:58.430
 prompt to yes if you have any 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.050
 video proposals even though I have 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.419
 still a lot to do but osef 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.770
 says long comment on everything even there 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:05.720
 for example we go on the other channel a 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:08.330
 cover that will soon be created you can 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:11.599
 offer me proposals up to that point 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:13.190
 cover and his nerves after I'll see 

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:15.259
 if i can do them this ask us 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.360
 something you have to do opera all 

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:20.599
 world is playing a little messy 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:23.979
 so here I leave you on his bomb 

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:26.210
 well, I see how long it lasts and 

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:26.509
 again thanks you are subscribers to the 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.699

 if you want again and again and 

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:33.650
 even more novelties and that I 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.719
 motivates to move a little but makes me 

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.250
 make videos a little faster even 

00:07:35.719 --> 00:07:39.199
 if I try to make it anyway 

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:44.120
 both played in this world and their 

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:48.050

00:07:50.770 --> 00:08:00.259
