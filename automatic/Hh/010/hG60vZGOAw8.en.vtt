00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.770
 who made outgoing 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:09.230
 you know that we have never failed you since 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.150
 here we want to thank all your 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.090
 support during these long and dark 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.670
 years 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.190
 our news or saga warned of 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.340
 many dangers harassed helped 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.340
 prevent all series of catastrophes 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.990
 but all principle final tino 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.840
 dear outgoing 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.789
 when all this started we thought that 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.320
 they would never take away what we most 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.430
 Liked to do 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.160
 inform and so it has been for a long 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.030
 weather 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.850
 our time is very small 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.489
 but we have never lacked desire and we have 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.530
 struggled to get to have a 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.699
 hope if we have shown a lot 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.280
 we had to abandon our old 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.260
 facilities we started to hack the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.649
 local transmission systems of each 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.180
 city ​​we went to and thanks to that 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.920
 despite the fact that the communication was cut 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.020
 all the world 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.020
 we managed to reach some people 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.520
 but today scream outgoing 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.520
 we no longer want 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.960
 we can not bring the same hope 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.790
 so much 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.970
 the truth 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.400
 perhaps he has 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.090
 sea told this world and all those who 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.090
 they live in it 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.729
 has a canine pint 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.640
 two 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.940
 this is the last transmission so what 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:00.020
 we have decided all time is also my 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.640
 last message of last message to 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.470
 study just an amount although it has not been 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.910
 become what we are 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.910
 and who will care 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.180
 you have heard that 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.550
 with good luck
