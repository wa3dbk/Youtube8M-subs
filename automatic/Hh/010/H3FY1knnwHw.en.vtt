five<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.840> row<00:00:28.010> I'd<00:00:29.010> say<00:00:29.340> he's<00:00:29.580> going<00:00:30.510> for<00:00:30.810> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
five in a row I'd say he's going for the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.420 
five in a row I'd say he's going for the
gusto<00:00:31.080> okay<00:00:32.040> that's<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.730> nice<00:00:32.850> way<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.120> say<00:00:34.430> so

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
gusto okay that's a nice way to say so

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.650 
gusto okay that's a nice way to say so
we<00:00:35.940> don't<00:00:36.059> make<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.390> stir<00:00:36.739> hahaha<00:00:38.480> we<00:00:39.480> might

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
we don't make it a stir hahaha we might

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.569 
we don't make it a stir hahaha we might
all<00:00:39.930> gonna<00:00:40.110> start<00:00:40.379> things<00:00:40.559> off<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.980> able<00:00:41.309> I

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
all gonna start things off of the able I

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.690 
all gonna start things off of the able I
think<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.719> his<00:00:42.899> alternate<00:00:43.770> jury<00:00:44.280> would<00:00:44.489> do<00:00:44.670> a

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
think that his alternate jury would do a

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.440 
think that his alternate jury would do a
little<00:00:44.910> bit<00:00:45.059> better<00:00:45.300> against<00:00:46.140> guy<00:00:46.800> go<00:00:47.450> they're

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
little bit better against guy go they're

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.229 
little bit better against guy go they're
not<00:00:48.660> able<00:00:48.980> and<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.610> was<00:00:50.789> definitely<00:00:50.850> be

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
not able and that was definitely be

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.700 
not able and that was definitely be
familiar<00:00:51.629> with<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.870> matchup<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.440> luna

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
familiar with this matchup of luna

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.470 
familiar with this matchup of luna

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
vachon 80 throw and he might be able to

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.209 
vachon 80 throw and he might be able to
get<00:00:54.570> things<00:00:54.750> started<00:00:54.899> here<00:00:55.199> same<00:00:55.500> side<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.129> I
