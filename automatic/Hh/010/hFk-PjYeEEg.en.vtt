00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460

origins as you can tell by the game play
in<00:00:08.700> this<00:00:08.849> game<00:00:09.090> play<00:00:09.330> was<00:00:09.990> pretty<00:00:10.469> long<00:00:11.099> this

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
in this game play was pretty long this

in this game play was pretty long this
would<00:00:11.759> probably<00:00:12.000> be<00:00:12.480> my<00:00:12.780> longest<00:00:13.590> round<00:00:13.889> 50

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
would probably be my longest round 50

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.460 
would probably be my longest round 50
run<00:00:14.610> when<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.509> count<00:00:15.809> from<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.080> beginning<00:00:16.410> of

thirty that's about six and six I think

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.370 
thirty that's about six and six I think
six<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.760> half<00:00:26.789> hours<00:00:27.029> I'm<00:00:27.449> good<00:00:28.050> at<00:00:28.170> math

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
six and a half hours I'm good at math

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.349 
six and a half hours I'm good at math
and<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:29.310> was<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.670> wasn't<00:00:29.970> playing<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.240> whole

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
and it was I wasn't playing the whole

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.659 
and it was I wasn't playing the whole
time<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.900> probably<00:00:31.260> took<00:00:31.740> about<00:00:31.800> an<00:00:32.219> hour<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.640> a

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
time I probably took about an hour and a

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.580 
time I probably took about an hour and a
half<00:00:32.880> off<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.420> go<00:00:33.570> outside<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.050> play<00:00:34.170> wiffle

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
half off to go outside and play wiffle

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.799 
half off to go outside and play wiffle
ball<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.920> go<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:35.820> eat<00:00:36.059> dinner<00:00:36.239> because<00:00:36.540> you

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
ball and go and eat dinner because you

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.690 
ball and go and eat dinner because you
can't<00:00:37.079> stare<00:00:37.410> at<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.649> screen<00:00:37.860> for<00:00:38.160> six<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.640> a

can't stare at the screen for six and a

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.270 
can't stare at the screen for six and a
half<00:00:38.730> hours<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.480> ridiculous<00:00:40.320> but<00:00:41.010> I

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
half hours that is ridiculous but I

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.440 
half hours that is ridiculous but I
can't<00:00:41.340> believe<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.969> got<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.270> game

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
can't believe I got this game

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.790 
can't believe I got this game
considering<00:00:42.840> how<00:00:43.050> long<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.290> was<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.739> should

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
considering how long it was I should

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.520 
considering how long it was I should
have<00:00:44.070> quit<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.309> long<00:00:44.460> time<00:00:44.820> ago<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.780> fact<00:00:46.230> what

didn't want to do what I did during moon

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.460

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.920 
made it all the way up to about round 35
and<00:01:13.950> then<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.790> decided<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.330> quit<00:01:15.600> because<00:01:15.780> I

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930

round 35 game on moon and I regret it
because<00:01:24.540> if<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.200> had<00:01:25.380> kept<00:01:25.619> training<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
because if I had kept training in the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.280 
because if I had kept training in the
biodome<00:01:26.640> with<00:01:26.909> theme<00:01:27.240> wave<00:01:27.630> gonna<00:01:27.990> believe

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
biodome with theme wave gonna believe

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.719 
biodome with theme wave gonna believe
that's<00:01:28.500> what<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.740> was<00:01:28.799> called<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:29.220> probably

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
that's what it was called I probably

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.730 
that's what it was called I probably
would<00:01:30.119> have<00:01:30.210> reached<00:01:30.390> around<00:01:30.570> 50<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.470> have

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
would have reached around 50 and I have

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.039 
would have reached around 50 and I have

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
not reached around 50 on moon in fact

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.140 
not reached around 50 on moon in fact
I've<00:01:34.320> made<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.860> all<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.159> way<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.280> around<00:01:35.729> forty

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
I've made it all the way to around forty

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.020 
I've made it all the way to around forty
nine<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.720> then<00:01:37.140> downed<00:01:37.560> which<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.610> probably

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
nine and then downed which is probably

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.080 
nine and then downed which is probably
the<00:01:39.270> worst<00:01:39.420> down<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.439> my<00:01:40.710> career<00:01:41.040> as<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> zombie

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
am presenting you round 50 gameplay on

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.249 
am presenting you round 50 gameplay on
origins<00:01:53.000> moving<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.119> from<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.509> my<00:01:54.750> basic

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
origins moving on from that my basic

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.980 
origins moving on from that my basic
strategy<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.159> fairly<00:01:56.610> simple<00:01:56.969> all<00:01:57.360> i<00:01:57.420> do<00:01:57.810> is

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
strategy is fairly simple all i do is

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.139 
strategy is fairly simple all i do is
train<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.070> crazy<00:01:59.399> place<00:01:59.729> now<00:01:59.969> you'll

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
train in the crazy place now you'll

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.999 
train in the crazy place now you'll
notice<00:02:00.329> i'm<00:02:00.659> not<00:02:00.840> using<00:02:01.110> any<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.710> staves

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
notice i'm not using any of the staves

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.580 
notice i'm not using any of the staves
and<00:02:02.280> i'm<00:02:02.490> not<00:02:02.670> using<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.149> stays<00:02:03.390> because<00:02:03.810> what

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
and i'm not using the stays because what

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.709 
and i'm not using the stays because what
that<00:02:04.619> does<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:05.070> create<00:02:05.759> walls<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.479> crazy

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
that does is create walls in the crazy

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.419 
that does is create walls in the crazy
place<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.469> makes<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.950> pretty<00:02:08.190> difficult

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
place and it makes it pretty difficult

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.639 
place and it makes it pretty difficult
to<00:02:08.819> train<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.270> i<00:02:09.420> wanted<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.050> be<00:02:10.170> able<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.379> train

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
to train in i wanted to be able to train

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.450 
to train in i wanted to be able to train
in<00:02:10.890> your<00:02:11.390> uninterruptible

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
in your uninterruptible

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.920 
in your uninterruptible
about<00:02:12.640> moving<00:02:12.940> walls<00:02:13.150> I<00:02:13.420> didn't<00:02:13.750> want<00:02:13.870> to

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
about moving walls I didn't want to

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.540 
about moving walls I didn't want to
worry<00:02:14.080> about<00:02:14.170> zombies<00:02:14.410> coming<00:02:15.010> in<00:02:15.160> from<00:02:15.310> crazy

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
worry about zombies coming in from crazy

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.040 
worry about zombies coming in from crazy
angles<00:02:15.820> I<00:02:16.180> didn't<00:02:16.480> want<00:02:16.600> to<00:02:16.660> worry<00:02:16.810> about<00:02:16.900> the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
angles I didn't want to worry about the

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.260 
angles I didn't want to worry about the
possibility<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.650> being<00:02:17.920> trapped<00:02:18.250> at<00:02:18.610> random<00:02:19.120> I

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
possibility of being trapped at random I

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.960 
possibility of being trapped at random I
wanted<00:02:19.870> full<00:02:20.080> control<00:02:20.260> of<00:02:20.560> my<00:02:21.010> train<00:02:21.400> so

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
wanted full control of my train so

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.790 
wanted full control of my train so
that's<00:02:22.240> why<00:02:22.360> I<00:02:22.390> trained<00:02:22.750> here<00:02:23.020> in<00:02:23.170> fact<00:02:23.530> it's

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
that's why I trained here in fact it's

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.010 
that's why I trained here in fact it's
pretty<00:02:24.070> nice<00:02:24.340> in<00:02:24.580> here<00:02:24.610> you<00:02:25.150> have<00:02:25.180> open<00:02:25.690> space

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
pretty nice in here you have open space

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.620 
pretty nice in here you have open space
you<00:02:26.560> have<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:26.860> very<00:02:27.370> good<00:02:27.670> wall<00:02:27.910> weapon<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.540> you

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
you have a very good wall weapon and you

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.060 
you have a very good wall weapon and you
don't<00:02:28.900> have<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.200> worry<00:02:29.380> about<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.650> Panzer

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
don't have to worry about the Panzer

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.740 
don't have to worry about the Panzer
soldiers<00:02:30.640> I<00:02:30.880> believe<00:02:31.300> that's<00:02:31.420> what<00:02:31.600> they're

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
soldiers I believe that's what they're

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.990 
soldiers I believe that's what they're
called<00:02:31.990> so<00:02:32.500> it's<00:02:32.980> almost<00:02:33.370> like<00:02:33.610> you're<00:02:33.790> in

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
called so it's almost like you're in

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.910 
called so it's almost like you're in
train<00:02:34.360> heaven<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:35.200> you'll<00:02:35.650> notice

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
train heaven and you'll notice

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.190 
train heaven and you'll notice
throughout<00:02:36.280> this<00:02:36.430> game<00:02:36.610> play<00:02:36.820> I<00:02:37.000> use<00:02:37.240> the<00:02:37.510> SCG

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
throughout this game play I use the SCG

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.050 
throughout this game play I use the SCG
a<00:02:38.230> lot<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:38.920> that's<00:02:39.040> because<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.550> don't<00:02:39.820> want<00:02:39.910> to

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
a lot and that's because I don't want to

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.700 
a lot and that's because I don't want to
leave<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.300> crazy<00:02:40.540> place<00:02:40.870> because<00:02:41.200> what

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
leave the crazy place because what

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.010 
leave the crazy place because what
happens<00:02:42.100> is<00:02:42.280> if<00:02:42.520> you're<00:02:42.820> not<00:02:43.000> in<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.570> main

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
happens is if you're not in the main

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.620 
happens is if you're not in the main
realm<00:02:44.440> when<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.280> Panzer<00:02:45.730> soldat<00:02:46.060> spawns<00:02:46.390> what

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
realm when the Panzer soldat spawns what

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.150 
realm when the Panzer soldat spawns what
he<00:02:46.720> does<00:02:46.900> is<00:02:47.140> he<00:02:47.170> wait<00:02:47.530> at<00:02:47.710> the<00:02:47.740> top<00:02:47.980> of<00:02:48.010> the

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
he does is he wait at the top of the

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.890 
he does is he wait at the top of the
cave<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.700> can<00:02:48.820> be<00:02:48.850> pretty<00:02:49.090> tough<00:02:49.360> to<00:02:49.690> get

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
cave and that can be pretty tough to get

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.630 
cave and that can be pretty tough to get
out<00:02:50.110> of<00:02:50.140> that's<00:02:50.710> a<00:02:50.830> tough<00:02:51.010> situation<00:02:51.250> because

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
out of that's a tough situation because

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.730 
out of that's a tough situation because
it's<00:02:51.880> only<00:02:52.030> one<00:02:52.330> way<00:02:52.450> exit<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.080> he<00:02:53.410> basically

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
it's only one way exit and he basically

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.170 
it's only one way exit and he basically
blocks<00:02:54.160> ticket<00:02:54.520> so<00:02:54.610> you<00:02:54.700> gotta<00:02:54.880> kill<00:02:55.060> him

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
blocks ticket so you gotta kill him

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.390 
blocks ticket so you gotta kill him
quickly<00:02:55.330> so<00:02:55.690> I<00:02:55.900> wanted<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.650> stay<00:02:56.890> in<00:02:56.920> here<00:02:57.190> for

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
quickly so I wanted to stay in here for

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.520 
quickly so I wanted to stay in here for
as<00:02:57.490> long<00:02:57.550> as<00:02:57.850> I<00:02:57.940> could<00:02:58.000> so<00:02:58.360> use<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.780> STG<00:02:59.290> for

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
as long as I could so use the STG for

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.680 
as long as I could so use the STG for
most<00:02:59.710> of<00:02:59.860> this<00:03:00.010> round<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.610> most<00:03:01.240> of<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.510> other

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
most of this round and most of the other

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.730 
most of this round and most of the other
rounds<00:03:01.990> from<00:03:02.140> about<00:03:02.530> 41<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:04.110> 41<00:03:05.110> i<00:03:05.290> believe<00:03:05.620> the

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
rounds from about 41 to 41 i believe the

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
awesome I must say though this gameplay

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.040 
awesome I must say though this gameplay
is<00:04:03.610> a<00:04:03.640> testimony<00:04:04.330> to<00:04:04.450> one<00:04:04.690> of<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:04.840> biggest

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
is a testimony to one of the biggest

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.560 
is a testimony to one of the biggest
changes<00:04:05.710> in<00:04:05.950> black<00:04:06.340> ops<00:04:06.520> 2<00:04:06.700> and<00:04:07.120> if<00:04:07.330> you<00:04:07.480> were

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
changes in black ops 2 and if you were

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.110 
changes in black ops 2 and if you were
to<00:04:07.630> play<00:04:07.840> black<00:04:08.140> ops<00:04:08.170> 1<00:04:08.500> in<00:04:08.920> black<00:04:09.220> ops<00:04:09.400> ooh<00:04:09.670> the

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
to play black ops 1 in black ops ooh the

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.640 
to play black ops 1 in black ops ooh the
one<00:04:10.330> thing<00:04:10.570> you're<00:04:10.780> going<00:04:10.930> to<00:04:10.990> notice<00:04:11.260> in

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
one thing you're going to notice in

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.950 
one thing you're going to notice in
terms<00:04:11.860> of<00:04:12.040> changes<00:04:12.580> is<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:12.850> damage<00:04:13.510> that<00:04:13.690> the

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
terms of changes is the damage that the

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.110 
terms of changes is the damage that the
weapons<00:04:14.350> are<00:04:14.500> able<00:04:14.860> to<00:04:15.040> pull<00:04:15.370> out<00:04:15.550> per<00:04:15.850> bullet

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
weapons are able to pull out per bullet

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.750 
weapons are able to pull out per bullet
so<00:04:16.750> in<00:04:17.140> black<00:04:17.410> ops<00:04:17.710> the<00:04:18.010> weapons<00:04:18.340> are<00:04:18.520> much

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
so in black ops the weapons are much

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.250 
so in black ops the weapons are much
weaker<00:04:18.970> round<00:04:19.330> black<00:04:19.600> ops<00:04:19.840> 2<00:04:20.049> they're

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
weaker round black ops 2 they're

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.230 
weaker round black ops 2 they're
stronger<00:04:20.799> not<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.489> mention<00:04:21.669> that<00:04:21.880> you<00:04:22.030> have

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
stronger not to mention that you have

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.870 
stronger not to mention that you have
double<00:04:22.540> tap<00:04:22.720> to<00:04:22.840> point<00:04:23.230> o<00:04:23.350> the<00:04:23.530> kill

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
double tap to point o the kill

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.640 
double tap to point o the kill
zombies<00:04:24.240> quicker<00:04:24.510> that's<00:04:25.050> what<00:04:25.290> made<00:04:25.470> this

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
zombies quicker that's what made this

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.890 
zombies quicker that's what made this
gameplay<00:04:25.920> possible<00:04:26.730> if<00:04:26.850> I<00:04:26.970> was<00:04:27.180> not<00:04:27.360> able<00:04:27.660> to

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
gameplay possible if I was not able to

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.230 
gameplay possible if I was not able to
kill<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.230> zombies<00:04:28.650> with<00:04:28.860> that<00:04:29.070> STG<00:04:29.970> I

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
kill the zombies with that STG I

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.120 
kill the zombies with that STG I
probably<00:04:30.930> would<00:04:31.200> have<00:04:31.320> to<00:04:31.440> keep<00:04:31.620> leaving<00:04:31.860> the

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
for me at the top of the cave it

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.650 
for me at the top of the cave it
wouldn't<00:04:38.100> have<00:04:38.310> been<00:04:38.730> possible<00:04:38.970> i<00:04:39.270> had<00:04:39.570> to

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
wouldn't have been possible i had to

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.480 
wouldn't have been possible i had to
train<00:04:39.870> by<00:04:40.020> one<00:04:40.200> of<00:04:40.290> the<00:04:40.350> generators<00:04:40.920> and<00:04:41.310> while

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
train by one of the generators and while

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.160 
train by one of the generators and while
i<00:04:41.520> could<00:04:41.940> have<00:04:42.030> done<00:04:42.240> that<00:04:42.270> it<00:04:42.870> would<00:04:43.080> have

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
i could have done that it would have

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.770 
i could have done that it would have
been<00:04:43.260> much<00:04:43.560> harder<00:04:43.920> so<00:04:44.580> with<00:04:44.820> this<00:04:44.850> scg<00:04:45.540> i<00:04:45.570> was

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
been much harder so with this scg i was

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.360 
been much harder so with this scg i was
able<00:04:45.930> to<00:04:46.080> weaken<00:04:46.350> the<00:04:46.500> zombies<00:04:46.920> then<00:04:47.130> i<00:04:47.190> would

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
able to weaken the zombies then i would

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.820 
able to weaken the zombies then i would
kill<00:04:47.610> them<00:04:47.820> with<00:04:47.970> my<00:04:48.000> ray<00:04:48.330> gun<00:04:48.360> mark<00:04:48.750> 2<00:04:48.810> or<00:04:49.260> we

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
kill them with my ray gun mark 2 or we

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.130 
kill them with my ray gun mark 2 or we
just<00:04:50.040> killed<00:04:50.310> a<00:04:50.430> whole<00:04:50.610> train<00:04:51.030> with<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.420> SCG

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
just killed a whole train with the SCG

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.690 
just killed a whole train with the SCG
and<00:04:52.500> what's<00:04:52.680> nice<00:04:52.770> about<00:04:52.830> this<00:04:53.070> area<00:04:53.400> is<00:04:53.550> that

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
and what's nice about this area is that

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.790 
and what's nice about this area is that
the<00:04:53.970> swans<00:04:54.240> are<00:04:54.390> so<00:04:54.600> quick<00:04:54.840> that<00:04:55.080> the<00:04:55.470> zombies

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
the swans are so quick that the zombies

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.500 
the swans are so quick that the zombies
will<00:04:55.830> keep<00:04:56.190> coming<00:04:56.400> and<00:04:56.700> you<00:04:56.790> have<00:04:56.940> an<00:04:57.030> instant

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
will keep coming and you have an instant

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.240 
will keep coming and you have an instant
flow<00:04:57.780> so<00:04:58.020> you<00:04:58.080> can<00:04:58.320> just<00:04:58.350> skip<00:04:58.590> spraying<00:04:59.040> with

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
flow so you can just skip spraying with

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.310 
flow so you can just skip spraying with
that<00:04:59.400> scg<00:05:00.030> and<00:05:00.240> that<00:05:00.420> has<00:05:00.600> somewhere<00:05:00.900> around<00:05:01.050> i

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
that scg and that has somewhere around i

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.920 
that scg and that has somewhere around i
believe<00:05:02.000> 360<00:05:03.000> around<00:05:03.060> something<00:05:03.510> like<00:05:03.750> that

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
believe 360 around something like that

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.930 
believe 360 around something like that
i'm<00:05:04.110> not<00:05:04.290> quite<00:05:04.470> sure<00:05:04.500> so<00:05:05.070> i<00:05:05.100> can<00:05:05.520> just<00:05:05.700> go<00:05:05.880> to

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
i'm not quite sure so i can just go to

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.690 
i'm not quite sure so i can just go to
town<00:05:06.300> on<00:05:06.360> these<00:05:06.750> guys<00:05:06.990> but<00:05:07.800> anyway<00:05:08.220> guys<00:05:08.370> as

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.400 
guys probably won't see me do that
because<00:06:02.730> this<00:06:03.150> gameplay<00:06:03.390> doesn't<00:06:03.810> really<00:06:04.230> go

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
because this gameplay doesn't really go

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.630 
because this gameplay doesn't really go
on<00:06:04.590> for<00:06:04.770> long<00:06:04.800> enough<00:06:04.920> for<00:06:05.220> executive

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
on for long enough for executive

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.010 
on for long enough for executive
actually<00:06:06.210> to<00:06:06.300> be<00:06:06.330> honest<00:06:06.630> ethically

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
actually to be honest ethically

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.870 
actually to be honest ethically
commentating<00:06:07.770> up<00:06:07.920> for<00:06:08.160> about<00:06:08.310> 8<00:06:08.490> minutes<00:06:08.520> and

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
commentating up for about 8 minutes and

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.460 
commentating up for about 8 minutes and
30<00:06:09.150> seconds<00:06:09.630> something<00:06:09.930> like<00:06:10.050> that<00:06:10.170> I<00:06:10.200> believe

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
30 seconds something like that I believe

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.170 
30 seconds something like that I believe
that's<00:06:10.620> how<00:06:10.770> long<00:06:11.040> this<00:06:11.250> gameplay<00:06:11.490> isn't<00:06:11.760> old

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
that's how long this gameplay isn't old

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.850 
that's how long this gameplay isn't old
it<00:06:12.300> without<00:06:12.480> being<00:06:12.660> sped<00:06:13.020> up<00:06:13.170> and<00:06:13.320> if<00:06:13.740> you're

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
it without being sped up and if you're

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.680 
it without being sped up and if you're
wondering<00:06:13.890> why<00:06:14.370> this<00:06:14.430> gameplay<00:06:14.820> sped<00:06:15.390> up<00:06:15.510> it's

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
wondering why this gameplay sped up it's

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.570 
wondering why this gameplay sped up it's
because<00:06:16.020> this<00:06:16.230> is<00:06:16.440> actually<00:06:16.860> a<00:06:16.920> 13<00:06:17.370> minute

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
because this is actually a 13 minute

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.280 
because this is actually a 13 minute
recording<00:06:17.940> and<00:06:18.240> I<00:06:18.660> don't<00:06:18.840> think<00:06:18.990> you<00:06:19.080> guys

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
recording and I don't think you guys

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.320 
recording and I don't think you guys
want<00:06:19.650> to<00:06:19.710> sit<00:06:19.890> through<00:06:20.190> 13<00:06:20.640> minutes<00:06:21.000> of<00:06:21.150> a

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
want to sit through 13 minutes of a

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.790 
want to sit through 13 minutes of a
video<00:06:21.600> where<00:06:21.780> I'm<00:06:21.870> just<00:06:22.050> basically<00:06:22.410> running

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
video where I'm just basically running

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.830 
video where I'm just basically running
in<00:06:23.010> a<00:06:23.070> circle<00:06:23.280> shooting<00:06:24.090> zombies<00:06:24.270> I<00:06:24.600> mean<00:06:24.750> this

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
in a circle shooting zombies I mean this

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.900 
in a circle shooting zombies I mean this
gameplay<00:06:25.110> gets<00:06:25.560> pretty<00:06:25.830> repetitive<00:06:26.160> but<00:06:26.880> I

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
gameplay gets pretty repetitive but I

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.400 
gameplay gets pretty repetitive but I
like<00:06:27.150> it<00:06:27.180> for<00:06:27.480> me<00:06:27.630> I<00:06:27.810> don't<00:06:27.990> know<00:06:28.080> something

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
like it for me I don't know something

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:29.990 
like it for me I don't know something
about<00:06:28.440> this<00:06:28.680> game<00:06:28.920> actually<00:06:29.130> just<00:06:29.490> kept<00:06:29.790> me

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
about this game actually just kept me

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.969 
about this game actually just kept me
going<00:06:30.270> like<00:06:30.480> I<00:06:30.690> said<00:06:30.870> earlier<00:06:30.900> I<00:06:31.410> was<00:06:31.680> going<00:06:31.890> to

going like I said earlier I was going to

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:33.440 
going like I said earlier I was going to
stop<00:06:32.190> at<00:06:32.220> around<00:06:32.460> 30<00:06:32.760> but<00:06:32.970> I<00:06:33.000> think<00:06:33.210> I<00:06:33.300> like
