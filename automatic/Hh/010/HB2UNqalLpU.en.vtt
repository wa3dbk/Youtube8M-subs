that<00:03:39.019> Pokemon<00:03:39.500> and<00:03:39.790> quite<00:03:40.790> often<00:03:41.000> they're

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
that Pokemon and quite often they're

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.160 
that Pokemon and quite often they're
using<00:03:42.080> full<00:03:42.319> restore<00:03:42.830> so<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:44.510> pokemon<00:03:45.019> are

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170

but anyway how's a bad move by me and
well<00:04:45.930> I<00:04:46.340> can<00:04:47.340> just<00:04:47.580> take<00:04:47.819> them<00:04:48.000> all<00:04:48.150> out<00:04:48.180> with

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
well I can just take them all out with

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.450 
well I can just take them all out with
heat<00:04:48.720> wave<00:04:48.930> anyway<00:04:49.349> because<00:04:49.560> heat<00:04:49.949> wave<00:04:50.160> is

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
heat wave anyway because heat wave is

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.029 
heat wave anyway because heat wave is
strong<00:04:52.669> well<00:04:53.669> much<00:04:53.970> stronger<00:04:54.660> than<00:04:54.690> a<00:04:55.039> nearly

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
strong well much stronger than a nearly

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:03.230 
strong well much stronger than a nearly
four<00:04:56.690> anyway<00:04:59.660> it<00:05:00.660> will<00:05:00.900> be<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:02.210> elite<00:05:03.210> four

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
four anyway it will be the elite four

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.219 
four anyway it will be the elite four
does<00:05:03.750> get<00:05:04.169> harder<00:05:05.070> you're<00:05:05.849> most<00:05:06.060> like<00:05:06.419> taking

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
does get harder you're most like taking

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.520 
does get harder you're most like taking
to<00:05:07.410> note<00:05:07.590> that<00:05:08.720> get<00:05:09.720> that<00:05:09.960> into<00:05:10.349> your<00:05:10.410> head

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
to note that get that into your head

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.740 
to note that get that into your head
because<00:05:11.099> if<00:05:11.639> you're<00:05:12.380> aiming<00:05:13.380> just<00:05:14.099> like<00:05:14.750> say

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
because if you're aiming just like say

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.219 
because if you're aiming just like say
train<00:05:16.380> your<00:05:16.680> for<00:05:17.539> so<00:05:18.539> you're<00:05:18.780> good<00:05:18.960> enough<00:05:18.990> to

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
train your for so you're good enough to

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.999 
train your for so you're good enough to
be<00:05:19.530> the<00:05:19.680> first<00:05:20.009> battle<00:05:20.940> it<00:05:21.210> might<00:05:22.139> be<00:05:22.349> far<00:05:22.770> too

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:23.009 
be the first battle it might be far too

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:25.129 
be the first battle it might be far too
hard<00:05:23.250> to<00:05:23.460> get<00:05:23.669> past<00:05:23.909> like<00:05:24.240> the<00:05:24.270> fourth<00:05:24.720> battle

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
hard to get past like the fourth battle

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.899 
hard to get past like the fourth battle
because<00:05:25.530> the<00:05:25.740> Pokemon<00:05:26.190> will<00:05:26.550> be<00:05:26.699> higher

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:26.909 
because the Pokemon will be higher

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:31.399 
because the Pokemon will be higher
leveled<00:05:27.389> now<00:05:28.380> in<00:05:29.009> this<00:05:29.759> they<00:05:30.030> don't<00:05:30.240> get<00:05:30.509> much

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
leveled now in this they don't get much

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:35.210 
leveled now in this they don't get much
much<00:05:31.889> higher<00:05:32.310> level<00:05:32.870> but<00:05:33.870> I<00:05:34.229> honking<00:05:34.919> all<00:05:35.099> the

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
much higher level but I honking all the

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:42.510 
much higher level but I honking all the
games<00:05:35.430> they<00:05:35.639> can<00:05:35.940> get<00:05:36.120> pretty<00:05:36.419> high

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.960 

i'm<00:05:43.090> just<00:05:43.419> wondering<00:05:43.660> i'm<00:05:44.169> thinking<00:05:44.919> that<00:05:45.610> the

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
i'm just wondering i'm thinking that the

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.900 
i'm just wondering i'm thinking that the
dams<00:05:46.449> and<00:05:46.690> pearl<00:05:46.930> champion<00:05:47.680> has<00:05:47.949> level<00:05:48.340> 60s

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
dams and pearl champion has level 60s

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.540 
dams and pearl champion has level 60s
but<00:05:49.090> i'm<00:05:49.240> not<00:05:49.419> sure<00:05:49.479> i<00:05:50.080> think<00:05:50.740> i<00:05:51.159> might<00:05:51.310> be

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
but i'm not sure i think i might be

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.520 
but i'm not sure i think i might be
thinking<00:05:52.389> something<00:05:52.720> up<00:05:52.870> in<00:05:53.020> my<00:05:53.139> head<00:05:53.319> but

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
thinking something up in my head but

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.559 
thinking something up in my head but
anyway<00:05:54.330> the<00:05:55.330> elite<00:05:55.810> four<00:05:55.840> does<00:05:56.560> get<00:05:57.159> harder<00:05:57.699> so

00:05:58.559 --> 00:05:58.569 
anyway the elite four does get harder so

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:01.439 
anyway the elite four does get harder so
you<00:05:59.020> need<00:05:59.379> pokemon<00:06:00.159> that<00:06:00.370> will<00:06:00.639> be<00:06:01.150> able<00:06:01.270> to

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:01.449 
you need pokemon that will be able to

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:15.070 
you need pokemon that will be able to
take<00:06:01.840> the<00:06:02.520> extra<00:06:04.199> push<00:06:05.430> every<00:06:06.430> battle

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.730 

so<00:06:15.740> yeah<00:06:16.610> these<00:06:16.909> first<00:06:17.330> few<00:06:17.569> battles<00:06:17.840> are<00:06:18.439> very

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
so yeah these first few battles are very

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.179 
so yeah these first few battles are very
easy<00:06:19.449> well<00:06:20.449> for<00:06:20.720> me<00:06:20.900> anyway<00:06:20.930> if<00:06:21.620> you've<00:06:21.860> got

00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:22.189 
easy well for me anyway if you've got

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:23.950 
easy well for me anyway if you've got
lower<00:06:22.490> level<00:06:22.849> pokemon<00:06:23.000> then<00:06:23.419> there<00:06:23.629> might<00:06:23.900> be

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
lower level pokemon then there might be

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.409 
lower level pokemon then there might be
a<00:06:24.169> bit<00:06:24.379> harder<00:06:25.189> for<00:06:25.400> you<00:06:25.550> or<00:06:25.849> if<00:06:26.030> you've<00:06:26.180> got

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:26.419 
a bit harder for you or if you've got

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.570 
a bit harder for you or if you've got

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
the wrong type which is always very

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.860 
the wrong type which is always very
annoying<00:06:29.289> so<00:06:30.669> that's<00:06:31.669> the<00:06:32.000> second<00:06:32.599> elite

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
annoying so that's the second elite

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:38.129 
annoying so that's the second elite
four-member<00:06:33.740> down<00:06:34.159> and<00:06:34.430> out<00:06:34.580> so<00:06:35.419> um<00:06:36.250> yeah<00:06:37.250> so
