most<00:00:00.659> Road<00:00:00.870> races<00:00:01.230> start<00:00:01.500> pretty<00:00:01.770> gently<00:00:02.129> and

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
most Road races start pretty gently and

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.919 
most Road races start pretty gently and

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
even in a time phone there's an element

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.869 
even in a time phone there's an element
of<00:00:04.049> control<00:00:04.230> as<00:00:04.890> you<00:00:05.009> roll<00:00:05.190> off<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.490> start<00:00:05.730> run

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
of control as you roll off the start run

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.200

but<00:00:06.359> Simon<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:07.220> start<00:00:08.220> of<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.639> cyclocross<00:00:09.090> race

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
but Simon a start of a cyclocross race

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.360 
but Simon a start of a cyclocross race
to<00:00:09.990> me<00:00:10.110> seems<00:00:10.410> completely<00:00:10.769> frenetic<00:00:11.219> it's

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
to me seems completely frenetic it's

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.009 
to me seems completely frenetic it's
almost<00:00:11.550> like<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.759> bunch<00:00:12.300> sprint<00:00:12.630> but<00:00:12.870> at<00:00:12.960> the

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
almost like a bunch sprint but at the

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.120 
almost like a bunch sprint but at the
beginning<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.530> race<00:00:13.650> rather<00:00:13.920> than<00:00:14.009> the

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
beginning of the race rather than the

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.829 
beginning of the race rather than the
end<00:00:14.219> absolutely<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:15.089> think<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.389> hardest<00:00:15.719> you

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
end absolutely I think the hardest you

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.570 
end absolutely I think the hardest you
probably<00:00:16.049> ever<00:00:16.199> have<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.619> go<00:00:16.770> in<00:00:17.010> any<00:00:17.279> bike

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
probably ever have to go in any bike

race is at the start of a cyclocross
race<00:00:19.470> but<00:00:20.220> there's<00:00:20.640> loads<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.910> little<00:00:21.029> tricks

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
race but there's loads of little tricks

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.790 
race but there's loads of little tricks
and<00:00:21.600> tips<00:00:21.779> we<00:00:21.990> can<00:00:22.050> give<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.410> that'll<00:00:22.680> mean

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
and tips we can give you that'll mean

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.620 
and tips we can give you that'll mean
that<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:23.010> nail<00:00:23.279> every<00:00:23.789> start<00:00:24.090> without

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
that you nail every start without

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.660 
that you nail every start without
ruining<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.170> rest<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.590> your<00:00:25.710> race<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.220> think

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
ruining the rest of your race I think

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.160 
ruining the rest of your race I think
first<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:26.970> all<00:00:27.029> we<00:00:27.119> need<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.330> think<00:00:27.420> about<00:00:27.720> what

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
first of all we need to think about what

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.779 
first of all we need to think about what
the<00:00:28.260> actual<00:00:28.529> objective<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:29.130> your<00:00:29.220> start<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.609> it

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
the actual objective of your start is it

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.880 
the actual objective of your start is it
sounds<00:00:30.029> pretty<00:00:30.210> stupid<00:00:30.390> but<00:00:30.810> essentially<00:00:31.800> you

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
sounds pretty stupid but essentially you

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.530 
sounds pretty stupid but essentially you
want<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.160> go<00:00:32.250> hard<00:00:32.520> enough<00:00:32.790> off<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.239> start

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
want to go hard enough off the start

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.420 
want to go hard enough off the start
that<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.930> hold<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.350> position<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.010> race<00:00:35.190> we

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
that you hold a position in the race we

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.459 
that you hold a position in the race we
don't<00:00:35.460> get<00:00:35.760> held<00:00:36.000> up<00:00:36.180> by<00:00:36.630> slower<00:00:36.930> riders<00:00:37.200> when

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
don't get held up by slower riders when

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.600 
don't get held up by slower riders when
you<00:00:37.530> get<00:00:37.649> two<00:00:37.770> corners<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.250> technical

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
you get two corners and technical

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.220 
you get two corners and technical
sections<00:00:38.969> but<00:00:39.300> equally<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.629> don't<00:00:39.870> get<00:00:39.989> so

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
sections but equally you don't get so

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.369 
sections but equally you don't get so
hard<00:00:40.530> for<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.280> long<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.210> end<00:00:42.360> up<00:00:42.600> parking

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
hard for so long that you end up parking

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.440 
hard for so long that you end up parking
up<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.770> then<00:00:44.010> everyone<00:00:44.579> just<00:00:44.610> overtaking

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
up and then everyone just overtaking

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.450 
up and then everyone just overtaking
comes<00:00:45.750> back<00:00:45.960> past<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.410> ten<00:00:46.620> minutes<00:00:46.710> later<00:00:47.039> so

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
comes back past you ten minutes later so

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.220 
comes back past you ten minutes later so
it's<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> balancing<00:00:48.120> act<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.780> it's<00:00:48.899> almost<00:00:48.989> like

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
it's a balancing act so it's almost like

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.049 
it's a balancing act so it's almost like
was<00:00:49.530> very<00:00:49.649> much<00:00:50.039> like<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.430> our<00:00:50.579> parallel<00:00:50.969> ways

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
was very much like in our parallel ways

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.459 
was very much like in our parallel ways
in<00:00:51.149> relation<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.510> riding<00:00:51.840> on<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> kind<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.230> climb

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
in relation to riding on a kind of climb

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.779 
in relation to riding on a kind of climb
in<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.680> sweet<00:00:52.890> spot<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.460> want<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.640> ride

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
in the sweet spot you want to ride

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.490 
in the sweet spot you want to ride
nearly<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.120> threshold<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:54.870> not<00:00:55.110> go<00:00:55.260> into<00:00:55.379> that

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
nearly a threshold but not go into that

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.170 
nearly a threshold but not go into that
red<00:00:55.739> zone<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.219> completely<00:00:56.640> blow<00:00:56.820> up<00:00:56.969> and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
red zone so you completely blow up and

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.760 
red zone so you completely blow up and
lose<00:00:57.539> lots<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.780> places<00:00:57.989> again<00:00:58.230> well<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.649> will

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
lose lots of places again well you will

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.560 
lose lots of places again well you will
have<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.980> go<00:00:59.039> into<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.250> red<00:00:59.460> but<00:00:59.850> just<00:01:00.270> not<00:01:00.510> for

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
have to go into the red but just not for

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.049 
have to go into the red but just not for
so<00:01:00.930> long<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.379> can't<00:01:01.620> recover<00:01:01.879> so<00:01:02.879> that's

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
so long that you can't recover so that's

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.850 
so long that you can't recover so that's
what<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.510> need<00:01:03.690> all<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.080> trainings<00:01:04.500> for<00:01:04.710> is

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
what you need all the trainings for is

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.070 
what you need all the trainings for is
to<00:01:04.979> be<00:01:05.129> able<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.369> go<00:01:05.909> anaerobic<00:01:06.180> but<00:01:06.720> then<00:01:06.840> come

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
to be able to go anaerobic but then come

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.440 
to be able to go anaerobic but then come
back<00:01:07.110> out<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.650> then<00:01:07.979> go<00:01:08.100> back<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.460> again<00:01:08.670> it

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
back out and then go back in again it

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.670 
back out and then go back in again it
has<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.659> be<00:01:09.780> said<00:01:09.960> though<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> start

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
has to be said though that the start

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.070 
has to be said though that the start
while<00:01:11.240> really<00:01:12.240> really<00:01:12.479> important<00:01:12.930> unless

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
while really really important unless

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.920 
while really really important unless
it's<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.650> flat<00:01:14.040> fast<00:01:14.520> dry<00:01:14.939> day<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.659> not<00:01:15.869> the

it's a flat fast dry day it's not the

it's a flat fast dry day it's not the
be-all<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.439> end-all<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:17.220> only<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.460> to

be-all and end-all you only have to

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.280 
be-all and end-all you only have to

watch spend nice in it pretty much any
Belgian<00:01:19.740> cyclocross<00:01:20.189> race<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.670> you'll<00:01:20.759> see

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
Belgian cyclocross race and you'll see

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.649 
him cruising around mid pack for the
first<00:01:23.070> few<00:01:23.310> laps<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.119> that's<00:01:24.299> because<00:01:24.540> he

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
first few laps and that's because he

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.649 
first few laps and that's because he
knows<00:01:25.229> how<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.040> ride<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:26.880> he<00:01:27.030> knows<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.479> he

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
knows how to ride it so he knows that he

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.179 
knows how to ride it so he knows that he
can<00:01:27.810> bring<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.080> guys<00:01:28.229> back<00:01:28.500> make<00:01:28.740> up<00:01:28.920> 30

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
can bring the guys back make up 30

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.580 
can bring the guys back make up 30
seconds<00:01:29.640> when<00:01:30.090> he<00:01:30.180> needs<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:30.930> think<00:01:31.110> he's

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
seconds when he needs to so I think he's

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.440 
seconds when he needs to so I think he's
a<00:01:31.619> really<00:01:31.920> good<00:01:32.130> example<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.119> know<00:01:33.180> not

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
a really good example of you know not

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.880 
a really good example of you know not
getting<00:01:33.659> too<00:01:33.840> caught<00:01:34.079> up<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.619> start

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
getting too caught up in the start

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.370 
getting too caught up in the start
effort<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.430> then<00:01:35.880> saving<00:01:36.540> something<00:01:36.960> for<00:01:37.140> 10

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
effort and then saving something for 10

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.260 
effort and then saving something for 10
20<00:01:37.770> 30<00:01:38.100> minutes<00:01:38.460> into<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.700> race<00:01:38.850> when

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
20 30 minutes into the race when

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.910 
20 30 minutes into the race when
everyone<00:01:39.570> else<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.869> going<00:01:40.049> slower<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.650> you

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
everyone else is going slower and you

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.850 
everyone else is going slower and you
can<00:01:41.100> go<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.520> mahalo<00:01:42.030> now<00:01:42.150> quicker

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
can go to mahalo now quicker

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.219 
can go to mahalo now quicker
sounds<00:01:43.860> good<00:01:44.040> alright<00:01:44.460> three<00:01:44.729> two<00:01:44.880> one<00:01:45.030> good

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
sounds good alright three two one good

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.010 
sounds good alright three two one good
you've<00:01:46.229> never<00:01:46.380> told<00:01:46.619> me<00:01:46.740> you're<00:01:46.860> doing<00:01:47.009> that

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.840 

so<00:01:52.020> sites<00:01:52.290> not<00:01:52.620> just<00:01:52.680> about<00:01:53.070> standing<00:01:53.490> hard<00:01:53.730> on

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
so sites not just about standing hard on

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.820 
so sites not just about standing hard on
the<00:01:53.940> pedals<00:01:54.240> what<00:01:54.390> about<00:01:54.540> skills<00:01:55.080> technique

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
the pedals what about skills technique

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.860 
the pedals what about skills technique
and<00:01:55.980> tactics<00:01:56.340> absolutely<00:01:57.210> okay<00:01:57.390> well<00:01:57.630> first

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
and tactics absolutely okay well first

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.570 
and tactics absolutely okay well first
things<00:01:58.080> first<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.680> get<00:01:58.800> off<00:01:58.980> the<00:01:59.160> line

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
things first to get off the line

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.850 
things first to get off the line
your<00:01:59.940> first<00:02:00.240> pedal<00:02:00.510> stroke<00:02:00.870> is<00:02:01.290> obviously

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
your first pedal stroke is obviously

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.500 
your first pedal stroke is obviously
crucial<00:02:02.160> but<00:02:02.550> not<00:02:02.820> necessarily<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.480> way

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
crucial but not necessarily in the way

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.970 
crucial but not necessarily in the way
you<00:02:03.630> think<00:02:03.810> about<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.200> it's<00:02:04.560> more<00:02:04.770> about

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
you think about it it's more about

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.430 
you think about it it's more about
getting<00:02:05.220> your<00:02:05.520> trailing<00:02:06.150> leg<00:02:06.270> clipped<00:02:06.690> in<00:02:06.930> so

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
getting your trailing leg clipped in so

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.109 
getting your trailing leg clipped in so
that<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.650> can<00:02:07.830> then<00:02:07.980> accelerate<00:02:08.550> hard<00:02:08.760> with

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
that you can then accelerate hard with

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.700 
that you can then accelerate hard with
both<00:02:09.150> feet<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.840> pedals<00:02:10.230> okay

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
both feet on the pedals okay

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.890 
both feet on the pedals okay
so<00:02:10.950> presumably<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.910> do<00:02:12.180> practice<00:02:12.360> clipping

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
so presumably you do practice clipping

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.280 
so presumably you do practice clipping
in<00:02:12.990> it<00:02:14.030> sometimes<00:02:15.030> yeah<00:02:15.240> yeah<00:02:15.660> we<00:02:15.810> all<00:02:16.110> thought

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
in it sometimes yeah yeah we all thought

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.380 
in it sometimes yeah yeah we all thought
that<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:17.250> that's<00:02:17.370> really<00:02:17.640> really<00:02:18.030> vital

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
that and so that's really really vital

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.780 
that and so that's really really vital
you<00:02:18.750> want<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:18.990> start<00:02:19.260> with<00:02:19.470> your<00:02:19.800> lead<00:02:20.220> leg<00:02:20.520> at

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
you want to start with your lead leg at

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.970 
you want to start with your lead leg at
one<00:02:21.210> or<00:02:21.360> two<00:02:21.570> o'clock<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.680> gives<00:02:22.890> you

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
one or two o'clock and that gives you

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.860 
one or two o'clock and that gives you
plenty<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.250> time<00:02:23.490> for<00:02:23.730> your<00:02:23.940> trailing<00:02:24.480> leg<00:02:24.570> to

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
plenty of time for your trailing leg to

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.180 
plenty of time for your trailing leg to
then<00:02:25.020> find<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.410> pedal<00:02:25.740> so<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.040> you're

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
then find the pedal so that you're

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.790 
then find the pedal so that you're
clipped<00:02:26.520> in<00:02:26.730> first<00:02:27.210> time<00:02:27.510> as<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:28.410> comes<00:02:28.620> over

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
clipped in first time as it comes over

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.830 
clipped in first time as it comes over
the<00:02:29.220> 12<00:02:29.490> o'clock<00:02:29.670> position<00:02:29.760> now<00:02:30.270> that<00:02:30.660> does

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
the 12 o'clock position now that does

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.750 
the 12 o'clock position now that does
take<00:02:31.080> practice<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.590> people<00:02:32.400> miss<00:02:32.580> their

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
take practice and people miss their

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.640 
take practice and people miss their
pedals<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.480> know<00:02:33.600> Pro<00:02:33.840> cross<00:02:34.080> riders<00:02:34.440> do<00:02:34.560> it

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
pedals you know Pro cross riders do it

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.470 
pedals you know Pro cross riders do it
all<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.830> time<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.250> does<00:02:35.430> happen<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:35.970> it's

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
all the time so it does happen and it's

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.060 
all the time so it does happen and it's
pretty<00:02:36.930> much<00:02:37.050> impossible<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.590> do<00:02:37.740> it<00:02:37.800> first

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
pretty much impossible to do it first

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.590 
pretty much impossible to do it first
time<00:02:38.220> every<00:02:38.430> time<00:02:38.460> but<00:02:38.880> it's<00:02:39.030> absolutely

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
time every time but it's absolutely

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.510 
time every time but it's absolutely
worth<00:02:39.870> practicing<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:40.950> get<00:02:41.070> off<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.370> line

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
worth practicing to get off the line

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.150 
worth practicing to get off the line
quickly<00:02:41.930> good<00:02:42.930> ok<00:02:44.270> he's<00:02:45.270> in<00:02:45.300> easy<00:02:45.990> look<00:02:46.920> at

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
quickly good ok he's in easy look at

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.870 
quickly good ok he's in easy look at
that<00:02:51.380> so<00:02:52.380> tom<00:02:52.650> talked<00:02:53.130> about<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.430> technique

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
that so tom talked about the technique

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.420 
that so tom talked about the technique
at<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.540> start<00:02:54.780> of<00:02:54.840> a<00:02:54.959> race<00:02:55.170> what<00:02:55.830> about<00:02:55.920> gear

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
at the start of a race what about gear

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.710 
at the start of a race what about gear
selection<00:02:56.790> because<00:02:57.209> it's<00:02:57.330> something<00:02:57.540> that

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
selection because it's something that

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.090 
selection because it's something that
you<00:02:58.050> don't<00:02:58.200> really<00:02:58.320> have<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.650> think<00:02:58.740> about<00:02:58.890> in

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
you don't really have to think about in

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.920 
you don't really have to think about in
a<00:02:59.160> road<00:02:59.310> race<00:02:59.490> yeah<00:03:00.120> your<00:03:00.330> gear<00:03:00.570> selection

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
a road race yeah your gear selection

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.420 
a road race yeah your gear selection
that<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.320> stuff<00:03:01.530> is<00:03:01.560> really<00:03:01.920> important<00:03:02.370> to

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
that the stuff is really important to

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.070 
that the stuff is really important to
get<00:03:02.580> right<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:02.820> clipping<00:03:03.390> in<00:03:03.480> easier<00:03:03.810> it's

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
get right and clipping in easier it's

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.840 
get right and clipping in easier it's
just<00:03:04.260> one<00:03:04.500> of<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.680> reasons<00:03:05.010> when<00:03:05.610> you<00:03:05.670> think

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
just one of the reasons when you think

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.070 
just one of the reasons when you think
about<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.090> gear<00:03:06.300> you<00:03:06.390> want<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.660> be<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:06.930> you

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
about the gear you want to be and you

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.630 
about the gear you want to be and you
take<00:03:07.350> into<00:03:07.560> account<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.920> few<00:03:08.070> factors<00:03:08.430> the

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
take into account a few factors the

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.790 
take into account a few factors the
gradient<00:03:09.120> of<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.300> start<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:10.260> surface<00:03:10.680> that

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
gradient of the start the surface that

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.290 
gradient of the start the surface that
you're<00:03:10.890> starting<00:03:11.160> on<00:03:11.370> in<00:03:11.520> your<00:03:11.640> position<00:03:12.180> on

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
you're starting on in your position on

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.660 
you're starting on in your position on
the<00:03:12.420> start<00:03:12.750> grid<00:03:12.900> brush<00:03:13.860> starts<00:03:14.190> as<00:03:14.310> we<00:03:14.459> said<00:03:14.640> a

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
the start grid brush starts as we said a

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.400 
the start grid brush starts as we said a
really<00:03:14.970> fast<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:15.810> you're<00:03:15.959> going<00:03:16.080> to<00:03:16.140> have<00:03:16.290> to

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
really fast so you're going to have to

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.560 
really fast so you're going to have to
change<00:03:16.620> gear<00:03:16.920> at<00:03:17.010> some<00:03:17.220> point<00:03:17.459> so<00:03:18.239> it's<00:03:18.360> best

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
change gear at some point so it's best

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.940 
change gear at some point so it's best
to<00:03:18.660> start<00:03:18.959> in<00:03:19.110> your<00:03:19.140> big<00:03:19.410> ring<00:03:19.620> because<00:03:19.830> the

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
to start in your big ring because the

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.350 
to start in your big ring because the
front<00:03:20.220> mat<00:03:20.700> can<00:03:20.970> be<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.090> bit<00:03:21.239> more

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
front mat can be a bit more

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.080 
front mat can be a bit more
unpredictable<00:03:21.840> under<00:03:22.650> strain<00:03:23.010> but<00:03:23.610> on<00:03:23.940> the

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
unpredictable under strain but on the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.250 
unpredictable under strain but on the
other<00:03:24.150> hand<00:03:24.360> you<00:03:24.450> don't<00:03:24.660> want<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.930> be<00:03:25.020> over

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
other hand you don't want to be over

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.660 
other hand you don't want to be over
gear<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:25.739> need<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:25.980> weigh<00:03:26.130> up<00:03:26.280> whether<00:03:26.520> the

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
gear so you need to weigh up whether the

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.400 
gear so you need to weigh up whether the
moment<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.060> easing<00:03:27.480> off<00:03:27.600> to<00:03:27.870> change<00:03:28.110> into<00:03:28.350> your

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
moment of easing off to change into your

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.160 
moment of easing off to change into your
big<00:03:28.620> ring<00:03:28.830> it's<00:03:29.640> worse<00:03:29.970> than<00:03:30.480> being<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:30.750> little

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
big ring it's worse than being a little

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.650 
big ring it's worse than being a little
bit<00:03:31.260> over<00:03:31.440> gear<00:03:31.739> at<00:03:31.950> first<00:03:32.360> here<00:03:33.360> we<00:03:33.390> go

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.910 

now<00:03:36.660> it's<00:03:37.050> something<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.350> bear<00:03:37.560> in<00:03:37.590> mind<00:03:37.650> if

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
now it's something to bear in mind if

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.380 
now it's something to bear in mind if
you<00:03:38.010> are<00:03:38.040> starting<00:03:38.610> in<00:03:38.670> your<00:03:38.790> big<00:03:39.000> ring<00:03:39.180> you're

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
you are starting in your big ring you're

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.300 
you are starting in your big ring you're
likely<00:03:39.570> to<00:03:39.750> be<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:40.170> long<00:03:40.560> way<00:03:40.709> up<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:40.950> cassette

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
likely to be a long way up the cassette

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.830 
likely to be a long way up the cassette
at<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.489> back<00:03:41.700> so<00:03:41.970> your<00:03:42.090> chain<00:03:42.330> line<00:03:42.540> isn't

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
at the back so your chain line isn't

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.660 
at the back so your chain line isn't
going<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.290> be<00:03:43.380> optimal<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:44.010> it's<00:03:44.400> very<00:03:44.580> easy

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
going to be optimal and it's very easy

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.880 
going to be optimal and it's very easy
to<00:03:45.320> absent-mindedly<00:03:46.320> start<00:03:46.620> backpedaling

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
to absent-mindedly start backpedaling

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.410 
to absent-mindedly start backpedaling
when<00:03:47.430> you're<00:03:47.550> nervous<00:03:47.730> on<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.090> start<00:03:48.360> line

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
when you're nervous on the start line

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.870 
when you're nervous on the start line
and<00:03:49.170> so<00:03:49.350> if<00:03:49.500> you<00:03:49.590> do<00:03:49.739> that<00:03:49.920> you<00:03:50.550> need<00:03:50.670> to<00:03:50.730> be

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
and so if you do that you need to be

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.940 
and so if you do that you need to be
really<00:03:51.270> careful<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:52.110> chain<00:03:52.380> is<00:03:52.530> not<00:03:52.650> halfway

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
really careful the chain is not halfway

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.890 
really careful the chain is not halfway
through<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.400> jump<00:03:53.790> or<00:03:54.000> something<00:03:54.120> when<00:03:54.810> you

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
through a jump or something when you

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.870 
through a jump or something when you
start<00:03:55.170> pedaling<00:03:55.320> hard<00:03:55.709> you're<00:03:56.489> just<00:03:56.670> going<00:03:56.790> to

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
start pedaling hard you're just going to

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.699 
start pedaling hard you're just going to
lose<00:03:57.000> your<00:03:57.180> gears<00:03:57.420> so<00:03:57.780> do<00:03:58.079> make<00:03:58.230> sure<00:03:58.290> if<00:03:58.590> you

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
lose your gears so do make sure if you

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.280 
lose your gears so do make sure if you
do<00:03:58.829> bad<00:03:58.980> pedal<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.820> then<00:04:00.000> do

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
do bad pedal you then do

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.520 
do bad pedal you then do
for<00:04:01.409> one<00:04:01.680> as<00:04:01.799> well<00:04:02.900> right<00:04:03.900> Matt<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.290> last

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
for one as well right Matt the last

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.500 
for one as well right Matt the last
thing<00:04:04.799> to<00:04:04.890> think<00:04:05.069> about<00:04:05.159> is<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.969> grid

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
thing to think about is the grid

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.140 
thing to think about is the grid
so<00:04:06.840> most<00:04:07.200> Cypress<00:04:07.680> races<00:04:08.129> will<00:04:08.579> be<00:04:08.609> gridded

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
so most Cypress races will be gridded

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.789 
so most Cypress races will be gridded
and<00:04:09.299> therefore<00:04:09.719> you<00:04:09.780> get<00:04:09.930> called<00:04:10.200> up<00:04:10.379> to<00:04:10.439> line

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
and therefore you get called up to line

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.679 
and therefore you get called up to line
in<00:04:11.040> turn<00:04:11.400> well<00:04:12.090> I'm<00:04:12.239> not<00:04:12.420> going<00:04:12.569> to<00:04:12.629> be

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:12.689 
in turn well I'm not going to be

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:14.720 
in turn well I'm not going to be
prettier<00:04:13.109> than<00:04:13.170> I<00:04:13.319> you<00:04:14.040> will<00:04:14.219> be<00:04:14.370> gridded

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
prettier than I you will be gridded

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.090 
prettier than I you will be gridded
you're<00:04:15.599> just<00:04:15.719> going<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:15.900> grid<00:04:16.109> at<00:04:16.199> last<00:04:16.440> well

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
you're just going to grid at last well

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.409 
you're just going to grid at last well
but<00:04:17.489> that's<00:04:17.639> not<00:04:17.759> a<00:04:17.789> problem<00:04:17.910> that's<00:04:18.239> not<00:04:18.359> a

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
but that's not a problem that's not a

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.960 
but that's not a problem that's not a
problem<00:04:18.660> we<00:04:19.109> can<00:04:19.259> tackle<00:04:19.470> it<00:04:19.620> anyway<00:04:19.889> okay<00:04:20.070> so

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
problem we can tackle it anyway okay so

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.570 
problem we can tackle it anyway okay so
when<00:04:21.359> you're<00:04:21.479> pre<00:04:21.720> riding<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.139> course

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
when you're pre riding the course

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.740 
when you're pre riding the course
beforehand<00:04:23.580> you<00:04:23.850> need<00:04:24.000> to<00:04:24.090> think<00:04:24.419> not<00:04:24.570> just

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
beforehand you need to think not just

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.570 
beforehand you need to think not just
about<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:25.020> start<00:04:25.320> straight<00:04:25.530> but<00:04:25.770> also<00:04:25.949> what

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
about the start straight but also what

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.249 
about the start straight but also what
happens<00:04:26.910> at<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.060> end<00:04:27.180> of<00:04:27.330> it<00:04:27.419> so<00:04:27.720> is<00:04:27.960> it<00:04:28.199> a

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:28.259 
happens at the end of it so is it a

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:30.020 
happens at the end of it so is it a
left-hand<00:04:28.710> corner<00:04:29.009> first<00:04:29.250> or<00:04:29.520> a<00:04:29.580> right-hand

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
left-hand corner first or a right-hand

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.180 
left-hand corner first or a right-hand
corner<00:04:30.240> first<00:04:30.479> all<00:04:30.780> these<00:04:30.990> little<00:04:31.139> things<00:04:31.259> to

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
corner first all these little things to

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.520 
corner first all these little things to
tell<00:04:33.060> you<00:04:33.270> which<00:04:33.539> side<00:04:33.780> of<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.960> grid<00:04:34.169> you<00:04:34.199> need

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
tell you which side of the grid you need

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.469 
tell you which side of the grid you need
to<00:04:34.680> be<00:04:34.830> on<00:04:34.979> say<00:04:35.430> for<00:04:35.520> example<00:04:35.910> if<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.240> start

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
to be on say for example if the start

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.089 
to be on say for example if the start
straight<00:04:36.630> finishes<00:04:37.139> in<00:04:37.259> a<00:04:37.349> sharp<00:04:37.620> right-hand

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099 
straight finishes in a sharp right-hand

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:39.710 
straight finishes in a sharp right-hand
corner<00:04:38.490> we<00:04:38.699> can<00:04:38.849> be<00:04:38.910> pretty<00:04:39.120> sure<00:04:39.210> that<00:04:39.360> Evans

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
corner we can be pretty sure that Evans

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.480 
corner we can be pretty sure that Evans
going<00:04:39.810> to<00:04:39.900> bunch<00:04:40.110> up<00:04:40.349> on<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.860> right-hand<00:04:41.070> side

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
going to bunch up on the right-hand side

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.640 
going to bunch up on the right-hand side
so<00:04:41.520> maybe<00:04:41.910> you're<00:04:42.150> better<00:04:42.389> off<00:04:42.570> hanging<00:04:43.289> far

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
so maybe you're better off hanging far

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.320 
so maybe you're better off hanging far
left<00:04:43.919> or<00:04:44.280> you<00:04:44.370> can<00:04:44.490> hopefully<00:04:44.699> go<00:04:45.000> around<00:04:45.210> the

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
left or you can hopefully go around the

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.689 
left or you can hopefully go around the
outside<00:04:45.470> but<00:04:46.470> then<00:04:46.650> equally<00:04:47.099> as<00:04:47.250> we<00:04:47.400> can<00:04:47.550> see

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
outside but then equally as we can see

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.219 
outside but then equally as we can see
on<00:04:47.820> our<00:04:47.849> little<00:04:48.210> fake<00:04:48.389> start<00:04:48.720> straight<00:04:48.960> here

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
on our little fake start straight here

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.320 
on our little fake start straight here
there's<00:04:50.070> going<00:04:50.160> to<00:04:50.220> be<00:04:50.280> one<00:04:50.520> clear<00:04:50.910> smooth

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
there's going to be one clear smooth

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.939 
there's going to be one clear smooth
line<00:04:51.570> down<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:51.870> middle<00:04:51.900> and<00:04:52.349> it's<00:04:52.770> going<00:04:52.860> to

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
line down the middle and it's going to

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.379 
line down the middle and it's going to
be<00:04:53.009> a<00:04:53.039> lot<00:04:53.160> rougher<00:04:53.400> on<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:53.729> edge<00:04:53.849> now<00:04:54.300> if

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
be a lot rougher on the edge now if

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.390 
be a lot rougher on the edge now if
you're<00:04:54.509> strong<00:04:54.870> and<00:04:55.080> you're<00:04:55.710> bit<00:04:55.949> gridded

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
you're strong and you're bit gridded

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.129 
you're strong and you're bit gridded
badly<00:04:56.849> then<00:04:57.180> you<00:04:57.300> actually<00:04:57.449> might<00:04:57.750> make<00:04:57.780> up<00:04:58.050> a

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
badly then you actually might make up a

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.249 
badly then you actually might make up a
load<00:04:58.289> of<00:04:58.410> time<00:04:58.560> if<00:04:59.099> you<00:04:59.280> stuck<00:04:59.639> yourself<00:04:59.820> in

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:00.259 
load of time if you stuck yourself in

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.719 
load of time if you stuck yourself in
the<00:05:01.259> crappy<00:05:01.590> bit<00:05:01.740> on<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:01.949> edge<00:05:02.070> where<00:05:02.639> it's

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
the crappy bit on the edge where it's

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:04.430 
the crappy bit on the edge where it's
very<00:05:02.820> hard<00:05:03.120> to<00:05:03.300> pedal<00:05:03.509> but<00:05:04.020> there's<00:05:04.289> going<00:05:04.380> to

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
very hard to pedal but there's going to

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.710 
very hard to pedal but there's going to
be<00:05:04.500> less<00:05:04.710> riders<00:05:05.190> so<00:05:05.460> those<00:05:06.300> are<00:05:06.419> the<00:05:06.510> things

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
be less riders so those are the things

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.719 
be less riders so those are the things
to<00:05:06.780> think<00:05:07.050> about<00:05:07.340> when<00:05:08.340> you've<00:05:08.490> got<00:05:08.639> the

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
to think about when you've got the

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.399 
to think about when you've got the
choice<00:05:08.940> and<00:05:09.449> you've<00:05:09.630> been<00:05:09.780> called<00:05:10.080> up<00:05:10.199> to<00:05:10.320> the

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409 
choice and you've been called up to the

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:12.200 
choice and you've been called up to the
line<00:05:10.590> I<00:05:10.889> suppose<00:05:11.340> I<00:05:11.430> mean<00:05:11.520> the<00:05:11.610> parallels<00:05:12.030> for

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
line I suppose I mean the parallels for

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.939 
line I suppose I mean the parallels for
me<00:05:12.330> are<00:05:12.599> in<00:05:12.750> a<00:05:12.810> road<00:05:12.990> race<00:05:13.169> you<00:05:13.650> know<00:05:13.770> it's

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
me are in a road race you know it's

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.089 
me are in a road race you know it's
sometimes<00:05:14.720> you're<00:05:15.720> in<00:05:15.990> shelter<00:05:16.440> out<00:05:16.740> the<00:05:16.949> wind

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
sometimes you're in shelter out the wind

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:18.500 
sometimes you're in shelter out the wind
in<00:05:17.190> the<00:05:17.250> bunch<00:05:17.460> the<00:05:17.760> only<00:05:18.030> way<00:05:18.120> to<00:05:18.180> move<00:05:18.330> up

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
in the bunch the only way to move up

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:19.760 
in the bunch the only way to move up
especially<00:05:18.810> when<00:05:19.139> you're<00:05:19.260> moving<00:05:19.470> into<00:05:19.680> a

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
especially when you're moving into a

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.290 
especially when you're moving into a
crosswind<00:05:20.190> section<00:05:20.520> is<00:05:20.669> to<00:05:20.820> get<00:05:21.000> into<00:05:21.210> the

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
crosswind section is to get into the

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.270 
crosswind section is to get into the
wind<00:05:21.510> move<00:05:21.870> up<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.110> outside<00:05:22.229> and<00:05:22.590> get<00:05:22.680> in<00:05:22.710> so

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
wind move up the outside and get in so

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.710 
wind move up the outside and get in so
use<00:05:23.520> your<00:05:23.669> strength<00:05:23.940> to<00:05:24.000> advantage<00:05:24.510> when<00:05:24.659> you

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
use your strength to advantage when you

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.210 
use your strength to advantage when you
see<00:05:24.810> the<00:05:24.900> opportunity<00:05:25.349> absolutely<00:05:25.919> and<00:05:26.099> it

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
see the opportunity absolutely and it

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.529 
see the opportunity absolutely and it
when<00:05:26.639> everyone<00:05:26.940> is<00:05:27.030> bunched<00:05:27.300> up<00:05:27.360> in<00:05:27.479> a

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
when everyone is bunched up in a

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:28.969 
when everyone is bunched up in a
crossface<00:05:27.930> like<00:05:28.139> that<00:05:28.289> you<00:05:28.590> can<00:05:28.710> make<00:05:28.830> some

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
crossface like that you can make some

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.279 
crossface like that you can make some
big<00:05:29.190> gains<00:05:29.430> you<00:05:29.849> just<00:05:30.030> got<00:05:30.180> obviously<00:05:31.139> always

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
big gains you just got obviously always

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:32.870 
big gains you just got obviously always
factor<00:05:31.590> it<00:05:31.800> in<00:05:31.889> that<00:05:32.010> you<00:05:32.070> don't<00:05:32.250> go<00:05:32.370> so<00:05:32.580> far<00:05:32.760> as

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
factor it in that you don't go so far as

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.550 
factor it in that you don't go so far as
to<00:05:32.940> read<00:05:33.180> that<00:05:33.539> everyone<00:05:34.080> overtakes<00:05:34.409> you

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
to read that everyone overtakes you

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.070 
to read that everyone overtakes you
again<00:05:34.760> good<00:05:35.760> stuff<00:05:36.000> so<00:05:36.240> really<00:05:36.419> the<00:05:36.780> only<00:05:36.810> way

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
again good stuff so really the only way

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.260 
again good stuff so really the only way
to<00:05:37.139> practice<00:05:37.710> race<00:05:38.190> starts<00:05:38.639> properly<00:05:39.060> is<00:05:39.240> to

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
to practice race starts properly is to

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.230 
to practice race starts properly is to
go<00:05:39.570> when<00:05:39.780> race<00:05:40.020> but<00:05:40.560> a<00:05:40.800> really<00:05:41.520> good<00:05:41.699> drill<00:05:42.030> is

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
go when race but a really good drill is

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.390 
go when race but a really good drill is
to<00:05:42.270> do<00:05:42.479> standing<00:05:42.900> starts<00:05:43.380> so<00:05:43.800> just<00:05:44.190> like<00:05:44.310> we

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
to do standing starts so just like we

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.279 
to do standing starts so just like we
are<00:05:44.430> now

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
are now

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:48.230
