so<00:00:01.170> this<00:00:01.290> is<00:00:01.319> saber<00:00:01.709> mungkin<00:00:02.129> since<00:00:02.370> my<00:00:02.460> first

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
so this is saber mungkin since my first

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.300 
so this is saber mungkin since my first
gmod<00:00:03.210> video<00:00:03.510> this<00:00:03.959> is<00:00:04.140> just<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.500> response<00:00:05.040> to

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
gmod video this is just a response to

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.089 
gmod video this is just a response to
the<00:00:05.430> tutorial<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.450> turret<00:00:06.750> tutorial<00:00:07.290> by<00:00:07.649> clam

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
the tutorial the turret tutorial by clam

the tutorial the turret tutorial by clam
91<00:00:08.610> now<00:00:09.450> you<00:00:09.510> decide<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:10.080> turret<00:00:10.380> using<00:00:10.710> a

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
91 now you decide to turret using a

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.890 
91 now you decide to turret using a
vector<00:00:11.160> thrusters<00:00:11.639> it<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:11.880> very<00:00:12.240> accurate<00:00:12.480> and

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
vector thrusters it is very accurate and

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.530 
vector thrusters it is very accurate and
I<00:00:13.530> took<00:00:13.679> his<00:00:14.009> idea<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.400> made<00:00:15.059> one<00:00:15.240> on<00:00:15.360> my<00:00:15.509> own

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
I took his idea and made one on my own

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.650 
I took his idea and made one on my own
and<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:17.220> as<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.520> can<00:00:17.789> see<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.000> use<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.449> laser

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
and this as you can see it use the laser

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.480 
and this as you can see it use the laser
this<00:00:19.050> prediction<00:00:19.770> was<00:00:19.980> not<00:00:20.160> quite<00:00:20.369> as

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
this prediction was not quite as

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.609 
this prediction was not quite as
accurate<00:00:20.670> as<00:00:20.970> his<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.390> tends<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.080> overshoot

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
accurate as his it tends to overshoot

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.160 
accurate as his it tends to overshoot
just<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.949> little<00:00:23.189> bit<00:00:23.660> but<00:00:24.660> I'm<00:00:24.810> working<00:00:25.109> on

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
just a little bit but I'm working on

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.470 
just a little bit but I'm working on
that<00:00:25.230> part<00:00:25.529> but<00:00:25.880> what<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:26.910> did<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.180> was<00:00:27.359> a

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
that part but what I did that was a

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.599 
that part but what I did that was a
little<00:00:27.750> no<00:00:28.140> improvement<00:00:28.710> on<00:00:28.769> his<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.189> took<00:00:29.250> his

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
little no improvement on his I took his

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.299 
little no improvement on his I took his
a<00:00:29.640> vector<00:00:30.300> turret<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.900> made<00:00:31.890> one<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.160> those

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
a vector turret and made one of those

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.920 
a vector turret and made one of those
that<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.579> made<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.790> second<00:00:33.300> one<00:00:33.420> just<00:00:33.450> like<00:00:33.870> it

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
that I made a second one just like it

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.440 
that I made a second one just like it
accepted<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.680> put<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.920> turd<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.790> put<00:00:36.420> a

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
accepted so to put a turd on it I put a

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.119 
accepted so to put a turd on it I put a
thruster<00:00:36.930> on<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.170> other<00:00:37.290> end<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.770> added<00:00:38.070> a

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
thruster on the other end and added a

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.790 
thruster on the other end and added a
second<00:00:38.579> targeting<00:00:39.059> system<00:00:39.480> it'll<00:00:40.260> target<00:00:40.710> the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
second targeting system it'll target the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.470 
second targeting system it'll target the
player<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.670> can't<00:00:41.910> really<00:00:42.000> tell<00:00:42.239> here

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
player and you can't really tell here

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.970 
player and you can't really tell here
because<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:43.110> course<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.410> just<00:00:43.559> standing<00:00:43.770> on

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
because of course of just standing on

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.380 
because of course of just standing on
this<00:00:44.100> corner<00:00:44.160> with<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.640> thing<00:00:44.820> hovering<00:00:44.969> above

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
this corner with a thing hovering above

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.950 
this corner with a thing hovering above
me<00:00:45.629> but<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.530> run<00:00:46.829> around<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.250> level<00:00:47.960> this

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
me but if I run around the level this

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.560 
me but if I run around the level this
turret<00:00:49.350> uses<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> hoverball<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:51.000> float<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.510> a

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
turret uses a hoverball to float it a

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.410 
turret uses a hoverball to float it a
set<00:00:51.840> height<00:00:52.110> above<00:00:52.649> my<00:00:53.039> height<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:54.270> other

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
set height above my height and the other

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.619 
set height above my height and the other
thruster<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.260> chase<00:00:55.620> me<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.760> i<00:00:56.789> can<00:00:57.120> just<00:00:57.420> wanna

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
thruster to chase me so i can just wanna

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.689 
thruster to chase me so i can just wanna
run<00:00:57.840> anywhere<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.739> thing<00:00:58.949> will<00:00:59.190> chase

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
run anywhere and this thing will chase

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.479 
run anywhere and this thing will chase
me<00:00:59.730> in<00:01:00.920> vaporize<00:01:01.920> all<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.370> my<00:01:02.520> enemies<00:01:02.879> and

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
me in vaporize all of my enemies and

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.420 
me in vaporize all of my enemies and
then<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.700> moment<00:01:05.850> when<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.100> one<00:01:08.100> up<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.340> is

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
then in a moment when the one up and is

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.609 
then in a moment when the one up and is
showing<00:01:08.729> off<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.260> version<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.409> turret

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
showing off this version of the turret

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.100 
showing off this version of the turret
is<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> second<00:01:11.220> version<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.610> i<00:01:11.700> made<00:01:11.939> this<00:01:12.930> one

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
is a second version that i made this one

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.950 
is a second version that i made this one
that<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.320> see<00:01:13.530> right<00:01:13.560> there<00:01:14.540> turn<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.689> on<00:01:15.720> and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
that you see right there turn it on and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.800 
that you see right there turn it on and
then<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.259> lot<00:01:16.759> jump<00:01:17.759> up<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.060> fly<00:01:18.270> over<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.750> me

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
then in a lot jump up and fly over to me

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.390 
then in a lot jump up and fly over to me
and<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.380> actually<00:01:19.590> uses<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.549> laser<00:01:22.400> laser

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
and it actually uses the laser laser

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.969 
and it actually uses the laser laser
pointer<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.090> laser<00:01:24.270> pointer<00:01:24.479> receiver<00:01:25.020> to

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
pointer and a laser pointer receiver to

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.270 
pointer and a laser pointer receiver to
fire<00:01:26.430> where<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.180> laser<00:01:27.689> pointer<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.200> pointing

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
fire where the laser pointer is pointing

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.789 
fire where the laser pointer is pointing
and<00:01:29.280> i'm<00:01:29.939> going<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.210> jump<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.200> ahead<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.710> a

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
and i'm going to jump that ahead in a

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.200 
and i'm going to jump that ahead in a
second<00:01:32.159> here<00:01:32.340> something<00:01:32.670> like<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.850> wait<00:01:33.030> for

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
second here something like to wait for

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.340 
second here something like to wait for
it<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.329> fly<00:01:33.509> all<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> way<00:01:33.810> over<00:01:34.049> here<00:01:34.079> and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
it to fly all the way over here and

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.380 
it to fly all the way over here and
there<00:01:34.470> we<00:01:34.560> go<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:35.579> can<00:01:35.670> see<00:01:35.820> now<00:01:35.970> wherever<00:01:36.180> I

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
there we go you can see now wherever I

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.300 
there we go you can see now wherever I
point<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.960> laser<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:38.100> fires<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:40.310> hey

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
point that laser it fires and hey

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.679 
point that laser it fires and hey
there's<00:01:41.490> some<00:01:41.640> tutorials<00:01:42.119> out<00:01:42.210> there<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.540> show

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
there's some tutorials out there to show

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.109 
there's some tutorials out there to show
how<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.930> use<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.280> laser<00:01:44.280> pointer<00:01:44.729> receiver

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.520 

and<00:01:48.119> I'm<00:01:48.270> just<00:01:48.450> gonna<00:01:48.600> spawn<00:01:48.869> some<00:01:49.110> zombies

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
and I'm just gonna spawn some zombies

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.860 
and I'm just gonna spawn some zombies
and<00:01:49.680> show<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:50.009> off<00:01:50.220> here<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:51.119> then

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.320 
and show this off here and then
after<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.590> I'll<00:01:52.860> pull<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.670> thing<00:01:53.940> apart<00:01:54.060> a

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
after that I'll pull the thing apart a

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.790 
after that I'll pull the thing apart a
quick<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.750> show<00:01:54.900> you<00:01:54.960> on<00:01:55.080> the<00:01:55.170> inside<00:01:55.290> how<00:01:55.620> it

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
quick and show you on the inside how it

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.750 
quick and show you on the inside how it
looks<00:01:56.010> like<00:01:56.280> clam<00:01:56.850> naughty<00:01:57.180> ones<00:01:57.480> design

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.280 

sorry<00:02:02.760> for<00:02:02.910> the<00:02:02.940> poor<00:02:03.360> quality<00:02:03.390> video<00:02:04.020> on<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
sorry for the poor quality video on the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.780 
sorry for the poor quality video on the
weird<00:02:04.470> colors<00:02:04.830> I'm<00:02:05.010> not<00:02:05.130> quite<00:02:05.370> sure<00:02:05.400> what

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
weird colors I'm not quite sure what

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:15.700 
weird colors I'm not quite sure what
caused<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.150> to<00:02:06.390> heaven

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.590 

you<00:02:16.340> say<00:02:16.520> this<00:02:16.640> version<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.090> turd<00:02:17.300> is<00:02:17.420> a<00:02:17.450> lot

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
you say this version the turd is a lot

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.050 
you say this version the turd is a lot
more<00:02:17.750> accurate<00:02:18.230> but<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:19.010> also<00:02:19.700> it's<00:02:19.850> a<00:02:19.880> little

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
more accurate but and also it's a little

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.700 
more accurate but and also it's a little
harder<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.300> use<00:02:20.510> because<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:20.900> have<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.260> you're

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
harder to use because you have to you're

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.700 
harder to use because you have to you're
aiming<00:02:22.130> for<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:22.580> but<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:24.230> tends<00:02:24.500> not<00:02:24.590> to

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
aiming for it but it tends not to

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:56.200 
aiming for it but it tends not to
overshoot<00:02:25.280> as<00:02:25.460> far

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.820 

and<00:02:56.870> now<00:02:57.020> I'm<00:02:57.140> going<00:02:57.290> to<00:02:57.380> pull<00:02:57.530> it<00:02:57.560> down<00:02:57.800> and

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
and now I'm going to pull it down and

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.370 
and now I'm going to pull it down and
pull<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.790> turret<00:02:59.360> pieces<00:02:59.660> out<00:02:59.750> of<00:02:59.810> it<00:03:00.020> you<00:03:00.170> so

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
pull the turret pieces out of it you so

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.590 
pull the turret pieces out of it you so
you<00:03:00.500> can<00:03:00.620> see<00:03:00.860> where<00:03:01.070> i<00:03:01.100> use<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.970> same<00:03:02.240> design

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
you can see where i use the same design

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.300 
you can see where i use the same design
to<00:03:02.840> attach<00:03:03.110> a<00:03:03.290> thruster<00:03:03.710> to<00:03:03.890> instead<00:03:04.220> of

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
to attach a thruster to instead of

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:14.020 
to attach a thruster to instead of
another<00:03:04.460> target

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.640 

this<00:03:14.510> may<00:03:14.690> be<00:03:14.720> kind<00:03:14.990> of<00:03:15.080> tell<00:03:15.410> in<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.620> end

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
this may be kind of tell in the end

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.140 
this may be kind of tell in the end
zombie<00:03:16.069> you<00:03:16.160> can<00:03:16.280> see<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.520> hoverball<00:03:16.910> there

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
zombie you can see the hoverball there

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.030 
zombie you can see the hoverball there
it's<00:03:17.720> kind<00:03:17.900> of<00:03:17.930> hard<00:03:18.140> with<00:03:18.260> it<00:03:18.350> all<00:03:18.470> being<00:03:18.950> the

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
it's kind of hard with it all being the

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.220 
it's kind of hard with it all being the
same<00:03:19.190> color<00:03:22.330> here<00:03:23.330> you<00:03:23.420> can<00:03:23.540> see<00:03:23.810> that's<00:03:24.080> the

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
same color here you can see that's the

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.500 
same color here you can see that's the
thruster<00:03:24.709> size<00:03:24.950> jeans<00:03:25.459> looks<00:03:25.819> just<00:03:26.030> like<00:03:26.240> clam

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
thruster size jeans looks just like clam

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.530 
thruster size jeans looks just like clam
90<00:03:26.840> once<00:03:27.080> turret<00:03:27.680> with<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.790> vector<00:03:29.090> thrusters

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
90 once turret with the vector thrusters

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.090 
90 once turret with the vector thrusters
if<00:03:29.810> he's<00:03:29.930> got<00:03:30.020> a<00:03:30.080> thruster<00:03:30.500> on<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.920> end

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
if he's got a thruster on the end

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.620 
if he's got a thruster on the end
opposite<00:03:31.580> of<00:03:31.730> what<00:03:31.880> you<00:03:31.970> would<00:03:32.120> normally<00:03:32.270> put

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
opposite of what you would normally put

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.350 
opposite of what you would normally put
the<00:03:32.810> turret<00:03:33.110> or<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.290> laser<00:03:33.500> on<00:03:34.120> and<00:03:35.120> here's<00:03:35.300> a

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
the turret or the laser on and here's a

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.750 
the turret or the laser on and here's a
laser<00:03:35.600> piece<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.110> fixing<00:03:36.200> to<00:03:36.410> pull<00:03:36.590> out<00:03:36.770> and<00:03:37.040> I

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
laser piece and fixing to pull out and I

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.900 
laser piece and fixing to pull out and I
don't<00:03:37.970> think<00:03:38.150> you<00:03:38.360> can<00:03:38.480> see<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:38.989> but<00:03:39.910> yeah

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
don't think you can see it but yeah

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.850 
don't think you can see it but yeah
there<00:03:41.180> are<00:03:41.360> multiple<00:03:41.810> beacon<00:03:42.200> sensors<00:03:42.620> one

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
there are multiple beacon sensors one

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.350 
there are multiple beacon sensors one
for<00:03:43.069> each<00:03:43.160> of<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.400> targeting<00:03:43.880> system<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.330> the

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
for each of the targeting system to the

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.199 
for each of the targeting system to the
end<00:03:44.510> there<00:03:44.750> is<00:03:44.780> an<00:03:45.350> expression<00:03:45.800> gate<00:03:46.190> that<00:03:47.180> I

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
end there is an expression gate that I

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.820 
end there is an expression gate that I
use<00:03:47.480> to<00:03:47.510> control<00:03:47.870> everything<00:03:48.260> I<00:03:48.500> juice<00:03:48.680> and

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
use to control everything I juice and

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.470 
use to control everything I juice and
instead<00:03:49.130> of<00:03:49.160> out<00:03:49.340> there<00:03:49.370> you<00:03:49.730> can<00:03:49.850> see<00:03:49.880> the<00:03:50.030> tip

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
instead of out there you can see the tip

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.880 
instead of out there you can see the tip
of<00:03:50.510> it<00:03:50.690> there<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:51.050> instead<00:03:51.260> of<00:03:51.350> using<00:03:51.560> the

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
of it there and instead of using the

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.880 
of it there and instead of using the
multiple<00:03:52.160> gates<00:03:52.610> like<00:03:53.090> a<00:03:53.150> clam<00:03:53.660> did<00:03:53.959> I<00:03:54.200> just

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
multiple gates like a clam did I just

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.670 
multiple gates like a clam did I just
set<00:03:55.130> it<00:03:55.160> up<00:03:55.400> with<00:03:55.670> a<00:03:56.200> single<00:03:57.200> custom

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
set it up with a single custom

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.280 
set it up with a single custom
expression<00:03:58.190> gate<00:03:58.370> to<00:03:58.489> did<00:03:58.640> everything<00:03:59.290> so

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
expression gate to did everything so

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.259 
expression gate to did everything so
thanks<00:04:00.620> for<00:04:00.769> watching<00:04:01.130> a<00:04:01.250> clam<00:04:01.640> thank<00:04:01.940> you<00:04:02.060> for

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
thanks for watching a clam thank you for

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.040 
thanks for watching a clam thank you for
that<00:04:02.360> awesome<00:04:02.510> tower<00:04:02.930> design<00:04:03.319> and<00:04:04.660> i'll<00:04:05.660> see

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
that awesome tower design and i'll see

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.269 
that awesome tower design and i'll see
if<00:04:06.140> i<00:04:06.260> can<00:04:06.470> improve<00:04:07.370> they'll<00:04:07.790> miss<00:04:07.940> more
