 I have a nice suggestion suggestion 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.170
 but not out for an opinion about it 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.880
 homosexuality 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.649
 I myself have known that for a while 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.739
 I on the same and the opposite sex 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.890

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.780
 their opinions should be so if you like that 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.930
 or if you would like to do that 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.670
 then add some cool videos 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.550

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.079
 respect in hours that you have such a thing 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.480
 reveals because some people are there 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.399
 a little scared of to say one 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.789
 come out of the closet 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.070

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.659
 waste homosexuality the yellow let me 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.820
 ff explain the concept of 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.500
 homosexuality 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.630
 you have gays, they are two men 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.729
 fall on each other and you have this lesbian 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.950
 are two women who fall apart 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.450
 ok but that is both covered 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.119
 homosexuality 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.060
 so technically that is the same 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.100
 so if I present you the concept of 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.840
 he pushed his two women around 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.409
 corner are kissing with each other 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.670
 are you especially here high five yes lk eh 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.250
 Everything good 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.990
 okay times I say the same and yours 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.530
 two men are around the corner and go-to 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.659
 kissing 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.250
 and then you say wow what we but 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.700
 why do they do that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.100
 yeah so stupid i think it's so stupid 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.970
 that in the end it comes to the same 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.890
 down 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.759
 same sex as each other but 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.680
 in the end it will be that way 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.509
 looking down, though there are two 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.189
 men together and there will be 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.969
 actually the most serious problems 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.830
 made over in various 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.800
 religion is the way that you 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.250
 actually just punished for it if 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.530
 are you gay 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.630
 it just doesn't get into the society and 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.820
 in the religion or in some religions 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.320
 it is not accepted and I ask 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.690
 wonder why 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.180
 it's not a disease it's a choice already 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.690
 you fall on men the tips men waste 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.400
 you women you fall on women 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.490
 same sex concept and 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.000
 so there is in I do not quite understand 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.490
 why the bad is looked at because 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.290
 desk itself I used to look bad smoke 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.750
 to the and I walked with the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.920
 my friend I walked on 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.290
 I don't know what the park is like anymore 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.660
 but a park in Amsterdam 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.880
 and then I was checked by one 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.410
 number of gay men 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.930
 I got a little bit out of it 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.490
 from the back of frankly but that 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.410
 was really years back and now I am 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.310
 actually I grew up as a person 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.470
 from 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.910
 and blame me as the winner 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.120
 looking at that is actually just one 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.400
 compliment technically from one 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.980
 women fall on me and men fall on me 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.430
 fall in a high five to myself 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.930
 fucking home abs 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.810
 yes i am not a gay person 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.140
 so in the end I'm not going anything 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.350
 but you never do that in a way 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.790
 is it a compliment address yes i am 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.269
 here myself I'm not quite right 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.790
 I have to spend a month there or whatever I do with that 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.590
 offer but I just accepted it 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.790
 you already know you are a gay man 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.940
 or wife 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.830
 whatever I happen to have 3 homosexual 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.450
 guys in my current class are from 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.239
 my training 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.070
 when do you know i just deal with them 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.459
 just like me dealing with other people 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.320
 just respectfully acceptable why would 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.440
 I look down at them that is 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.050
 just it makes no sense 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.010
 and you fall as simple as it can be 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.320
 thanks for looking 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.090
 thanks resources for the gameplay you have 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.100
 another suggestion for me for my 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.620
 opinion about later than in the back 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.120
 the reactions and then I see you 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.709
 next time for your fun again 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.709
