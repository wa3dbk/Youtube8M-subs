since<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.550> my<00:00:29.670> experiences<00:00:30.330> I've<00:00:30.480> used<00:00:30.689> a

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
since in my experiences I've used a

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.930 
since in my experiences I've used a
dozen<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.650> these<00:00:31.769> battery<00:00:32.130> chargers<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.850> as

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
dozen of these battery chargers and as

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.530 
dozen of these battery chargers and as
far<00:00:33.210> as<00:00:33.410> charging<00:00:34.410> they're<00:00:35.130> all<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.340> same<00:00:35.540> but

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
far as charging they're all the same but

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.270 
far as charging they're all the same but
I<00:00:36.570> put<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.050> test<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.710> charge<00:00:38.040> two

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
I put it to the test I charge two

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.729 
I put it to the test I charge two
devices<00:00:38.309> both<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.540> have<00:00:39.719> 2300<00:00:40.200> milliamp

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
devices both that have 2300 milliamp

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.340 
devices both that have 2300 milliamp
batteries<00:00:41.190> from<00:00:41.850> zero<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.420> hundred<00:00:42.540> they

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
batteries from zero to a hundred they

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.440 
batteries from zero to a hundred they
consumed<00:00:43.770> about<00:00:43.920> 5,000<00:00:44.789> milliamps<00:00:45.270> now<00:00:45.420> I

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
consumed about 5,000 milliamps now I

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.910 
consumed about 5,000 milliamps now I
would<00:00:45.660> expect<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.260> drop<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.680> device

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
would expect this to drop the device

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.459 
would expect this to drop the device
down<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.340> at<00:00:47.460> least<00:00:47.579> one<00:00:47.850> bar<00:00:48.149> but<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.230> did<00:00:49.350> not

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
down to at least one bar but it did not

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.260 
down to at least one bar but it did not
I<00:00:49.770> was<00:00:49.920> able<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.190> go<00:00:50.399> ahead<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.879> charge<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
I was able to go ahead and charge the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.689 
I was able to go ahead and charge the
devices<00:00:51.780> about<00:00:52.050> fifty<00:00:52.410> percent<00:00:52.440> again<00:00:53.070> now

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
devices about fifty percent again now

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.610 
devices about fifty percent again now
remember<00:00:53.969> that's<00:00:54.690> one<00:00:54.899> hundred<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.289> fifty

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
remember that's one hundred and fifty

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.860 
remember that's one hundred and fifty
percent<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.280> then<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.760> bar<00:00:57.000> finally<00:00:57.539> dropped

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
percent and then the bar finally dropped

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.510 
percent and then the bar finally dropped
which<00:00:58.260> for<00:00:58.500> me<00:00:58.680> didn't<00:00:59.100> really<00:00:59.309> make<00:00:59.460> sense

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
which for me didn't really make sense

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.880 
which for me didn't really make sense
since<00:01:00.120> I've<00:01:00.449> reviewed<00:01:00.960> these<00:01:01.469> devices

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
since I've reviewed these devices

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.950 
since I've reviewed these devices
several<00:01:02.399> times<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.239> after<00:01:03.300> speaking<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.809> will

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
several times so after speaking of will

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.420 
several times so after speaking of will
be<00:01:04.080> about<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.619> they<00:01:04.769> stated<00:01:05.010> they're<00:01:05.189> using

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
be about this they stated they're using

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.890 
be about this they stated they're using
high-quality<00:01:05.640> batteries<00:01:06.510> instead<00:01:06.750> of

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
high-quality batteries instead of

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.179 
high-quality batteries instead of
run-of-the-mill<00:01:07.080> batteries<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.979> other

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
run-of-the-mill batteries that other

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.429 
run-of-the-mill batteries that other
companies<00:01:08.460> use<00:01:08.909> now<00:01:09.750> it's<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.990> great<00:01:10.170> looking

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
companies use now it's a great looking

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.080 
companies use now it's a great looking
device<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.979> metal<00:01:11.220> case<00:01:11.430> makes<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.880> look

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
device the metal case makes it look

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.179 
device the metal case makes it look
premium<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.260> ports<00:01:13.530> are<00:01:13.590> clearly<00:01:13.860> marked

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
premium and the ports are clearly marked

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.890 
premium and the ports are clearly marked
but<00:01:14.610> they're<00:01:14.820> hidden<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.270> bottom<00:01:15.659> side

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
but they're hidden on the bottom side

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.690 
but they're hidden on the bottom side
which<00:01:16.439> helps<00:01:16.799> with<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.040> clean<00:01:17.310> appearance

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
which helps with this clean appearance

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.390 
which helps with this clean appearance
it's<00:01:18.600> also<00:01:18.780> very<00:01:19.049> thin<00:01:19.470> which<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.890> nice<00:01:20.100> it

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
it's also very thin which is nice it

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.969 
it's also very thin which is nice it
makes<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.670> easy<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.970> slide<00:01:21.330> into<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.630> bag<00:01:21.950> now<00:01:22.950> a

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
makes it easy to slide into a bag now a

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.499 
makes it easy to slide into a bag now a
few<00:01:23.280> things<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.610> did<00:01:23.790> not<00:01:23.970> like<00:01:24.180> about<00:01:24.210> it

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
few things that I did not like about it

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.480 
few things that I did not like about it
I<00:01:24.780> think<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.500> bit<00:01:25.710> too<00:01:25.740> long<00:01:26.159> i<00:01:26.189> had<00:01:26.460> a

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
I think it's a bit too long i had a

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.969 
I think it's a bit too long i had a
tough<00:01:26.820> time<00:01:26.850> fitting<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.659> pocket<00:01:27.930> i'm<00:01:28.770> also

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
tough time fitting in a pocket i'm also

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.950 
tough time fitting in a pocket i'm also
not<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.220> fan<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.549> glossy<00:01:30.180> plastic<00:01:30.360> they<00:01:30.840> get

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
not a fan of glossy plastic they get

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.270 
not a fan of glossy plastic they get
slippery<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.560> finger<00:01:31.829> prints<00:01:32.100> show<00:01:32.250> up

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
slippery and finger prints show up

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.640 
slippery and finger prints show up
easily<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:33.270> power<00:01:33.479> button<00:01:33.689> also<00:01:33.990> rattles<00:01:34.560> a

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
easily the power button also rattles a

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.590 
easily the power button also rattles a
bit<00:01:34.799> I'm<00:01:34.979> just<00:01:35.250> worried<00:01:35.640> i<00:01:35.759> may<00:01:36.030> press<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.479> in

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
bit I'm just worried i may press it in

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.480 
bit I'm just worried i may press it in
all<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.930> way<00:01:37.140> one<00:01:37.500> day<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:37.950> gets<00:01:38.040> stuck<00:01:38.310> in

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
all the way one day and it gets stuck in

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.700 
all the way one day and it gets stuck in
there<00:01:38.670> but<00:01:39.299> i<00:01:39.329> really<00:01:39.600> can't<00:01:39.780> say<00:01:39.960> for<00:01:40.020> sure<00:01:40.200> if

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710
