00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.240 
at a very
this<00:00:12.360> morning

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.330 

and<00:00:15.340> here<00:00:15.520> it<00:00:15.610> in<00:00:15.700> the<00:00:15.790> background<00:00:20.340> they've

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
and here it in the background they've

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.500 
and here it in the background they've
got<00:00:21.610> a<00:00:21.640> bulldozer<00:00:22.210> in<00:00:22.660> here<00:00:22.869> doing<00:00:23.110> something

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
got a bulldozer in here doing something

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.800 
got a bulldozer in here doing something
so<00:00:25.510> I<00:00:26.730> don't<00:00:27.730> know<00:00:27.910> if<00:00:27.939> they're<00:00:28.180> smoothing<00:00:28.689> out

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
so I don't know if they're smoothing out

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.900 
so I don't know if they're smoothing out
the<00:00:29.020> road<00:00:29.230> for<00:00:29.529> more<00:00:29.800> millions<00:00:30.310> of<00:00:30.460> people<00:00:30.790> to

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
the road for more millions of people to

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.600 
the road for more millions of people to
Commander<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:33.430> what<00:00:35.070> that's<00:00:36.070> the<00:00:36.250> air<00:00:36.460> and

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
Commander just what that's the air and

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.750 
Commander just what that's the air and
sea<00:00:36.820> and<00:00:37.379> then<00:00:38.379> this<00:00:38.590> happens<00:00:39.160> this<00:00:39.370> isn't

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
sea and then this happens this isn't

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.320 
sea and then this happens this isn't
very<00:00:40.000> conducive<00:00:40.390> to<00:00:40.809> do<00:00:40.989> one<00:00:42.330> Bigfoot

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
very conducive to do one Bigfoot

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.590 
very conducive to do one Bigfoot
research<00:00:44.080> but<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.860> big<00:00:48.160> pull<00:00:48.940> those<00:00:49.180> are<00:00:49.390> down

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
research but the big pull those are down

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.569 
research but the big pull those are down
there<00:00:49.899> and<00:00:50.200> the<00:00:50.320> half<00:00:50.559> dozen<00:00:50.860> trucks<00:00:51.340> that

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
there and the half dozen trucks that

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.490 
there and the half dozen trucks that
came<00:00:51.850> through<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:54.600> i'm<00:00:55.600> thinking<00:00:55.660> i<00:00:56.170> may<00:00:56.350> have

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
came through so i'm thinking i may have

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.880 
came through so i'm thinking i may have
to<00:00:56.710> pack<00:00:56.890> it<00:00:57.070> up<00:00:57.190> leave<00:00:58.500> they're<00:00:59.500> working

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
to pack it up leave they're working

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.150 
to pack it up leave they're working
their<00:01:00.039> way<00:01:00.070> this<00:01:00.460> way<00:01:01.739> well<00:01:02.739> it<00:01:02.920> certainly

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
their way this way well it certainly

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.480 
their way this way well it certainly
appears<00:01:03.850> that<00:01:03.969> they<00:01:05.160> mean<00:01:06.160> to<00:01:06.190> grade<00:01:06.759> the<00:01:06.970> road

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
appears that they mean to grade the road

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.410 
appears that they mean to grade the road
and<00:01:09.490> I<00:01:09.610> know<00:01:09.670> if<00:01:09.970> they're<00:01:10.149> going<00:01:10.300> to<00:01:10.390> grade<00:01:10.840> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
and I know if they're going to grade the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.070 
and I know if they're going to grade the
campsites<00:01:13.420> or<00:01:13.630> not<00:01:13.810> but<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:16.420> can<00:01:16.570> do<00:01:16.690> that<00:01:16.869> big

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
campsites or not but you can do that big

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.490 
campsites or not but you can do that big
old<00:01:17.259> cat<00:01:17.530> down<00:01:17.770> there<00:01:18.220> working<00:01:19.080> some<00:01:20.080> time<00:01:20.320> to

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
old cat down there working some time to

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.760 
old cat down there working some time to
sign<00:01:20.770> my<00:01:21.189> see<00:01:21.520> big<00:01:21.729> trees<00:01:22.119> tops<00:01:22.869> moving<00:01:23.560> where

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
sign my see big trees tops moving where

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.370 
sign my see big trees tops moving where
they<00:01:23.950> pushing<00:01:24.400> over<00:01:24.700> trees<00:01:24.970> and<00:01:25.210> stuffs<00:01:25.479> all

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.590 

crap<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.700> it<00:01:30.790> looks<00:01:31.000> like<00:01:31.180> I'm<00:01:31.360> going<00:01:31.479> to<00:01:31.540> have

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
crap and it looks like I'm going to have

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:41.529 
crap and it looks like I'm going to have
to<00:01:31.720> move

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:02:14.650 

what<00:01:42.539> I<00:01:42.569> woke<00:01:42.840> up<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.409> morning

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:23.530 

looks<00:02:15.020> like<00:02:15.230> that<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.560> Forest<00:02:16.010> Service<00:02:16.430> thing

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:31.990 

I<00:02:28.870> decided<00:02:29.870> since<00:02:30.379> the<00:02:31.010> Forest<00:02:31.400> Service<00:02:31.760> was

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
I decided since the Forest Service was

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.970 
I decided since the Forest Service was
going<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.480> be<00:02:32.629> in<00:02:32.719> the<00:02:32.840> area<00:02:33.049> making<00:02:33.500> all<00:02:33.769> this

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
going to be in the area making all this

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.369 
going to be in the area making all this
noise<00:02:34.040> and<00:02:34.670> disrupting<00:02:35.329> the<00:02:35.450> forest<00:02:35.930> that<00:02:36.200> I

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
noise and disrupting the forest that I

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.970 
noise and disrupting the forest that I
would<00:02:36.760> go<00:02:37.760> ahead<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.269> leave<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.989> go<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.200> the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
would go ahead and leave and go to the

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.280 
would go ahead and leave and go to the
farther<00:02:40.640> end<00:02:40.760> of<00:02:41.390> my<00:02:41.720> research<00:02:42.379> area<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:44.290> see

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
farther end of my research area and see

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.319 
farther end of my research area and see
what<00:02:45.590> else<00:02:45.769> I<00:02:46.010> could<00:02:46.069> see<00:02:46.489> see<00:02:47.000> if<00:02:47.090> there<00:02:47.299> is

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
what else I could see see if there is

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:52.569 
what else I could see see if there is
any<00:02:47.689> activity<00:02:48.379> of<00:02:48.530> over<00:02:48.980> there<00:02:49.510> this<00:02:50.510> is<00:02:51.579> about

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
any activity of over there this is about

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.470 
any activity of over there this is about
as<00:02:52.819> wild<00:02:53.090> as<00:02:53.450> I<00:02:53.599> cut<00:02:53.900> today<00:02:54.639> when<00:02:55.639> two<00:02:55.849> cows<00:02:56.090> in
