00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
demonstration we're going to show that

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.450 
demonstration we're going to show that
simply<00:00:45.750> by<00:00:45.899> plugging<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.010> connecting<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
simply by plugging in and connecting the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.340 
simply by plugging in and connecting the
power<00:00:47.610> cords<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.719> I'm<00:00:48.809> doing<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.200> from

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
power cords and I'm doing this from

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.990 
power cords and I'm doing this from
scratch<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.250> show<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.820> there's

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
scratch just to show you that there's

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.270 
scratch just to show you that there's
nothing<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:52.079> know<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.379> took<00:00:52.559> 30<00:00:52.829> minutes<00:00:52.920> to

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
nothing you know the took 30 minutes to

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.790 
nothing you know the took 30 minutes to
do<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.550> advance<00:00:53.930> what<00:00:54.930> you'd<00:00:55.050> understand<00:00:55.530> it's

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
do in advance what you'd understand it's

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.750 
do in advance what you'd understand it's
really<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> very<00:00:56.190> quick<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.059> simple<00:00:57.350> process

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
really a very quick and simple process

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.520 
really a very quick and simple process
if<00:00:59.760> you're<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.390> me<00:01:00.600> your<00:01:00.780> teenagers<00:01:01.289> will

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
if you're like me your teenagers will

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.280 
if you're like me your teenagers will
probably<00:01:01.920> do<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.070> more<00:01:02.309> quickly<00:01:02.520> then<00:01:03.420> most<00:01:04.170> of

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
probably do it more quickly then most of

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:18.020 
probably do it more quickly then most of
us<00:01:04.409> adults<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:15.590> we<00:01:16.590> have<00:01:16.799> power<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.880> main

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
us adults but we have power to the main

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.730 
us adults but we have power to the main
unit<00:01:19.549> this<00:01:20.549> unit<00:01:20.850> also<00:01:20.970> shifts<00:01:21.740> quite

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
unit this unit also shifts quite

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.990 
unit this unit also shifts quite
uniquely<00:01:23.189> with<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.400> wireless<00:01:24.240> subwoofer<00:01:24.600> that

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
uniquely with a wireless subwoofer that

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.580 
uniquely with a wireless subwoofer that
again<00:01:27.000> only<00:01:27.450> requires<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.049> connection<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.560> a

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
again only requires the connection of a

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:36.350 
again only requires the connection of a
power<00:01:28.860> cord<00:01:30.229> here<00:01:31.229> briefly<00:01:34.400> and<00:01:35.400> basically

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
power cord here briefly and basically

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.950 
power cord here briefly and basically
we're<00:01:36.600> ready<00:01:36.780> for<00:01:37.430> turning<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.520> unit<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.960> and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960
