00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
way of getting through this would be to

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.300 
way of getting through this would be to
start<00:03:32.200> bringing<00:03:32.350> in<00:03:32.560> more<00:03:32.650> technical<00:03:32.860> side<00:03:33.250> of

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
start bringing in more technical side of

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.040 
start bringing in more technical side of
things<00:03:33.580> could<00:03:33.760> because<00:03:34.030> no<00:03:34.210> one<00:03:34.360> can<00:03:34.510> really

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
things could because no one can really

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.290 
things could because no one can really
yeah<00:03:35.680> well<00:03:35.920> people<00:03:36.340> we<00:03:36.460> can<00:03:36.580> do<00:03:36.730> it<00:03:36.850> but<00:03:37.060> you

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
yeah well people we can do it but you

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.240 
yeah well people we can do it but you
know<00:03:37.450> it's<00:03:37.570> hard<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:38.170> those<00:03:38.620> guys<00:03:38.860> don't<00:03:39.100> know

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
know it's hard and those guys don't know

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.280 
know it's hard and those guys don't know
you<00:03:39.310> have<00:03:39.520> trouble<00:03:39.700> keeping<00:03:39.910> up<00:03:40.150> with<00:03:40.240> it<00:03:40.420> so<00:03:40.960> I

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
you have trouble keeping up with it so I

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.170 
you have trouble keeping up with it so I
figured<00:03:41.440> that<00:03:41.950> would<00:03:42.040> be<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.310> one<00:03:42.460> and<00:03:42.640> I<00:03:42.790> did

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
figured that would be the one and I did

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.960 
figured that would be the one and I did
a<00:03:43.210> 360<00:03:43.480> -<00:03:44.470> sir<00:03:44.650> why<00:03:45.070> don't<00:03:45.130> you<00:03:45.250> whipped<00:03:45.490> out<00:03:45.700> to

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
a 360 - sir why don't you whipped out to

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.940 
a 360 - sir why don't you whipped out to
180<00:03:46.300> down<00:03:46.510> so<00:03:46.660> with<00:03:46.840> being<00:03:47.050> opposite<00:03:47.410> and<00:03:47.830> I

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
180 down so with being opposite and I

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.650 
180 down so with being opposite and I
thought<00:03:48.130> that<00:03:48.670> was<00:03:48.820> quite<00:03:48.970> a<00:03:49.030> banger<00:03:49.420> and<00:03:49.540> then

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
thought that was quite a banger and then

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.360 
thought that was quite a banger and then
after<00:03:49.930> that<00:03:50.020> I<00:03:50.080> thought<00:03:50.350> maybe<00:03:50.890> this<00:03:51.100> is<00:03:51.250> like

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
after that I thought maybe this is like

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.250 
after that I thought maybe this is like
last<00:03:51.610> year<00:03:51.820> maybe<00:03:52.030> I<00:03:52.180> only<00:03:52.540> need<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:52.810> big<00:03:53.050> trick

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
last year maybe I only need a big trick

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.010 
last year maybe I only need a big trick
that<00:03:53.380> finishes<00:03:53.740> off<00:03:53.890> and<00:03:54.630> that's<00:03:55.630> what<00:03:55.780> I<00:03:55.810> did

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
that finishes off and that's what I did

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.960 
that finishes off and that's what I did
and<00:03:56.290> we're<00:03:56.680> waiting<00:03:56.830> see<00:03:57.070> the<00:03:57.190> result<00:03:57.520> I<00:03:57.670> don't

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
and we're waiting see the result I don't

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.060 
and we're waiting see the result I don't
expect<00:03:58.300> to<00:03:58.390> come<00:03:58.630> first<00:03:59.110> in<00:03:59.290> this<00:03:59.410> contest<00:03:59.830> but
