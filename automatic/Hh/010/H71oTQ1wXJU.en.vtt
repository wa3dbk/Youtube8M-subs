00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.110
 Haye is neither the blockhouse ever again 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.990
 the five minutes 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.150
 yes you have noticed it all I wanted 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.760
 a cover version of rage against the 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.290
 upload machine and while the track there 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.329
 there will be another one soon 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.820
 Of course I wanted to do that too 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:25.500
 and I will do that too yes and you 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.970
 many have seen that as I had 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.619
 recently the topic 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.640
 copyright and coversongs and such 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.960
 further developed so and now so me 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.470
 did not count that, but 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.480
 As I said, I use it when it is 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.890
 I like to use our body 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.300
 Of course, just stop knows less 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.500
 work for me is because with me it works 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.480
 I'm just interested in the guitar 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.980
 not that I'm 38 now 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.560
 Instruments game and a chamber number 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.320
 but I have just stop me 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.970
 always use pekings from guitar backing 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.460
 check.com has since downloaded me 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.780
 and at some point I have the song as 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.490
 so becking without a guitar 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.680
 and then I just have a cover 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.509
 video of it where of course I did that 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.790
 make video myself and where I of course 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.380
 also play the guitar yourself and now 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.079
 But it is always like that when you do that 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.170
 is doing relatively well when uploading 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:18.420
 this file is youtube able 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.130
 by one I call it all then always 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.299
 moved algorithm if it is now 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.219
 right word for it I know 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.069
 not in any case there is software 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:29.639
 Recognition which then recognizes okay that is 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:32.600
 this and janis and then goes as well 

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:37.350
 a copyright law procedure in transition 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:40.920
 funnily, but you have to say that 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.539
 this video again like me too 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.979
 quite often stressed only in 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.590
 Germany is locked 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.600
 that means that's a bit 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.189
 Opinion of youtube I had to 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.450
 Now that's life then that is 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.579
 my work at least on this 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.859
 platform just a bit for the 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.600
 nuts but not as bad as 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:58.950
 then i have my god at two hours 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.459
 free guitar with the 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.490
 camera 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:04.529
 then that's all other people 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.880
 outside germany in switzerland 

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:09.090
 I greet you here again and 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.860
 Austria can do that, of course 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.030
 unconditionally you can see there 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.709
 see ok why 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.020
 with the copyrights why should that 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.709
 now that different so it is somehow so 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.870
 a little bit 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.090
 it's from the publishers or whatever 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.010
 always a bit of opinion 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.400
 it's a bit weird that's it 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.410
 is 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.620
 Well, well, that's just it 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.080
 such and such things will be in 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.180
 The countries simply blocked but not 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.940
 because I made a cover video 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.300
 but that locked away because of this 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.640
 Software covers I would have the original 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.620
 piece in video and as an audio file 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.820
 uploaded 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.739
 because of course I am relative too 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.350
 authentic games have these 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.390
 software that too is not that 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.010
 is recognized as formcheck what also up 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.320
 to the point, yes, everything is okay and 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.090
 then there's our copyright 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.650
 claim or whatever that means yes 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.480
 I have to live with that, but that's just it 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.690
 just in germany the case is so 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.130
 it alone so again to the topic 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:10.890
 copyrights again the expiration at 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.140
 youtube just because it is so must 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.730
 not happen with every song gives 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.650
 just keep publishing or whatever 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.320
 youtube a lot goes through the grid 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.079
 by some it does not know that 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.610
 before always not and as I said 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.260
 yes have a concern while I do 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.540
 these cover videos I did not say yes 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.940
 high because I want to enrich it 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.769
 I do not invite her a little there with her 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.329
 not out of out of copyright form 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.160
 So yes I will create copies 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.070
 but for me is always only 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.350
 from the principle are the 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.359
 viewpoint for that let me 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.040
 somehow on the internet then somehow 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.320
 after that would like to do afterwards 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.410
 In the end, I use that only as 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.720
 trittbrett to bring the people closer 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.630
 So basically only advertising for 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.220
 the vegetarian now with me 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.220
 Well , that's okay
