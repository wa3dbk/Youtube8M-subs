00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.780
 hello today I want to show you 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.850
 bottle from the bug that I bought 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.139
 quite spontaneously something very me 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.780
 I wanted to buy one 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.180
 a bottle with a picture in general, she told me 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.820
 just quite like it cost 17 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.240
 USD lucky bear an inscription 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.660
 ndfl and here are liberty and 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.550
 accordingly also made in d issey in 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.260
 Generally there are all such inscriptions as I 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.660
 somehow I just liked her 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.460
 spontaneously took and bought well, I think 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.129
 use periodically take with you 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.870
 as such a bottle with good 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.210
 clean water where in general you need and 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.530
 have a drink somewhere go for a walk 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.570
 maybe something else is opening 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.909
 closes like this with one hand 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.260
 pretty comfortable comfortable it is specially 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:53.870
 Made to bottle 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.429
 it was hung on a backpack there on a belt 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.350
 for something for additionally secure 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:59.659
 like fixing itself one hand 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.460
 opening the bottle can not tilt not 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.050
 turn over to drink just drink 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.360
 from here here respectively there is a valve 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.700
 here this part and so I will sort it out 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.829
 still here correspond from here we drink 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.590
 here she is this part here so she 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:13.750
 looks made quite qualitatively it 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.140
 so rubberized 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.659
 the structure is everything to me in principle especially such 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.070
 here are some niggles there is nothing water 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.930
 misses the rays on what is not 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.670
 wound up opens quickly why 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.920
 you can drink without turning because 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.039
 there is such a tube here too 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.939
 removable it was originally removed 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.000
 there was this valve hanging here 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.609
 inside a hermetically closed inside 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.289
 This type of ceramic coating volume 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:42.259
 what I managed to measure but 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:45.920
 almost to the top I got 0 7 liters 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.350
 Well, in principle, the volume is different but 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.920
 tank is not a big choice after all the bottle 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.570
 there are various means in size 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.689
 so that you understand for those who 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.729
 interesting it is somewhere twenty four with 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.979
 half centimeters total length 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:05.359
 it turns out well, and that's the diameter somewhere in 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:07.399
 area 68 maybe 9 millimeters then 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:09.200
 what I see now when you still 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.390
 sticker that can be peeled off but for now 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.770
 did not become here here glue here some 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.770
 God barcode chutochek 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.390
 yet no well here opens 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.460
 closes very convenient for filling 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.070
 in my opinion in general, I am very 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.950
 Satisfied with a bottle made as stated 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.660
 a producer of aluminum here is a note all 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.520
 the only thing is that when drank and 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.020
 especially 1 time gave a little bit somehow 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.000
 Here I want to rinse a little 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.220
 plastics and rubber some smell 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.650
 still was but now almost 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:43.400
 no 175 grams I got weight here 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.250
 such a spontaneous purchase is not 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.830
 I know how much is necessary but I just 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.750
 really wanted very much here 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.220
 maybe some of you will be too 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.860
 interesting but especially to me 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.840
 I liked what opens is not drunk 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.640
 tilting the bottle without turning 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.940
 accordingly it is just as easy and 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:06.160
 quickly closed without looking like this 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.160
 I hope it was interesting for now
