00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
use more fibrous carbs like vegetables

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.839 
use more fibrous carbs like vegetables
in<00:04:00.359> the<00:04:00.989> afternoon<00:04:01.680> as<00:04:01.979> well<00:04:02.189> as<00:04:02.370> into<00:04:02.669> the

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
nutrition to round it out is to focus on

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.050 
nutrition to round it out is to focus on
making<00:04:07.109> sure<00:04:07.139> that<00:04:07.379> you<00:04:07.680> do<00:04:07.949> have<00:04:08.220> carbs

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
making sure that you do have carbs

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.280 
making sure that you do have carbs
proteins<00:04:09.989> and<00:04:10.259> fats<00:04:10.859> at<00:04:11.489> every<00:04:12.209> meal<00:04:12.720> time<00:04:13.019> and

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
proteins and fats at every meal time and

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.649 
proteins and fats at every meal time and
sitting<00:04:13.500> so<00:04:14.129> for<00:04:14.310> instance<00:04:14.639> if<00:04:14.879> you<00:04:15.180> do<00:04:15.389> have<00:04:15.629> a

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
sitting so for instance if you do have a

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.409 
sitting so for instance if you do have a
mid-morning<00:04:16.560> meal<00:04:17.039> say<00:04:17.669> a<00:04:17.700> snack

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
mid-morning meal say a snack

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.869 
mid-morning meal say a snack
calling<00:04:18.659> it<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:18.840> snack<00:04:19.079> and<00:04:19.799> all<00:04:20.189> you<00:04:20.519> do<00:04:20.729> is

00:04:20.869 --> 00:04:20.879 
calling it a snack and all you do is

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:23.629 
calling it a snack and all you do is
have<00:04:21.060> an<00:04:21.150> apple<00:04:21.629> that's<00:04:22.139> not<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:22.830> good<00:04:23.129> meal

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
have an apple that's not a good meal

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.110 
have an apple that's not a good meal
because<00:04:24.270> it's<00:04:24.629> just<00:04:25.020> fibrous<00:04:25.680> carbs<00:04:26.430> you<00:04:26.909> do

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
because it's just fibrous carbs you do

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.589 
because it's just fibrous carbs you do
need<00:04:27.360> to<00:04:27.479> always<00:04:27.689> include<00:04:28.430> fat<00:04:29.430> as<00:04:29.819> well<00:04:30.270> as

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 
need to always include fat as well as

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:33.230 
need to always include fat as well as
protein<00:04:31.289> which<00:04:31.650> is<00:04:31.800> going<00:04:31.979> to<00:04:32.069> process<00:04:32.699> the

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
protein which is going to process the

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.929 
protein which is going to process the
carb<00:04:33.599> better<00:04:34.050> within<00:04:34.439> your<00:04:34.650> body<00:04:34.830> so<00:04:35.789> for

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:35.939 
carb better within your body so for

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:37.089 
carb better within your body so for
instance<00:04:36.240> what<00:04:36.360> would<00:04:36.449> be<00:04:36.599> a<00:04:36.629> better

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:37.099 
instance what would be a better

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:39.589 
instance what would be a better
substitution<00:04:38.099> maybe<00:04:38.729> for<00:04:39.060> instance<00:04:39.360> if<00:04:39.509> you

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
substitution maybe for instance if you

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:41.330 
substitution maybe for instance if you
had<00:04:39.749> celery<00:04:40.229> and<00:04:40.409> a<00:04:40.560> tablespoon<00:04:40.889> of<00:04:41.159> peanut

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
had celery and a tablespoon of peanut

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.730 
had celery and a tablespoon of peanut
butter<00:04:41.580> all<00:04:42.029> of<00:04:42.240> that<00:04:42.389> protein<00:04:42.810> fats<00:04:43.080> and<00:04:43.319> the

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
butter all of that protein fats and the

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.649 
butter all of that protein fats and the
fibrous<00:04:44.249> carbs<00:04:44.520> is<00:04:44.610> going<00:04:44.759> to<00:04:44.819> be<00:04:44.939> good<00:04:45.120> if<00:04:45.479> you

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659 
fibrous carbs is going to be good if you

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:48.559 
fibrous carbs is going to be good if you
are<00:04:45.840> going<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:46.229> have<00:04:46.319> an<00:04:46.560> apple<00:04:47.240> many<00:04:48.240> people

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:48.569 
are going to have an apple many people

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:49.969 
are going to have an apple many people
sometimes<00:04:48.900> will<00:04:49.020> have<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.319> Apple<00:04:49.650> with<00:04:49.770> it's

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
sometimes will have the Apple with it's

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.240 
sometimes will have the Apple with it's
a<00:04:50.189> cottage<00:04:50.580> cheese<00:04:51.029> or<00:04:51.389> a<00:04:52.050> yogurt<00:04:52.590> a<00:04:52.770> non-fat

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
a cottage cheese or a yogurt a non-fat

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.899 
a cottage cheese or a yogurt a non-fat
yogurt

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:53.909 
yogurt

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.570 
yogurt
so<00:04:54.330> think<00:04:55.020> about<00:04:55.199> where<00:04:55.590> you<00:04:55.740> can<00:04:55.949> match<00:04:56.250> up

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
so think about where you can match up

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.029 
so think about where you can match up
some<00:04:57.029> protein<00:04:57.449> and<00:04:57.479> carbs<00:04:57.990> especially<00:04:58.830> and

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
some protein and carbs especially and

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:01.339 
some protein and carbs especially and
every<00:04:59.759> so<00:04:59.879> often<00:05:00.060> that<00:05:00.360> fat<00:05:00.689> added<00:05:00.960> in<00:05:01.199> your

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
every so often that fat added in your

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.409 
every so often that fat added in your
day<00:05:01.590> now<00:05:02.219> let's<00:05:02.430> take<00:05:02.639> a<00:05:02.669> look<00:05:02.939> at<00:05:03.150> your

this exactly you've probably been doing

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.899 
this exactly you've probably been doing
a<00:05:09.810> lot<00:05:09.990> of<00:05:10.020> you<00:05:10.349> know<00:05:10.379> cardio<00:05:11.039> and<00:05:11.460> weight

the<00:05:18.240> laughs<00:05:18.419> of<00:05:18.599> 5<00:05:18.779> to<00:05:18.930> 10<00:05:19.110> pounds<00:05:19.259> off<00:05:19.499> is<00:05:19.740> to

00:05:20.239 --> 00:05:20.249 
the laughs of 5 to 10 pounds off is to

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:22.429 
the laughs of 5 to 10 pounds off is to
really<00:05:20.520> focus<00:05:20.789> on<00:05:21.089> these<00:05:21.389> two<00:05:21.659> specific<00:05:21.930> areas

00:05:22.429 --> 00:05:22.439 
really focus on these two specific areas

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:26.119 
really focus on these two specific areas
in<00:05:22.919> your<00:05:23.580> workouts<00:05:24.120> first<00:05:24.930> weight<00:05:25.620> training

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:26.129 
in your workouts first weight training

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:27.769 
in your workouts first weight training
so<00:05:26.610> weight<00:05:26.879> training<00:05:27.150> obviously<00:05:27.599> probably

00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:27.779 
so weight training obviously probably

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:30.200 
so weight training obviously probably
has<00:05:27.990> been<00:05:28.139> in<00:05:28.439> your<00:05:28.889> workout<00:05:29.370> program<00:05:29.520> but

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
has been in your workout program but

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.439 
has been in your workout program but
really<00:05:30.539> focus<00:05:30.960> now<00:05:31.169> on<00:05:31.469> trying<00:05:32.189> to<00:05:32.449> maximize

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
really focus now on trying to maximize

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:35.510 
really focus now on trying to maximize
the<00:05:33.839> amount<00:05:33.960> of<00:05:34.379> weight<00:05:34.620> that<00:05:34.649> you<00:05:34.889> can<00:05:35.250> lift

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
the amount of weight that you can lift

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.420 
the amount of weight that you can lift
in<00:05:35.969> the<00:05:36.779> amount<00:05:37.439> of<00:05:37.529> reps<00:05:37.740> that<00:05:38.099> will<00:05:38.279> hit

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
in the amount of reps that will hit

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.629 
in the amount of reps that will hit
maybe<00:05:38.610> say<00:05:38.909> 10<00:05:39.210> to<00:05:39.389> 12<00:05:39.659> reps<00:05:39.779> you<00:05:40.680> do<00:05:41.009> want<00:05:41.550> to

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 
maybe say 10 to 12 reps you do want to

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:44.329 
maybe say 10 to 12 reps you do want to
hit<00:05:41.909> failure<00:05:42.810> so<00:05:43.379> your<00:05:43.830> weight<00:05:44.129> training

00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:44.339 
hit failure so your weight training

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:47.420 
hit failure so your weight training
should<00:05:44.580> hit<00:05:45.210> more<00:05:45.659> of<00:05:45.689> a<00:05:46.050> weight<00:05:46.319> increase<00:05:47.099> as

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
should hit more of a weight increase as

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.869 
should hit more of a weight increase as
well<00:05:48.210> as<00:05:48.479> suggestion<00:05:49.110> for<00:05:49.879> compound

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:50.879 
well as suggestion for compound

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:53.659 
well as suggestion for compound
exercises<00:05:51.839> so<00:05:52.529> rather<00:05:52.740> than<00:05:53.009> just<00:05:53.069> training

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
exercises so rather than just training

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:54.499 
exercises so rather than just training
your<00:05:53.819> biceps

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:54.509 
your biceps

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:57.529 
your biceps
why<00:05:54.960> don't<00:05:55.229> you<00:05:55.379> do<00:05:55.589> biceps<00:05:56.339> and<00:05:56.580> a<00:05:56.909> lunge<00:05:57.210> at

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
why don't you do biceps and a lunge at

00:05:57.539 --> 00:05:59.480 
why don't you do biceps and a lunge at
the<00:05:57.779> same<00:05:58.020> time<00:05:58.319> and<00:05:58.830> that's<00:05:59.009> when<00:05:59.219> it<00:05:59.339> worked

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
the same time and that's when it worked

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.189 
the same time and that's when it worked
more<00:05:59.669> of<00:05:59.759> your<00:05:59.879> body<00:06:00.089> as<00:06:00.330> well<00:06:00.509> as<00:06:00.629> your<00:06:00.779> core

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 
more of your body as well as your core

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:03.679 
more of your body as well as your core
at<00:06:01.439> the<00:06:01.589> same<00:06:01.770> time<00:06:02.069> so<00:06:02.909> increase<00:06:03.479> your

00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:03.689 
at the same time so increase your

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:05.809 
at the same time so increase your
weights<00:06:03.960> really<00:06:04.620> go<00:06:04.770> heavier<00:06:05.129> than<00:06:05.370> you<00:06:05.520> think

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:05.819 
weights really go heavier than you think

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:08.029 
weights really go heavier than you think
and<00:06:06.089> the<00:06:06.750> second<00:06:07.349> thing<00:06:07.469> that's<00:06:07.589> really<00:06:07.919> going

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
and the second thing that's really going

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:11.089 
and the second thing that's really going
to<00:06:08.189> impact<00:06:08.819> your<00:06:09.539> workouts<00:06:10.259> is<00:06:10.529> by<00:06:11.039> doing

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:11.099 
to impact your workouts is by doing

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:13.939 
to impact your workouts is by doing
interval<00:06:12.089> training<00:06:12.629> not<00:06:13.110> just<00:06:13.349> regular<00:06:13.680> old

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949 
interval training not just regular old

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:15.939 
interval training not just regular old
interval<00:06:14.669> training<00:06:15.089> but<00:06:15.240> really

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:15.949 
interval training but really

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.649 
interval training but really
high-intensity<00:06:16.949> interval<00:06:17.219> training<00:06:17.580> you<00:06:18.479> may

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:18.659 
high-intensity interval training you may

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:22.820 
high-intensity interval training you may
have<00:06:18.750> seen<00:06:18.930> it<00:06:19.110> called<00:06:19.409> hit<00:06:20.389> HIIT<00:06:21.469> if<00:06:22.469> you<00:06:22.649> can
