root side effects
black<00:00:10.740> cohosh<00:00:11.040> root<00:00:11.519> has<00:00:11.790> been<00:00:12.000> used

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
black cohosh root has been used

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.810 
black cohosh root has been used
primarily<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:13.049> help<00:00:13.290> reduce<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:14.160> symptoms<00:00:14.639> of

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
primarily to help reduce the symptoms of

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.800 
primarily to help reduce the symptoms of
menopause<00:00:15.269> such<00:00:15.870> as<00:00:15.900> hot<00:00:16.049> flashes<00:00:17.570> one<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.720> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
menopause such as hot flashes one of the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.099 
menopause such as hot flashes one of the
things<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.350> can<00:00:19.500> happen<00:00:19.710> with<00:00:20.160> black<00:00:20.430> cohosh

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 
things that can happen with black cohosh

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.540 
things that can happen with black cohosh
exactly<00:00:22.109> how<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.380> works<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.769> not<00:00:22.949> extremely

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
exactly how it works is not extremely

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.370 
exactly how it works is not extremely
well<00:00:23.939> understood<00:00:24.420> but<00:00:24.630> one<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.140> things

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
well understood but one of the things

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.679 
well understood but one of the things
that<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.740> thought<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.010> occur<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.420> can

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
that is thought to occur is that it can

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.859 
that is thought to occur is that it can
increase<00:00:28.650> blood<00:00:29.039> flow<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:30.300> pelvic<00:00:30.689> area

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
increase blood flow to the pelvic area

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.860 
increase blood flow to the pelvic area
it<00:00:31.260> can<00:00:31.500> also<00:00:31.830> stimulate<00:00:33.920> endometrial

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
it can also stimulate endometrial

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.830 
it can also stimulate endometrial
basically<00:00:36.870> stimulation<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.680> for<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.399> reason

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
basically stimulation so for that reason

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.900 
basically stimulation so for that reason
one<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.079> side<00:00:40.320> effects<00:00:40.739> if<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.370> took<00:00:41.670> it

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
one of the side effects if you took it

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.420 
one of the side effects if you took it
and<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.600> were<00:00:42.719> actually<00:00:42.930> still<00:00:43.590> as<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.040> woman

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
and you were actually still as a woman

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.860 
and you were actually still as a woman
is<00:00:44.550> if<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:45.000> were<00:00:45.090> still<00:00:45.300> menstruating<00:00:45.750> it

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
is if you were still menstruating it

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.360 
is if you were still menstruating it
could<00:00:45.989> actually<00:00:46.200> increase<00:00:46.739> blood<00:00:47.309> flow

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
could actually increase blood flow

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.330 
could actually increase blood flow
therefore<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.960> cause<00:00:49.530> very<00:00:49.829> very<00:00:50.070> heavy

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
therefore in cause very very heavy

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.189 
therefore in cause very very heavy
bleeding<00:00:50.700> which<00:00:51.390> would<00:00:51.570> not<00:00:51.719> be<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> good<00:00:52.140> thing

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
bleeding which would not be a good thing

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.560 
bleeding which would not be a good thing
it<00:00:52.620> could<00:00:52.829> actually<00:00:53.430> decrease<00:00:53.820> your<00:00:54.059> body's

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
it could actually decrease your body's

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.299 
it could actually decrease your body's
ability<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:55.140> clot<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.739> definitely<00:00:55.920> would

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
ability to clot so you definitely would

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.889 
ability to clot so you definitely would
not<00:00:56.489> want<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.789> take<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.149> if<00:00:57.329> you're<00:00:57.480> actually

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
not want to take it if you're actually

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.470 
not want to take it if you're actually
still<00:00:58.190> administrating<00:00:59.190> another<00:01:00.000> thing<00:01:00.300> is

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
still administrating another thing is

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.840 
still administrating another thing is
because<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:01.020> does<00:01:01.230> cause<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:02.010> stimulation

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
because it does cause that stimulation

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.509 
because it does cause that stimulation
in<00:01:03.090> your<00:01:03.329> individual<00:01:03.960> lining<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.799> can<00:01:05.339> also

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
in your individual lining it can also

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.000 
in your individual lining it can also
cause<00:01:05.880> cramping<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.900> some<00:01:07.229> women<00:01:07.530> or<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> lot<00:01:07.890> of

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
cause cramping in some women or a lot of

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.160 
cause cramping in some women or a lot of
abdominal<00:01:08.189> pain<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.510> those<00:01:09.750> are<00:01:09.930> some

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
abdominal pain so those are some

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.130 
abdominal pain so those are some
potential<00:01:10.890> side<00:01:11.100> effects<00:01:11.570> another<00:01:12.570> thing<00:01:12.900> is

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
potential side effects another thing is

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.649 
potential side effects another thing is
in<00:01:13.520> pregnant<00:01:14.520> women<00:01:14.549> they<00:01:14.970> should<00:01:15.180> completely

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
in pregnant women they should completely

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.380 
in pregnant women they should completely
avoid<00:01:16.200> black<00:01:16.619> cohosh<00:01:17.159> fruit<00:01:17.460> again<00:01:17.939> because

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
avoid black cohosh fruit again because

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.749 
avoid black cohosh fruit again because
of<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.810> stimulation<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.070> endometrial

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
of that stimulation to the endometrial

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.960 
of that stimulation to the endometrial
lining<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.570> could<00:01:21.840> actually<00:01:22.049> cause

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
lining it could actually cause

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.719 
lining it could actually cause
miscarriages<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.659> for<00:01:25.650> pregnant<00:01:26.130> women<00:01:26.310> or

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
miscarriages so for pregnant women or

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.580 
miscarriages so for pregnant women or
for<00:01:27.030> women<00:01:27.210> who<00:01:27.570> are<00:01:27.840> breastfeeding<00:01:28.290> it's

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
for women who are breastfeeding it's

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.109 
for women who are breastfeeding it's
very<00:01:28.799> important<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.310> they<00:01:29.520> don't<00:01:29.790> take

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
very important that they don't take

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.050 
very important that they don't take
black<00:01:30.840> cohosh<00:01:31.229> because<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.829> could<00:01:32.009> cause<00:01:32.220> many

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
black cohosh because it could cause many

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.280 
black cohosh because it could cause many
problems<00:01:34.070> as<00:01:35.070> far<00:01:35.280> as<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.119> men<00:01:36.509> there<00:01:36.900> really

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
problems as far as in men there really

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.289 
problems as far as in men there really
are<00:01:37.409> not<00:01:37.560> very<00:01:37.619> well<00:01:38.100> studied<00:01:38.460> side<00:01:38.970> effects

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
are not very well studied side effects

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.300 
are not very well studied side effects
of<00:01:39.479> black<00:01:39.659> cohosh<00:01:40.020> some<00:01:40.710> men<00:01:40.860> have<00:01:41.009> actually

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
of black cohosh some men have actually

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.030 
of black cohosh some men have actually
tried<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:42.299> increasing<00:01:43.140> blood<00:01:43.560> flow<00:01:43.979> to

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
tried it for increasing blood flow to

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.580 
tried it for increasing blood flow to
their<00:01:44.939> sex<00:01:45.299> organs<00:01:45.689> but<00:01:46.020> again<00:01:46.259> that's<00:01:46.409> not

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
their sex organs but again that's not

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.649 
their sex organs but again that's not
very<00:01:46.829> well<00:01:47.100> studied<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.119> side<00:01:48.329> effects

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
very well studied and the side effects

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.200 
very well studied and the side effects
are<00:01:48.810> not<00:01:49.020> very<00:01:49.320> well<00:01:49.560> known<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:50.130> men<00:01:50.399> however

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
are not very well known in men however

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.030 
are not very well known in men however
in<00:01:51.479> women<00:01:51.840> there<00:01:51.990> are<00:01:52.110> very<00:01:52.350> well<00:01:52.409> known<00:01:52.560> side

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
in women there are very well known side

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.440 
in women there are very well known side
effects<00:01:53.280> for<00:01:53.369> black<00:01:53.579> cohosh<00:01:53.939> again<00:01:54.360> you

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
effects for black cohosh again you

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.940 
effects for black cohosh again you
should<00:01:54.600> not<00:01:54.780> take<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.229> if<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.409> are<00:01:55.590> still

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
should not take it if you are still
