00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.450 
think it all depends they've got to
start<00:01:07.450> you<00:01:08.110> know<00:01:08.229> well<00:01:08.500> and<00:01:08.740> just<00:01:09.100> keep<00:01:09.280> their

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460

fourth<00:01:09.670> ghost<00:01:09.940> keep<00:01:10.119> the<00:01:10.210> discipline<00:01:10.720> and<00:01:11.229> I

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
fourth ghost keep the discipline and I

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.990 
fourth ghost keep the discipline and I
think<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.679> simple<00:01:12.009> of<00:01:12.160> the<00:01:12.340> fit<00:01:12.520> decide<00:01:12.910> in

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
think the simple of the fit decide in

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.910 
think the simple of the fit decide in
the<00:01:13.090> world<00:01:13.300> sore<00:01:13.630> maybe<00:01:14.319> there's<00:01:14.560> score<00:01:14.800> them

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
the world sore maybe there's score them

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.010 
the world sore maybe there's score them
later<00:01:15.160> on<00:01:15.369> in<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:15.759> game<00:01:15.789> but<00:01:16.270> i<00:01:16.450> think<00:01:16.840> they

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
later on in the game but i think they

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.949 
later on in the game but i think they
haven't<00:01:17.380> looked<00:01:17.590> like<00:01:17.800> scooted<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.869> know

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:19.959 
haven't looked like scooted you know

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:22.290 
haven't looked like scooted you know
troy<00:01:20.289> saw<00:01:20.649> the<00:01:20.709> tournament<00:01:21.340> I<00:01:21.490> just<00:01:22.149> think

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
troy saw the tournament I just think

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.609 
troy saw the tournament I just think
they<00:01:22.450> were<00:01:22.569> they'll<00:01:22.720> be<00:01:22.869> happy<00:01:23.050> to<00:01:23.140> get<00:01:23.319> a<00:01:23.380> win

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
they were they'll be happy to get a win

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.199 
they were they'll be happy to get a win
so<00:01:24.009> I<00:01:24.580> think<00:01:24.910> maybe<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.979> would<00:01:27.250> go<00:01:27.399> some<00:01:28.179> more

00:01:28.199 --> 00:01:28.209 
so I think maybe I would go some more

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:30.480 
so I think maybe I would go some more
without<00:01:28.569> 16<00:01:29.170> excellent<00:01:29.830> stuff<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.099> as<00:01:30.190> far<00:01:30.340> as
