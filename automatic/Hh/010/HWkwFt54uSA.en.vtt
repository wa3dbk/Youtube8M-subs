okay so it kind of cut it is actually
the<00:00:40.850> the<00:00:41.270> beam<00:00:41.480> is<00:00:41.510> actually<00:00:41.960> acronym<00:00:42.500> you

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
the the beam is actually acronym you

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.920 
the the beam is actually acronym you
guys<00:00:43.340> use<00:00:43.520> that<00:00:43.670> word<00:00:43.850> right<00:00:44.060> in<00:00:44.240> the<00:00:44.300> UK<00:00:44.540> you

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
guys use that word right in the UK you

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.800 
guys use that word right in the UK you
never<00:00:45.800> know<00:00:45.860> and<00:00:46.130> there<00:00:46.220> and<00:00:46.400> the<00:00:47.120> beam<00:00:47.510> stands

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
never know and there and the beam stands

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.160 
never know and there and the beam stands
for<00:00:48.080> bass<00:00:48.710> electric<00:00:49.610> acoustic<00:00:49.970> and<00:00:50.360> music<00:00:50.720> so

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
for bass electric acoustic and music so

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.960 
for bass electric acoustic and music so
it<00:00:51.260> actually<00:00:51.410> works<00:00:51.710> really<00:00:51.800> well<00:00:52.010> for<00:00:52.130> as<00:00:52.730> a

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
it actually works really well for as a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.050 
it actually works really well for as a
bass<00:00:53.180> guitar<00:00:53.230> amplifier<00:00:54.490> electric<00:00:55.490> obviously

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060 
bass guitar amplifier electric obviously

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.200 
bass guitar amplifier electric obviously
from<00:00:56.240> the<00:00:56.300> core<00:00:56.540> series<00:00:56.810> acoustic<00:00:57.740> as<00:00:58.210> well

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
from the core series acoustic as well

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.680 
from the core series acoustic as well
and<00:00:59.510> then<00:00:59.840> also<00:00:59.990> playback<00:01:00.560> for<00:01:00.770> music<00:01:01.160> and

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
and then also playback for music and

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.620 
and then also playback for music and
this<00:01:02.690> year<00:01:02.930> it<00:01:03.020> has<00:01:03.170> bluetooth<00:01:04.630> accessibility

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
this year it has bluetooth accessibility

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.000 
this year it has bluetooth accessibility
so<00:01:05.750> you<00:01:05.840> can<00:01:05.930> actually<00:01:06.049> play<00:01:06.470> your<00:01:06.590> music<00:01:06.650> by

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
your phone or what have you by that also

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.680 
your phone or what have you by that also
the<00:01:09.950> enclosure<00:01:10.460> themselves<00:01:11.030> is<00:01:11.150> a<00:01:11.180> tuning

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
the enclosure themselves is a tuning

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.240 
the enclosure themselves is a tuning
closure<00:01:11.930> now<00:01:12.200> so<00:01:12.590> it's<00:01:12.710> two<00:01:12.860> separate

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
closure now so it's two separate

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.760 
closure now so it's two separate

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
small size I think and I heard some of

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.410 
small size I think and I heard some of
the<00:01:45.799> prototypes<00:01:46.370> of<00:01:46.490> this<00:01:46.640> I<00:01:46.790> have<00:01:46.940> to<00:01:46.970> confess

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
the prototypes of this I have to confess

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.140 
the prototypes of this I have to confess
gorilla<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.229> it<00:01:48.350> seemed<00:01:48.650> to<00:01:48.890> be<00:01:49.150> probably

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
gorilla and it seemed to be probably

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.070 
gorilla and it seemed to be probably
loud<00:01:50.360> enough<00:01:50.600> to<00:01:50.630> take<00:01:50.900> to<00:01:51.049> an<00:01:51.140> open<00:01:51.380> mic

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
loud enough to take to an open mic

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.770 
loud enough to take to an open mic
thing<00:01:52.230> like<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.440> yeah<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:54.180> electric<00:01:54.600> side

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
thing like that yeah the electric side

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.480 
thing like that yeah the electric side
we're<00:01:55.050> especially<00:01:55.260> good<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.980> has<00:01:56.220> an<00:01:56.340> eighth

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
we're especially good it has an eighth

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.190 
we're especially good it has an eighth
inch<00:01:56.670> output<00:01:57.120> you<00:01:57.240> could<00:01:57.390> use<00:01:57.510> that<00:01:57.630> into<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.020> PA

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
inch output you could use that into a PA

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.890 
inch output you could use that into a PA
