what we're going to do now is we're
going<00:03:12.680> to<00:03:12.800> take<00:03:13.450> this<00:03:14.450> bit<00:03:14.720> right<00:03:14.750> here<00:03:16.540> and

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
going to take this bit right here and

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.940 
going to take this bit right here and
first<00:03:18.140> thing<00:03:18.200> we're<00:03:18.380> going<00:03:18.470> to<00:03:18.530> do<00:03:18.620> is<00:03:18.770> we're

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
first thing we're going to do is we're

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.600 
first thing we're going to do is we're
going<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.160> put<00:03:19.340> these<00:03:19.430> back<00:03:19.640> in<00:03:21.370> hoagies<00:03:22.370> back

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
going to put these back in hoagies back

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.060 
going to put these back in hoagies back
fold<00:03:23.600> this<00:03:23.750> up<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:23.989> rest<00:03:24.140> of<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.320> way<00:03:24.440> so<00:03:24.950> it's

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
fold this up the rest of the way so it's

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.470 
fold this up the rest of the way so it's
like<00:03:25.190> that<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:25.900> go<00:03:26.900> take<00:03:27.260> this<00:03:28.209> bring<00:03:29.209> it<00:03:29.330> all

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
like that and go take this bring it all

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.120 
like that and go take this bring it all
the<00:03:29.540> way<00:03:30.170> down<00:03:31.060> like<00:03:32.060> so<00:03:32.980> you're<00:03:33.980> going<00:03:34.100> to

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
the way down like so you're going to

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.630 
the way down like so you're going to
rotate<00:03:34.459> this<00:03:34.910> and<00:03:36.010> then<00:03:37.010> you<00:03:37.250> just<00:03:37.430> kind<00:03:37.580> of

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
rotate this and then you just kind of

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.920 
rotate this and then you just kind of
kind<00:03:37.820> of<00:03:37.910> rotate<00:03:38.360> this<00:03:38.480> back<00:03:38.780> over<00:03:38.840> like<00:03:39.350> that

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
kind of rotate this back over like that

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.570 
kind of rotate this back over like that
and<00:03:42.100> once<00:03:43.100> you<00:03:43.190> have<00:03:43.280> it<00:03:43.340> in<00:03:43.459> this

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
and once you have it in this

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.870 
and once you have it in this
configuration<00:03:45.160> see<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.250> two<00:03:46.430> ports<00:03:46.730> right

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
configuration see the two ports right

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.199 
configuration see the two ports right
here<00:03:47.830> they're<00:03:48.830> going<00:03:48.950> to<00:03:49.010> go<00:03:49.160> on<00:03:49.489> these<00:03:50.030> two

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
here they're going to go on these two

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.860 
here they're going to go on these two
pegs<00:03:50.450> on<00:03:50.770> optimises<00:03:51.770> shoulders<00:03:52.600> say<00:03:53.600> just

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
pegs on optimises shoulders say just

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.510 
pegs on optimises shoulders say just
take<00:03:54.020> them<00:03:54.489> and<00:03:55.489> you<00:03:56.480> just<00:03:56.690> plug<00:03:56.989> it<00:03:57.020> in<00:03:57.520> like

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
take them and you just plug it in like

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.190 
take them and you just plug it in like
that<00:03:58.670> once<00:03:59.540> you<00:03:59.600> have<00:03:59.690> this<00:03:59.780> plugged<00:04:00.020> in<00:04:00.170> just

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
that once you have this plugged in just

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.250 
that once you have this plugged in just
bring<00:04:00.620> this<00:04:00.739> down<00:04:00.980> and<00:04:01.220> they'll<00:04:01.400> snap<00:04:01.760> in

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
bring this down and they'll snap in

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.399 
bring this down and they'll snap in
right<00:04:03.260> there

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:08.409 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:17.560 

and<00:04:11.560> once<00:04:13.629> you<00:04:14.629> have<00:04:14.810> it<00:04:14.959> there<00:04:16.419> we're<00:04:17.419> almost

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
and once you have it there we're almost

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.229 
and once you have it there we're almost
done

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
done

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.400

bashful so basically now you want to
take<00:04:31.100> these<00:04:31.280> bets<00:04:31.639> right<00:04:31.820> here<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:32.270> with<00:04:33.229> the

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
take these bets right here and with the

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.950 
take these bets right here and with the
silver<00:04:34.039> part<00:04:34.280> facing<00:04:35.090> out<00:04:35.389> you<00:04:35.570> just<00:04:35.780> want<00:04:35.930> to

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
silver part facing out you just want to

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.529 
silver part facing out you just want to
click<00:04:36.110> these<00:04:37.930> enoughness<00:04:38.930> of<00:04:39.199> shoulders<00:04:40.539> like

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
click these enoughness of shoulders like

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:45.129 
click these enoughness of shoulders like
so<00:04:42.430> so<00:04:43.430> it's<00:04:43.940> got<00:04:44.120> pushes<00:04:44.479> on<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:44.690> car<00:04:44.840> close

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
so so it's got pushes on the car close

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.670 
so so it's got pushes on the car close
up<00:04:45.289> the<00:04:45.380> gap<00:04:46.419> and<00:04:47.419> you<00:04:47.479> can<00:04:47.630> take<00:04:47.780> this<00:04:48.380> little
