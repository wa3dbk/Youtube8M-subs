 the woods have dates 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.750

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.260
 everything with its dates 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.330
 they have to take a minimum of one year 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.040
 inflamed and dry is an age or a 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:48.180
 guarantee that the wood is stable 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.970
 at least here there are 500 500 horses 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.300
 for 500 grams 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.850
 everything that is here is made of wood 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.790
 mark it 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.230
 and jacarandas 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:05.530
 what is here is the naranjeros 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:08.159
 also in other ways shows this 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.650
 year 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.350
 comes to us 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.040
 in this years 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.530
 It is wood such 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.530
 It is a process of wood settlement 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.909
 a way called 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:34.479
 from eastern Bolivian 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.899
 this is a wood that is called that is 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.899
 raw 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.890
 the finish 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.670
 after that 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.540
 they already have 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.540
 the world Cup 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.130
 which it is to form the charango 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:56.549
 in this case we are inviting the kibbutz 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.659
 as here everything is almost finished 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.050
 Painted 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.110
 they thought this charango is ready 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.680
 first turn your back after 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.820
 the back 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.030
 comes what is called and although to this 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.030
 it's here 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.360
 to a certain place with the machine 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.570
 Precision machine posture for 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:26.290
 this if it would have been nice for me but 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.290
 the way to lose weight is with the cumbia 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.770
 i 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.310
 after doing all this comes own 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.310
 covered 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:48.590
 and it's like that 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.590
 this is already with the lid 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:55.250
 top white pine fir german 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.160
 it's the tapado 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.569
 put the table 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.310
 thereafter 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:07.370

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.370
 2 phil is where this matter from here 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.510
 the steak 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:16.280
 once the steaks are put 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.680

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.290
 the fretboard 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.630
 what can be ebony because 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.640
 we start wood and the palette 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.580
 the palette has a combination of 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.220
 jacaranda wood with ebony conchitas 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.710

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.580
 shells made of plastic 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:48.380
 the wood is jacaranda 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.670
 and then comes flat 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.709
 the explanation 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.709
