00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:20.270
 hi to all and bus 91 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.450
 hello I was planning a tutorial on 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:27.520
 earth simulator 2 to be able to put 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:30.320
 a music and format kilometers so 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.230
 First of all if you do not have 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.739
 music in mp3 it will download a 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.180
 software 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:40.489
 I advise you and follow the show and 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.840
 x.com so I would put you well in 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:49.269
 the discussions you just have to do 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:49.269
 download it's going pretty fast 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.489
 I installed you in France year 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:20.210
 so that I advise you to do like 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.830
 I just unhook it is useless 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.130
 it's a total part what's going to do 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.900
 slow down your pc you want it and that 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.930
 except that your browser needs to be 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.930
 fault 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:36.380
 the camera take off that crazy and its 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:40.369
 clever outdoor facilities must 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:47.420
 install also microsoft.net you 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:51.710
 the install is so this software it goes 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.660
 we serve to see convert the 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.140
 music formats of all 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.149
 music that you have and sometimes passes 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.530
 not on their stuff that I wanted 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.460
 put a precise format on mp3 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.020
 now most of the music that 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.520
 you download his mp3 but there is 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.270
 always who they are so I'm going 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.230
 find yourself at the end of 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.670
 the installation to his fresco 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.600
 the installation there is the installation 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.500
 from microsoft.net that takes a little bit 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.090
 of time if they went to right away 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.690
 so here is the download done 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:30.730
 so when we open freemix audio 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.730
 converter falls on us 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:47.730
 when I said proud as the place ve 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:53.540
 and the years on wav aiff does audio you 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:58.800
 go get your music is there we go 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:02.760
 see there and you put it in mp3 you 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.520
 click on an mp3 here I advise you 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.320
 to make optimal quality that's a 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.790
 better quality will not take longer 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:18.000
 than in 300 - select it your 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:21.120
 folder where are you ever going to the office and 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.420
 you have north convert in general 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.420
 go fast enough 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.300
 c 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.850
 so here you can put some 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.700
 several and all convert to the same 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.970
 time you see how you do 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.840
 here I am going to do my time while there 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.840
 it was in wav 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.879
 and mp3 is the same quality 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:15.239
 good so let's take this one for 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:20.109

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.650
