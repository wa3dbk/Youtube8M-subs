you how to uh what do you call it

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.879 
you how to uh what do you call it
changer<00:00:07.859> bushings<00:00:08.610> so<00:00:09.050> the<00:00:10.050> bushings<00:00:10.469> art<00:00:10.769> of

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
changer bushings so the bushings art of

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.570 
changer bushings so the bushings art of
the<00:00:11.330> little<00:00:12.330> squishy<00:00:12.920> things<00:00:13.920> right<00:00:14.160> here<00:00:14.370> the

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
the little squishy things right here the

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.000 
the little squishy things right here the
made<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.820> urethane<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.650> the<00:00:16.650> basically<00:00:16.949> it

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
made of urethane and the basically it

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.170 
made of urethane and the basically it
helps<00:00:17.279> you<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:18.150> turn<00:00:18.390> with<00:00:19.340> with<00:00:20.340> rebound<00:00:20.730> and

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
helps you to turn with with rebound and

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.040 
helps you to turn with with rebound and
still<00:00:21.949> instability<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.490> basically<00:00:23.939> I'm<00:00:24.840> going

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
still instability so basically I'm going

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.179 
still instability so basically I'm going
to<00:00:25.140> change<00:00:25.439> out<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.859> venom

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
to change out the venom

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.380 
to change out the venom
86a<00:00:26.900> bushings<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:28.230> have<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.830> cone<00:00:29.490> cone<00:00:30.150> on<00:00:30.330> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
86a bushings I have a cone cone on the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.420 
86a bushings I have a cone cone on the
top<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.840> barrel<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.199> bottom<00:00:31.590> which<00:00:32.279> is

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
top and a barrel on the bottom which is

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.400 
top and a barrel on the bottom which is
pretty<00:00:32.669> good<00:00:32.910> for<00:00:32.969> cruising<00:00:33.960> around<00:00:34.079> with

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
pretty good for cruising around with

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.000 
pretty good for cruising around with
those<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.730> first<00:00:36.059> ability<00:00:36.380> with<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> barrel<00:00:37.980> on

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
those so first ability with a barrel on

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.490 
those so first ability with a barrel on
the<00:00:38.160> bottom<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.670> for<00:00:38.940> carving<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.600> for

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
the bottom and for carving on the for

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.560 
the bottom and for carving on the for
the<00:00:40.590> cone<00:00:40.800> bushing<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.520> I'm<00:00:42.090> going<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.450> be

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
the cone bushing and I'm going to be

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.709 
the cone bushing and I'm going to be
changing<00:00:43.079> them<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.680> 83<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> bear<00:00:45.239> stock

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
changing them to the 83 a bear stock

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.619 
changing them to the 83 a bear stock
bushing<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.879> I<00:00:47.879> just<00:00:48.149> wanted<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.390> see<00:00:48.510> how

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
bushing so I just wanted to see how

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.520 
bushing so I just wanted to see how
those<00:00:48.780> ride<00:00:50.239> and<00:00:51.239> then<00:00:51.420> all<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.809> needed<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.289> skate

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
those ride and then all I needed a skate

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.139 
those ride and then all I needed a skate
tool<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.039> he's<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.820> big<00:00:54.059> size<00:00:54.360> take<00:00:54.780> off<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
tool and he's the big size take off the

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.420 
tool and he's the big size take off the
kingpin<00:00:57.149> bolt<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.140> just<00:00:58.350> turn<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.649> turn<00:00:59.370> it

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
kingpin bolt so you just turn it turn it

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.400 
kingpin bolt so you just turn it turn it
turn<00:00:59.850> it

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
turn it

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.930 
turn it
throw<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.590> over<00:01:01.710> there<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.520> then<00:01:02.640> take<00:01:02.820> out

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
throw that over there and then take out

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.719 
throw that over there and then take out
the<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.390> bolts<00:01:03.719> at<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.140> aside<00:01:04.549> thing<00:01:05.549> about

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
the the bolts at that aside thing about

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.810 
the the bolts at that aside thing about
the<00:01:05.850> washer<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:07.170> washer<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.830> for<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> cone

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
the washer is this washer is for a cone

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.520 
the washer is this washer is for a cone
bushing<00:01:09.740> as<00:01:10.740> opposed<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.549> washer<00:01:12.229> it<00:01:13.229> is

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
bushing as opposed to this washer it is

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.969 
bushing as opposed to this washer it is
for<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.580> barrel<00:01:15.830> bushing<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.540> whoops

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
for a barrel bushing so whoops

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.910 
for a barrel bushing so whoops
drop<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.009> okay<00:01:20.720> so<00:01:21.720> basically<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.680> for<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
drop that okay so basically like for the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.700 
drop that okay so basically like for the
barrel<00:01:23.299> this<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.840> supposed<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.170> go<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.409> like

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
barrel this is supposed to go on like

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.940 
barrel this is supposed to go on like
that<00:01:25.740> flush<00:01:26.400> but<00:01:27.390> for<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.960> cone<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.650> will<00:01:28.770> not

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
that flush but for this cone it will not

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.950 
that flush but for this cone it will not
fit<00:01:29.250> see<00:01:29.729> it's<00:01:30.689> just<00:01:31.140> kind<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:32.270> it's<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.780> won't

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
fit see it's just kind of it's it won't

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.069 
fit see it's just kind of it's it won't
fit<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:35.240> that's<00:01:36.240> why<00:01:36.420> if<00:01:36.689> if<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.229> have<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> coned

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
fit so that's why if if you have a coned

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.020 
fit so that's why if if you have a coned
bushing<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.259> need<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.560> use<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.950> way<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.880> have

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
bushing you need to use this way to have

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.230 
bushing you need to use this way to have
to<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:42.560> like<00:01:43.560> if<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.399> one<00:01:44.579> fits<00:01:44.850> for<00:01:45.090> cone

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
to but like if this one fits for cone

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.350 
to but like if this one fits for cone
bushings<00:01:45.659> only<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.979> one<00:01:47.250> fits<00:01:48.180> for

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
bushings only and this one fits for

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.520 
bushings only and this one fits for
barrel<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.840> can<00:01:48.990> use<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.200> one<00:01:49.320> if<00:01:49.439> you

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
barrel so you can use this one if you

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.499 
barrel so you can use this one if you
have<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.649> cone<00:01:49.890> or<00:01:50.159> just<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.299> made

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
have a cone or just that this is made

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.780 
have a cone or just that this is made
for<00:01:51.780> barrel<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:53.040> one<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.280> made<00:01:53.430> for<00:01:53.549> cone

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
for barrel this one is made for cone

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.050 
for barrel this one is made for cone
cone<00:01:55.310> bushings<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.180> just<00:01:57.329> hit<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.479> aside

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
cone bushings so you just hit that aside

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.780 
cone bushings so you just hit that aside
wiggle<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.240> out

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
wiggle this out

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.249 
wiggle this out
set<00:02:02.790> aside<00:02:02.909> take<00:02:03.540> off<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.810> hanger<00:02:06.259> the

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
set aside take off the hanger the

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.949 
set aside take off the hanger the
bushing<00:02:07.530> aside<00:02:07.799> then<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.129> get<00:02:08.599> the<00:02:09.599> other

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
bushing aside then you get the other

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.380 
bushing aside then you get the other
bushing<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.470> won't<00:02:10.679> put<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:10.920> at<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.069> bottom

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
bushing you won't put it at the bottom

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.490 
bushing you won't put it at the bottom
but

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
but
