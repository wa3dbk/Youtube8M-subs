definitely a challenge to you know put

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.830 
definitely a challenge to you know put
it<00:00:29.660> up<00:00:29.750> high<00:00:29.930> but<00:00:30.260> luckily<00:00:30.860> today<00:00:31.279> we<00:00:31.430> did<00:00:31.610> that

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
it up high but luckily today we did that

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.180 
it up high but luckily today we did that
the<00:00:32.840> car<00:00:33.079> is<00:00:33.230> definitely<00:00:33.649> very<00:00:33.680> different

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
the car is definitely very different

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.460 
the car is definitely very different
than<00:00:34.280> last<00:00:34.460> year<00:00:34.670> we<00:00:35.329> got<00:00:35.600> a<00:00:35.840> lot<00:00:36.050> of<00:00:36.079> new<00:00:36.260> rules

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
than last year we got a lot of new rules

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.920 
than last year we got a lot of new rules
packages<00:00:37.100> with<00:00:37.310> the<00:00:37.430> brakes<00:00:37.930> specifically

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
packages with the brakes specifically

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.139 
packages with the brakes specifically
and<00:00:39.140> it<00:00:39.620> really<00:00:39.829> helps<00:00:40.160> out<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:40.430> Mustang<00:00:40.850> in

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
and it really helps out the Mustang in

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.389 
and it really helps out the Mustang in
its<00:00:41.450> weakest<00:00:41.840> area<00:00:42.140> so<00:00:42.410> we're<00:00:42.920> hoping<00:00:43.130> for<00:00:43.190> a

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
its weakest area so we're hoping for a

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.250 
its weakest area so we're hoping for a
lot<00:00:44.000> better<00:00:44.180> results<00:00:44.239> with<00:00:44.720> some<00:00:44.750> tracks<00:00:45.110> that

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
lot better results with some tracks that

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.200 
lot better results with some tracks that
we<00:00:45.350> weren't<00:00:45.590> so<00:00:45.710> good<00:00:45.890> at<00:00:46.070> last<00:00:46.309> year<00:00:46.579> a<00:00:46.850> lot<00:00:47.090> of

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
we weren't so good at last year a lot of

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.090 
we weren't so good at last year a lot of
the<00:00:47.270> tighter<00:00:47.510> twistier<00:00:48.079> tracks<00:00:48.440> that<00:00:48.710> really

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
the tighter twistier tracks that really

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.920 
the tighter twistier tracks that really
ate<00:00:49.250> up<00:00:49.399> the<00:00:49.430> brakes<00:00:49.760> so<00:00:50.059> hopefully<00:00:50.690> we'll<00:00:50.809> be

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
ate up the brakes so hopefully we'll be

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.319 
ate up the brakes so hopefully we'll be
stronger<00:00:51.260> all<00:00:51.530> around<00:00:51.890> it<00:00:52.040> everywhere<00:00:52.430> we've

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
stronger all around it everywhere we've

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.060 
stronger all around it everywhere we've
tried<00:00:53.930> some<00:00:54.079> different<00:00:54.440> things<00:00:54.559> with<00:00:54.680> setup

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
tried some different things with setup

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.130 
tried some different things with setup
it's<00:00:55.399> a<00:00:55.489> little<00:00:55.730> bit<00:00:55.850> different<00:00:56.210> than<00:00:56.329> what<00:00:56.450> we

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
it's a little bit different than what we

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.830 
it's a little bit different than what we
but<00:00:57.670> you<00:00:58.670> know<00:00:58.760> that<00:00:58.970> it's<00:00:59.270> great<00:00:59.540> to<00:00:59.690> be<00:00:59.809> back

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
but you know that it's great to be back

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.889 
but you know that it's great to be back

work<00:02:42.150> at<00:02:42.300> Roush<00:02:42.420> Fenway<00:02:42.600> in<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:42.930> training

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
work at Roush Fenway in the training

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.780 
work at Roush Fenway in the training
department<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:43.800> I<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:44.160> kind<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.430> figured<00:02:44.700> out

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
department so I I kind of figured out

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.370 
department so I I kind of figured out
what<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.060> was<00:02:45.210> we<00:02:45.450> think<00:02:45.630> it's<00:02:45.750> an<00:02:45.840> input<00:02:46.140> shaft

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
what it was we think it's an input shaft

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.830 
what it was we think it's an input shaft
that<00:02:46.560> cracked<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.490> mean<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.240> happens<00:02:48.720> it

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
that cracked and I mean it happens it

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.630 
that cracked and I mean it happens it
just<00:02:48.960> wasn't<00:02:49.260> our<00:02:49.320> day<00:02:49.530> but<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:49.980> mean<00:02:50.280> we've

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
just wasn't our day but I mean we've

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.370 
just wasn't our day but I mean we've
never<00:02:50.820> broken<00:02:51.300> one<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:51.420> those<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.990> he's

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
never broken one of those and he's

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.050 
never broken one of those and he's
driving<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.770> soft<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.280> smooth<00:02:53.520> just<00:02:53.880> trying

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
driving it soft and smooth just trying

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.670 
driving it soft and smooth just trying
to<00:02:54.120> give<00:02:54.360> me<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.510> good<00:02:54.720> car<00:02:54.930> for<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.140> finish<00:02:55.440> and

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
to give me a good car for the finish and

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.760 
to give me a good car for the finish and
a<00:02:56.100> rear<00:02:56.580> brake<00:02:56.730> rotor<00:02:57.000> cracks<00:02:57.270> also<00:02:57.540> so<00:02:58.110> this

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
a rear brake rotor cracks also so this

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.500 
a rear brake rotor cracks also so this
wasn't<00:02:59.010> our<00:02:59.220> day<00:02:59.370> wasn't<00:02:59.880> meant<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.030> be<00:03:00.090> we

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
wasn't our day wasn't meant to be we

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.970 
wasn't our day wasn't meant to be we
have<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.020> go<00:03:01.110> back<00:03:01.230> out<00:03:01.380> there<00:03:01.560> at<00:03:01.680> least<00:03:01.710> try

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
have to go back out there at least try

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.410 
have to go back out there at least try
to<00:03:02.010> get<00:03:02.160> back<00:03:02.310> out<00:03:02.490> front<00:03:02.700> laps<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.150> finish

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
to get back out front laps and finish

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.880 
to get back out front laps and finish
the<00:03:03.510> race<00:03:03.660> I<00:03:03.810> mean<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:03.990> is<00:03:04.110> a<00:03:04.140> race<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:04.650> have<00:03:04.770> to

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890

about<00:04:52.790> a<00:04:52.820> second<00:04:53.270> faster<00:04:53.450> than<00:04:53.810> the<00:04:54.020> previous

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
year tire and I think we did a really

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.940 
year tire and I think we did a really
good<00:04:56.930> job<00:04:56.990> for<00:04:57.260> the<00:04:57.350> whole<00:04:57.470> team<00:04:57.710> did<00:04:57.890> a

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
good job for the whole team did a

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.890 
good job for the whole team did a
phenomenal<00:04:58.310> job<00:04:58.669> really<00:04:59.000> nailing<00:04:59.300> the<00:04:59.540> setup

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
phenomenal job really nailing the setup

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.920 
phenomenal job really nailing the setup
to<00:05:00.500> get<00:05:00.800> us<00:05:00.919> to<00:05:01.370> be<00:05:01.460> fast<00:05:01.760> right<00:05:01.910> on<00:05:02.360> a<00:05:02.630> restart

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
to get us to be fast right on a restart

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.830 
to get us to be fast right on a restart
and<00:05:03.410> I<00:05:03.950> was<00:05:04.070> able<00:05:04.160> to<00:05:04.310> pull<00:05:04.820> away<00:05:04.850> a<00:05:05.060> decent<00:05:05.690> gap

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
and I was able to pull away a decent gap

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.010 
and I was able to pull away a decent gap
but<00:05:06.320> the<00:05:06.590> last<00:05:07.070> restart<00:05:07.430> I<00:05:08.240> think<00:05:08.780> he<00:05:08.870> was

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
but the last restart I think he was

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.690 
but the last restart I think he was
giving<00:05:09.169> whoever<00:05:09.950> was<00:05:10.040> behind<00:05:10.130> me<00:05:10.370> got<00:05:10.520> some
