I guess we've been out here for about an
hour<00:00:23.520> the<00:00:24.520> hardest<00:00:24.820> part<00:00:25.000> is<00:00:25.060> when<00:00:25.360> you<00:00:25.780> first

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
hour the hardest part is when you first

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
it gets through the grass actually it

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.210 
it gets through the grass actually it
gets<00:00:29.530> pretty<00:00:30.900> considerate<00:00:31.900> to<00:00:32.050> work<00:00:33.960> we<00:00:34.960> had

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220

whoopsie<00:00:57.629> we<00:00:58.629> had<00:00:58.809> to<00:00:58.960> level<00:00:59.199> the<00:00:59.320> ground<00:00:59.500> out

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
whoopsie we had to level the ground out

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:02.850 
whoopsie we had to level the ground out
a<00:00:59.800> little<00:00:59.920> bit<00:01:00.070> more<00:01:00.280> as<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:02.140> can<00:01:02.320> see<00:01:02.559> there

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
a little bit more as you can see there

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.040 
a little bit more as you can see there
you<00:01:03.129> know<00:01:03.610> of<00:01:03.910> course<00:01:04.059> most<00:01:04.449> of<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.690> backyards

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
you know of course most of the backyards

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.720 
you know of course most of the backyards
are<00:01:05.140> with<00:01:05.260> the<00:01:05.350> slope<00:01:05.680> and<00:01:05.980> so<00:01:06.310> you<00:01:06.400> can<00:01:06.550> see

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
are with the slope and so you can see

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.550 
are with the slope and so you can see
kind<00:01:07.060> of<00:01:07.330> where<00:01:07.840> we<00:01:07.990> kind<00:01:08.140> of<00:01:08.200> have<00:01:08.290> to<00:01:08.320> dig

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
kind of where we kind of have to dig

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.100 
kind of where we kind of have to dig
down<00:01:08.740> a<00:01:08.800> little<00:01:08.890> bit<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:10.450> level<00:01:10.810> it<00:01:10.930> and<00:01:11.050> we

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
down a little bit and level it and we

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.810 
down a little bit and level it and we
cut<00:01:11.409> some<00:01:11.530> blocks<00:01:11.800> 16<00:01:12.310> of<00:01:12.430> them<00:01:12.550> you<00:01:12.640> saw<00:01:12.760> that

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
cut some blocks 16 of them you saw that

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.130 
cut some blocks 16 of them you saw that
from<00:01:12.940> another<00:01:13.150> video<00:01:13.480> and<00:01:13.690> we're<00:01:13.840> gonna<00:01:13.960> put

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
from another video and we're gonna put

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.280 
from another video and we're gonna put
that<00:01:14.260> into<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.530> legs<00:01:15.690> and<00:01:16.690> so<00:01:16.870> just<00:01:16.900> to<00:01:17.140> kind

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
that into the legs and so just to kind

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.219 
that into the legs and so just to kind
of<00:01:17.320> show<00:01:17.380> you<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.620> slope<00:01:18.400> over<00:01:18.580> there<00:01:18.850> and<00:01:19.270> so

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
of show you the slope over there and so

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.120 
of show you the slope over there and so
we're<00:01:20.350> gonna<00:01:20.440> do<00:01:20.560> now<00:01:20.710> is<00:01:20.740> we're<00:01:20.950> probably

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
we're gonna do now is we're probably

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.969 
we're gonna do now is we're probably
going<00:01:21.310> to<00:01:21.370> space<00:01:21.760> these<00:01:22.390> boards<00:01:22.900> I<00:01:23.080> guess<00:01:23.890> I

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
going to space these boards I guess I

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.700 
going to space these boards I guess I
put<00:01:24.159> apart<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:24.700> use<00:01:25.690> a<00:01:25.720> lever<00:01:26.110> between<00:01:26.620> each

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
put apart and use a lever between each

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.020 
put apart and use a lever between each
one<00:01:26.860> and<00:01:27.040> to<00:01:27.100> make<00:01:27.250> sure<00:01:27.280> it's<00:01:27.490> level<00:01:27.730> and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
one and to make sure it's level and

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.120 
one and to make sure it's level and
we'll<00:01:28.330> just<00:01:28.480> go<00:01:28.570> with<00:01:28.720> that<00:01:28.800> we'll<00:01:29.800> see<00:01:29.920> if<00:01:30.010> it

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
we'll just go with that we'll see if it

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.300 
we'll just go with that we'll see if it
works<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:31.390> we<00:01:31.780> got<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.560> ground<00:01:32.740> this<00:01:32.980> way<00:01:33.160> with

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
works so we got the ground this way with

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.150 
works so we got the ground this way with
a<00:01:33.340> tiller<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:34.810> saw<00:01:35.560> it<00:01:35.620> on<00:01:35.740> that<00:01:35.860> other<00:01:35.950> video

just<00:01:55.490> this<00:01:55.640> is<00:01:55.700> tilted<00:01:56.180> from<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.390> wind<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:56.869> so

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
just this is tilted from the wind and so

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.380 
just this is tilted from the wind and so
now<00:01:57.890> we're<00:01:58.009> going<00:01:58.039> to<00:01:58.159> start<00:01:58.369> laying<00:01:58.610> out<00:01:58.880> and

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
now we're going to start laying out and

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.529 
now we're going to start laying out and
so<00:01:59.509> here's<00:01:59.690> all<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.899> parts<00:02:00.170> by<00:02:00.289> the<00:02:00.320> pool<00:02:00.619> and

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
so here's all the parts by the pool and

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.940 
so here's all the parts by the pool and
I'm<00:02:02.539> guessing<00:02:02.869> that's<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.049> pull<00:02:03.289> itself<00:02:03.649> the

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
I'm guessing that's the pull itself the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.100 
I'm guessing that's the pull itself the
liner<00:02:04.159> I'm<00:02:05.000> not<00:02:05.119> sure<00:02:05.240> what<00:02:05.420> that<00:02:05.630> box<00:02:05.840> is

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
liner I'm not sure what that box is

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.749 
liner I'm not sure what that box is
probably<00:02:06.560> more<00:02:06.710> posed<00:02:07.039> and<00:02:07.460> here's<00:02:07.580> some<00:02:07.729> more

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
probably more posed and here's some more

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.860 
probably more posed and here's some more
poles<00:02:08.119> right<00:02:08.239> there<00:02:08.560> that's<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.769> ladder

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:10.870 
poles right there that's the ladder

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.509 
poles right there that's the ladder
parts<00:02:11.870> of<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.080> pomp<00:02:12.349> of<00:02:12.590> course<00:02:12.860> that's<00:02:13.340> the

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
parts of the pomp of course that's the

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:19.740 
parts of the pomp of course that's the
cover<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:14.870> pump<00:02:15.140> itself<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.860> filter<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.870> so

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
cover the pump itself the filter and so

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.140 
cover the pump itself the filter and so
here's<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.870> completed<00:02:21.319> pool

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
here's the completed pool

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.540 
here's the completed pool
we<00:02:23.630> haven't<00:02:23.870> filled<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:24.140> up<00:02:24.290> yet<00:02:24.730> we<00:02:25.730> are

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
we haven't filled it up yet we are

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.310 
we haven't filled it up yet we are
starting<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.610> fill<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:28.880> up<00:02:29.200> 7:00<00:02:30.200> in<00:02:30.290> the

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
starting to fill it up 7:00 in the

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.470 
starting to fill it up 7:00 in the
morning<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:30.950> so<00:02:31.760> we'll<00:02:31.910> see<00:02:32.060> how<00:02:32.180> long<00:02:32.330> it

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
morning and so we'll see how long it

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.460 
morning and so we'll see how long it
takes<00:02:32.510> but<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:34.660> think<00:02:35.660> some<00:02:35.840> other<00:02:35.930> people<00:02:36.320> said

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
takes but I think some other people said

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.640 
takes but I think some other people said
it<00:02:36.590> takes<00:02:36.770> like<00:02:37.360> six<00:02:38.360> seven<00:02:38.630> hours<00:02:38.900> it<00:02:39.320> takes<00:02:39.530> a

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
it takes like six seven hours it takes a

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.880 
it takes like six seven hours it takes a
while<00:02:39.800> no<00:02:40.130> I'm<00:02:40.250> sorry<00:02:40.460> and<00:02:41.020> 15<00:02:42.020> hours<00:02:42.200> so

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
while no I'm sorry and 15 hours so

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.890 
while no I'm sorry and 15 hours so
anyway<00:02:43.420> but<00:02:44.860> that's<00:02:45.860> all<00:02:46.130> it<00:02:46.220> looks<00:02:46.750> as<00:02:47.750> you

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
anyway but that's all it looks as you

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.780 
anyway but that's all it looks as you
can<00:02:48.050> see<00:02:48.170> put<00:02:48.350> some<00:02:48.500> blocks<00:02:48.680> on<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.040> outside<00:02:49.490> I

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
can see put some blocks on the outside I

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.720 
can see put some blocks on the outside I
think<00:02:50.480> in<00:02:50.780> like<00:02:50.990> some<00:02:51.470> spots<00:02:51.920> might<00:02:52.370> be<00:02:52.700> a

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
think in like some spots might be a

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.699 
think in like some spots might be a
little<00:02:52.910> high<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.020> we<00:02:54.140> might<00:02:54.320> take<00:02:54.530> them

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
little high and so we might take them

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:01.170 
little high and so we might take them
down<00:02:54.890> we'll<00:02:55.220> see<00:02:55.690> but<00:02:59.290> so<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.560> pose<00:03:00.739> about

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
down we'll see but so the pose about

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.260 
down we'll see but so the pose about
half<00:03:02.180> way<00:03:02.420> full<00:03:02.750> I<00:03:02.959> guess<00:03:03.320> it's<00:03:03.470> been<00:03:03.650> on<00:03:03.739> for

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
half way full I guess it's been on for

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.340 
half way full I guess it's been on for
we<00:03:05.270> see<00:03:05.540> seven<00:03:05.989> one<00:03:06.230> two<00:03:06.410> three<00:03:06.709> four<00:03:07.010> five<00:03:07.280> six

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
we see seven one two three four five six

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:15.520 
we see seven one two three four five six
seven<00:03:09.350> hours<00:03:09.620> now<00:03:09.770> we<00:03:10.160> have<00:03:10.489> to<00:03:12.250> to<00:03:13.720> a<00:03:14.720> pretty

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
seven hours now we have to to a pretty

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.590 
seven hours now we have to to a pretty
level<00:03:15.739> you<00:03:15.950> can<00:03:16.070> see<00:03:16.100> we<00:03:16.940> took<00:03:17.120> out<00:03:17.300> some<00:03:17.570> of

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
level you can see we took out some of

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.360 
level you can see we took out some of
the<00:03:17.780> blocks<00:03:18.080> from<00:03:18.470> this<00:03:18.680> side<00:03:18.920> so<00:03:19.100> this<00:03:19.220> was

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
the blocks from this side so this was

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.220 
the blocks from this side so this was
the<00:03:19.489> highest<00:03:19.790> I<00:03:19.850> remember<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.780> gradient

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
the highest I remember the the gradient

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.110 
the highest I remember the the gradient
goes<00:03:21.350> from<00:03:22.160> this<00:03:22.310> way<00:03:22.550> this<00:03:22.700> way

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
goes from this way this way

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.580 
goes from this way this way
you<00:03:23.209> know<00:03:23.300> the<00:03:23.390> backyard<00:03:23.750> most<00:03:24.020> by<00:03:24.140> Roger<00:03:24.380> that

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
you know the backyard most by Roger that

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.390 
you know the backyard most by Roger that
way<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:24.980> so<00:03:25.640> we<00:03:25.760> first<00:03:26.450> we<00:03:26.600> had<00:03:26.780> blocks<00:03:27.140> and<00:03:27.530> so

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
way and so we first we had blocks and so

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.130 
way and so we first we had blocks and so
then<00:03:28.519> we<00:03:28.610> took<00:03:28.760> these<00:03:29.030> out<00:03:29.180> just<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.930> water

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
then we took these out just the water

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.340 
then we took these out just the water
looked<00:03:30.380> a<00:03:30.470> little<00:03:30.620> bit<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:31.880> was<00:03:32.000> sloping<00:03:32.510> that

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
looked a little bit it was sloping that

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.960 
looked a little bit it was sloping that
way<00:03:33.680> of<00:03:33.830> course<00:03:33.860> on<00:03:34.220> that<00:03:34.340> side<00:03:34.549> of<00:03:34.640> the<00:03:34.700> phone

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
way of course on that side of the phone

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.370 
way of course on that side of the phone
you<00:03:35.120> can<00:03:35.239> just<00:03:35.269> a<00:03:35.570> little<00:03:35.810> bit<00:03:35.930> and<00:03:36.019> so<00:03:36.110> we<00:03:36.140> took

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
you can just a little bit and so we took

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.039 
you can just a little bit and so we took
these<00:03:36.560> off<00:03:36.739> and<00:03:37.120> it<00:03:38.120> seems<00:03:38.330> to<00:03:38.510> have<00:03:38.630> Ward's

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
these off and it seems to have Ward's

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.750 
these off and it seems to have Ward's
just<00:03:39.230> a<00:03:39.620> little<00:03:39.860> bit<00:03:39.950> of<00:03:40.040> a<00:03:40.100> slope<00:03:40.340> it's<00:03:40.549> not

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
just a little bit of a slope it's not

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.949 
just a little bit of a slope it's not
not<00:03:41.090> too<00:03:41.299> bad<00:03:42.070> so<00:03:43.330> as<00:03:44.330> it's<00:03:44.540> filling<00:03:44.810> up<00:03:44.900> your

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
not too bad so as it's filling up your

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.060 
not too bad so as it's filling up your
you're<00:03:45.320> pushing<00:03:45.650> out<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:47.080> the<00:03:48.080> each

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
you're pushing out the the each

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.130 
you're pushing out the the each
individual<00:03:49.790> pull<00:03:50.030> there's<00:03:50.269> 16<00:03:50.660> of<00:03:50.780> them<00:03:50.900> until

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
individual pull there's 16 of them until

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.660 
individual pull there's 16 of them until
you<00:03:51.200> push<00:03:51.410> them<00:03:51.560> out<00:03:51.709> and<00:03:51.920> and<00:03:52.070> then<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.459> water

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
you push them out and and then the water

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.449 
you push them out and and then the water
although<00:03:53.570> its<00:03:53.840> own<00:03:53.959> little<00:03:54.080> thing<00:03:54.200> there<00:03:54.500> so

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
although its own little thing there so

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.340 
although its own little thing there so
far<00:03:55.970> so<00:03:56.150> good<00:03:56.330> but<00:03:56.390> you<00:03:56.510> can<00:03:56.780> see<00:03:56.989> it's<00:03:57.110> not

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
far so good but you can see it's not
