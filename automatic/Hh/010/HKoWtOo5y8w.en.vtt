00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
continue okay I guess I was just testing

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.190 
continue okay I guess I was just testing
for<00:02:47.640> super<00:02:47.910> user<00:02:48.090> access<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:48.750> test<00:02:49.020> did

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
for super user access and that test did

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.810 
for super user access and that test did
pass<00:02:49.440> because<00:02:49.680> we<00:02:49.920> granted<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.370> super<00:02:50.640> user

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
pass because we granted it super user

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.000 
pass because we granted it super user
access<00:02:51.300> now<00:02:51.480> it's<00:02:51.660> testing<00:02:52.140> just<00:02:52.800> to<00:02:52.890> make

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
access now it's testing just to make

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.340 
access now it's testing just to make
sure<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.340> our<00:02:53.460> phone<00:02:53.670> is<00:02:53.850> compatible<00:02:54.420> we'll

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
sure that our phone is compatible we'll

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:02.720 
sure that our phone is compatible we'll
let<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.560> go<00:02:55.770> ahead<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.100> test<00:03:01.520> okay<00:03:02.520> it<00:03:02.580> says

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
let it go ahead and test okay it says

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.120 
let it go ahead and test okay it says
that<00:03:02.880> we<00:03:03.000> are<00:03:03.030> compatible<00:03:03.750> so<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.470> have<00:03:05.010> two

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
that we are compatible so you have two

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.710 
that we are compatible so you have two
options<00:03:05.160> here<00:03:05.610> if<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:05.790> already<00:03:06.000> have<00:03:06.330> a<00:03:06.360> code

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
options here if you already have a code

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.720 
options here if you already have a code

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
for the application you can go ahead and

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.200 
for the application you can go ahead and
enter<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.210> now<00:03:09.510> or<00:03:09.900> you<00:03:10.050> can<00:03:10.230> skip<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.800> buy

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
so I already have the code so I'm going

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.770 
so I already have the code so I'm going
to<00:03:13.770> go<00:03:13.830> ahead<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.070> enter<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:14.250> now<00:03:14.720> okay<00:03:15.720> so
