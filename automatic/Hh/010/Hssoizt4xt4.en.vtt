 the fair also presents stands for 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.200
 environmental education based on 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.189
 recycling and reuse rather than use e 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.470
 throws 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.200
 we don't believe we have the answer in 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.420
 absolute but we think a little 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.820
 contribution was the recipe culture that 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.360
 that we want to propose re-use the 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.689
 recycling 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.670
 sure that if it was accepted by everyone e 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.680
 if anything also with the help of 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.689

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.649
 a journey that is now twenty years that 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.689
 we have undertaken it 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.570
 all this could give results 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.009
 really much more positive 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.250

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.860
 more or less a small road in fact is a 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.890
 opportunities are opportunities 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.180
