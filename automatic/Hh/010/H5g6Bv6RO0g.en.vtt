00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.810 
okay which would a lot of people you
know<00:06:08.720> kind<00:06:09.020> of<00:06:09.050> mull<00:06:09.440> over<00:06:09.470> that<00:06:09.980> that<00:06:10.430> skill

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
know kind of mull over that that skill

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.909 
know kind of mull over that that skill
but<00:06:11.000> that's<00:06:11.210> that's<00:06:11.870> a<00:06:12.050> really<00:06:12.350> important
