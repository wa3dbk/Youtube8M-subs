00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
map review and I'm assuming these are

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.630 
map review and I'm assuming these are
iron<00:00:15.660> bars<00:00:15.960> which<00:00:16.199> they<00:00:16.560> are<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.490> is

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
iron bars which they are and this is

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.890 
iron bars which they are and this is
just<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:18.060> upscaled<00:00:19.550> and<00:00:20.550> portal<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.359> couldn't

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
just a upscaled and portal I couldn't

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.929 
just a upscaled and portal I couldn't
really<00:00:22.020> have<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.650> fire<00:00:23.010> render<00:00:23.369> distance<00:00:23.490> on

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
really have the fire render distance on

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.910 
really have the fire render distance on
cause<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.269> kept<00:00:24.390> crashing<00:00:24.930> which<00:00:25.650> the

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
cause it kept crashing which the

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.529 
cause it kept crashing which the
crashing<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.400> stuff<00:00:26.670> should<00:00:26.880> be<00:00:26.910> resolved<00:00:27.269> if

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
crashing and stuff should be resolved if

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.259 
crashing and stuff should be resolved if
I<00:00:27.720> gain<00:00:27.869> your<00:00:27.990> iPad<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.500> record<00:00:29.070> with<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.490> so

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
I gain your iPad and record with that so

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.420 
I gain your iPad and record with that so
these<00:00:30.630> are<00:00:30.689> just<00:00:30.900> stone<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.949> there<00:00:32.099> will<00:00:32.279> be

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
these are just stone and there will be

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.720 
these are just stone and there will be
mossy<00:00:33.390> cobblestone<00:00:34.140> official<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.550> is

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
mossy cobblestone official and this is

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.000 
mossy cobblestone official and this is
supposed<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.420> be<00:00:36.480> larvae<00:00:36.899> which<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.380> looks

wonder<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.890> keep<00:00:46.920> crushing<00:00:47.309> because<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.360> stood

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
wonder I keep crushing because I stood

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.360 
wonder I keep crushing because I stood
all<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.809> way<00:00:48.930> over<00:00:49.110> here<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.500> by<00:00:50.010> then<00:00:50.219> that

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
all the way over here and by then that

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.729 
all the way over here and by then that
rendered<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:51.090> rental<00:00:51.930> way<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.350> end<00:00:52.530> there

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
rendered it rental way to the end there

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.799 
rendered it rental way to the end there
and<00:00:52.949> after<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.760> tried<00:00:54.000> recording<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.539> crash

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
and after I tried recording it crash

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.799 
and after I tried recording it crash
which<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.980> disappointing<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.670> still<00:00:57.149> this

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
which is disappointing that still this

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.439 
which is disappointing that still this
is<00:00:58.020> pretty<00:00:58.260> good<00:00:58.379> detailed<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.850> jacuzzi

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
there and I've don't know if this goes

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.570 
there and I've don't know if this goes
to<00:01:09.510> bed<00:01:09.689> rock<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.110> free<00:01:10.439> short<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.950> close<00:01:11.400> to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
to bed rock but I free short is close to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.630 
to bed rock but I free short is close to
bedrock<00:01:12.770> depends<00:01:13.770> with<00:01:13.950> type<00:01:14.159> 2<00:01:14.280> flat<00:01:14.460> map

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
bedrock depends with type 2 flat map

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.920 
bedrock depends with type 2 flat map
flatmap<00:01:15.150> he<00:01:15.990> used<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:18.030> yeah<00:01:18.150> that's<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.900> a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
flatmap he used so yeah that's this is a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.420 
flatmap he used so yeah that's this is a
pretty<00:01:19.170> cool<00:01:19.380> map<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.280> end

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
pretty cool map if you like the end

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.700 
pretty cool map if you like the end
portal<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.420> kind<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.840> want<00:01:22.020> one<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.680> my

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
portal and you kind of want one in my

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.249 
portal and you kind of want one in my
proposition<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.790> recommend<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.689> get<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.020> map

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
proposition I recommend you get this map

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.840 
proposition I recommend you get this map
and<00:01:25.560> it's<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.920> closest<00:01:26.250> you'll<00:01:26.400> probably<00:01:26.640> get

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
and it's the closest you'll probably get

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.910 
and it's the closest you'll probably get
even<00:01:27.210> though<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.360> doesn't<00:01:27.479> really<00:01:27.780> work<00:01:28.049> so

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
even though it doesn't really work so

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.319 
even though it doesn't really work so
obviously<00:01:29.400> it's<00:01:29.549> not<00:01:29.579> good<00:01:29.790> works<00:01:29.970> just<00:01:30.150> to

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
obviously it's not good works just to

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.390 
obviously it's not good works just to
build<00:01:32.210> Nancy<00:01:33.210> I'm<00:01:33.390> just<00:01:33.890> so<00:01:34.890> yeah<00:01:35.100> that's

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
build Nancy I'm just so yeah that's

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.390 
build Nancy I'm just so yeah that's
really<00:01:35.939> into<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.750> map<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.950> nice<00:01:38.070> little

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
really into this map it's a nice little

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.170 
really into this map it's a nice little
map<00:01:38.670> nice<00:01:38.970> map<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.960> have<00:01:40.640> so<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:42.000> does

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
map nice map to just to have so it does

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.749 
map nice map to just to have so it does
go<00:01:42.360> all<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.810> way<00:01:42.840> up<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.200> clouds<00:01:43.619> as<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.280> saw

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
go all the way up to the clouds as I saw

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.350 
go all the way up to the clouds as I saw
just<00:01:45.060> then<00:01:45.560> maybe<00:01:46.560> in<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> future<00:01:47.060> it<00:01:48.060> doesn't

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
just then maybe in the future it doesn't

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.850 
just then maybe in the future it doesn't
really<00:01:48.630> matter<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.990> much<00:01:49.110> because<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.680> don't

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
really matter that much because I don't

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.770 
really matter that much because I don't
think<00:01:49.890> you'll<00:01:50.100> fit<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.399> little<00:01:50.549> bit<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
think you'll fit in a little bit of the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.810 
think you'll fit in a little bit of the
blocks<00:01:52.049> are<00:01:52.200> like<00:01:52.500> only<00:01:52.740> one<00:01:53.130> wide<00:01:53.369> for<00:01:53.790> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
blocks are like only one wide for the
