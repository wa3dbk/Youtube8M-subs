all<00:00:00.329> right<00:00:00.539> welcome<00:00:00.780> to<00:00:00.930> my<00:00:01.230> video<00:00:02.060> tutorial

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
all right welcome to my video tutorial

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.809 
all right welcome to my video tutorial
on<00:00:03.449> how<00:00:03.510> to<00:00:03.629> make<00:00:03.810> gold<00:00:04.259> on<00:00:04.440> table<00:00:04.770> two<00:00:04.920> we

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
on how to make gold on table two we

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.960 
on how to make gold on table two we
start<00:00:06.060> off<00:00:06.150> going<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.569> blacksmith<00:00:07.970> it's

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
start off going to the blacksmith it's

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.450 
start off going to the blacksmith it's
probably<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.870> best<00:00:10.080> job<00:00:10.170> because<00:00:10.830> you<00:00:11.280> make

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
probably the best job because you make

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.339 
probably the best job because you make
money<00:00:11.820> really<00:00:12.090> quickly<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.960> gets<00:00:13.080> the

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
money really quickly it gets the

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.140 
money really quickly it gets the
multiplier<00:00:13.799> up<00:00:14.009> every<00:00:14.549> time<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:14.940> make<00:00:15.120> a

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
multiplier up every time you make a

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.849 
multiplier up every time you make a
sword<00:00:15.949> and<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:17.820> every<00:00:18.300> time<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.539> doesn't<00:00:18.930> do<00:00:19.740> it

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
sword and so every time it doesn't do it

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.130 
sword and so every time it doesn't do it
after<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.130> while<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.270> multiplier<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> big

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
after a while so the multiplier is a big

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.410 
after a while so the multiplier is a big
um<00:00:23.750> it's<00:00:24.750> very<00:00:24.840> important<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:26.189> make<00:00:26.369> gold<00:00:26.640> if

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
um it's very important to make gold if

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.790 
um it's very important to make gold if
you<00:00:27.510> have<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.660> big<00:00:27.810> enough<00:00:27.960> multiplier<00:00:28.470> it

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
you have a big enough multiplier it

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.460 
you have a big enough multiplier it
passes<00:00:29.250> by<00:00:29.400> more<00:00:29.880> quickly<00:00:30.170> so<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.260> reason

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
passes by more quickly so the reason

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.830 
passes by more quickly so the reason
this<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.679> better<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.719> level<00:00:33.719> up

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
this is better so that you level up

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.630 
this is better so that you level up
quicker<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.500> then<00:00:34.920> when<00:00:35.100> you're<00:00:35.219> level<00:00:35.430> five

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
quicker and then when you're level five

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.000 
quicker and then when you're level five
you<00:00:35.820> probably<00:00:36.120> make<00:00:36.300> about<00:00:36.540> 200<00:00:37.530> gold<00:00:40.010> every

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
you probably make about 200 gold every

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.930 
you probably make about 200 gold every
single<00:00:42.000> time<00:00:42.180> with<00:00:42.360> one<00:00:42.980> multiplier<00:00:43.980> which<00:00:44.820> is

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
single time with one multiplier which is

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.470 
single time with one multiplier which is
really<00:00:45.180> good<00:00:45.360> but<00:00:45.660> if<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.530> can<00:00:46.680> stand<00:00:47.480> like

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
really good but if you can stand like

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.260 
really good but if you can stand like
missing<00:00:49.410> over<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.829> over<00:00:50.010> again<00:00:50.129> then<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.149> is

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
missing over and over again then this is

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.209 
missing over and over again then this is
a<00:00:51.300> job<00:00:51.539> for<00:00:51.570> you

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
a job for you

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.430 
a job for you
but<00:00:53.219> any<00:00:53.579> other<00:00:53.699> job<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.090> okay<00:00:54.390> right<00:00:54.690> now<00:00:55.289> I'm

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
but any other job is okay right now I'm

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.479 
but any other job is okay right now I'm
just<00:00:55.530> showing<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:56.809> me<00:00:57.809> leveling<00:00:58.770> up<00:00:58.920> and<00:01:01.489> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
just showing you me leveling up and the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.570 
just showing you me leveling up and the
gold<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.940> I'm<00:01:03.030> collecting<00:01:03.239> which<00:01:04.199> is

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
gold that I'm collecting which is

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.890 
gold that I'm collecting which is
important<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:06.090> don't<00:01:06.180> need<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> lot<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.600> gold

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
important you don't need a lot of gold

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.320 
important you don't need a lot of gold
could<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.470> just<00:01:07.650> need<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> lot<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.010> time<00:01:08.330> not
