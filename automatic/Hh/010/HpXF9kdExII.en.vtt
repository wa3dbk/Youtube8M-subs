00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
recipes leave the peeling on because I

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.860 
recipes leave the peeling on because I
feel<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.850> adds<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.210> little<00:00:51.329> bit<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.750> the

of a potato very very easy and these
have<00:01:00.570> cooled<00:01:00.840> down<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.079> little<00:01:01.260> bit<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:01.710> they're

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
have cooled down a little bit so they're

immediately when they cool off enough

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.550 
immediately when they cool off enough
that<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.330> handle<00:01:06.570> them<00:01:06.869> out<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
that you can handle them out of the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.300 
that you can handle them out of the
microwave<00:01:08.040> just<00:01:08.790> take<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.570> Peele<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.380> much

microwave just take it and Peele of much

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.120 
microwave just take it and Peele of much
easier<00:01:11.729> than<00:01:11.850> using<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.330> potato<00:01:12.750> peeler<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.380> it

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
