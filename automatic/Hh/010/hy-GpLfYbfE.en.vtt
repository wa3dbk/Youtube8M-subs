one<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.110> switched<00:01:31.350> into<00:01:31.619> my<00:01:32.009> arm<00:01:32.189> all<00:01:32.400> does

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
one so I switched into my arm all does

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.950 
one so I switched into my arm all does
he<00:01:32.729> makes<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.000> very<00:01:33.210> good<00:01:33.299> double<00:01:33.630> switch<00:01:33.810> down

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
he makes a very good double switch down

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.380 
he makes a very good double switch down
toes<00:01:34.200> why<00:01:34.500> not<00:01:34.710> predicting<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.700> knowing

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
toes why not predicting that and knowing

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.060 
toes why not predicting that and knowing
that<00:01:36.509> he<00:01:36.780> more<00:01:36.990> likely<00:01:37.380> would<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:37.799> go<00:01:37.920> for

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
that he more likely would just go for

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.469 
that he more likely would just go for
the<00:01:38.130> Encore<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.759> just<00:01:38.939> decided<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.270> get<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.450> my

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
the Encore I just decided to get on my

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.480 
the Encore I just decided to get on my
stealth<00:01:39.750> rocks<00:01:39.960> because<00:01:40.320> he<00:01:40.799> has<00:01:40.979> no<00:01:41.189> rapid

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
stealth rocks because he has no rapid

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.100 
stealth rocks because he has no rapid
spinners<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.329> don't<00:01:42.689> really<00:01:42.780> have<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.079> worry

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
spinners so I don't really have to worry

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.319 
spinners so I don't really have to worry
about<00:01:43.320> him<00:01:43.590> spinning<00:01:44.490> away<00:01:44.549> my<00:01:44.759> hazards<00:01:45.180> and

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
about him spinning away my hazards and

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.270 
about him spinning away my hazards and
even<00:01:45.960> if<00:01:46.049> he<00:01:46.079> does<00:01:46.259> encore<00:01:46.680> me<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.040> stealth

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
even if he does encore me to the stealth

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.859 
even if he does encore me to the stealth
rocks<00:01:47.490> he<00:01:47.790> doesn't<00:01:48.149> really<00:01:48.240> have<00:01:48.360> anything<00:01:48.689> on

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
rocks he doesn't really have anything on

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.020 
rocks he doesn't really have anything on
his<00:01:48.990> team<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.799> sets<00:01:50.159> up<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.610> mean<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.939> guess

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
his team that sets up I mean I guess

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.819 
his team that sets up I mean I guess
sanghas<00:01:51.659> could<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:52.079> swords<00:01:52.500> ants<00:01:52.680> but

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
sanghas could have swords ants but

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.580 
sanghas could have swords ants but
Haunter<00:01:53.490> out<00:01:53.610> speeds<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.320> zangoose<00:01:55.320> can't

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
Haunter out speeds it and zangoose can't

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.649 
Haunter out speeds it and zangoose can't
really<00:01:55.829> do<00:01:55.950> anything<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.610> hunter<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.509> either

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
really do anything to hunter so either

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.120 
really do anything to hunter so either

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
attack zangoose was the only one real

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.540 
attack zangoose was the only one real
thing<00:02:47.480> that<00:02:47.840> I'd<00:02:47.930> spend<00:02:48.260> my<00:02:48.350> garbodor<00:02:48.950> so<00:02:49.370> he

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
thing that I'd spend my garbodor so he

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.100 
thing that I'd spend my garbodor so he
had<00:02:49.640> no<00:02:49.700> other<00:02:49.940> choice<00:02:50.030> but<00:02:50.210> to<00:02:50.480> bring<00:02:50.720> that<00:02:50.930> in

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
had no other choice but to bring that in

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.260 
had no other choice but to bring that in
because<00:02:51.860> I<00:02:51.890> could<00:02:52.220> have<00:02:52.310> got<00:02:52.700> off<00:02:52.820> damage<00:02:53.180> on

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
because I could have got off damage on

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.450 
because I could have got off damage on
whatever<00:02:53.420> else<00:02:53.660> he<00:02:53.780> brought<00:02:53.930> in<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:54.460> knowing

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
whatever else he brought in and knowing

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.950 
whatever else he brought in and knowing
that<00:02:55.490> he<00:02:55.790> would<00:02:55.910> want<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.330> leave<00:02:56.480> in<00:02:56.630> zangoose

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
that he would want to leave in zangoose

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.210 
that he would want to leave in zangoose
or<00:02:57.110> father<00:02:57.290> actually<00:02:57.560> go<00:02:57.830> straight<00:02:58.070> for<00:02:58.160> the

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
or father actually go straight for the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.490 
or father actually go straight for the
sludge<00:02:58.490> bomb<00:02:58.700> but<00:02:59.000> he<00:02:59.240> ends<00:02:59.420> up<00:02:59.510> making<00:02:59.690> a<00:03:00.050> very

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
sludge bomb but he ends up making a very

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.800 
sludge bomb but he ends up making a very
odd<00:03:00.830> switch<00:03:01.280> out<00:03:01.490> to<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.790> cacturne<00:03:02.330> I<00:03:02.510> don't

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
odd switch out to the cacturne I don't

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.800 
odd switch out to the cacturne I don't
really<00:03:03.140> know<00:03:03.410> why<00:03:03.920> I<00:03:04.460> guess<00:03:05.150> maybe<00:03:05.330> thinking<00:03:05.690> I

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
really know why I guess maybe thinking I

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.330 
really know why I guess maybe thinking I
was<00:03:05.930> a<00:03:05.960> choice<00:03:06.290> set<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:06.740> he<00:03:06.800> just<00:03:06.980> wanted<00:03:07.190> to

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
was a choice set and he just wanted to

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.440 
was a choice set and he just wanted to
scout<00:03:07.580> out<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.790> see<00:03:07.940> what<00:03:08.090> I<00:03:08.120> would<00:03:08.300> lock

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
scout out to see what I would lock

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.350 
scout out to see what I would lock
myself<00:03:08.690> into<00:03:09.080> or<00:03:09.530> just<00:03:10.190> leaving<00:03:10.460> union<00:03:11.000> for

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
myself into or just leaving union for

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.120 
myself into or just leaving union for
just<00:03:11.810> switching<00:03:12.110> it<00:03:12.200> in<00:03:12.290> for<00:03:12.410> water<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.710> have<00:03:12.890> no

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
just switching it in for water I have no

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.550 
just switching it in for water I have no
idea<00:03:13.550> but<00:03:14.120> either<00:03:14.270> way<00:03:14.450> a<00:03:14.720> Cacturne<00:03:15.080> is<00:03:15.380> out<00:03:15.530> of

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
idea but either way a Cacturne is out of

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.050 
idea but either way a Cacturne is out of
the<00:03:15.680> way<00:03:15.770> which<00:03:15.950> means<00:03:16.130> he<00:03:16.280> can<00:03:16.430> no<00:03:16.550> longer<00:03:16.820> get

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
the way which means he can no longer get

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.850 
the way which means he can no longer get
up<00:03:17.180> any<00:03:17.390> more<00:03:17.600> or<00:03:17.720> less<00:03:17.750> spikes<00:03:18.200> as<00:03:18.380> he<00:03:18.710> brings

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
up any more or less spikes as he brings

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.680 
up any more or less spikes as he brings
in<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.250> why<00:03:19.400> not<00:03:19.640> I<00:03:19.820> thought<00:03:20.300> that<00:03:20.510> he<00:03:20.600> would

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
in the why not I thought that he would

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.150 
in the why not I thought that he would
go<00:03:20.900> for<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.200> mirror<00:03:21.440> coat<00:03:21.650> which<00:03:21.860> is<00:03:21.890> why<00:03:22.100> I

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
go for the mirror coat which is why I

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.310 
go for the mirror coat which is why I
actually<00:03:22.310> subbed<00:03:22.760> up<00:03:22.970> but<00:03:23.360> no<00:03:23.510> he<00:03:23.960> saw<00:03:24.170> that

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
actually subbed up but no he saw that

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.570 
actually subbed up but no he saw that
coming<00:03:24.710> and<00:03:24.860> he<00:03:24.920> ends<00:03:25.070> up<00:03:25.130> going<00:03:25.310> for<00:03:25.520> the

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
coming and he ends up going for the

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.730 
coming and he ends up going for the
Encore<00:03:26.060> and<00:03:26.300> if<00:03:26.780> you<00:03:26.870> guys<00:03:27.050> have<00:03:27.260> not<00:03:27.380> noticed

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
Encore and if you guys have not noticed

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.430 
Encore and if you guys have not noticed
I<00:03:27.890> am<00:03:27.920> getting<00:03:28.310> predicted<00:03:28.970> like<00:03:29.360> out<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:30.290> ass

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
I am getting predicted like out the ass

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.950 
I am getting predicted like out the ass
here<00:03:30.860> like<00:03:31.130> I'm<00:03:31.370> getting<00:03:31.640> smashed<00:03:32.060> yet<00:03:32.780> I<00:03:32.810> do

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:32.960 
here like I'm getting smashed yet I do

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.080 
here like I'm getting smashed yet I do
have<00:03:33.260> a<00:03:33.290> slight<00:03:33.500> advantage<00:03:33.590> because<00:03:34.160> of<00:03:34.520> the

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
have a slight advantage because of the

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.270 
have a slight advantage because of the
hazards<00:03:35.330> i<00:03:35.720> managed<00:03:36.080> to<00:03:36.110> lay<00:03:36.440> up<00:03:36.470> so<00:03:37.100> he's

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
hazards i managed to lay up so he's

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.830 
hazards i managed to lay up so he's
going<00:03:37.430> to<00:03:37.490> switch<00:03:37.700> into<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:38.240> promo<00:03:38.630> pass

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
going to switch into the promo pass

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.970 
going to switch into the promo pass
because<00:03:39.080> i<00:03:39.200> am<00:03:39.320> locked<00:03:39.530> in<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:39.710> substitute

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
because i am locked in the substitute

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.830 
because i am locked in the substitute
i'm<00:03:40.400> just<00:03:40.580> gonna<00:03:40.730> stay<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.060> keep<00:03:41.300> stomping<00:03:41.600> up

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
i'm just gonna stay and keep stomping up

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.660 
i'm just gonna stay and keep stomping up
until<00:03:42.110> eventually<00:03:42.230> my<00:03:42.709> encore<00:03:43.190> ends<00:03:43.459> which<00:03:43.580> i

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
until eventually my encore ends which i

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.180 
until eventually my encore ends which i
believe<00:03:43.730> is<00:03:44.150> this<00:03:44.720> turn<00:03:45.080> so<00:03:45.620> thinking<00:03:45.950> that<00:03:46.100> he

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
believe is this turn so thinking that he

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.560 
believe is this turn so thinking that he
would<00:03:46.310> go<00:03:46.400> for<00:03:46.550> the<00:03:46.640> bolts<00:03:46.880> which<00:03:47.030> i<00:03:47.150> supped<00:03:47.480> up

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
would go for the bolts which i supped up

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.660 
would go for the bolts which i supped up
again<00:03:47.900> because<00:03:48.050> he<00:03:48.590> has<00:03:48.800> really<00:03:49.160> nothing<00:03:49.400> that

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
again because he has really nothing that

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.270 
again because he has really nothing that
could<00:03:50.030> take<00:03:50.240> on<00:03:50.510> my<00:03:50.750> haunter<00:03:51.260> but<00:03:51.470> no<00:03:51.650> he<00:03:52.100> makes

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
could take on my haunter but no he makes

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.740 
could take on my haunter but no he makes
a<00:03:52.370> good<00:03:52.520> play<00:03:52.700> ghosts<00:03:53.000> really<00:03:53.120> flash<00:03:53.450> cannon

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
a good play ghosts really flash cannon

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.110 
a good play ghosts really flash cannon
again<00:03:54.140> and<00:03:54.380> then<00:03:54.920> he<00:03:55.040> predicts<00:03:55.520> me<00:03:55.700> to<00:03:55.880> switch

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
again and then he predicts me to switch

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.510 
again and then he predicts me to switch
out<00:03:56.330> and<00:03:56.540> goes<00:03:56.660> for<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.080> volt<00:03:57.380> switch<00:03:57.620> all

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
out and goes for the volt switch all

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.250 
out and goes for the volt switch all

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
he wants to do because his Golic is

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.400 
he wants to do because his Golic is
basically<00:04:16.910> the<00:04:17.060> only<00:04:17.270> thing<00:04:17.630> that<00:04:17.780> he<00:04:17.870> has<00:04:18.080> for

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
basically the only thing that he has for

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.170 
basically the only thing that he has for
my<00:04:18.530> hip<00:04:18.709> know<00:04:18.890> which<00:04:19.100> means<00:04:19.310> if<00:04:19.640> i<00:04:19.790> can<00:04:19.940> get<00:04:20.030> rid

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
my hip know which means if i can get rid

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.150 
my hip know which means if i can get rid
of<00:04:20.209> this<00:04:20.390> thing

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
of this thing

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.980 
of this thing
no<00:04:21.340> can<00:04:21.550> basically<00:04:21.790> deal<00:04:22.270> with<00:04:22.480> the<00:04:22.630> rest<00:04:22.840> of

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
no can basically deal with the rest of

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.020 
no can basically deal with the rest of
his<00:04:23.110> team<00:04:23.320> by<00:04:23.500> itself<00:04:23.860> now<00:04:24.370> because<00:04:24.700> he<00:04:24.790> locked

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
his team by itself now because he locked

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.790 
his team by itself now because he locked
himself<00:04:25.150> into<00:04:25.510> the<00:04:25.660> shadow<00:04:25.870> punch<00:04:26.140> I<00:04:26.350> thought

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
himself into the shadow punch I thought

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.350 
himself into the shadow punch I thought
that<00:04:26.980> the<00:04:27.070> switch<00:04:27.280> a<00:04:27.400> vertebrate<00:04:27.850> very<00:04:28.090> was

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
that the switch a vertebrate very was

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.000 
that the switch a vertebrate very was
too<00:04:28.780> obvious<00:04:28.990> and<00:04:29.440> that<00:04:29.620> he<00:04:29.710> would<00:04:29.800> pull<00:04:29.980> a

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
too obvious and that he would pull a

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.740 
too obvious and that he would pull a
double<00:04:30.190> switch<00:04:30.490> onto<00:04:31.060> his<00:04:31.270> promo<00:04:31.540> pass

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
double switch onto his promo pass

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.410 
double switch onto his promo pass
predicting<00:04:32.440> that<00:04:32.590> but<00:04:33.250> no<00:04:33.460> he<00:04:33.790> stays<00:04:34.060> in<00:04:34.270> and

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
predicting that but no he stays in and

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.640 
predicting that but no he stays in and
go<00:04:34.480> straight<00:04:34.720> for<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:34.960> shadow<00:04:35.170> punch<00:04:35.410> again

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
go straight for the shadow punch again

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.950 
go straight for the shadow punch again

now my hip know basically deals with

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.750 
now my hip know basically deals with
this<00:04:56.260> entire<00:04:56.650> team<00:04:56.950> it's<00:04:57.190> just<00:04:57.370> a<00:04:57.460> matter<00:04:57.610> of

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
this entire team it's just a matter of

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.550 
this entire team it's just a matter of
when<00:04:58.060> i<00:04:58.300> can<00:04:58.510> get<00:04:58.630> a<00:04:58.660> free<00:04:58.810> suite<00:04:59.110> chatter<00:04:59.290> into

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
when i can get a free suite chatter into

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.650 
when i can get a free suite chatter into
it<00:04:59.710> and<00:04:59.860> if<00:05:00.040> i<00:05:00.130> can<00:05:00.310> hopefully<00:05:00.820> take<00:05:01.060> out<00:05:01.450> this

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
it and if i can hopefully take out this

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.950 
it and if i can hopefully take out this
promo<00:05:02.350> pass<00:05:02.760> so<00:05:03.760> i<00:05:04.030> decide<00:05:04.450> to<00:05:04.510> switch<00:05:04.600> into<00:05:04.780> my

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
promo pass so i decide to switch into my

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.230 
promo pass so i decide to switch into my
tangela<00:05:05.410> basically<00:05:05.920> as<00:05:06.010> death<00:05:06.280> water<00:05:06.520> but<00:05:06.820> to

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
tangela basically as death water but to

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.090 
tangela basically as death water but to
my<00:05:07.390> surprise<00:05:07.420> I<00:05:07.810> actually<00:05:08.200> end<00:05:08.440> up<00:05:08.530> living<00:05:08.860> the

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
my surprise I actually end up living the

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.130 
my surprise I actually end up living the
flash<00:05:09.370> cannon<00:05:09.730> and<00:05:10.030> I<00:05:10.390> actually<00:05:10.540> do<00:05:10.840> carry

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
flash cannon and I actually do carry

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.260 
flash cannon and I actually do carry
synthesis<00:05:11.620> on<00:05:11.770> this<00:05:11.980> tangler<00:05:12.460> so<00:05:12.850> hoping<00:05:13.060> that

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
synthesis on this tangler so hoping that

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.610 
synthesis on this tangler so hoping that
he<00:05:13.360> would<00:05:13.480> go<00:05:13.600> for<00:05:13.780> another<00:05:13.840> one<00:05:14.140> after<00:05:14.320> the

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
he would go for another one after the

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.410 
he would go for another one after the
synthesis<00:05:15.010> I<00:05:15.160> would<00:05:15.460> be<00:05:15.610> able<00:05:15.880> to<00:05:16.060> take<00:05:16.270> a

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.420 
synthesis I would be able to take a

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.020 
synthesis I would be able to take a
second<00:05:17.230> flash<00:05:17.470> cannon<00:05:17.770> because<00:05:18.220> Tangela<00:05:18.910> is

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
second flash cannon because Tangela is

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.850 
second flash cannon because Tangela is
naturally<00:05:19.480> faster<00:05:19.810> than<00:05:20.080> provo<00:05:20.440> passed<00:05:20.620> which

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
naturally faster than provo passed which

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.440 
naturally faster than provo passed which
don't<00:05:21.340> tend<00:05:21.520> to<00:05:21.580> carry<00:05:21.820> any<00:05:22.030> speed<00:05:22.210> of<00:05:22.330> ease

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
don't tend to carry any speed of ease

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.030 
don't tend to carry any speed of ease
but<00:05:22.960> he<00:05:23.050> actually<00:05:23.200> switches<00:05:23.650> into<00:05:23.800> his

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
but he actually switches into his

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.010 
but he actually switches into his
zangoose<00:05:24.430> for<00:05:24.610> fodder<00:05:24.820> I<00:05:24.970> suppose<00:05:25.390> and<00:05:25.630> at

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
zangoose for fodder I suppose and at

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.780 
zangoose for fodder I suppose and at
this<00:05:26.170> point<00:05:26.380> of<00:05:26.560> the<00:05:26.620> battle<00:05:26.950> because<00:05:27.490> I<00:05:27.520> have

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
this point of the battle because I have

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.280 
this point of the battle because I have
been<00:05:27.880> getting<00:05:28.060> predicted<00:05:28.570> so<00:05:28.810> badly<00:05:29.080> i

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
been getting predicted so badly i

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.410 
been getting predicted so badly i
actually<00:05:29.440> stayed<00:05:29.920> in<00:05:30.160> knowing<00:05:31.060> that<00:05:31.210> he<00:05:31.300> would

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
actually stayed in knowing that he would

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.240 
actually stayed in knowing that he would
either<00:05:31.570> go<00:05:31.870> for<00:05:31.900> the<00:05:32.230> hydro<00:05:32.530> pump<00:05:32.650> or<00:05:32.890> go<00:05:33.010> for

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
either go for the hydro pump or go for

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.770 
either go for the hydro pump or go for
the<00:05:33.310> rain<00:05:33.520> dance<00:05:33.730> predicting<00:05:34.300> my<00:05:34.420> switch<00:05:34.630> out

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
the rain dance predicting my switch out
