00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.319
 very good to all welcome to a 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.600
 new corner this time it's about light 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.109
 malignant and we started as usual with the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.109
 cries of war 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.140
 with what I wanted 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.670
 let's Dance 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.800
 ah 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.800
 Laughter I say the dance forgives 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.310
 in laughter sets 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.829
 we go to the spells 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.110
 let's move the character a little 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.110
 that you see him is seeing the butterfly 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.990
 q hopefully 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.490
 franz hals attacks 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.180
 another q 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:18.380
 the double over an ally 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.380
 rather 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.390
 about himself too 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.030
 so double over an enemy 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.470
 hard 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.470
 the deaf enemy 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.660
 something else 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.600
 again about me 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.600
 and again the enemy double flavor 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.920
 in what recess 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.920
 and finally the r 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.890
 We're seeing 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.160
 and until it is already screen I hope that you 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.160
