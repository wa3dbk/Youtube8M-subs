00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.230 
instead of having the little bump out
where<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:52.100> would<00:01:52.220> normally<00:01:52.250> have<00:01:52.730> a<00:01:52.760> bumper

bumper and then you have four inches of
bumper<00:01:57.260> and<00:01:57.410> then<00:01:57.530> it<00:01:57.650> would<00:01:57.740> go<00:01:57.770> down<00:01:57.920> we

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
bumper and then it would go down we

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.820 
bumper and then it would go down we
actually<00:01:59.090> have<00:01:59.210> a<00:01:59.240> flush<00:01:59.630> back<00:01:59.900> end<00:02:00.170> so<00:02:00.560> it's<00:02:00.740> a
