hey<00:00:04.890> guys<00:00:05.100> here's<00:00:05.490> another<00:00:05.730> step<00:00:06.060> for<00:00:06.299> the

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
hey guys here's another step for the

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.509 
hey guys here's another step for the
movie<00:00:06.600> poster<00:00:06.930> series<00:00:07.130> so<00:00:08.130> we've<00:00:08.250> got<00:00:08.400> the

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
movie poster series so we've got the

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.680 
movie poster series so we've got the
whole<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.760> our<00:00:08.880> building<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.330> it's<00:00:09.420> off<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.660> a

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
whole to our building and it's off to a

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.209 
whole to our building and it's off to a
pretty<00:00:09.900> good<00:00:09.990> start<00:00:10.380> but<00:00:10.650> we<00:00:10.710> need<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:11.040> take

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
pretty good start but we need to take

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.860 
pretty good start but we need to take
the<00:00:11.340> extra<00:00:11.580> steps<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.030> really<00:00:12.360> make<00:00:12.540> it<00:00:12.570> pop

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
the extra steps to really make it pop

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.550 
the extra steps to really make it pop
out<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.349> also<00:00:13.980> blend<00:00:14.759> in<00:00:15.139> basically<00:00:16.139> do<00:00:16.289> both

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
out and also blend in basically do both

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.260 
out and also blend in basically do both
at<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.740> same<00:00:16.830> time<00:00:17.010> so<00:00:17.730> there's<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.970> few<00:00:18.150> ways

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
at the same time so there's a few ways

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.790 
at the same time so there's a few ways
we<00:00:18.300> can<00:00:18.570> do<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:19.050> couple<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.560> steps

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
we can do that a couple of the steps

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.710 
we can do that a couple of the steps
will<00:00:19.980> be<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.640> same<00:00:20.820> steps<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.119> we<00:00:21.210> went<00:00:21.449> over

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
will be the same steps that we went over

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.380 
will be the same steps that we went over
for<00:00:21.949> filling<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.070> damaged<00:00:23.760> buildings<00:00:24.150> like

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
for filling in damaged buildings like

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.200 
for filling in damaged buildings like
this<00:00:24.960> one<00:00:25.640> but<00:00:26.640> we're<00:00:26.760> going<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.910> go<00:00:27.029> over

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
this one but we're going to go over

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.700 
this one but we're going to go over
those<00:00:27.300> steps<00:00:27.570> along<00:00:27.869> with<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.050> couple<00:00:28.619> of

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
those steps along with a couple of

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.650 
those steps along with a couple of
others<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.580> show<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:29.849> some<00:00:30.119> extra<00:00:30.359> things<00:00:30.599> you

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
others to show you some extra things you

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.889 
others to show you some extra things you
can<00:00:30.869> do<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.109> add<00:00:31.230> more<00:00:31.439> realism<00:00:32.690> so<00:00:33.690> first

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
can do to add more realism so first

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.000 
can do to add more realism so first
thing<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.140> want<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.380> do<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.590> we<00:00:34.710> want<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.890> get

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
thing we want to do is we want to get

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.220 
thing we want to do is we want to get
the<00:00:35.100> building<00:00:35.579> effectively<00:00:36.180> old<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.780> damaged

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
the building effectively old and damaged

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.010 
the building effectively old and damaged
and<00:00:38.149> we're<00:00:39.149> going<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.300> start<00:00:39.510> by<00:00:39.660> using<00:00:39.809> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
and we're going to start by using the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.470 
and we're going to start by using the
burn<00:00:40.170> tools<00:00:43.670> so<00:00:44.670> click<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.120> burn<00:00:45.270> tool

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
burn tools so click on the burn tool

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.000 
burn tools so click on the burn tool
make<00:00:45.809> sure<00:00:45.840> your<00:00:46.110> brush<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.530> something<00:00:46.860> that's

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
make sure your brush is something that's

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.709 
make sure your brush is something that's
going<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.250> be<00:00:47.460> kind<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.000> have<00:00:48.120> jagged<00:00:48.539> edges

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
going to be kind of have jagged edges

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.900 
going to be kind of have jagged edges
like<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:49.739> one<00:00:50.750> set<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.899> at<00:00:52.399> 30<00:00:53.399> pixels<00:00:53.789> that

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
like this one set it at 30 pixels that

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.209 
like this one set it at 30 pixels that
should<00:00:54.180> be<00:00:54.270> fine<00:00:54.480> for<00:00:54.539> an<00:00:54.809> image<00:00:54.989> like<00:00:55.140> this

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
should be fine for an image like this

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.680 
should be fine for an image like this
and<00:00:56.219> we're<00:00:57.090> going<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.270> start<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
and we're going to start with the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.770 
and we're going to start with the
exposure<00:00:57.960> level<00:00:58.289> level<00:00:58.710> at<00:00:58.829> 75<00:00:59.699> percent<00:00:59.780> and

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
exposure level level at 75 percent and

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.899 
exposure level level at 75 percent and
we're<00:01:01.530> going<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.770> go<00:01:01.949> over<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.520> areas<00:01:03.049> around

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
we're going to go over the areas around

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.520 
we're going to go over the areas around
the<00:01:05.909> destroyed<00:01:06.270> part<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.630> building<00:01:09.530> kind

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
the destroyed part of the building kind

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.520 
the destroyed part of the building kind
of<00:01:10.650> do<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.040> chaotic<00:01:11.460> fashion<00:01:12.380> make<00:01:13.380> it

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
of do it in a chaotic fashion make it

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.469 
of do it in a chaotic fashion make it
look<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.189> burnt<00:01:14.790> parts<00:01:15.210> from<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
look like it's burnt parts from the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.080 
look like it's burnt parts from the
explosion<00:01:15.960> itself<00:01:16.700> assuming<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.970> an

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
explosion itself assuming this is an

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.880 
explosion itself assuming this is an
explosion<00:01:18.600> could've<00:01:19.170> been<00:01:19.200> Godzilla<00:01:19.590> then

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
explosion could've been Godzilla then

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.060 
explosion could've been Godzilla then
there<00:01:20.040> would<00:01:20.159> be<00:01:20.189> no<00:01:20.400> burn<00:01:20.549> marks<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:24.950> also<00:01:25.950> go

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
there would be no burn marks and also go

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.050 
there would be no burn marks and also go
over<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.340> other<00:01:26.430> parts<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.880> building

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
over the other parts of the building

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.850 
over the other parts of the building
that<00:01:27.210> got<00:01:27.420> damaged<00:01:27.900> as<00:01:28.049> well<00:01:33.770> when<00:01:34.770> you're

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
that got damaged as well when you're

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.319 
that got damaged as well when you're
doing<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.220> think<00:01:35.460> about<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.759> physics<00:01:36.240> of

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
doing this think about the physics of

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.450 
doing this think about the physics of
the<00:01:36.780> explosion<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.590> more<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:38.009> think<00:01:38.310> about

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
the explosion the more you think about

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.880 
the explosion the more you think about
the<00:01:38.880> reality<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.840> what's<00:01:40.290> going<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.650> with

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
the reality of what's going on with

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.380 
the reality of what's going on with
these<00:01:40.979> buildings<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.579> more<00:01:41.759> real<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.060> will

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
these buildings the more real it will

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.039 
these buildings the more real it will
look<00:01:43.100> so<00:01:44.100> that's<00:01:44.579> looking<00:01:45.149> pretty<00:01:45.180> good<00:01:45.689> first

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
look so that's looking pretty good first

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.170 
look so that's looking pretty good first
start<00:01:46.350> let's<00:01:47.130> get<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.549> rest<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.880> building

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
start let's get the rest of the building

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.410 
start let's get the rest of the building
old<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.720> disgusting<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:50.790> we're<00:01:51.119> going<00:01:51.270> to

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
old and disgusting so we're going to

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.800 
old and disgusting so we're going to
make<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.470> brush<00:01:52.590> bigger

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
make the brush bigger

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.219 
make the brush bigger
we'll<00:01:54.810> make<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:54.990> 50<00:01:55.470> pixels<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:57.079> we'll<00:01:58.079> set

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
we'll make it 50 pixels and we'll set

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.350 
we'll make it 50 pixels and we'll set
the<00:01:58.350> exposure<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.799> 50%<00:01:59.399> so<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.729> differentiates

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
the exposure to 50% so it differentiates

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:11.730 
the exposure to 50% so it differentiates
itself<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:01.110> just<00:02:01.950> cover<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.790> whole<00:02:02.820> building

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.560 

don't<00:02:12.740> cover<00:02:12.860> everything<00:02:13.520> just<00:02:13.850> cover<00:02:14.150> enough

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
don't cover everything just cover enough

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.080 
don't cover everything just cover enough
so<00:02:14.780> it's<00:02:14.930> looking<00:02:15.200> really<00:02:15.560> nasty<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.580> jagged

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
so it's looking really nasty and jagged

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.000 
so it's looking really nasty and jagged
just<00:02:20.090> so<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.240> know<00:02:20.330> if<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.170> have<00:02:21.380> a<00:02:21.410> stylus

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
just so you know if you have a stylus

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.770 
just so you know if you have a stylus
for<00:02:22.040> this<00:02:22.340> use<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:22.970> because<00:02:23.270> I'm<00:02:23.450> right<00:02:23.630> now

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
for this use it because I'm right now

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.170 
for this use it because I'm right now
I'm<00:02:23.930> using<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.350> mouse<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:25.520> have<00:02:25.730> so<00:02:26.030> much

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
I'm using a mouse and you have so much

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.630 
I'm using a mouse and you have so much
more<00:02:26.360> control<00:02:26.780> especially<00:02:27.350> over<00:02:28.070> how<00:02:28.250> hard

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
more control especially over how hard

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.910 
more control especially over how hard
that<00:02:29.240> these<00:02:29.450> brushes<00:02:29.720> are<00:02:29.930> hitting<00:02:30.260> with<00:02:30.890> a

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
that these brushes are hitting with a

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:39.059 
that these brushes are hitting with a
stylus

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.179 

and<00:02:39.700> that's<00:02:39.819> pretty<00:02:39.939> good<00:02:40.799> so<00:02:41.799> next<00:02:41.950> thing<00:02:42.040> we

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:42.189 
and that's pretty good so next thing we

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:43.649 
and that's pretty good so next thing we
want<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.400> do<00:02:42.519> to<00:02:42.640> make<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:42.819> even<00:02:43.000> more<00:02:43.120> real<00:02:43.420> is

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
want to do to make it even more real is

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.149 
want to do to make it even more real is
we're<00:02:44.079> going<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.290> start<00:02:44.500> removing<00:02:44.590> windows

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
we're going to start removing windows

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.280 
we're going to start removing windows
the<00:02:46.150> best<00:02:46.329> way<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:46.480> do<00:02:46.689> that<00:02:46.810> is<00:02:47.019> to<00:02:47.140> actually

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
the best way to do that is to actually

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.319 
the best way to do that is to actually
take<00:02:47.650> them<00:02:47.829> out<00:02:47.920> of<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.099> picture<00:02:48.220> itself<00:02:48.640> so

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
take them out of the picture itself so

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.030 
take them out of the picture itself so
you<00:02:49.420> could<00:02:49.599> use<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.959> eraser<00:02:50.290> keys<00:02:50.500> but<00:02:50.980> I

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
you could use the eraser keys but I

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.800 
you could use the eraser keys but I
prefer<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.430> lasso<00:02:51.730> tool<00:02:51.760> because<00:02:52.659> you<00:02:52.689> can

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
prefer the lasso tool because you can

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.160 
prefer the lasso tool because you can
get<00:02:53.110> a<00:02:53.319> little<00:02:53.709> bit<00:02:53.890> more<00:02:54.010> accurate<00:02:54.220> with<00:02:54.670> it

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.170 

so<00:02:59.170> just<00:02:59.680> like<00:03:00.099> so<00:03:00.450> trace<00:03:01.450> around<00:03:01.629> the<00:03:02.110> window

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
so just like so trace around the window

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.099 
so just like so trace around the window
and<00:03:04.180> press<00:03:04.870> control<00:03:05.530> X<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:06.010> there<00:03:06.579> you<00:03:06.670> go<00:03:07.109> now

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
and press control X and there you go now

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.130 
and press control X and there you go now
because<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:09.359> damaged<00:03:10.359> whole<00:03:10.659> of<00:03:11.019> the

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
because the damaged whole of the

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.319 
because the damaged whole of the
original<00:03:11.620> building<00:03:11.950> is<00:03:12.040> still<00:03:12.250> there<00:03:12.310> it<00:03:12.909> ties

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
original building is still there it ties

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.280 
original building is still there it ties
in<00:03:13.690> very<00:03:13.840> well<00:03:14.560> with<00:03:15.299> our<00:03:16.299> current<00:03:17.109> building

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
in very well with our current building

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.170 
in very well with our current building
so<00:03:17.739> it<00:03:17.859> makes<00:03:18.040> it<00:03:18.129> look<00:03:18.190> even<00:03:18.519> more<00:03:18.670> real<00:03:18.940> and

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
so it makes it look even more real and

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.629 
so it makes it look even more real and
more<00:03:19.329> interesting<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:20.190> if<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.340> do<00:03:21.489> this

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
more interesting and if you do this

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.160 
more interesting and if you do this
enough<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:22.239> you<00:03:22.480> get<00:03:22.629> a<00:03:22.659> little<00:03:22.870> creative

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
enough and you get a little creative

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.690 
enough and you get a little creative
with<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.530> like<00:03:24.220> I'm<00:03:24.370> doing<00:03:24.400> here<00:03:26.430> you<00:03:27.430> can<00:03:27.579> make

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
with it like I'm doing here you can make

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.369 
with it like I'm doing here you can make
it<00:03:27.730> look<00:03:27.970> really<00:03:28.299> real<00:03:28.510> really<00:03:28.959> dramatic

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379 
it look really real really dramatic

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:31.890 
it look really real really dramatic
really<00:03:29.650> interesting<00:03:30.190> almost<00:03:30.970> artistic<00:03:31.269> it's

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
really interesting almost artistic it's

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.119 
really interesting almost artistic it's
almost<00:03:32.079> like<00:03:32.260> it's<00:03:32.440> a<00:03:32.530> more<00:03:32.799> of<00:03:32.859> a<00:03:32.889> painting

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
almost like it's a more of a painting

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.879 
almost like it's a more of a painting
than<00:03:33.310> a<00:03:33.340> photo<00:03:33.579> now<00:03:34.440> kind<00:03:35.440> of<00:03:35.500> reminds<00:03:35.709> me<00:03:35.799> of

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
than a photo now kind of reminds me of

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:40.619 
than a photo now kind of reminds me of
Cloverfield<00:03:37.769> by<00:03:38.769> the<00:03:38.829> way<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.790> Godzilla

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
Cloverfield by the way the Godzilla

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:41.819 
Cloverfield by the way the Godzilla
monster<00:03:40.780> can<00:03:41.109> kick<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.409> Cloverfield

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
monster can kick the Cloverfield

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:51.050 
monster can kick the Cloverfield
monster's<00:03:42.159> ass<00:03:42.400> any<00:03:43.060> day<00:03:43.299> of<00:03:43.329> the<00:03:43.419> week

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:04:03.660 

you

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.680 

okay<00:04:04.670> so<00:04:04.730> I<00:04:04.850> think<00:04:04.970> we've<00:04:05.210> broken<00:04:05.420> enough

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
okay so I think we've broken enough

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.750 
okay so I think we've broken enough
windows<00:04:06.050> now<00:04:06.830> it's<00:04:07.040> really<00:04:07.280> starting<00:04:07.580> to

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
windows now it's really starting to

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.120 
windows now it's really starting to
blend<00:04:07.970> in<00:04:08.240> now<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:08.900> next<00:04:09.230> step<00:04:09.440> is<00:04:09.590> for<00:04:09.770> us<00:04:09.890> to

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
blend in now the next step is for us to

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.070 
blend in now the next step is for us to
actually<00:04:10.310> change<00:04:10.820> the<00:04:11.030> color<00:04:11.240> balance<00:04:11.480> of<00:04:11.900> the

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
actually change the color balance of the

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.990 
actually change the color balance of the
hole<00:04:12.290> itself<00:04:12.710> since<00:04:13.130> it's<00:04:13.280> a<00:04:13.370> separate<00:04:13.730> image

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
hole itself since it's a separate image

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.970 
hole itself since it's a separate image
and<00:04:14.270> we're<00:04:14.930> going<00:04:14.960> to<00:04:15.170> do<00:04:15.290> that<00:04:15.440> by<00:04:15.620> going<00:04:15.650> to

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
and we're going to do that by going to

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.940 
and we're going to do that by going to
image<00:04:16.720> adjustments<00:04:17.770> brightness<00:04:18.770> and

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
image adjustments brightness and

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.790 
image adjustments brightness and
contrast<00:04:22.990> bring<00:04:23.990> that<00:04:24.110> down<00:04:24.320> a<00:04:24.350> little<00:04:24.590> bit

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
contrast bring that down a little bit

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.760 
contrast bring that down a little bit
bring<00:04:25.160> up<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.370> contrast<00:04:25.850> a<00:04:25.970> little<00:04:26.000> bit<00:04:29.770> and

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
bring up the contrast a little bit and

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.320 
bring up the contrast a little bit and
let's<00:04:31.100> change<00:04:31.220> the<00:04:31.340> colors<00:04:31.640> around<00:04:31.850> just<00:04:32.180> a

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
let's change the colors around just a

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:43.930 
let's change the colors around just a
little<00:04:32.510> bit<00:04:32.660> so<00:04:32.870> it<00:04:33.020> better<00:04:33.860> fits<00:04:42.760> that's<00:04:43.760> good

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
little bit so it better fits that's good

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.550 
little bit so it better fits that's good
but<00:04:44.150> it's<00:04:44.270> a<00:04:44.450> little<00:04:44.780> standing<00:04:45.230> out<00:04:45.350> a<00:04:45.380> little

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
but it's a little standing out a little

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.890 
but it's a little standing out a little
too<00:04:45.770> much<00:04:45.950> so<00:04:46.250> image<00:04:46.700> adjustments<00:04:47.510> hue<00:04:47.750> and

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
too much so image adjustments hue and

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:55.420 
too much so image adjustments hue and
saturation<00:04:53.980> there<00:04:54.980> we<00:04:55.100> go

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
saturation there we go

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.090 
saturation there we go
that's<00:04:55.700> looking<00:04:55.970> good<00:04:56.440> and<00:04:57.440> let's<00:04:57.920> add<00:04:58.070> a

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
that's looking good and let's add a

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:07.010 
that's looking good and let's add a
little<00:04:58.280> bit<00:04:58.400> of<00:04:58.580> burn<00:04:58.730> effect<00:04:58.880> to<00:04:59.180> it<00:04:59.300> as<00:04:59.390> well

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.090 

all<00:05:08.020> right<00:05:08.970> now<00:05:09.970> let's<00:05:10.120> zoom<00:05:10.330> at<00:05:10.480> on<00:05:10.570> that

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
all right now let's zoom at on that

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.050 
all right now let's zoom at on that
that's<00:05:12.100> looking<00:05:12.400> pretty<00:05:12.430> good

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
that's looking pretty good

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.690 
that's looking pretty good
the<00:05:13.480> only<00:05:13.660> problem<00:05:14.110> now<00:05:14.140> is<00:05:14.680> that<00:05:14.710> our<00:05:15.100> area<00:05:15.490> up

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
the only problem now is that our area up

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:21.330 
the only problem now is that our area up
here<00:05:17.400> doesn't<00:05:18.400> fit<00:05:18.700> in<00:05:19.590> so<00:05:20.590> use<00:05:21.010> the<00:05:21.160> same

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
here doesn't fit in so use the same

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.800 
here doesn't fit in so use the same
techniques<00:05:21.760> that<00:05:21.850> we<00:05:22.030> did<00:05:22.210> on<00:05:22.330> this<00:05:22.510> burnt

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
techniques that we did on this burnt

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.380 
techniques that we did on this burnt
hole<00:05:23.080> and<00:05:23.490> you<00:05:24.490> want<00:05:24.670> to<00:05:24.730> match<00:05:24.910> them<00:05:25.150> up<00:05:25.240> as

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
hole and you want to match them up as

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.100 
hole and you want to match them up as
best<00:05:25.570> as<00:05:25.780> you<00:05:25.810> can

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
best as you can

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.040 
best as you can
broken<00:05:27.100> windows<00:05:27.490> color<00:05:28.060> correction<00:05:28.720> using

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
broken windows color correction using

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.770 
broken windows color correction using
the<00:05:29.350> burn<00:05:29.500> tool<00:05:29.770> etc<00:05:30.430> so<00:05:31.180> just<00:05:31.360> try<00:05:31.480> that<00:05:31.630> out

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
the burn tool etc so just try that out

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.450 
the burn tool etc so just try that out
and<00:05:32.740> in<00:05:32.890> the<00:05:32.950> next<00:05:33.130> video

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
and in the next video

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.400 
and in the next video
I'm<00:05:33.640> going<00:05:34.090> to<00:05:34.180> go<00:05:34.300> over<00:05:34.330> adding<00:05:34.720> elements

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
I'm going to go over adding elements

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.190 
I'm going to go over adding elements
like<00:05:35.530> this<00:05:35.740> these<00:05:36.220> plumes<00:05:37.150> of<00:05:37.390> smoking<00:05:37.930> clouds

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
like this these plumes of smoking clouds

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.870 
like this these plumes of smoking clouds
and<00:05:38.440> I'm<00:05:38.500> going<00:05:38.650> to<00:05:38.710> show<00:05:38.920> you<00:05:38.950> how<00:05:39.250> easy<00:05:39.550> it<00:05:39.730> is

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
and I'm going to show you how easy it is

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.570 
and I'm going to show you how easy it is
to<00:05:40.810> take<00:05:41.290> these<00:05:41.500> cloud<00:05:41.770> elements<00:05:42.280> and<00:05:42.430> add

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
to take these cloud elements and add

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:52.559 
to take these cloud elements and add
them<00:05:42.790> in<00:05:42.970> with<00:05:43.600> as<00:05:43.750> few<00:05:43.990> steps<00:05:44.230> as<00:05:44.380> possible

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:52.569 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:54.629
