ever<00:05:35.940> unbox<00:05:36.940> like<00:05:37.690> we're<00:05:37.960> already<00:05:38.259> at<00:05:38.500> like

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
ever unbox like we're already at like

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.740 
ever unbox like we're already at like
five<00:05:40.680> minutes<00:05:41.680> like<00:05:42.070> 38<00:05:42.599> seconds<00:05:43.599> or

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
five minutes like 38 seconds or

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:54.320 
five minutes like 38 seconds or
something<00:05:44.220> it's<00:05:45.220> a<00:05:45.310> long<00:05:45.550> time

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:01.710 

there<00:05:55.330> we<00:05:55.510> go<00:05:57.570> Raptors<00:05:58.570> this<00:06:00.360> good<00:06:01.360> I<00:06:01.390> didn't

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
there we go Raptors this good I didn't

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.290 
there we go Raptors this good I didn't
cut<00:06:01.960> it<00:06:02.080> I'm<00:06:02.350> guessing<00:06:02.890> this<00:06:03.100> is<00:06:03.280> the<00:06:03.310> software

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
cut it I'm guessing this is the software

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.450 
cut it I'm guessing this is the software
for<00:06:04.540> the<00:06:04.570> mouse<00:06:04.780> you<00:06:05.530> had<00:06:05.650> to<00:06:05.830> program<00:06:06.100> those

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
for the mouse you had to program those

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.610 
for the mouse you had to program those
buttons<00:06:08.010> HP<00:06:09.270> reason<00:06:10.270> why<00:06:10.360> I<00:06:10.450> got<00:06:10.630> HP<00:06:11.140> mouse<00:06:11.380> is

buttons HP reason why I got HP mouse is

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.950 
buttons HP reason why I got HP mouse is
so<00:06:11.860> that<00:06:12.040> it<00:06:12.160> goes<00:06:12.370> with<00:06:12.640> the<00:06:12.670> whole<00:06:12.820> HP<00:06:13.690> theme

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
so that it goes with the whole HP theme

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.300 
so that it goes with the whole HP theme
since<00:06:14.410> I've<00:06:15.270> HP<00:06:16.270> computer<00:06:17.040> so<00:06:18.040> this<00:06:18.280> is

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
since I've HP computer so this is

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.070 
since I've HP computer so this is
actually<00:06:18.670> a<00:06:20.040> really<00:06:21.040> comfortable<00:06:22.080> mouse-like

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
actually a really comfortable mouse-like

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.850 
actually a really comfortable mouse-like
as<00:06:24.040> you<00:06:24.670> can<00:06:24.820> see<00:06:25.030> that<00:06:25.290> pretty<00:06:26.290> sure<00:06:26.560> this<00:06:26.710> is

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
as you can see that pretty sure this is

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.410 
as you can see that pretty sure this is
what<00:06:27.010> you<00:06:27.070> call<00:06:27.310> but<00:06:27.550> I<00:06:27.730> think<00:06:28.030> it<00:06:28.120> has<00:06:28.240> an

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:28.420 
what you call but I think it has an

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.110 
what you call but I think it has an
ergonomic<00:06:28.690> design<00:06:29.350> yeah<00:06:29.980> I<00:06:30.370> believe<00:06:30.640> that's

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
ergonomic design yeah I believe that's

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.580 
ergonomic design yeah I believe that's
what<00:06:31.510> you<00:06:31.630> call<00:06:31.870> it<00:06:31.900> um<00:06:33.300> so<00:06:34.300> there's<00:06:35.230> just<00:06:35.440> all

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.050 
actually really comfy as you can see
this<00:06:49.810> is<00:06:50.080> um<00:06:50.260> like<00:06:50.560> the<00:06:51.070> size<00:06:51.310> of<00:06:51.400> my<00:06:51.460> hand<00:06:51.730> and

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
this is um like the size of my hand and

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.070 
this is um like the size of my hand and
that's<00:06:52.860> what<00:06:53.860> it<00:06:53.950> looks<00:06:54.130> like<00:06:54.310> I<00:06:55.080> actually

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 
that's what it looks like I actually

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.230 
that's what it looks like I actually
have<00:06:56.320> a<00:06:56.350> ruler<00:06:56.860> ready<00:06:57.310> so<00:06:57.700> why<00:06:57.940> don't<00:06:58.120> I<00:06:58.210> just

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 
have a ruler ready so why don't I just

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.430 
have a ruler ready so why don't I just
quickly<00:06:58.570> measure<00:06:58.930> it<00:06:59.140> it's<00:07:00.100> about<00:07:01.050> four<00:07:02.050> inch

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.440 
quickly measure it it's about four inch

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.850 
quickly measure it it's about four inch
so<00:07:03.340> the<00:07:03.490> most<00:07:03.730> is<00:07:03.970> about<00:07:04.210> four<00:07:04.480> inches<00:07:04.860> long

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860 
so the most is about four inches long

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:12.330 
so the most is about four inches long
and<00:07:06.100> the<00:07:06.910> boat<00:07:09.510> two<00:07:10.510> and<00:07:10.930> a<00:07:11.260> half<00:07:11.290> inches<00:07:11.770> wide

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:12.340 
and the boat two and a half inches wide

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.330 
and the boat two and a half inches wide
so<00:07:13.330> that's<00:07:13.540> pretty<00:07:13.810> good<00:07:14.050> um<00:07:14.290> I<00:07:15.010> actually
