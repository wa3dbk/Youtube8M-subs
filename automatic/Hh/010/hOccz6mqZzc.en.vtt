00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
you cut those slats off right there and

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.100 
you cut those slats off right there and
get<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.489> fixed<00:00:44.879> up<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.390> then<00:00:45.870> you're<00:00:46.020> going

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
get that fixed up and then you're going

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.290 
get that fixed up and then you're going
to<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> metal<00:00:46.739> bracket<00:00:47.309> right<00:00:48.000> through

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
to have a metal bracket right through

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.880 
to have a metal bracket right through
here<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.899> what<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.230> want<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.500> do<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.770> you're

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
going to want to solve the metal

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.720 
going to want to solve the metal
brackets<00:00:51.510> off<00:00:51.660> on<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.899> side<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.920> then<00:00:53.579> you're

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
brackets off on the side and then you're

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.450 
brackets off on the side and then you're
going<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.879> want<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.210> somehow<00:00:54.600> makeshift<00:00:55.460> not

ashtray in order to take it out which is
simply<00:01:03.329> pull<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.690> ashtray<00:01:03.870> out<00:01:04.140> there's<00:01:04.979> a

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
simply pull this ashtray out there's a

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.910 
simply pull this ashtray out there's a
little<00:01:05.309> tab<00:01:05.549> right<00:01:05.880> here<00:01:05.909> push<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.720> down<00:01:06.960> in

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
little tab right here push it down in

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.160 
little tab right here push it down in
the<00:01:08.040> ashtray<00:01:08.220> fully<00:01:08.790> comes<00:01:09.119> out<00:01:09.360> underneath

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
the ashtray fully comes out underneath

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.719 
the ashtray fully comes out underneath
there<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.680> bolt<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.280> believe<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:11.640> like

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
there is a bolt and I believe it's like

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.880 
there is a bolt and I believe it's like
a<00:01:11.780> 9/16<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.260> unscrew<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.710> and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
a 9/16 and you just unscrew that and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.890 
a 9/16 and you just unscrew that and
then<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.369> original<00:01:14.970> radio<00:01:15.210> will<00:01:15.420> come<00:01:15.600> out

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
then the original radio will come out

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.170 
then the original radio will come out
along<00:01:16.710> with<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.950> same<00:01:17.369> back<00:01:17.759> bracket<00:01:20.030> back<00:01:21.030> in

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
along with the same back bracket back in

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.590 
along with the same back bracket back in
there<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:22.250> also<00:01:23.250> there's<00:01:23.460> no<00:01:23.549> live<00:01:23.970> or<00:01:24.540> a

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
there and also there's no live or a

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.289 
there and also there's no live or a
constant<00:01:25.170> wire<00:01:25.439> in<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.310> car<00:01:26.610> going<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
constant wire in this car going to the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.580 
constant wire in this car going to the
radio<00:01:27.420> because<00:01:27.689> there<00:01:27.869> was<00:01:27.960> no<00:01:28.110> need<00:01:28.320> to

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
radio because there was no need to

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.950 
radio because there was no need to
but<00:01:29.340> mug<00:01:29.610> since<00:01:30.030> pretty<00:01:30.570> much<00:01:30.780> all

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
but mug since pretty much all

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.080 
but mug since pretty much all
aftermarket<00:01:31.770> serials<00:01:32.130> have<00:01:32.280> clocks<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:32.970> them

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
aftermarket serials have clocks on them

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.030 
aftermarket serials have clocks on them
you're<00:01:33.270> gonna<00:01:33.360> need<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.630> constant<00:01:34.110> wire<00:01:34.290> my

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
you're gonna need a constant wire my

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.850 
you're gonna need a constant wire my
clock<00:01:35.369> up<00:01:35.579> here<00:01:35.610> did<00:01:36.299> not<00:01:36.509> work<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.470> but

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
clock up here did not work and so but

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.289 
clock up here did not work and so but
the<00:01:37.979> line<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.520> wire<00:01:38.700> was<00:01:38.939> still<00:01:39.119> had<00:01:39.270> a

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
the line but the wire was still had a

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.060 
the line but the wire was still had a
constant<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.200> simply<00:01:40.470> just<00:01:40.799> clipped

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
constant on it so I simply just clipped

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.240 
constant on it so I simply just clipped
that<00:01:41.250> wire<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.909> ran<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.930> down<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.259> here<00:01:43.560> this

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
that wire and ran it down to here this

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.120 
that wire and ran it down to here this

radio<00:02:00.180> connector<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.780> don't<00:02:01.110> think<00:02:01.350> if<00:02:01.590> you

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
radio connector I don't think if you

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.090 
radio connector I don't think if you
have<00:02:02.009> an<00:02:02.100> 83<00:02:02.460> you're<00:02:02.579> going<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.759> need<00:02:02.969> one<00:02:03.210> and

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
have an 83 you're going to need one and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.800 
have an 83 you're going to need one and
just<00:02:05.100> connect<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.490> live<00:02:05.670> wire<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.630> live

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
just connect the live wire to the live

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.389 
just connect the live wire to the live
wire<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.530> thing<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.160> then<00:02:08.280> everything

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
wire on the thing and then everything

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.050 
wire on the thing and then everything
else<00:02:08.700> simply<00:02:09.119> goes<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.720> place<00:02:10.129> I<00:02:11.129> also

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
else simply goes in this place I also

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.130 
else simply goes in this place I also
thought<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.360> might<00:02:12.540> have<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.750> replace<00:02:12.989> the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140
