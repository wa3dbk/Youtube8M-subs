00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
and then at the end of the chapter I was

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.960 
and then at the end of the chapter I was
just<00:03:04.830> like<00:03:05.570> who<00:03:06.570> who<00:03:07.020> is<00:03:07.380> that<00:03:07.920> cuz<00:03:08.580> at<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.850> end

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
we get the shadowy figure and he's like

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.400 
we get the shadowy figure and he's like
oh<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.100> just<00:03:11.610> I<00:03:11.820> must<00:03:12.330> overslept<00:03:12.840> where's<00:03:13.170> punk

oh I just I must overslept where's punk
hazard<00:03:13.620> again<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.720> way<00:03:16.140> it<00:03:16.290> was<00:03:16.380> thus

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
hazard again and the the way it was thus

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.080 
hazard again and the the way it was thus
brought<00:03:16.890> you<00:03:17.160> know<00:03:17.280> drawn<00:03:17.610> and<00:03:17.820> whatnot

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
who that is at all it's just like barely

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.640 
who that is at all it's just like barely
any<00:03:23.250> shape<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.000> just<00:03:24.810> like<00:03:24.930> barely

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
any shape to it just like barely

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.010 
any shape to it just like barely
anything<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.160> can't<00:03:26.400> tell<00:03:26.580> who<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.760> is<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.180> I

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
anything you can't tell who it is and I

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.440 
anything you can't tell who it is and I
don't<00:03:28.200> have<00:03:28.710> much<00:03:28.920> guesses<00:03:29.370> I<00:03:29.490> think<00:03:29.760> if<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.420> had

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
don't have much guesses I think if I had

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.510 
don't have much guesses I think if I had
to<00:03:30.720> throw<00:03:30.870> out<00:03:30.960> a<00:03:31.080> guest<00:03:31.230> there<00:03:31.440> maybe<00:03:31.860> title

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
to throw out a guest there maybe title

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.880 
to throw out a guest there maybe title
maybe<00:03:33.300> just<00:03:33.750> just<00:03:34.200> throwing<00:03:34.560> that<00:03:34.620> out<00:03:34.740> there

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
maybe just just throwing that out there

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.940 
maybe just just throwing that out there
could<00:03:35.280> be<00:03:35.310> Kato<00:03:35.640> it<00:03:36.270> has<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:36.660> be<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:37.080> non<00:03:37.560> double

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
could be Kato it has to be a non double

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.190 
could be Kato it has to be a non double
users<00:03:38.460> because<00:03:38.700> he's<00:03:38.820> just<00:03:39.000> chillin<00:03:39.990> in<00:03:40.080> the

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
users because he's just chillin in the

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.470 
users because he's just chillin in the
ocean<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:41.100> whoever<00:03:41.340> it<00:03:41.580> is<00:03:41.670> it's<00:03:42.090> just<00:03:42.180> like

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
ocean so whoever it is it's just like

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.090 
ocean so whoever it is it's just like
chillin<00:03:42.810> in<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:42.960> ocean<00:03:43.320> it<00:03:43.440> also<00:03:43.740> looked<00:03:43.950> like

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
chillin in the ocean it also looked like

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.610 
chillin in the ocean it also looked like
maybe<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.150> person<00:03:45.360> had<00:03:45.780> wings<00:03:46.110> or<00:03:46.470> something

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
maybe the person had wings or something

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.420 
maybe the person had wings or something
like<00:03:47.460> cuz<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:48.210> little<00:03:48.450> drawing<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.990> see<00:03:49.110> like

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
like cuz the little drawing to see like

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.670 
like cuz the little drawing to see like
sort<00:03:50.430> of<00:03:50.550> shape<00:03:50.820> so<00:03:51.390> whoever<00:03:51.660> it<00:03:51.930> is<00:03:52.020> they're

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
sort of shape so whoever it is they're

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.160 
sort of shape so whoever it is they're
just<00:03:52.920> like<00:03:53.010> floating<00:03:53.280> in<00:03:53.460> the<00:03:53.550> ocean<00:03:53.580> and

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
just like floating in the ocean and

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.300 
just like floating in the ocean and
there's<00:03:55.170> a<00:03:55.290> big<00:03:55.440> possibility<00:03:55.590> they<00:03:56.100> don't

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
there's a big possibility they don't

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.920 
there's a big possibility they don't
have<00:03:56.490> a<00:03:56.520> devil<00:03:56.850> fruit<00:03:57.000> power<00:03:57.210> I<00:03:57.360> want<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:57.780> say

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
have a devil fruit power I want to say

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.990 
have a devil fruit power I want to say
that<00:03:58.140> and<00:03:58.320> just<00:03:58.830> overall<00:03:59.010> that<00:03:59.580> was<00:03:59.730> just<00:03:59.910> like

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
that and just overall that was just like

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.220 
that and just overall that was just like
a<00:04:00.030> throw<00:04:00.270> me<00:04:00.390> for<00:04:00.540> a<00:04:00.600> loop<00:04:00.630> because<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:01.110> know

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
a throw me for a loop because you know

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.230 
a throw me for a loop because you know
the<00:04:01.380> big<00:04:01.620> surprise<00:04:01.800> i<00:04:02.160> was<00:04:02.280> expecting<00:04:02.610> is<00:04:02.910> go

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
the big surprise i was expecting is go

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.850 
the big surprise i was expecting is go
for<00:04:03.420> legal<00:04:03.750> not<00:04:03.900> another<00:04:04.200> different<00:04:04.530> person

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
for legal not another different person

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.740 
for legal not another different person
so<00:04:05.340> if<00:04:05.610> you<00:04:05.700> have<00:04:05.850> a<00:04:05.880> guess<00:04:06.120> out<00:04:06.330> there<00:04:06.570> your

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
so if you have a guess out there your

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.690 
so if you have a guess out there your
guess<00:04:06.930> is<00:04:06.960> as<00:04:07.110> good<00:04:07.260> as<00:04:07.410> mine<00:04:07.530> cuz<00:04:08.160> i<00:04:08.310> can't

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
guess is as good as mine cuz i can't

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.860 
guess is as good as mine cuz i can't
really<00:04:08.880> think<00:04:09.000> of<00:04:09.090> anybody<00:04:09.330> that<00:04:09.540> would<00:04:09.690> be

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
really think of anybody that would be

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.600 
really think of anybody that would be
approaching<00:04:10.320> punk<00:04:10.800> hazard<00:04:11.040> that<00:04:11.250> is<00:04:11.430> just

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
approaching punk hazard that is just

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.090 
approaching punk hazard that is just
floating<00:04:11.850> on<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.120> ocean<00:04:12.240> they<00:04:13.200> have<00:04:13.620> no<00:04:13.830> grasp

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
floating on the ocean they have no grasp

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.180 
floating on the ocean they have no grasp
of<00:04:14.370> time<00:04:14.640> uh<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:16.290> only<00:04:16.320> person<00:04:16.799> that<00:04:16.950> kind<00:04:17.130> of

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
of time uh the only person that kind of

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.920 
of time uh the only person that kind of
fits<00:04:17.430> that<00:04:17.670> description<00:04:17.700> in<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.450> way<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:18.870> i

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
fits that description in a way and i

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.840 
fits that description in a way and i
highly<00:04:19.140> doubt<00:04:19.500> he's<00:04:19.710> headed<00:04:19.980> to<00:04:20.370> punk<00:04:20.609> hazard

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
highly doubt he's headed to punk hazard

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.600 
highly doubt he's headed to punk hazard
would<00:04:21.540> probably<00:04:22.200> be<00:04:22.320> out<00:04:22.530> kg<00:04:22.890> can<00:04:23.220> just<00:04:23.490> cause

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
would probably be out kg can just cause

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.290 
would probably be out kg can just cause
he's<00:04:23.760> so<00:04:23.910> lazy<00:04:24.210> and<00:04:24.840> maybe

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
he's so lazy and maybe

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.580 
he's so lazy and maybe
just<00:04:25.419> like<00:04:25.509> put<00:04:25.720> a<00:04:25.750> trail<00:04:26.050> of<00:04:26.080> ice<00:04:26.349> or

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
just like put a trail of ice or

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.409 
just like put a trail of ice or
something<00:04:26.710> and<00:04:27.250> he<00:04:27.310> says<00:04:27.580> i<00:04:27.729> owe<00:04:27.759> you<00:04:27.909> know<00:04:28.240> cuz

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
something and he says i owe you know cuz

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.149 
something and he says i owe you know cuz
never<00:04:28.599> he's<00:04:28.810> been<00:04:29.139> like<00:04:29.379> known<00:04:29.650> to<00:04:29.830> be<00:04:29.919> like

00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:30.159 
never he's been like known to be like

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:32.610 
never he's been like known to be like
kind<00:04:30.430> of<00:04:30.490> lazy<00:04:30.699> or<00:04:30.940> whatnot<00:04:31.090> so<00:04:31.449> maybe<00:04:32.050> I'll<00:04:32.289> TG

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
kind of lazy or whatnot so maybe I'll TG

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.890 
kind of lazy or whatnot so maybe I'll TG
