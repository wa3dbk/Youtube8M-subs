our welcome to episode number three from

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.240 
our welcome to episode number three from
Chapter<00:00:16.840> five<00:00:17.080> and<00:00:17.410> in<00:00:17.500> this<00:00:17.619> episode<00:00:18.130> we're

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
Chapter five and in this episode we're

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.769 
Chapter five and in this episode we're
going<00:00:18.369> to<00:00:18.430> start<00:00:18.759> to<00:00:18.910> learn<00:00:19.090> about<00:00:19.119> some<00:00:19.750> of

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
going to start to learn about some of

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.010 
going to start to learn about some of
the<00:00:19.960> things<00:00:20.230> that<00:00:20.590> put<00:00:21.220> limits<00:00:21.730> on<00:00:21.970> growth<00:00:22.600> and

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.020 
the things that put limits on growth and

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.269 
the things that put limits on growth and
we're<00:00:23.350> talking<00:00:23.470> about<00:00:23.619> the<00:00:23.770> growth<00:00:24.039> of

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
we're talking about the growth of

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.880 
we're talking about the growth of
population<00:00:24.460> now<00:00:25.240> these<00:00:25.869> things<00:00:26.260> that<00:00:26.470> limit

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
population now these things that limit

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.029 
population now these things that limit
growth<00:00:27.340> they're<00:00:28.119> called<00:00:28.449> limiting<00:00:29.260> factors

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
growth they're called limiting factors

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.580 
growth they're called limiting factors
so<00:00:30.430> make<00:00:30.609> sure<00:00:30.640> you<00:00:30.820> make<00:00:30.970> a<00:00:31.000> note<00:00:31.119> of<00:00:31.449> this

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
so make sure you make a note of this

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.650 
so make sure you make a note of this
limiting<00:00:32.590> factors<00:00:33.070> cause<00:00:33.550> the<00:00:33.970> population

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
limiting factors cause the population

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.470 
limiting factors cause the population
growth<00:00:34.989> to<00:00:35.260> decrease<00:00:35.860> or<00:00:36.100> at<00:00:36.790> a<00:00:36.850> minimum<00:00:37.239> to

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
growth to decrease or at a minimum to

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.670 
growth to decrease or at a minimum to
slow<00:00:37.809> down<00:00:38.050> that<00:00:38.320> they<00:00:38.530> limit<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:41.350> size

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
slow down that they limit the the size

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.709 
slow down that they limit the the size
of<00:00:41.980> the<00:00:42.070> population<00:00:42.700> now<00:00:42.880> limiting<00:00:43.329> factors

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719 
of the population now limiting factors

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.139 
of the population now limiting factors
come<00:00:43.930> in<00:00:44.050> two<00:00:44.260> flavors<00:00:44.670> number<00:00:45.670> one<00:00:45.910> is<00:00:46.090> called

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
come in two flavors number one is called

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.400 
come in two flavors number one is called
density<00:00:46.899> dependent<00:00:47.829> factors<00:00:48.700> alright<00:00:49.410> DDF

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
density dependent factors alright DDF

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.040 
density dependent factors alright DDF
for<00:00:50.800> short<00:00:51.070> these<00:00:51.670> occur<00:00:52.120> when<00:00:52.480> a<00:00:52.510> population

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
for short these occur when a population

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.500 
for short these occur when a population
reaches<00:00:53.559> a<00:00:53.710> certain<00:00:53.920> size<00:00:54.370> in<00:00:55.030> other<00:00:55.270> words

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
reaches a certain size in other words

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.500 
reaches a certain size in other words
they<00:00:55.600> become<00:00:55.750> large<00:00:56.440> and<00:00:57.039> dense<00:00:57.670> and<00:00:58.360> we're

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
they become large and dense and we're

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.819 
they become large and dense and we're
going<00:00:58.629> to<00:00:58.660> go<00:00:58.750> through<00:00:58.960> a<00:00:58.989> list<00:00:59.289> of<00:00:59.469> what<00:00:59.620> those

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
going to go through a list of what those

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.910 
going to go through a list of what those
are<00:01:00.129> in<00:01:00.370> just<00:01:00.430> a<00:01:01.149> moment<00:01:01.570> okay<00:01:02.050> some<00:01:02.530> some<00:01:02.829> of

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
are in just a moment okay some some of

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.350 
are in just a moment okay some some of
these<00:01:03.010> different<00:01:03.579> types<00:01:03.699> of<00:01:03.969> density

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
these different types of density

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.480 
these different types of density
dependent<00:01:04.839> factors<00:01:05.199> okay<00:01:05.500> density

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
dependent factors okay density

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.410 
dependent factors okay density
independent<00:01:07.270> factors<00:01:07.690> di<00:01:08.500> F<00:01:08.950> for<00:01:09.280> short<00:01:09.640> these

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
independent factors di F for short these

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.140 
independent factors di F for short these
affect<00:01:10.930> all<00:01:11.220> population<00:01:12.220> regardless<00:01:12.820> of<00:01:12.970> size

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
affect all population regardless of size

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.000 
affect all population regardless of size
and<00:01:13.540> typically<00:01:14.229> these<00:01:14.409> would<00:01:14.650> be<00:01:14.799> like

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
and typically these would be like

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.859 
and typically these would be like
natural<00:01:15.790> disasters<00:01:15.820> and<00:01:16.540> we're<00:01:16.689> going<00:01:16.810> to

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
natural disasters and we're going to

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.899 
natural disasters and we're going to
have<00:01:16.990> another<00:01:17.229> screencast<00:01:17.680> that<00:01:18.189> tells<00:01:18.790> you

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
have another screencast that tells you

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.969 
have another screencast that tells you
the<00:01:19.060> details<00:01:19.479> about<00:01:20.110> density<00:01:20.409> independent

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
the details about density independent

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.249 
the details about density independent
factors<00:01:21.369> but<00:01:22.240> this<00:01:22.390> episode<00:01:22.900> is<00:01:23.020> going<00:01:23.110> to<00:01:23.170> be

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
factors but this episode is going to be

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.530 
factors but this episode is going to be
on<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.590> density<00:01:23.799> dependent<00:01:24.640> factors<00:01:25.030> so

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
on the density dependent factors so

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.179 
on the density dependent factors so
let's<00:01:25.720> start<00:01:26.049> learning<00:01:26.409> about<00:01:26.500> some<00:01:26.950> of<00:01:27.070> those

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
let's start learning about some of those

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.330 
let's start learning about some of those
okay<00:01:27.850> one<00:01:28.600> of<00:01:28.630> those<00:01:28.990> density<00:01:29.740> dependent

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
okay one of those density dependent

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.399 
okay one of those density dependent
factors<00:01:30.759> is<00:01:30.939> called<00:01:31.479> competition<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.320> we

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
factors is called competition and we

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.380 
factors is called competition and we
learned<00:01:32.619> about<00:01:32.710> this<00:01:33.009> back<00:01:33.310> in<00:01:33.340> chapter<00:01:33.939> 4

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
learned about this back in chapter 4

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.800 
learned about this back in chapter 4
actually<00:01:35.170> yeah<00:01:35.950> chapter<00:01:36.369> 4<00:01:36.579> and<00:01:37.450> one<00:01:37.600> of<00:01:37.720> our

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
actually yeah chapter 4 and one of our

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.690 
actually yeah chapter 4 and one of our
screencasts<00:01:38.470> on<00:01:38.560> that<00:01:38.740> chapter<00:01:38.979> where

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
screencasts on that chapter where

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.270 
screencasts on that chapter where
competition<00:01:40.329> comes<00:01:40.930> into<00:01:41.259> play<00:01:41.590> when

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
competition comes into play when

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.510 
competition comes into play when
resources<00:01:43.030> are<00:01:43.210> limited<00:01:43.869> now<00:01:44.770> I<00:01:44.799> do<00:01:45.070> want<00:01:45.369> to

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
resources are limited now I do want to

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.440 
resources are limited now I do want to
route<00:01:45.700> you<00:01:45.970> remember<00:01:46.450> that<00:01:47.079> this<00:01:47.320> is<00:01:47.500> a<00:01:47.740> major

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
route you remember that this is a major

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.080 
route you remember that this is a major
evolutionary<00:01:49.450> force<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:51.250> is<00:01:51.460> part<00:01:51.790> of<00:01:51.880> the

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
evolutionary force this is part of the

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.109 
evolutionary force this is part of the
struggle<00:01:52.750> to<00:01:53.020> survive<00:01:53.610> survival<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.759> fittest

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
struggle to survive survival the fittest

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.149 
struggle to survive survival the fittest
there's<00:01:55.540> not<00:01:55.899> enough<00:01:56.200> resources<00:01:56.649> to<00:01:56.920> go

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
there's not enough resources to go

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.859 
there's not enough resources to go
around<00:01:57.549> so<00:01:58.180> those<00:01:58.420> were<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:58.720> best

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
around so those were the best

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.469 
around so those were the best
adaptations<00:01:59.710> they<00:02:00.340> get<00:02:00.579> to<00:02:00.700> have<00:02:00.909> them<00:02:01.270> and

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
adaptations they get to have them and

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:02.910 
adaptations they get to have them and
that<00:02:01.960> leads<00:02:02.229> to<00:02:02.350> something<00:02:02.560> we<00:02:02.740> learn<00:02:02.890> about

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
that leads to something we learn about

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.830 
that leads to something we learn about
chapter<00:02:03.340> 4<00:02:03.700> called<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.240> competitive

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
chapter 4 called the competitive

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.130 
chapter 4 called the competitive

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
competitive exclusion principle says no

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.830 
competitive exclusion principle says no
two<00:02:10.269> species<00:02:10.959> can<00:02:11.829> occupy<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.610> same<00:02:13.060> niche<00:02:13.120> in

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
two species can occupy the same niche in

two species can occupy the same niche in
other<00:02:14.049> words<00:02:14.290> only<00:02:15.280> one<00:02:16.030> type<00:02:16.900> of<00:02:17.080> species

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
the lower two-thirds so this would be

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.010 
the lower two-thirds so this would be
the<00:03:05.020> area<00:03:05.320> of<00:03:05.380> competition<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.870> based<00:03:07.870> on

so<00:03:16.420> for<00:03:17.080> balonus<00:03:17.620> it's<00:03:18.040> fundamental<00:03:18.730> and

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
so for balonus it's fundamental and

this predator-prey relationship that you
see<00:03:49.750> right<00:03:49.930> here<00:03:50.190> okay<00:03:51.190> now<00:03:51.490> as<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:52.240> amount<00:03:52.570> of

see right here okay now as the amount of

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.880 
see right here okay now as the amount of
prey<00:03:53.080> increases<00:03:54.900> eventually<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.350> predator

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
prey increases eventually the predator

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.670 
prey increases eventually the predator
will<00:03:57.100> increase<00:03:57.640> why<00:03:58.209> is<00:03:58.270> that<00:03:58.530> well<00:03:59.530> it's

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
will increase why is that well it's

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.620 
will increase why is that well it's
because<00:03:59.709> there's<00:04:00.310> more<00:04:00.580> food<00:04:00.880> so<00:04:01.300> more

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
because there's more food so more

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.620 
because there's more food so more
predators<00:04:02.290> more<00:04:03.130> prey<00:04:03.520> now<00:04:03.880> what<00:04:04.270> happens

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
predators more prey now what happens

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.080 
predators more prey now what happens
when<00:04:04.840> you<00:04:04.930> have<00:04:05.110> more<00:04:05.500> predators<00:04:06.250> you're

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
when you have more predators you're

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.910 
when you have more predators you're
going<00:04:07.240> to<00:04:07.300> have<00:04:07.450> less<00:04:07.690> prey<00:04:08.110> because<00:04:08.560> more<00:04:08.830> of

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
going to have less prey because more of

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.070 
going to have less prey because more of
them<00:04:09.040> are<00:04:09.190> getting<00:04:09.280> eating<00:04:09.760> eaten<00:04:10.600> so<00:04:10.870> when

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
them are getting eating eaten so when

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.470 
them are getting eating eaten so when
the<00:04:11.200> prey<00:04:11.530> decreases<00:04:12.370> then<00:04:13.000> there's<00:04:13.240> not

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
the prey decreases then there's not

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.699 
the prey decreases then there's not
enough<00:04:15.060> food<00:04:16.060> for<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.450> predator<00:04:16.900> so<00:04:17.470> their

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
enough food for the predator so their

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.620 
enough food for the predator so their
population<00:04:18.430> will<00:04:18.549> increase<00:04:18.609> well<00:04:19.209> once<00:04:19.450> the

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
population will increase well once the

population of the prey of the Predators

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.909 
population of the prey of the Predators
increase<00:04:22.030> the<00:04:22.720> prey<00:04:23.200> is<00:04:23.410> going<00:04:23.560> to<00:04:23.620> increase

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
increase the prey is going to increase

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.360 
increase the prey is going to increase
and<00:04:24.160> we<00:04:24.610> have<00:04:24.820> this<00:04:25.060> cycle<00:04:25.840> of<00:04:26.050> waves<00:04:26.919> that

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
and we have this cycle of waves that

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.940

happen over and over okay there's a

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.420 
happen over and over okay there's a
classic<00:04:30.250> example<00:04:30.910> on<00:04:31.090> page<00:04:31.630> 139<00:04:32.290> of<00:04:32.470> your<00:04:32.950> book

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
classic example on page 139 of your book

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.150 
classic example on page 139 of your book
on<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:34.090> wolves<00:04:34.570> and<00:04:34.690> moose<00:04:35.050> populations<00:04:35.979> on

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
on the wolves and moose populations on

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.870 
on the wolves and moose populations on
Isle<00:04:36.820> Royal<00:04:37.210> which<00:04:37.900> is<00:04:38.050> in<00:04:38.199> Lake<00:04:38.410> Superior<00:04:38.880> in

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
Isle Royal which is in Lake Superior in

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.340 
Isle Royal which is in Lake Superior in
the<00:04:40.030> northern<00:04:40.330> part<00:04:40.630> of<00:04:40.720> Michigan<00:04:41.110> and<00:04:41.470> as<00:04:42.160> the

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
the northern part of Michigan and as the

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.129 
the northern part of Michigan and as the
moose<00:04:44.350> population<00:04:44.979> goes<00:04:45.130> up<00:04:45.160> the<00:04:46.150> wolf

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
moose population goes up the wolf

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.290 
moose population goes up the wolf
population<00:04:47.370> increases<00:04:48.370> but<00:04:48.550> eventually<00:04:49.150> the

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
population increases but eventually the

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.870 
population increases but eventually the
Wolves<00:04:49.750> begin<00:04:50.350> to<00:04:50.410> eat<00:04:50.530> too<00:04:50.770> much<00:04:50.949> moose<00:04:51.310> so

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
Wolves begin to eat too much moose so

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.240 
Wolves begin to eat too much moose so
the<00:04:52.000> moose<00:04:52.150> population<00:04:52.560> decreases<00:04:53.560> and<00:04:53.770> then

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
the moose population decreases and then

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.760 
the moose population decreases and then
the<00:04:54.430> wolf<00:04:54.669> population<00:04:54.910> will<00:04:55.600> decrease<00:04:56.110> and<00:04:56.320> it

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
the wolf population will decrease and it

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.370 
the wolf population will decrease and it
creates<00:04:57.220> a<00:04:57.550> pattern<00:04:58.360> a<00:04:58.539> pattern<00:04:59.050> that<00:04:59.229> looks

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
creates a pattern a pattern that looks

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.510 
creates a pattern a pattern that looks
just<00:04:59.680> like<00:04:59.800> this

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
just like this

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.680 
just like this
okay<00:05:00.940> so<00:05:01.720> as<00:05:02.050> you<00:05:02.199> can<00:05:02.259> see<00:05:02.320> as<00:05:02.620> the<00:05:03.690> Predators

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
okay so as you can see as the Predators

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.830 
okay so as you can see as the Predators
decrease<00:05:05.320> the<00:05:06.100> prey<00:05:06.400> increases<00:05:07.210> but<00:05:07.360> once<00:05:07.600> the

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
decrease the prey increases but once the

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.290 
decrease the prey increases but once the
prey<00:05:08.110> increase<00:05:08.560> a<00:05:08.590> certain<00:05:09.160> spot<00:05:09.430> then<00:05:10.090> the

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
prey increase a certain spot then the

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.870 
prey increase a certain spot then the
Predators<00:05:10.960> will<00:05:11.400> increase<00:05:12.400> and<00:05:12.669> once<00:05:12.789> you

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
Predators will increase and once you

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.879 
Predators will increase and once you
have<00:05:13.000> too<00:05:13.180> many<00:05:13.360> predators<00:05:13.600> then<00:05:14.440> the<00:05:14.650> prey

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
have too many predators then the prey

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.060 
have too many predators then the prey
population<00:05:15.729> decreases<00:05:16.510> so<00:05:17.199> on<00:05:17.380> and<00:05:17.560> so<00:05:17.770> forth

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
population decreases so on and so forth

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.620 
population decreases so on and so forth
so<00:05:18.220> they<00:05:18.370> have<00:05:18.520> these<00:05:18.699> waves<00:05:19.150> that<00:05:20.110> basically

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
so they have these waves that basically

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.210 
so they have these waves that basically
happen<00:05:22.630> in<00:05:22.750> response<00:05:23.380> to<00:05:23.650> each<00:05:23.800> other<00:05:24.039> and

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
happen in response to each other and

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.990 
happen in response to each other and
that's<00:05:24.729> the<00:05:25.060> predator-prey<00:05:25.840> relationship

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
that's the predator-prey relationship

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.140 
that's the predator-prey relationship
okay

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
okay

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.420 
okay
the<00:05:28.449> final<00:05:28.960> density<00:05:29.470> dependent<00:05:29.949> factor<00:05:30.280> that

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
the final density dependent factor that

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.370 
the final density dependent factor that
we're<00:05:30.580> going<00:05:30.699> to<00:05:30.760> learn<00:05:30.849> about<00:05:30.910> is<00:05:31.419> parasitism

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
we're going to learn about is parasitism

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.060 
we're going to learn about is parasitism
and<00:05:32.710> disease<00:05:33.190> okay<00:05:34.349> this<00:05:35.349> one<00:05:35.530> kind<00:05:35.770> of<00:05:35.830> acts

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
and disease okay this one kind of acts

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.370 
and disease okay this one kind of acts
like<00:05:36.340> a<00:05:36.550> predator<00:05:37.150> prey<00:05:37.449> relationship<00:05:38.080> so

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
like a predator prey relationship so

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.439 
like a predator prey relationship so
when<00:05:38.889> we<00:05:39.130> have<00:05:39.430> populations<00:05:40.270> that<00:05:40.389> are

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
when we have populations that are

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:43.250 
when we have populations that are
tightly<00:05:40.870> packed<00:05:41.280> disease<00:05:42.280> can<00:05:42.550> spread<00:05:42.820> easily

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
tightly packed disease can spread easily

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.020 
tightly packed disease can spread easily
there<00:05:44.260> can<00:05:44.380> be<00:05:44.410> more<00:05:44.650> parasites<00:05:45.310> because<00:05:45.610> once

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
there can be more parasites because once

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.060 
there can be more parasites because once
again<00:05:46.150> the<00:05:46.690> for<00:05:47.139> the<00:05:47.229> parasite<00:05:47.740> like<00:05:47.889> this

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
again the for the parasite like this

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.219 
again the for the parasite like this
mosquito<00:05:48.490> you<00:05:48.580> see<00:05:48.729> on<00:05:48.849> your<00:05:48.940> screen

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
mosquito you see on your screen

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.189 
mosquito you see on your screen
it's<00:05:50.860> the<00:05:51.099> predator<00:05:51.550> were<00:05:52.000> the<00:05:52.270> prey<00:05:52.599> so<00:05:52.960> if

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 
it's the predator were the prey so if

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.439 
it's the predator were the prey so if
there's<00:05:53.440> more<00:05:53.800> humans<00:05:54.370> therefore<00:05:55.000> there's

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
there's more humans therefore there's

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:59.129 
there's more humans therefore there's
going<00:05:55.510> to<00:05:55.690> be<00:05:55.750> more<00:05:56.909> mosquitoes<00:05:57.909> and<00:05:58.180> if<00:05:58.900> we

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139 
going to be more mosquitoes and if we

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.250 
going to be more mosquitoes and if we
can<00:05:59.320> find<00:05:59.560> a<00:05:59.770> way<00:05:59.949> to<00:06:00.840> limit<00:06:01.840> the<00:06:01.930> amount<00:06:02.139> of

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
can find a way to limit the amount of

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.110 
can find a way to limit the amount of
humans<00:06:02.680> then<00:06:02.860> you<00:06:02.979> might<00:06:03.159> have<00:06:03.190> less

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
humans then you might have less

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.210 
humans then you might have less
mosquitoes<00:06:04.810> but<00:06:05.050> we<00:06:05.199> don't<00:06:05.380> we'll<00:06:05.590> do<00:06:05.830> that<00:06:06.010> we

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
mosquitoes but we don't we'll do that we

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.060 
mosquitoes but we don't we'll do that we
use<00:06:06.490> herbicides<00:06:07.240> and<00:06:07.630> pesticides<00:06:07.889> to<00:06:08.889> take

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
use herbicides and pesticides to take

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.360 
use herbicides and pesticides to take
care<00:06:09.280> of<00:06:09.310> that<00:06:09.520> stuff<00:06:09.930> okay<00:06:10.930> so<00:06:11.260> just<00:06:12.099> want<00:06:12.280> you

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
care of that stuff okay so just want you

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.820 
care of that stuff okay so just want you
to<00:06:12.430> remember<00:06:12.639> that<00:06:13.289> density<00:06:14.289> dependent

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
to remember that density dependent

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.560 
to remember that density dependent
factors<00:06:15.220> depend<00:06:15.639> upon<00:06:16.000> the<00:06:16.180> amount<00:06:16.389> of

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
factors depend upon the amount of

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.350 
factors depend upon the amount of
individuals<00:06:17.169> who<00:06:17.320> are<00:06:17.349> in<00:06:17.680> a<00:06:17.830> given<00:06:18.070> area

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
individuals who are in a given area

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.210 
individuals who are in a given area
predator<00:06:19.360> prey<00:06:19.690> and<00:06:19.990> parasitism<00:06:20.590> and<00:06:20.889> disease

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
predator prey and parasitism and disease

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.000 
predator prey and parasitism and disease
are<00:06:21.580> two<00:06:22.120> great<00:06:22.360> examples<00:06:22.389> of<00:06:23.169> a<00:06:23.500> density

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.010 
are two great examples of a density

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.399 
are two great examples of a density
dependent<00:06:24.490> factor<00:06:24.909> so<00:06:25.180> until<00:06:26.020> our<00:06:26.139> next

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:26.409 
dependent factor so until our next

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:28.649 
dependent factor so until our next
episode<00:06:26.860> we're<00:06:27.250> going<00:06:27.370> to<00:06:27.430> catch<00:06:27.610> you<00:06:27.909> on<00:06:28.599> the

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:28.659 
episode we're going to catch you on the

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:31.229 
episode we're going to catch you on the
flip<00:06:29.199> side
