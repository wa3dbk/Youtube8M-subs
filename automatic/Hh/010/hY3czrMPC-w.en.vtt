00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.970
 hello how about in this tutorial we're going to 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.519
 see how to solve operations with 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.630
 fractions let's see the operations 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:13.340
 of addition subtraction multiplication and division 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.060
 very well let's start by explaining 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.890
 what is the numerator and the denominator 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:21.350
 when we have a fraction for example 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.020
 three quarters 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.840
 in what is above our 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.619
 fraction is the numerator and what is 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.100
 find down is the denominator very 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.130
 ok now let's start with the sum 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:41.390
 when we have a sum for example two 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:43.309
 thirds plus one third 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.100
 when we have a sum with 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.890
 equal denominators we apply a sum 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.790
 direct what does it mean that the 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.420
 our 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.129
 denominator is going to stay the same 3 and what 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.320
 only that we are going to add will be 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:03.410
 our numerators 2 + 13 and this is the 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.190
 result of our sum now well 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.700
 when we have 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.130
 sums with different denominators we go 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.580
 to apply the following method by 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.580
 example 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:22.200
 three fifths 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.810
 plus two thirds 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.870
 very good as we can see here we have 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:32.650
 different denominators 5 and 3 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:37.270
 what we are going to do is multiply the 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.190
 two denominators 5 by 3 15 and the 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.570
 result we will put it in our 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.270
 denominator 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.750
 now let's multiply crossover that 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:51.560
 it would be 3 x 3 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:55.720
 9 and as it is a sum we are going to 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:59.290
 add the terms in our numerator 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:04.600
 now let's multiply crossed on 5 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:06.640
 for the 2 that would be 10 as we see for 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.890
 get our numerator is simply 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:15.310
 cross multiply the numerator by the 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.460
 denominator of the second fraction and 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.490
 then we apply the same thing but with the 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.840
 denominator of our first fraction 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.230
 and the numerator of our second 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.230
 fraction 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:34.230
 now to solve this simply 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:36.709
 we make this sum 10 + 9 19 15 to you 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.500
 and this here is the result of our 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.460
 of our sum 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.680
 now let's do a subtraction 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:51.420
 when it's an equal subtraction for example 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.340
 two quarters minus a quarter 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.160
 when it's a subtraction with equal 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.530
 denominator is the only thing we do is 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.500
 a direct subtraction or our 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.730
 denominator stays the same and only 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.830
 we subtract our numerators 2 minus 11 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.840
 and this is the result of our subtraction 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.380
 now we do have a subtraction with 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.260
 different denominators the only thing that 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.840
 we have to do is the next method 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.240
 is the next equal of the sum 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.510
 simply that we are going to change the sign 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.319
 more for less this means that if 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.999
 we have 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:33.650
 two quarters minus two fifths as 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:37.150
 we can see the denominators are 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.790
 different the only thing we will do is 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.780
 multiply denominator by denominator 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.450
 4 for 5 20 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.530
 and then let's multiply crossover 2 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.780
 by 5 10 but in this case as it comes 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.440
 of a subtraction let's subtract both 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.330
 terms 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:00.250
 and then multiply crossed 22 by 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.380
 48 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.870
 and now we simply do this 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.930
 operation that we have in the numerator what 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:11.500
 which would be 10 minus 82 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.349
 and in denominator 20 very well now 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.739
 we will make examples of multiplication 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.739
 and division 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.549
 very well 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.430
 to perform multiplication the 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.260
 method is very simple the only thing that 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:34.200
 we have to do is multiply 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:38.220
 numerator by numerator 5 by 7 35 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:42.330
 and our denominator would be 4 for us 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.130
 5 20 then the only thing we have to 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.520
 to do is multiply numerator by 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.290
 numerator and we get the result and 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.690
 to get our denominator is 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.340
 denominator by denominator and we get 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.190
 the result 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:00.720
 now let's see an example of division 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:04.370
 for example if we have a third 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.370
 between two fifths 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.090
 There are two ways to solve 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.850
 divisions we will perform the most 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.660
 simple the only thing we have to do 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.770
 it's a lot like multiplication 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.880
 simply that now we are going to 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:25.700
 multiply numerator by denominator and 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.490
 summarize the result we put it in 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:31.669
 our numerator and then 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.660
 multiply denominator by numerator 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:37.590
 and the result we put it 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.980
 in our denominator 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.969
 and in this way we already have the result 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:46.119
 from our division 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:49.179
 now let's see a known method 

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:50.810
 like the tortilla method for to 

00:05:49.179 --> 00:05:54.420
 solve 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:57.990
 broken divisions for example a 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:00.000
 third between two fifths 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.650
 let's verify that he gives us the same 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.949
 result 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:07.360
 For this, what we are going to do is put 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:11.530
 the first fraction 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.319
 in our numerator on the second 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:17.939
 fraction we put it in our 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:17.939
 denominator two fifths 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:24.240
 very good now what we are going to do is 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:26.930
 multiply the extremes 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.479
 1 for 5 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.700
 and the result we're going to put in 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:33.890
 our numerator 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:37.190
 and then we are going to multiply the 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:41.090
 digits that are in the middle 2 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:43.340
 by 36 and as we can see is the same 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:46.130
 result simply that with different 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.320
 good method this is all if they have 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.220
 Any doubt please put in the 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.810
 comments
