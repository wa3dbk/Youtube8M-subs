that's<00:01:19.030> gonna<00:01:19.180> look<00:01:19.330> silly<00:01:19.630> and<00:01:20.070> then<00:01:21.070> for<00:01:21.310> a

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
that's gonna look silly and then for a

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.980 
that's gonna look silly and then for a
slimmer<00:01:21.670> nose<00:01:21.910> you<00:01:22.090> can<00:01:22.240> take<00:01:22.420> a<00:01:22.570> smaller

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
slimmer nose you can take a smaller

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.850 
slimmer nose you can take a smaller
brush<00:01:23.290> and<00:01:23.440> the<00:01:23.680> same<00:01:23.950> bronzer<00:01:24.510> and<00:01:25.860> we're

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
brush and the same bronzer and we're

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.180 
brush and the same bronzer and we're
going<00:01:27.100> to<00:01:27.250> place<00:01:27.550> this<00:01:27.790> down<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.240> side<00:01:28.540> of<00:01:29.190> the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
going to place this down the side of the

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.460 
going to place this down the side of the
nose

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
nose

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.230 
nose
so<00:01:32.470> by<00:01:32.800> contouring<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:33.520> sides<00:01:33.790> of<00:01:33.940> our<00:01:34.060> nose

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
so by contouring the sides of our nose

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.270 
so by contouring the sides of our nose
we're<00:01:34.510> creating<00:01:35.020> shadow<00:01:35.350> and<00:01:35.770> that<00:01:35.890> gives<00:01:36.130> the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
we're creating shadow and that gives the

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.640 
we're creating shadow and that gives the
illusion<00:01:36.520> that<00:01:36.880> our<00:01:37.270> nose<00:01:37.540> is<00:01:37.810> a<00:01:37.870> lot<00:01:38.350> slimmer

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
illusion that our nose is a lot slimmer

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.710 
illusion that our nose is a lot slimmer
and<00:01:41.070> lastly<00:01:42.070> for<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.310> final<00:01:42.760> touch<00:01:42.970> you<00:01:43.330> can<00:01:43.510> add

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
and lastly for a final touch you can add

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.380 
and lastly for a final touch you can add
a<00:01:43.930> highlighter<00:01:44.440> to<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.520> high<00:01:45.730> points<00:01:46.120> of<00:01:46.240> your

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
face so you just want to place this

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.540 
face so you just want to place this
right<00:01:48.970> on<00:01:49.030> at<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.690> cheekbones<00:01:50.260> and<00:01:52.980> then<00:01:53.980> also
