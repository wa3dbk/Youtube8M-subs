00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.050
 cranial blacks give us a lot 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.869
 information about the pathology 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.240
 what the patient can have and gives us a 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:32.739
 Accurate location for injuries 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:35.410
 either cranial or system facial 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.720
 central nervous there are two there are nerves 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.910
 cranial and we have the possibility of 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.390
 explore each of them to try 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.120
 of looking for pathology and to try to 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.190
 find some location for a 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.120
 injury that produces the findings 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.710
 clinical 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.140
 the first cranial clock is the nerve 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.510
 alpha thorium is a purely nerve 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:01.149
 sensitive that is responsible for olfaction 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.880
 When there is injury to the first nerve 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.400
 cranial 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.030
 the clinical manifestation will be loss of 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.800
 olfaction but also taste a 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.040
 a large percentage of what we 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.130
 we detect how taste comes from smelling 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.450
 the food then when a 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.460
 patient has some alteration of the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.960
 black cranial closeup also refers 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.909
 a great loss of taste 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.650
 the only sensation that is not processed in 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.900
 the thalamus and well let's talk a 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.960
 little bit of the anatomy of this nerve in 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.030
 actually the first cranial nerve 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.670
 they are only small fibers that 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.150
 they pass through the crib plate and form 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.430
 delete mobile these small fibers 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.270
 they capture the substances that are floating 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.929
 in the air 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.609
 identify them transform this 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:54.000
 substance that is of a chemical stimulus 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:55.409
 in an electrical stimulus and they allow that 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.740
 this travel stimulus through their 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.530
 fibers to get to the nerve brain 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.469
 that is on the clifford plate happens to me the 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.590
 Olfactory bulb and olfactory tract 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.850
 there is a challenge that distributes 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.570
 fibers for both sides of the brain 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.280
 and from there it goes to the contralateral brain and 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.910
 to the bark ball factor since it's 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.550
 placed in the medial part of the lobe 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.830
 temporary it is very important that in a 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.050
 patient with alteration to the factor already 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.090
 let's make a precise clinical history 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.490
 the main causes that we should 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.620
 investigate are history of trauma 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.130
 blows to the head that sometimes are not 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.570
 very important the before smoking 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.680
 all patients who smoke have 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.300
 some alteration in the olfaction the 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.460
 people who have pathway infections 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.590
 high respiratory tract in very 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.370
 frequent will also have alteration in 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.260
 the formation there are systemic diseases 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.940
 for example allergies the veins 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.100
 rheumatology and a whole series of 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.330
 diseases that cause alteration in 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.720
 the first cranial nerve 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:10.940
 and being close to factories being 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:13.430
 exposed to having some solvents 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.980
 medicines and the use of drugs by 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.110
 example cocaine are going to destroy the 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.750
 olfactory mucosa and they will cause a 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.750
 decrease in olfaction
