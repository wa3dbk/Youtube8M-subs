 watch dogs one of the most anticipated games 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:25.279
 2013 on the other side of gta5 history 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.680
 about folk style which by 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.609

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.289

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.530
 connecting to the operating system 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.870
 networks with which manages the whole city he 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.550
 can predict crime however 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.500
 his main goal is the fight against 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.570
 the corporation that controls this 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.970
 watch dogs system so much 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.890
 intrigued us at last year's e3 what 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.110
 we could not agree to the call 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.089
 yubisoft go to paris to look at 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.449
 play and get to know the team 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.449
 developers 

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:57.559
 everything on the presentation was stylized 

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:59.989
 to maximize the world of the game 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.339
 camcorders watched visitors on 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.320
 old TVs were displayed 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:04.850
 image with security systems 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.340
 analyzed coming people 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.900
 counting out qr code from monitors could 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.729
 play a simple mini game and 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.270
 connect to cameras using your 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.060
 phone 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.850
 the phone is the main weapon 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.799
 your heroes so he clearly shows that 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.140
 capabilities of modern smartphones yet 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.850
 not disclosed and in the near future they 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.420
 can become a formidable weapon in their hands 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.970
 offenders 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.860
 Chicago is the scene of the game. 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.869
 modern as the authors consider the city 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.299
 America where most security cameras 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.090
 systems by all urban services in the world 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.649
 the game is controlled by the operating system 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.479
 Sites and developers assure 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.240
 this is quite coming for us with you 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.619
 the future is already hundreds of companies around the world 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.869
 working on management programs 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.700
 urban services and only a matter of time 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.009
 when artificial intelligence will start 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:57.460
 responsible for the electrical traffic lights and 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:59.380
 transport family of the main character eiden 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.539
 pier suffered as a result of not 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.560
 known circumstances to save 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.929
 other innocent 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.569
 he connected to the ais network and started 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:11.519
 watch your street first then 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.519
 districts and soon the whole city 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.650
 story plot watch dogs partly 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.200
 reminds series person of interest 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.090
 however, unlike the heroes of the movie player 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.170
 he decides what to do with received from 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.170
 knowledge supercomputer 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.740
 the choice is always on the conscience of the player you walk 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.020
 over the open world and see now 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.090
 there may be a crime network 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.860
 with intercepts conversations with letters and 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.140
 can predict crimes and 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.390
 then only you decide to prevent 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.580
 his or not and your actions affect that 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.540
 how the game perceives you but we don't want 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.220
 put pressure on the player 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:52.510
 want to solve all brute force or 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:54.040
 covert is your choice depending on 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.470
 player action will change and 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.990
 the attitude of society to his person going 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.120
 along the path of violence and open clashes 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.520
 you will certainly become a hero case 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.860
 news and even gun salesmen will 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.080
 look askance at you frantically 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.600
 and the alarm button under the counter to the word 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.520
 unlike go too far cry 3 assassin's 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.680
 creed and other games in the open world 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.050
 Watch dogs do not convert arrival 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.790
 police in the inevitable shootout hundreds 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:24.130
 constantly arriving enemies when you 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.690
 commit a crime and people see you 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.360
 then the whole chain starts to happen 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.000
 events in our universe and network first 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.590
 with analyzes the situation she sends 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.600
 the police at the scene only when 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.850
 sure something happened this something 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.680
 sort of optimizing budget spending you 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.660
 can intervene in this process for example 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.910
 hack and and hide or go far 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.010
 from the crime scene then the police are not 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.540
 will appear if she came to the place 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.459
 crime and you're not on a straight line 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.300
 visibility then everything goes so become 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.120
 stealth mode 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.680
 you are hiding while the police are looking for you 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.180
 can get out of the search area or 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.280
 hide properly so that you are not 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.410
 found it in my opinion the most interesting in 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.480
 our system, people do not want to run away from 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.550
 the police they want to hide from her and we 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.740
 provided many opportunities for 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.480
 of this 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.640
 But if it comes to the chase then the hero 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.080
 not at all without help he can go 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.770
 hack a variety of urban 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.510
 systems 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.370
 activate the blocking would become 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.410
 switch traffic lights to arrange 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.150
 traffic congestion can even open 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.830
 covered car parking and do not call 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.050
 and close the shutters for themselves after which 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:26.130
 get out of the car stop the train to sit down 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.130
 on him and go on 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.980
 but to use everything 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.900
 Arsenal of skills first to be 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.120
 access the network with a specific 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.010
 District concept watch dogs reminds 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.080
 Other games Ubisoft Headlight Edge 3 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.970
 assassin's creed first player needs 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.220
 will penetrate the protected object 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.110
 where is the server systems it can 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.150
 do as quietly manipulating 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.920
 gate cameras and even lifts 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.410
 so with a gun at the ready 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.240
 cleaning the territory and hacking servers and 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.980
 one gets the ability to manage 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.260
 urban systems in the area 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.080
 and read all the characters 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.449
 the games in general seized the turret opened 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.580
 part of the island 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.199
 we intend to bring in the proper elements 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.999
 our other popular project but 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.860
 main gameplay and mechanics all the same 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:13.259
 completely different I honestly do not understand 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.059
 why we should not intersect with others 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:15.330
 projects if we make a game in the open 

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:17.430
 the world 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.199
 I once heard from a man that they say to us 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.509
 don't make trips by car 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.460
 because they are gta and we are not educated 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:25.499
 must be different we are fig 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.669
 we make a game about a big city and about 

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:29.039
 modern dude 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.809
 he should be able to drive a car at all 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.180
 another question is what will we do with it 

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:35.219
 skill and what will the gameplay be with 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.870
 weapons we could make a game about a hero 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:38.849
 which only hacker applies 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.129
 ability after all surely someone from 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:44.099
 players will want to fire offenders 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:46.110
 answer with putting enemies from far cry 3 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:48.330
 too, everything is just a player in the open world 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.529
 need to know where his enemies are we could 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.659
 do it automatically 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:53.550
 we decided that let him do better 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:55.620
 This is through the hacking cameras and at the same time will be 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.029
 explore the environment in general all 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.949
 elements in our game where there is 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:01.879
 because they really need her and 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:01.879
 our gameplay 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.820
 total watch dogs will be more than 100 missions 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.590
 besides, there will be plenty in the game world 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.450
 opportunities for the phone will be 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.340
 buy apps including games with 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.200
 augmented reality liked in 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.600
 institution music can be gone 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.280
 notice ATM hack parsed 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.540
 electronics pawnshop and on 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.130
 raise funds to collect yourself 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.590
 some kind of auxiliary gadget 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.890
 authors emphasize for them it is important that 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.000
 the task and the game world are not boring to the player 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.740
 the main thing for us is diversity 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.990
 problem of all games in the open world 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.820
 duplicate items and this is the main 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.500
 difficulty in creating them so we 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.450
 tried to make the player 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.310
 there was no feeling that he was one and that 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:43.960
 same does twice especially in the main 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:46.240
 watch developers 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.070
 dogs is another almost unique 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.320
 reception to diversify the adventure 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.480
 player is a rare view at the moment 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.130
 multiplayer about him while nothing at all 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.810
 they say but most likely watch dogs 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.060
 the players themselves without knowing it 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:00.700
 will penetrate each other's games like 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.260
 it was with diman sales they can both 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.860
 help each other and become 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.960
 the enemies 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:08.460
 and you can enter another game 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.460
 will even be using the iPad 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.100
 in general, everything about watch dogs 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.660
 sounds extremely intriguing let's hope 

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.820
 the author will be able to create the most important 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.620
 really interesting open world 

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.199
 all the laws of which generate mass 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.900
 fascinating situations and not annoying 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:28.680
 player looking forward to new hits 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.680
 and release games
