00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.360
 hello and good morning today I am here and 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.279
 I want to show how you can 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.199
 make very simple confetti 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.369
 to make a little bit special 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.680
 baptism we choose pink because it goes 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.619
 technician I am a child and therefore there 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.869
 I dedicate nothing to her for today 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.730
 what we need are stencils ad 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.230
 expulsion in particular we would have 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.590
 need a little flower and a 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.219
 little heart confess a stencil for 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.680
 flower-shaped suppression balls of 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.379
 pink and white sugar paste a little 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.980
 of feeding with a rolling pin and a 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.570
 ball tour 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.570
 you are ready we start then we take 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.120
 a candy and feathers let's take a little lightly 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.270
 surface with food cole I will 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.980
 I always recommend spending lots of money 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.960
 money in the sense there is no need to 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.790
 buy with food based 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.409
 improperly dissolving a ball of 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.650
 sugar paste with a little water and 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.140
 you will have an exceptional glue now the 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.049
 first thing I want you to see how 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.720
 make a pair of bamboo if we take 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.909
 the ball of pink sugar paste e 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.880
 we get two very very small balls 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:29.189
 small then we turn on the palm of the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.020
 hand so as to make it homogeneous e 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.580
 we are going to attack him in the middle of the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:41.070
 our candy and voila the first 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:47.700
 we repeat the operation we turn e 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:49.380
 we get the second one, let's take it now 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.690
 now two balls slightly more 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.150
 small in such a way that we do the 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:02:01.200
 upper edge of the shoe we turn 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:03.560
 ball and stick we do the same 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.560
 thing 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:15.860
 el we now attach with the board tool la 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:22.520
 little part of the ball tour 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:24.000
 let's do 2 nozzles above 1 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.260
 and 12 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.530
 ok now when the dough ball of 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.570
 white sugar we make micro 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.050
 micro micro micro balls that will be 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:43.489
 bowls of our little shoes 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:43.489
 we attack 1 and 2 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.340
 this if you have to make a little party 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.900
 of baptism are exceptional there 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.209
 put in the center of each plate for 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.950
 every diner will make a great impression there 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.989
 I guarantee 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.989
 1 and 2 years 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:06.920
 the first confetto is already finished 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:11.329
 let's pass the second candy 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:15.200
 now we will make a brush bottle 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:17.090
 I love the glue and brushes a little 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.430
 surface we don't have to put 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.159
 so much so that it does not slip 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:26.049
 after our subject then paste of 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:29.319
 white sugar and let's do a little 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:32.510
 small small salamis small small 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:35.569
 so as to make the central body 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:40.599
 of our bottle we put it in 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.599
 diagonal with respect to our candy 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:50.030
 now with pink sugar paste 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:52.280
 let's get another little ball in 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.200
 this way now we crush it 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:59.090
 slightly so as to get one 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:04.930
 pizzetti na made the pizza tin 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:08.419
 I call at the top of our bottle e 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.329

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:13.489

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.340
 let's go make a rose color 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:18.340
 slightly clearer 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.170
 here it is 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:36.750
 with the ball tour we make signs 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:42.240
 which will be the gradation of ours 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:47.000
 baby bottle to finish with another small one 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:57.800
 ball and the rolling pin crush 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:05:01.289
 we get a flower we apply now 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.710
 last I show you how to make a 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.710
 bib 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:16.860

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.030
 with the ball tour we always do of 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.090
 small little holes without going too far 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.090
 depth 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:30.710
 one two three four five times 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:33.560
 the last we leave it free and we do 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:37.039
 a bigger hole that will be the one where 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:41.840
 let's say the Lebanon collapses it 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:48.819
 we stick white sugar paste 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:48.819
 let's spread a little little heart 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:58.479
