 one more week trying to summarize the 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.520
 most important news that they have 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.949
 place in the world of videogames 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.830
 during last week and in this case 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.810
 It has been a week with more controversial 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.640
 almost what news I am going to try 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.499
 stay with the most important thing though it is 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.150
 might leave me something in the pipeline 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:34.250
 but as always I tell you if you see this 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.450
 since optic esp do not hesitate to give it a 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.070
 look at my channel that you will have it in the 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.329
 description if you want more news or 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.130
 more news from the world of 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.780
 video games and likewise if you are 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.150
 on my channel and you see this video 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.860
 hesitate to go through esp optics so 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.400
 without further delay we will comment on said 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.900
 news 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.340
 so let's start first with 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.450
 the great controversy this week that has 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.090
 had to do precisely with the 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.250
 1876 ​​dior launch a title 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.900
 which has received serious criticism both 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.970
 on the part of the users as of the 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.410
 own specialized magazines in 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.080
 Videogames that criticize especially 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.220
 the short duration of the title 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.619
 approximately between five or six hours 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.479
 played on normal difficulty and also the 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.729
 linearity of the title itself that does not 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.649
 offers just replayability I know this 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.100
 It's not news as such but I wanted to 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.049
 take this video 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.430
 since it has been one of the most 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.229
 important that happened this week 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.299
 past and then open a small 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.950
 debate in the comments for those 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.009
 that you have already passed or you are 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.299
 watching videos of di order and that you are 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.590
 forming your own opinion on 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.180
 this game, I would like that 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.820
 we will discuss a little politely 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.619
 in the comments even so it also fits 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.090
 point out that this week as it took place 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.350
 the launch came out precisely on 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.850
 launch trailer so 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.560
 I will take advantage to leave it in the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.030
 description in case someone did not see it and what 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.979
 I would have put on the screen also like this 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.420
 that I just wanted to comment on that 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.860
 small section before focusing on 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.149
 the rest of the news we continue now 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.920
 with other news and in this case we have 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.479
 to focus on a well-known saga 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.740
 of video games that possibly many 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.929
 of you played throughout 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.270
 your childhood depending on when 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.679
 you are obviously in this case it is legacy 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.259
 of kain a saga that was made 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.149
 especially famous at the beginning 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.039
 of the 90s for both playstation one 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.479
 as for playstation2 some of his 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.860
 videogames and this time you have to 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.810
 refer to precisely this 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.989
 saga because recently it has 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.880
 discovered that that development was 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.620
 developing for three years a 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.930
 video game known as legacy of kain 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.670
 de sant from which 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.859
 a new one has been recently filtered 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.569
 gameplay of more than 30 minutes which 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.980
 he has put them on the screen separately and 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.200
 also in the description obviously 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.939
 so you can take a look and the reason 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.129
 why it was canceled is supposed 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.510
 because square enix was not satisfied 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.150
 with the result seen so far 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.030
 and decided that I was not going to get a good 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.400
 welcome good some fans of the saga and 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.980
 maybe you would like to have seen it but it is 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.319
 true that does not shine or does not transmit that 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.359
 sensation transmitted by the first 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.219
 titles of the saga so maybe it was not 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.689
 a bad idea to cancel it at least 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:53.549
 I think I'll leave in the comments 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:55.260
 I leave the video in the description for 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.000
 that you take a look and tell me what 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.439
 you think we change now completely from 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.909
 gender and let's focus on this case in 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.189
 talk a little about the deadly kombat 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.230
 10 in the last one unless now- 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.790
 delivered of this well-known saga of 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.750
 fighting games that like many 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.510
 you know you have a release date 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.129
 planned in Spain for day 14 of 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.069
 April this year 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:15.930
 playstation3 360 playstation 4 xbox one 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.310
 and computer and this time what 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.919
 I wanted to comment is that this week 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.409
 past there have been several rumors to 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:24.670
 about this video game trying to 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.410
 find what they are going to be or what 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.720
 because we have sown one or several 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.060
 the hidden characters of this 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.790
 video game as many of you will already know in the 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.890
 mortal kombat 9 if I remember correctly 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.959
 several characters hidden among them 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.000
 good hidden in quotes between them 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.890
 nice freddy krueger was also 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.750
 unlockable and there would be the possibility 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.970
 of the appearance of one or another 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.840
 Hidden or unlockable character between 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.450
 the video game that for now 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.310
 we do not know the rumors have been 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.920
 quite broad and some assured 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.930
 that could be a predictor 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.330
 alien that stars in the saga of 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.790
 movies of the same name also others 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.900
 they spoke of spawn a good superhero 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.269
 rather more than superhero a 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.370
 anti-hero pretty well known that perhaps 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.739
 in Latin America you will have heard it more 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.140
 the name of the monster and also 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.489
 recently another rumor has come out that 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.440
 It says it could be a 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.940
 supposed gunman that for now 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.430
 we do not know but that has appeared in 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.049
 an illustration recently in short there's 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.180
 many rumors surrounding this issue do not 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.040
 we know if any of them is true or 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.930
 it is not true the only thing that is 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.150
 true is that the developers of 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.640
 this video game have the rights of 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.390
 spawn the antiaircraft the antihero forgiveness 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.280
 what I have told you 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.230
 it is very possible that that yes to appear 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.700
 others as well I would love 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.740
 see the predictor but we'll see 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.600
 final what happens so patience 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.910
 take that wait until day 14 of 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.770
 April does not leave the game or before if 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.120
 we discover it finally we continue here with 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.560
 a pretty interesting announcement that 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.090
 has done this week and that has 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.070
 come hand in this case 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.960
 creator of the video game known as 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.550
 terrarium and that has presented us a 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.570
 new title with a trailer that we have 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.790
 to it on screen and that too 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.500
 is in the description in this case this 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.110
 video game is known as terrarium other 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.960
 world and despite that by the appearance 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.330
 it could be more than one dlc or one 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.640
 kind of second part of terror already the 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.380
 own creator of the saga has insured 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.660
 that is not a different game that does 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.520
 that shares the same appearance and 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.840
 same mechanics that would close but that 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.300
 obviously it's going to be completely 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.080
 different in order for now it's early 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.550
 to talk about a release date 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.720
 but you have already assured that you are 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.550
 developing this video game for 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.810
 computer and for mac and that does not rule out 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.060
 in the future also release versions 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.680
 for playstation 4 and xbox one is not a 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.670
 very long trailer but good I leave it 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.260
 in the description so that you throw him a 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.730
 look let's go to the next news 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.590
 in this case let's focus on talking a 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.000
 little about final fantasy 15 a title 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.990
 that possibly many of you 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.120
 you will be waiting 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.320
 very much desire and in this occasion it is 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.750
 news because it has been shown 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.790
 recently the content of the demo of 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.770
 this video game that will be available 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.440
 only for those who buy the 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.120
 title of final fantasy type-0 a title 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.310
 that will be released in very little 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.780
 for playstation 4 and xbox one and 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.850
 precisely the demo will be for the 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.590
 platform that you have bought said 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.510
 video game you already know that final fantasy 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.980
 15 heap does not have a date 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.170
 launch but we already know that it will come out 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.480
 for those playstation 4 platforms and 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.700
 xbox one the developers of this 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.650
 title claim that you are currently in 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.970
 about 60 percent of the 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.920
 development so as soon as there's more 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.030
 I will comment on the details and finally 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.410
 to finish a small note that in 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.940
 this case has to do with blood board 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.220
 a videogame that as many of you already know 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.650
 will arrive on March 25 exclusively 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.300
 for playstation 4 and that in this case what 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.010
 that they have shown us is a new trailer 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.810
 of the video game that counts a little bit more 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.310
 about history and that it takes advantage of 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.540
 just to give us more information of 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.760
 own history but also for 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.830
 make sure that this title is going to get 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.360
 completely doubled to Castilian in 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.460
 our territory something pretty 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.230
 interesting below my point of view and 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.940
 that differs a bit from the other titles 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.750
 from software that we had seen 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.360
 to date 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.890
 but well let's hope it's the first 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.290
 of many dubbed games that come by 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:52.120
 this company hopefully it will be like that and nothing more 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.350
 what comment I leave in the description 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.150
 in trailer so you can take a look 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.490
 as I have also left you in the previous 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.930
 news the gameplay of the final demo 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.310
 fantasy and finally until it is weekly 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.870
 of news and tried to summarize the 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.070
 best possible way everything that has 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.750
 happened this week so I hope that 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.070
 I liked it and nothing else on my part 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:09.090
 thank you very much for having seen it be 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.090
 happy and see you
