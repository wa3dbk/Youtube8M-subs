line within it I'm going to take my red
line<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.340> just<00:00:23.850> want<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.119> bring<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.449> over

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
line and just want to bring it over

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.359 
line and just want to bring it over
we'll<00:00:25.650> bring<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:26.210> under<00:00:27.859> both<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:29.039> these<00:00:29.130> lines

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
we'll bring it under both of these lines

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.319 
we'll bring it under both of these lines
like<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.830> there<00:00:31.830> we<00:00:31.949> go<00:00:31.980> now<00:00:32.820> I'm<00:00:32.940> gonna<00:00:33.059> do<00:00:33.149> is

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
like so there we go now I'm gonna do is

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.000 
like so there we go now I'm gonna do is
take<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.780> I'm<00:00:34.200> going<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.410> loop<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.710> back

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
take this I'm going to loop this back

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.340 
take this I'm going to loop this back
just<00:00:35.910> pull<00:00:36.120> out<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.239> little<00:00:36.750> bit<00:00:36.960> more<00:00:37.140> length

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
just pull out a little bit more length

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.830 
just pull out a little bit more length
here<00:00:37.649> let's<00:00:37.890> keep<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.300> part<00:00:39.300> right<00:00:39.360> up<00:00:39.600> here

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
here let's keep this part right up here

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.000 
here let's keep this part right up here
bring<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:40.950> down<00:00:41.450> loop<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.629> back<00:00:42.899> over<00:00:43.140> like

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
bring this down loop this back over like

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.160 
bring this down loop this back over like
so<00:00:44.510> now<00:00:45.510> what<00:00:45.629> I'm<00:00:45.690> going<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.840> do<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.020> I'm<00:00:46.079> going

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
so now what I'm going to do is I'm going

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.420 
so now what I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:00:46.230> take<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.559> line<00:00:46.829> here<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.160> it's<00:00:47.280> going<00:00:47.370> to

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
to take this line here and it's going to

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.270 
to take this line here and it's going to
come<00:00:47.579> over<00:00:47.820> both<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.390> these<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.050> then<00:00:50.039> back

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
come over both of these and then back

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.740 
come over both of these and then back
through<00:00:50.309> as<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.000> see<00:00:51.180> I've<00:00:51.300> created<00:00:51.480> like

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
through as you can see I've created like

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.529 
through as you can see I've created like
a<00:00:51.780> little<00:00:52.050> cross<00:00:52.320> here<00:00:52.770> an<00:00:52.949> X<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:54.360> kind

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
a little cross here an X and it's kind

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.060 
a little cross here an X and it's kind
of<00:00:54.570> weaved<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.079> together<00:00:55.289> with<00:00:55.710> one<00:00:55.890> another

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
of weaved in together with one another

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.270 
of weaved in together with one another
and<00:00:56.280> as<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.489> pull<00:00:56.789> these<00:00:57.890> you'll<00:00:58.890> see<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.219> will

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
and as you pull these you'll see it will

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.750 
and as you pull these you'll see it will
come<00:00:59.579> together<00:01:01.399> rather<00:01:02.399> nicely<00:01:03.559> this<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.739> your

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.899 

reef<00:01:09.229> /<00:01:10.229> square<00:01:10.860> knot<00:01:11.100> now<00:01:11.670> what's<00:01:11.820> really

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
one back through here and create another

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.810 
one back through here and create another
square<00:01:28.140> knot<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.530> top<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.070> now<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.640> has

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
square knot on top of this now this has

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.179 
square knot on top of this now this has
gone<00:01:30.000> past<00:01:30.409> what<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.590> would<00:01:31.740> have<00:01:31.829> been<00:01:31.860> used

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
gone past what this would have been used

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.890 
gone past what this would have been used
for<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.520> square<00:01:32.729> knot<00:01:32.939> right<00:01:33.090> here<00:01:33.150> initially

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
for the square knot right here initially

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.060 
for the square knot right here initially
would<00:01:33.990> have<00:01:34.079> been<00:01:34.170> used<00:01:34.409> if<00:01:34.560> say<00:01:34.740> if<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.860> had<00:01:35.040> a

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
lines coming around your waist there you

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.030 
lines coming around your waist there you
would<00:01:39.960> just<00:01:40.049> tie<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.409> your<00:01:40.500> square<00:01:40.740> knot<00:01:40.920> but

this line right here was we've starting

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.740 
this line right here was we've starting
with<00:01:49.710> our<00:01:49.740> square<00:01:50.189> knot<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.640> just<00:01:51.090> weaved<00:01:51.360> all

with our square knot and just weaved all
the<00:01:51.960> way<00:01:52.049> down<00:01:52.290> creating<00:01:52.649> this<00:01:52.860> nice<00:01:53.130> thick

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
the way down creating this nice thick

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.609 
the way down creating this nice thick
rope<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.119> we<00:01:54.240> have<00:01:54.450> here<00:01:54.720> now<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.380> really

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
rope that we have here now this really

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.660 
rope that we have here now this really
doesn't<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.979> whole<00:01:56.130> lot<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.280> practical

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
doesn't have a whole lot of practical

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.399 
doesn't have a whole lot of practical
purposes<00:01:57.149> being<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.689> bigger<00:01:57.930> but<00:01:58.140> if<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.320> do

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
purposes being this bigger but if you do

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.200 
purposes being this bigger but if you do
it<00:01:58.530> on<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.649> smaller<00:01:58.950> line<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> great

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
it on a smaller line this is a great

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.999 
it on a smaller line this is a great
nice<00:02:00.450> weaving<00:02:01.049> hear<00:02:01.259> something<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.860> can
