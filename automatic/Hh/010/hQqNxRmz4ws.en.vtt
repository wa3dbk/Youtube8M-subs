00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
the rest this video so this mod does is

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.500 
the rest this video so this mod does is
it<00:00:28.740> spawns<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.400> one<00:00:29.609> zombie<00:00:30.060> model<00:00:30.359> that

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
it spawns in the one zombie model that

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.420 
it spawns in the one zombie model that
is<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.019> game<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.529> they<00:00:31.619> spawns<00:00:31.980> let<00:00:32.340> you

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
is in the game and they spawns let you

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.950 
is in the game and they spawns let you
know<00:00:32.550> loads<00:00:32.759> AI<00:00:32.969> with<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.450> one<00:00:33.630> model<00:00:33.930> and

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
puncher now obviously it doesn't have

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.139 
puncher now obviously it doesn't have
the<00:00:37.890> drunk<00:00:38.070> animation<00:00:38.670> because<00:00:38.790> that's<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the drunk animation because that's the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.400 
the drunk animation because that's the
one<00:00:39.300> at<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.450> moment<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.809> makes<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.110> look<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
one at the moment that makes it look the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.930 
one at the moment that makes it look the
most<00:00:40.590> realistic<00:00:40.860> without<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.340> being<00:00:41.460> custom

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
most realistic without it being custom

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.600 
most realistic without it being custom
in<00:00:42.270> game<00:00:42.600> anyway<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.710> they<00:00:43.920> also<00:00:44.100> come<00:00:44.399> after

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
in game anyway and they also come after

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.010 
in game anyway and they also come after
you<00:00:44.730> with<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.090> as<00:00:45.329> well<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:45.660> they'll<00:00:45.809> punch

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
you with this as well so they'll punch

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.990 
you with this as well so they'll punch
it<00:00:46.170> too<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.500> like<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.710> say<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.610> saying

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
about the concept mod thing which is the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.500 
about the concept mod thing which is the
fact<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.399> know<00:00:50.520> it's<00:00:50.879> only<00:00:50.969> got<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.390> in

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
zombies and I've changed it to 25 so

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.580 
zombies and I've changed it to 25 so
what<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.510> know<00:01:09.630> they'd<00:01:09.960> actually<00:01:10.140> all<00:01:10.350> work

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
what you know they'd actually all work

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.350 
what you know they'd actually all work
but<00:01:10.830> apparently<00:01:11.130> they<00:01:11.250> don't<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.240> say

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
but apparently they don't so like I say

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.730 
but apparently they don't so like I say
probably<00:01:12.630> leave<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.900> default<00:01:13.260> for<00:01:13.409> now<00:01:13.439> if

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
probably leave it default for now if

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.249 
probably leave it default for now if
