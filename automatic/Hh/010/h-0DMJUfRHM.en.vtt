hey this is Nate storey with bright
Agrotech<00:00:03.810> and<00:00:04.259> today<00:00:04.440> I'm<00:00:04.740> going<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:04.950> talk<00:00:05.069> a

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
Agrotech and today I'm going to talk a

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.579 
Agrotech and today I'm going to talk a
little<00:00:05.279> bit<00:00:05.430> about<00:00:05.700> whether<00:00:06.000> or<00:00:06.240> not

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:06.589 
little bit about whether or not

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:08.900 
little bit about whether or not
conventional<00:00:07.589> hydroponic<00:00:08.280> solutions<00:00:08.700> are

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
conventional hydroponic solutions are

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:19.220 
conventional hydroponic solutions are
safe<00:00:16.670> so<00:00:17.670> as<00:00:17.760> many<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.210> guys<00:00:18.390> know<00:00:18.750> we<00:00:19.020> have

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
safe so as many of you guys know we have

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.210 
safe so as many of you guys know we have
both<00:00:19.619> organic<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.460> conventional<00:00:21.650> farms<00:00:22.650> so

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
both organic and conventional farms so

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.040 
both organic and conventional farms so
we're<00:00:23.430> growing<00:00:23.689> organically<00:00:24.689> with<00:00:24.930> our

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
we're growing organically with our

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.900 
we're growing organically with our
aquaponic<00:00:25.650> production<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.550> this

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
aquaponic production in this in this

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.120 
aquaponic production in this in this
greenhouse<00:00:27.390> here<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.930> we've<00:00:28.529> got<00:00:28.560> also<00:00:29.099> a

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
greenhouse here and we've got also a

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.400 
greenhouse here and we've got also a
conventional<00:00:29.760> farm<00:00:30.000> down<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.539> Colorado<00:00:30.900> where

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
conventional farm down in Colorado where

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.560 
conventional farm down in Colorado where
we're<00:00:31.560> growing<00:00:31.980> with<00:00:32.550> hydroponic<00:00:33.120> solutions

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
we're growing with hydroponic solutions

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.200 
we're growing with hydroponic solutions
so<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.680> question<00:00:35.040> arises<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.550> lot<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.059> lot

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
so the question arises a lot and a lot

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.270 
so the question arises a lot and a lot
of<00:00:36.239> people<00:00:36.570> ask<00:00:36.750> us<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.170> question<00:00:37.280> because

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
of people ask us this question because

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.010 
of people ask us this question because
they<00:00:38.460> know<00:00:38.670> we've<00:00:39.059> got<00:00:39.239> our<00:00:39.270> hands<00:00:39.570> kind<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.899> in

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
they know we've got our hands kind of in

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.150 
they know we've got our hands kind of in
both<00:00:40.309> parts<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.399> parts<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.059> industry<00:00:42.270> are

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
both parts of parts of the industry are

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.680 
both parts of parts of the industry are
conventional<00:00:44.160> hydroponic<00:00:44.760> solutions<00:00:45.149> safe<00:00:45.420> a

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
conventional hydroponic solutions safe a

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.420 
conventional hydroponic solutions safe a
lot<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.079> people<00:00:46.320> will<00:00:46.440> say<00:00:46.649> well<00:00:46.920> you're

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
lot of people will say well you're

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.010 
lot of people will say well you're
growing<00:00:47.700> with<00:00:47.850> chemicals<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.539> can't<00:00:48.960> be

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
growing with chemicals that can't be

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.700 
growing with chemicals that can't be
safe<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.730> always<00:00:51.600> have<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.930> talk<00:00:52.199> with<00:00:52.410> folks

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
safe so I always have to talk with folks

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.350 
safe so I always have to talk with folks
and<00:00:53.039> make<00:00:53.340> sure<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.640> they<00:00:53.760> understand<00:00:54.210> that

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
and make sure that they understand that

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.139 
and make sure that they understand that
that<00:00:54.899> yes<00:00:55.199> we<00:00:55.379> are<00:00:55.500> using<00:00:55.860> chemicals<00:00:55.980> but<00:00:56.910> so

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
that yes we are using chemicals but so

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.790 
that yes we are using chemicals but so
we're<00:00:57.449> also<00:00:57.600> using<00:00:57.899> these<00:00:58.109> chemicals<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.710> our

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
we're also using these chemicals in our

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.920 
we're also using these chemicals in our
organic<00:00:59.100> systems<00:00:59.640> right<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.480> question<00:01:00.629> is

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
organic systems right the question is

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.540 
organic systems right the question is
not<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.170> chemicals<00:01:01.559> being<00:01:01.739> used<00:01:01.829> because<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
not the chemicals being used because the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.880 
not the chemicals being used because the
plants<00:01:02.969> absorb<00:01:03.539> certain<00:01:04.199> nutrients<00:01:04.739> in

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
plants absorb certain nutrients in

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.130 
plants absorb certain nutrients in
certain<00:01:05.339> chemical<00:01:05.729> forms<00:01:06.150> that's<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:06.840> how

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
certain chemical forms that's just how

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.050 
certain chemical forms that's just how
plants<00:01:07.470> work<00:01:07.740> they<00:01:08.159> take<00:01:08.340> nitrate<00:01:08.850> whether

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
plants work they take nitrate whether

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.149 
plants work they take nitrate whether
it's<00:01:09.270> sent<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.600> SOT<00:01:09.810> synthetic<00:01:10.439> they<00:01:10.979> take

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
it's sent the SOT synthetic they take

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.520 
it's sent the SOT synthetic they take
nitrate<00:01:11.610> whether<00:01:11.820> it's<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.659> know<00:01:12.689> mind<00:01:13.200> they

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
nitrate whether it's you know mind they

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.560 
nitrate whether it's you know mind they
take<00:01:13.710> nitrate<00:01:14.130> whether<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.520> comes<00:01:14.729> from<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
take nitrate whether it comes from the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.170 
take nitrate whether it comes from the
decomposition<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.820> proteins<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
decomposition of proteins and the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.539 
decomposition of proteins and the
oxidation<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.900> ammonia<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.590> our<00:01:19.950> aquaponics

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
oxidation of ammonia and our aquaponics

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.710 
oxidation of ammonia and our aquaponics
system<00:01:21.770> it's<00:01:22.770> all<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.040> same<00:01:23.250> thing<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
system it's all the same thing so the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.600 
system it's all the same thing so the
reality<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.380> yes<00:01:25.560> we're<00:01:25.799> using<00:01:26.040> chemicals

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
reality is is yes we're using chemicals

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.330 
reality is is yes we're using chemicals
but<00:01:26.820> we're<00:01:27.000> always<00:01:27.270> using<00:01:27.960> chemicals<00:01:28.409> even<00:01:29.130> in

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
but we're always using chemicals even in

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.569 
but we're always using chemicals even in
our<00:01:29.700> organic<00:01:30.060> systems<00:01:30.650> so<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.829> real<00:01:32.070> question

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
our organic systems so the real question

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.550 
our organic systems so the real question
here<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.790> source<00:01:33.270> what<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> source<00:01:34.320> of

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
here is source what is the source of

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.830 
here is source what is the source of
these<00:01:34.650> chemicals<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.490> how<00:01:36.030> comfortable<00:01:36.390> are

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
these chemicals and how comfortable are

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.140 
these chemicals and how comfortable are
we<00:01:37.200> with<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.799> source<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.759> lot<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
we with this source so a lot of the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.690 
we with this source so a lot of the
folks<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.509> purchase<00:01:40.320> organic<00:01:40.890> including<00:01:41.610> a

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
folks that purchase organic including a

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.850 
folks that purchase organic including a
lot<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.000> our<00:01:42.119> customers<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:43.259> know<00:01:43.380> we<00:01:43.590> eat

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
lot of our customers you know we eat

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.280 
lot of our customers you know we eat
mostly<00:01:44.369> our<00:01:44.579> organic<00:01:45.090> produce<00:01:45.299> because<00:01:46.079> we're

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
mostly our organic produce because we're

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.840 
mostly our organic produce because we're
up<00:01:46.500> here<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:46.860> Laramie<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.670> where<00:01:47.820> our

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
up here in Laramie and this is where our

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.210 
up here in Laramie and this is where our
farm<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.390> we're<00:01:48.840> down<00:01:49.079> in<00:01:49.229> Colorado<00:01:49.439> we're

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
farm is we're down in Colorado we're

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.800 
farm is we're down in Colorado we're
eating<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.520> lot<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.790> our<00:01:50.909> conventional<00:01:51.390> produce

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
eating a lot of our conventional produce

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.800 
eating a lot of our conventional produce
and<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:53.159> reality<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.540> it

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
and the reality is is that it's it

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.410 
and the reality is is that it's it
tastes<00:01:55.619> very<00:01:55.649> similar<00:01:56.009> oftentimes<00:01:57.000> believe

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
tastes very similar oftentimes believe

it or not the conventional stuff is a

it or not the conventional stuff is a

little bit more nutritionally balanced

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.510 
little bit more nutritionally balanced
simply<00:02:01.320> because<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.799> plants<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.250> all<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
simply because the plants have all the

simply because the plants have all the
nutrition<00:02:02.969> they<00:02:03.090> need<00:02:03.590> at<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.829> end<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:05.070> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
nutrition they need at the end of the

produce to my family to my child to my
wife<00:02:23.490> but<00:02:24.300> at<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.540> end<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.870> day<00:02:25.050> nitrate

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
wife but at the end of the day nitrate

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.860 
wife but at the end of the day nitrate
is<00:02:26.010> nitrate<00:02:26.460> there's<00:02:26.970> no<00:02:27.210> difference<00:02:27.690> between

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
is nitrate there's no difference between

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.470 
is nitrate there's no difference between
nitrates<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:29.010> we<00:02:29.130> get<00:02:29.460> through<00:02:30.000> synthetic

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
nitrates that we get through synthetic

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.510 
nitrates that we get through synthetic
processes<00:02:30.960> and<00:02:31.350> nitrate<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.190> we<00:02:32.340> get

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
processes and nitrate that we get

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.810 
processes and nitrate that we get
through<00:02:32.700> organic<00:02:33.000> processes<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.820> that's

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
through organic processes so that's

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.370 
through organic processes so that's
always<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.210> big<00:02:36.360> question<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:37.020> whether<00:02:37.200> you

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
always the big question and whether you

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.130 
always the big question and whether you
buy<00:02:37.560> organic<00:02:37.770> or<00:02:38.190> whether<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.550> buy<00:02:38.790> a

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
buy organic or whether you buy a

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.630 
buy organic or whether you buy a
conventional<00:02:40.140> probably<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.070> more<00:02:41.250> important

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
conventional probably the more important

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.230 
conventional probably the more important
question<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.390> ask<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:44.670> know<00:02:44.790> what<00:02:45.030> is<00:02:45.150> the

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
question to ask is you know what is the

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.020 
question to ask is you know what is the
pesticide<00:02:45.750> exposure<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.890> know<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.250> from

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
pesticide exposure you know of from

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.390 
pesticide exposure you know of from
eating<00:02:48.390> this<00:02:48.510> product<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.260> was<00:02:50.070> it<00:02:50.220> grown

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
eating this product and was it grown

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.120 
eating this product and was it grown
sustainably<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:51.300> was<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:51.930> grown<00:02:52.110> locally<00:02:52.320> at

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
sustainably and was it grown locally at

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.800 
sustainably and was it grown locally at
the<00:02:53.310> end<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.640> day<00:02:53.790> for<00:02:53.850> me<00:02:54.150> nutrients<00:02:54.720> are

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
the end of the day for me nutrients are

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.480 
the end of the day for me nutrients are
not<00:02:54.960> the<00:02:55.110> big<00:02:55.260> question<00:02:55.650> or<00:02:55.800> nutrient<00:02:56.220> sources

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
not the big question or nutrient sources

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.240 
not the big question or nutrient sources
even<00:02:57.390> are<00:02:57.570> not<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.900> question<00:02:58.320> a<00:02:58.500> lot<00:02:59.040> of

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
even are not the question a lot of

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.160 
even are not the question a lot of
conventional<00:03:00.180> nutrients<00:03:00.750> are<00:03:00.840> actually

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
conventional nutrients are actually

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.810 
conventional nutrients are actually
produced<00:03:01.470> more<00:03:01.680> sustainably<00:03:02.370> than<00:03:02.640> some

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
produced more sustainably than some

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.090 
produced more sustainably than some
organic<00:03:03.330> nutrients<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.290> we<00:03:04.710> want<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:05.010> be

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
organic nutrients so we want to be

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.400 
organic nutrients so we want to be
thinking<00:03:05.280> about<00:03:05.550> our<00:03:05.910> organic<00:03:06.660> nutrients<00:03:07.290> in

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
thinking about our organic nutrients in

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.050 
thinking about our organic nutrients in
the<00:03:07.470> same<00:03:07.680> way<00:03:07.830> that<00:03:07.980> we<00:03:08.100> think<00:03:08.310> about<00:03:08.400> oil<00:03:08.760> is

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
the same way that we think about oil is

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.400 
the same way that we think about oil is
the<00:03:09.240> same<00:03:09.420> way<00:03:09.600> that<00:03:09.720> we<00:03:09.840> think<00:03:10.050> about<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.290> lot

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
the same way that we think about a lot

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.700 
the same way that we think about a lot
of<00:03:10.680> our<00:03:10.830> other<00:03:11.340> finite<00:03:12.300> resources<00:03:12.810> really

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
of our other finite resources really

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.350 
of our other finite resources really
what<00:03:13.980> I'm<00:03:14.100> saying<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.520> this<00:03:14.640> is<00:03:14.760> way<00:03:14.970> too<00:03:15.030> big

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
what I'm saying is this is way too big

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.540 
what I'm saying is this is way too big
of<00:03:15.510> an<00:03:15.630> issue<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:16.470> really<00:03:16.650> get<00:03:16.950> into<00:03:17.100> in<00:03:17.460> a

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
of an issue to really get into in a

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
I'm sourcing a lot of my nutrients from

there's<00:03:58.110> a<00:03:58.200> great<00:03:58.500> argument<00:03:58.740> to<00:03:59.160> be<00:03:59.190> made<00:03:59.340> for

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
there's a great argument to be made for

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.410 
there's a great argument to be made for
conventional<00:04:01.350> over<00:04:01.890> organic<00:04:02.070> in<00:04:02.580> some<00:04:03.060> areas
