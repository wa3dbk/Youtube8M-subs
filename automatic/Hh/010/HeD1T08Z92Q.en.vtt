00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570 

we're<00:00:00.149> going<00:00:00.359> to<00:00:00.450> test<00:00:00.659> the<00:00:00.930> theory<00:00:01.350> of<00:00:01.580> that

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
we're going to test the theory of that

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.300 
we're going to test the theory of that
battery<00:00:03.540> all<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:04.080> double-a<00:00:04.680> batteries<00:00:05.069> being

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
battery all the double-a batteries being

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.059 
battery all the double-a batteries being
inside<00:00:05.730> a<00:00:06.060> six<00:00:06.629> volt<00:00:06.690> battery<00:00:07.230> I've<00:00:07.830> already

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
inside a six volt battery I've already

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.860 
inside a six volt battery I've already
kind<00:00:08.490> of<00:00:08.550> loosened<00:00:09.000> up<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.150> edge<00:00:09.360> here<00:00:09.690> so

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
kind of loosened up the edge here so

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.150 
kind of loosened up the edge here so
we're<00:00:10.019> getting<00:00:10.260> ready<00:00:10.410> for<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.740> moment<00:00:10.920> of

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
we're getting ready for the moment of

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.959 
we're getting ready for the moment of
truth<00:00:11.450> we<00:00:12.450> pop<00:00:12.690> this<00:00:12.870> cardboard<00:00:13.259> out<00:00:13.969> see

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
truth we pop this cardboard out see

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.279 
truth we pop this cardboard out see
what's<00:00:15.179> underneath<00:00:15.509> here<00:00:17.779> hopefully<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.810> whole

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
what's underneath here hopefully a whole

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:29.529 
what's underneath here hopefully a whole
gang<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:22.400> 32<00:00:25.609> will<00:00:26.609> pop<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.119> cardboard<00:00:27.539> out

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
gang of 32 will pop this cardboard out

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:41.660 
gang of 32 will pop this cardboard out
and<00:00:31.099> see<00:00:32.099> what's<00:00:32.550> underneath<00:00:33.000> here<00:00:38.000> and<00:00:40.670> sure

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
and see what's underneath here and sure

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.490 
and see what's underneath here and sure
is<00:00:41.940> going<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.239> make<00:00:42.420> some<00:00:42.629> fascinating<00:00:43.200> video

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
is going to make some fascinating video

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.540 
is going to make some fascinating video
I<00:00:43.739> bet<00:00:45.110> thought<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.140> had<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.559> all<00:00:46.860> ready<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.309> go

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
I bet thought I had this all ready to go

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.270 
I bet thought I had this all ready to go
but<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.850> know<00:00:47.969> how<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:51.770> couple<00:00:52.770> spots<00:00:53.010> I

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
but you know how that is couple spots I

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.750 
but you know how that is couple spots I
missed<00:00:53.610> here<00:00:54.559> now<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.829> should<00:00:56.129> we<00:00:56.370> want<00:00:56.579> this

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
missed here now this should we want this

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:05.719 
missed here now this should we want this
to<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:57.000> come<00:00:57.420> right<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.690> out<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:58.109> here<00:01:04.729> and

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
to just come right on out of here and

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.910 
to just come right on out of here and
you<00:01:06.150> know<00:01:06.180> if<00:01:06.630> here's<00:01:06.930> what<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:07.200> have<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.619> bunch

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
you know if here's what we have a bunch

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:17.300 
you know if here's what we have a bunch
of<00:01:08.130> more<00:01:08.610> cardboard<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.950> then<00:01:14.840> and<00:01:15.840> then<00:01:16.710> some

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
of more cardboard and then and then some

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.490 
of more cardboard and then and then some
empty<00:01:17.729> space<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.420> then<00:01:19.290> do<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.720> no<00:01:21.720> what

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
empty space and then do we have no what

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.010 
empty space and then do we have no what
we<00:01:22.619> have<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.159> some<00:01:24.409> decidedly<00:01:27.020> larger

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
we have is some decidedly larger

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.420 
we have is some decidedly larger
batteries<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.979> case<00:01:31.009> they<00:01:32.009> would<00:01:32.130> appear

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
batteries in this case they would appear

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.550 
batteries in this case they would appear
to<00:01:32.549> be<00:01:32.670> D<00:01:32.970> cells<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:35.900> which<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.049> not<00:01:37.229> what<00:01:37.259> we

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
to be D cells and which is not what we

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.990 
to be D cells and which is not what we
were<00:01:37.680> hoping<00:01:37.710> for<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.729> course<00:01:43.369> there<00:01:44.369> are<00:01:44.850> no

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
were hoping for of course there are no

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:54.499 
were hoping for of course there are no
wires<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.689> cut<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:48.890> what<00:01:49.890> we<00:01:50.040> have<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:51.860> for<00:01:53.509> C

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
wires to cut and what we have is for C

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.840 
wires to cut and what we have is for C
cells<00:01:54.780> inside<00:01:55.380> here<00:01:55.710> instead<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.310> gang<00:01:56.579> of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
cells inside here instead of a gang of

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.850 
cells inside here instead of a gang of
little<00:01:57.750> tiny<00:01:57.930> batteries<00:01:58.500> oh<00:01:58.850> well
