profanity yeah trying to now chase after

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.520 
profanity yeah trying to now chase after
it<00:00:45.440> like<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.469> couple<00:00:46.770> badasses<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:48.379> we're<00:00:49.379> as

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
it like a couple badasses so we're as

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.380 
it like a couple badasses so we're as
we're<00:00:49.680> rolling<00:00:50.070> through<00:00:50.460> here<00:00:50.730> what<00:00:51.059> are<00:00:51.180> kind

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
we're rolling through here what are kind

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.529 
we're rolling through here what are kind
of<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:52.340> how<00:00:53.340> do<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.520> design<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.910> high-speed

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
of the how do you design a high-speed

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.709 
of the how do you design a high-speed
chase<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:55.170> video<00:00:55.469> game<00:00:56.180> well<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.360> one<00:00:57.539> this

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
chase in a video game well this one this

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.150 
chase in a video game well this one this
we've<00:00:57.989> been<00:00:58.109> working<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.559> level<00:00:58.829> for

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
we've been working on this level for

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.069 
we've been working on this level for
quite<00:00:59.730> some<00:00:59.940> times<00:01:00.149> more<00:01:00.449> probably<00:01:00.750> one<00:01:00.899> that

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
quite some times more probably one that

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.779 
quite some times more probably one that
was<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.320> development<00:01:01.530> for<00:01:01.920> over<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> year<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
was in development for over a year and a

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.700 
was in development for over a year and a
half<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.390> trying<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.260> get<00:01:04.379> some<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.619> this

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
half and trying to get some of this

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.039 
half and trying to get some of this
right<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.700> know<00:01:05.820> Lagos<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.479> known<00:01:06.720> for

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
right but you know Lagos is known for

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.289 
right but you know Lagos is known for
its<00:01:07.170> traffic<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.799> its<00:01:07.890> buses<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.640> yeah<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.150> we

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
its traffic and its buses and yeah so we

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.000 
its traffic and its buses and yeah so we
knew<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.540> we<00:01:09.900> wanted<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.229> take<00:01:10.439> advantage<00:01:10.920> of

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
knew that we wanted to take advantage of

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.149 
knew that we wanted to take advantage of
some<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:13.350> since<00:01:13.680> we<00:01:13.799> now<00:01:13.920> have

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
some of that and and since we now have

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.429 
some of that and and since we now have
the<00:01:14.280> XO<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> boost<00:01:15.270> jump<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.869> mag<00:01:16.080> gloves

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
the XO and the boost jump and mag gloves

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.109 
the XO and the boost jump and mag gloves
and<00:01:16.680> things<00:01:16.770> like<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.759> know<00:01:17.790> getting

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
and things like that you know getting

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.670 
and things like that you know getting
and<00:01:18.330> jumping<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.750> top<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.080> these<00:01:19.170> things<00:01:19.229> and

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
and jumping on top of these things and

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.490 
and jumping on top of these things and
hanging<00:01:19.979> off<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.250> sides<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.640> them<00:01:21.229> made<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.259> lot

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
hanging off the sides of them made a lot

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.910 
hanging off the sides of them made a lot
more<00:01:22.530> sense<00:01:22.979> right<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.960> yeah<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.710> one

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
more sense right so yeah this is one

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.590 
more sense right so yeah this is one
that<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.369> know<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.580> trying<00:01:27.000> storyboard

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
that you know you trying storyboard

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.810 
that you know you trying storyboard
parts<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.140> out<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.560> then<00:01:28.710> just<00:01:29.640> keep

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
parts of it out and then just keep

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.090 
parts of it out and then just keep
experimenting<00:01:30.390> they<00:01:31.020> keep<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> action<00:01:31.799> going

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
experimenting they keep the action going

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.270 
experimenting they keep the action going
so<00:01:32.369> was<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.409> earlier<00:01:34.409> iterations<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.159> this

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
so was the earlier iterations of this

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.370 
so was the earlier iterations of this
longer<00:01:35.939> shorter<00:01:36.540> how<00:01:36.720> does<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.079> how<00:01:37.200> does<00:01:37.229> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
longer shorter how does it how does a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.170 
longer shorter how does it how does a
level<00:01:37.770> like<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.130> evolved<00:01:38.549> over<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.909> course

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
level like this evolved over the course

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.780 
level like this evolved over the course
of<00:01:39.299> development<00:01:40.100> usually<00:01:41.100> what<00:01:41.250> happens<00:01:41.280> is

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
of development usually what happens is

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.910 
of development usually what happens is
you<00:01:42.090> you've<00:01:42.450> got<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.229> length<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.740> this

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
you you've got this the length of this

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.420

look how much we're able to build and

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.750 
look how much we're able to build and
together<00:02:17.020> there's<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.950> lot<00:02:17.980> going<00:02:18.130> on<00:02:18.460> all<00:02:18.730> at

together there's a lot going on all at
60<00:02:19.240> frames<00:02:19.270> here<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.980> now<00:02:21.610> we're<00:02:21.940> where<00:02:22.390> are<00:02:22.480> we

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
60 frames here so now we're where are we

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.270

more yeah there's we didn't want to give
too<00:03:02.170> much<00:03:02.290> away<00:03:02.470> but<00:03:02.880> we<00:03:03.880> figured<00:03:04.060> we'll<00:03:04.270> give

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
too much away but we figured we'll give

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.420 
too much away but we figured we'll give
you<00:03:04.540> some<00:03:04.959> of<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.350> action<00:03:05.709> of<00:03:05.830> this<00:03:05.920> one<00:03:06.160> it's

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
you some of the action of this one it's

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.310 
you some of the action of this one it's
not<00:03:06.550> even<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:06.970> big<00:03:07.120> moment<00:03:07.540> as<00:03:07.870> we<00:03:08.050> call<00:03:08.290> them

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
not even a big moment as we call them

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.860 
not even a big moment as we call them
but<00:03:08.680> I<00:03:09.220> guess<00:03:09.610> it's<00:03:09.790> a<00:03:09.850> big<00:03:10.030> section<00:03:10.299> that's<00:03:10.720> a

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
but I guess it's a big section that's a

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.740 
but I guess it's a big section that's a
taste<00:03:11.110> of<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:12.430> traffic<00:03:12.820> level<00:03:13.299> I'll<00:03:13.420> call<00:03:13.600> to

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
taste of the traffic level I'll call to

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.930 
taste of the traffic level I'll call to
the<00:03:13.840> advanced<00:03:14.110> warfare<00:03:14.590> well<00:03:15.340> see<00:03:15.580> more<00:03:15.790> when
