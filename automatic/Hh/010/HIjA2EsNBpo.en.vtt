Lessons
OK, lets talk about sustains.

00:00:24.771 --> 00:00:29.191
You play a sustain just like any other note,
but instead of cutting it off, you let it

00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:43.441
ring out.
Now you try it.

00:00:43.441 --> 00:01:05.891
Nailed it.
Here is a riff with that sustain in it.

00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:22.561
Here's that riff again, but lets just listen
to it. You can play after that.

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:44.940
Play it now.
That was almost TOO perfect.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:03:03.211
You're ready to apply this to a practice track
now. Here goes.

00:03:03.211 --> 00:03:05.301
Flawless performance!
