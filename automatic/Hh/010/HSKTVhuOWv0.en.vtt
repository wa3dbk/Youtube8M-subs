to insert the SIM card into the new char

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.090 
to insert the SIM card into the new char
me<00:00:40.980> before<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:42.180> we<00:00:42.390> have<00:00:42.600> 2<00:00:42.840> HR<00:00:43.200> Mimi<00:00:43.649> for<00:00:43.920> with

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
me before so we have 2 HR Mimi for with

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.299 
me before so we have 2 HR Mimi for with
us<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:45.210> Micro<00:00:45.809> SIM<00:00:45.840> card<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
us the Micro SIM card and this is the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.279 
us the Micro SIM card and this is the
sim<00:00:47.489> ejector<00:00:47.940> pin<00:00:48.210> which<00:00:48.450> comes<00:00:48.750> along<00:00:49.079> with

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
sim ejector pin which comes along with

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.040 
sim ejector pin which comes along with
the<00:00:49.410> xiaomi<00:00:49.800> mi4<00:00:50.340> packing<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.390> for<00:00:51.629> inserting

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
the xiaomi mi4 packing so for inserting

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.979 
the xiaomi mi4 packing so for inserting
the<00:00:52.350> sim<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.070> see<00:00:53.550> an<00:00:53.730> hole<00:00:54.030> over<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.539> small

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
the sim you can see an hole over a small

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.660 
the sim you can see an hole over a small
hole<00:00:55.260> over<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.770> left-hand<00:00:56.160> side<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
hole over the left-hand side of the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.500 
hole over the left-hand side of the
device<00:00:57.920> so<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.789> insert<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.300> sim

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
device so we have to insert the sim

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:09.440 
device so we have to insert the sim
ejector<00:01:00.960> pin<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.379> hole<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:09.180> sim

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
ejector pin in that hole and the sim

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
ejector pin in that hole and the sim
tray<00:01:09.810> comes<00:01:10.110> out<00:01:14.540> so<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> sim<00:01:16.470> tray<00:01:19.009> and

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
tray comes out so this is a sim tray and

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.070 
tray comes out so this is a sim tray and
that<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.009> space<00:01:23.430> provider<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.479> insert<00:01:24.869> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
that is a space provider to insert the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.350 
that is a space provider to insert the
sim<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:26.009> we<00:01:26.159> have<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.520> just<00:01:26.549> keep<00:01:27.150> it

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
sim so we have to just keep it

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.249 
sim so we have to just keep it
accordingly

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.890 

so<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> way<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.340> keep<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.939> sim<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
so this is a way to keep the sim in the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.230 
so this is a way to keep the sim in the
SIM<00:01:34.500> card<00:01:34.530> tray<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:36.920> we<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.460> just<00:01:38.820> tilt

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
SIM card tray and we have to just tilt

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.780 
SIM card tray and we have to just tilt
it<00:01:39.540> like<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.920> sim<00:01:41.189> should<00:01:41.520> face

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
it like this that is the sim should face

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.499 
it like this that is the sim should face
downwards<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:45.979> insert<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.549> device<00:01:48.030> like

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
downwards and insert to the device like

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.480 
downwards and insert to the device like
this<00:01:49.909> so<00:01:50.909> that's<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.930> way<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.259> insert<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.220> SIM

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
this so that's the way to insert the SIM

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.690 
this so that's the way to insert the SIM
card<00:01:53.520> into<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.329> new<00:01:54.570> Shamim<00:01:55.229> e4<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.549> SIM

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
card into the new Shamim e4 so the SIM

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.730 
card into the new Shamim e4 so the SIM
card<00:01:56.729> will<00:01:57.119> be<00:01:57.240> detected<00:01:57.719> by<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.930> device<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
card will be detected by the device and

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.039 
card will be detected by the device and
it's<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.189> very<00:01:59.430> simple<00:01:59.729> to<00:02:00.360> insert<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.869> SIM

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
it's a very simple to insert the SIM

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.789 
it's a very simple to insert the SIM
card<00:02:01.350> into<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:02.060> xiaomi<00:02:03.060> mi4<00:02:03.509> device<00:02:03.899> so

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
card into the xiaomi mi4 device so

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.410 
card into the xiaomi mi4 device so
that's<00:02:05.070> all<00:02:05.280> guys<00:02:05.520> hope<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.969> liked<00:02:06.240> this
