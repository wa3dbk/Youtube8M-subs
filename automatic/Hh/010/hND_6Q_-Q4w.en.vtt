you can hear the aircon there and then

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:47.950 
you can hear the aircon there and then
when<00:00:42.530> I<00:00:42.559> try<00:00:42.829> and<00:00:42.859> start<00:00:43.129> the<00:00:43.250> engine<00:00:46.750> goes<00:00:47.750> off

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
when I try and start the engine goes off

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.680 
when I try and start the engine goes off
completely<00:00:48.909> and<00:00:49.909> it<00:00:50.000> comes<00:00:50.179> back<00:00:50.390> on<00:00:50.539> again

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
completely and it comes back on again

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.139 
completely and it comes back on again
when<00:00:50.899> I<00:00:50.929> stop<00:00:51.140> trying<00:00:51.289> so<00:00:52.219> I'm<00:00:52.699> not<00:00:52.820> sure<00:00:52.879> what

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
when I stop trying so I'm not sure what

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:54.490 
when I stop trying so I'm not sure what
the<00:00:53.210> problem<00:00:53.299> is<00:00:53.570> I'm<00:00:53.839> hoping<00:00:54.019> it's<00:00:54.229> just<00:00:54.289> a

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
the problem is I'm hoping it's just a

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.500 
the problem is I'm hoping it's just a
dead<00:00:54.680> battery<00:00:54.890> I<00:00:55.189> thought<00:00:56.149> I'd<00:00:56.239> make<00:00:56.420> this

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
dead battery I thought I'd make this

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.670 
dead battery I thought I'd make this
video<00:00:56.659> just<00:00:56.930> in<00:00:57.049> case<00:00:57.199> it's<00:00:57.350> happening<00:00:57.589> to

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
video just in case it's happening to

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.590 
video just in case it's happening to
anyone<00:00:57.859> else<00:00:58.070> and<00:00:58.670> I'll<00:00:58.820> go<00:00:59.000> through<00:00:59.329> the

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
anyone else and I'll go through the

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.549 
anyone else and I'll go through the
whole<00:01:00.309> process<00:01:01.309> of<00:01:01.699> diagnosing<00:01:02.329> the<00:01:02.420> problem

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
whole process of diagnosing the problem

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.669 
whole process of diagnosing the problem
due<00:01:03.559> to<00:01:03.589> getting<00:01:03.829> it<00:01:03.979> fixed<00:01:04.189> okay<00:01:05.289> so<00:01:06.289> this<00:01:06.500> is

00:01:06.669 --> 00:01:06.679 
due to getting it fixed okay so this is

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:07.779 
due to getting it fixed okay so this is
the<00:01:06.740> battery<00:01:06.950> charger<00:01:07.310> that<00:01:07.399> we're<00:01:07.580> going<00:01:07.700> to

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:07.789 
the battery charger that we're going to

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:15.309 
the battery charger that we're going to
use<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.810> charge<00:01:09.080> of<00:01:09.259> the<00:01:09.380> car<00:01:14.170> here's<00:01:15.170> the

okay so back inside the car now battery
is<00:02:03.440> fully<00:02:03.710> charged<00:02:04.010> we've<00:02:04.340> tested<00:02:04.910> the

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
is fully charged we've tested the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.240 
is fully charged we've tested the
battery<00:02:06.170> with<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.350> multimeter<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:07.070> it's

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
battery with the multimeter and it's

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.749 
battery with the multimeter and it's
showing<00:02:07.520> it's<00:02:08.420> thirteen<00:02:08.840> point<00:02:09.170> two<00:02:09.259> volts<00:02:09.759> so

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
showing it's thirteen point two volts so

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.720 
showing it's thirteen point two volts so
choose<00:02:11.030> that<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:11.450> battery<00:02:11.840> is<00:02:11.990> very<00:02:12.110> healthy

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
choose that the battery is very healthy

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.680 
choose that the battery is very healthy

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.630 
from the DME which is the engine that's
p1<00:02:44.959> five<00:02:45.200> seven<00:02:45.560> one<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:46.190> do<00:02:46.280> with<00:02:46.459> the

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
p1 five seven one to do with the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.810 
p1 five seven one to do with the
immobilizer<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:51.590> what<00:02:51.890> I'm<00:02:51.980> going<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.190> do<00:02:52.400> is<00:02:52.610> I

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
immobilizer so what I'm going to do is I

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.760 
immobilizer so what I'm going to do is I
have<00:02:53.450> no<00:02:53.630> idea<00:02:53.870> whether<00:02:54.020> this<00:02:54.260> will<00:02:54.470> work<00:02:54.620> or

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
have no idea whether this will work or

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.240 
have no idea whether this will work or
not<00:02:54.920> but<00:02:55.730> we'll<00:02:55.940> do<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.120> quicker<00:02:56.450> ease<00:02:57.040> of<00:02:58.040> this

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
not but we'll do a quicker ease of this

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.050 
not but we'll do a quicker ease of this
fault<00:02:58.550> cord<00:03:01.989> and<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.140> fault<00:03:03.410> is<00:03:03.560> cleared<00:03:04.160> but

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
fault cord and the fault is cleared but

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.250 
fault cord and the fault is cleared but
that<00:03:05.180> doesn't<00:03:05.420> necessarily<00:03:05.510> mean<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.080> fall

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
that doesn't necessarily mean the fall

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.110 
that doesn't necessarily mean the fall
has<00:03:06.410> gone<00:03:06.590> away<00:03:06.680> they<00:03:07.580> could<00:03:07.820> have<00:03:07.940> just

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
has gone away they could have just

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.060 
has gone away they could have just
needed<00:03:08.420> clearing<00:03:08.840> if<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:12.530> engine<00:03:12.860> should

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
needed clearing if so the engine should

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:19.099 
needed clearing if so the engine should
start<00:03:13.459> now<00:03:13.989> fingers<00:03:14.989> crossed<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:17.720> don't

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
start now fingers crossed and I don't

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.030 
start now fingers crossed and I don't
which<00:03:20.109> basically<00:03:20.290> means<00:03:20.469> I'm<00:03:20.739> cleared<00:03:20.950> the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
which basically means I'm cleared the

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.610 
which basically means I'm cleared the
fault<00:03:21.280> cord<00:03:24.480> but<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.599> problem<00:03:25.959> still<00:03:26.200> exists

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
fault cord but the problem still exists

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.569 
fault cord but the problem still exists
with<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:26.829> vehicle<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:30.280> line<00:03:30.430> of

with the vehicle the line of

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.580 
with the vehicle the line of
troubleshooting<00:03:31.030> I<00:03:31.090> guess<00:03:31.319> here<00:03:32.319> since

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
troubleshooting I guess here since

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.879 
troubleshooting I guess here since
clearing<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.069> DME<00:03:33.579> fault<00:03:33.909> cord<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:35.590> engine

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
clearing the DME fault cord the engine

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.910 
clearing the DME fault cord the engine
still<00:03:36.219> a<00:03:36.250> warm<00:03:36.489> start<00:03:37.260> but<00:03:38.260> you<00:03:38.349> can<00:03:38.500> see<00:03:38.680> here

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
still a warm start but you can see here

the the cord that we have the DME was to

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.000 
the the cord that we have the DME was to
do<00:03:43.359> with<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:43.599> immobilizer<00:03:44.049> and<00:03:44.680> we<00:03:44.769> go<00:03:44.889> into

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
do with the immobilizer and we go into

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.580 
do with the immobilizer and we go into
the<00:03:45.129> alarm<00:03:45.370> system<00:03:45.730> here<00:03:46.000> you<00:03:46.409> can<00:03:47.409> have<00:03:47.530> a
