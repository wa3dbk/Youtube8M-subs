00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.150 
so the last game of the group stage was
against<00:05:47.390> India<00:05:47.720> at<00:05:47.870> home<00:05:48.140> and<00:05:48.560> you'd<00:05:48.860> say<00:05:49.040> this

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
against India at home and you'd say this

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.500 
against India at home and you'd say this
is<00:05:49.220> supposed<00:05:49.669> to<00:05:49.730> be<00:05:49.820> the<00:05:50.000> easiest<00:05:50.300> game

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
is supposed to be the easiest game

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.080 
is supposed to be the easiest game
really<00:05:50.780> no<00:05:50.900> disrespect<00:05:51.500> to<00:05:51.560> India<00:05:52.220> but<00:05:52.460> they

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
really no disrespect to India but they

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.909 
really no disrespect to India but they
certainly<00:05:53.360> don't<00:05:53.600> have<00:05:53.810> much<00:05:54.380> quality<00:05:54.800> in

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:57.010 
certainly don't have much quality in
their<00:05:55.070> side<00:05:55.310> but<00:05:55.940> it<00:05:56.419> would<00:05:56.510> actually<00:05:56.630> be<00:05:56.930> the

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
their side but it would actually be the

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.110 
their side but it would actually be the
first<00:05:57.050> game<00:05:57.590> where<00:05:57.890> we<00:05:58.070> would<00:05:58.340> drop<00:05:58.640> points

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
first game where we would drop points

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.060 
first game where we would drop points

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 
unfortunately that was eventually how

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.779 
unfortunately that was eventually how
the<00:07:05.300> game<00:07:05.509> would<00:07:05.690> finish<00:07:05.930> at<00:07:06.800> 1:1<00:07:07.520> so

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:07.789 
the game would finish at 1:1 so

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:09.879 
the game would finish at 1:1 so
unfortunately<00:07:08.240> for<00:07:08.300> us<00:07:08.509> it's<00:07:08.810> it's<00:07:09.380> not<00:07:09.650> three

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:09.889

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:13.639 
would have been absolutely delightful
