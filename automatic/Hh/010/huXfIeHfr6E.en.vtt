turn<00:04:39.850> rena<00:04:40.850> distance<00:04:41.210> back<00:04:41.510> to<00:04:43.810> i'm

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
turn rena distance back to i'm

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.840 
turn rena distance back to i'm
going<00:04:45.110> to<00:04:45.200> build<00:04:45.620> up<00:04:45.800> these<00:04:46.040> mountains<00:04:46.550> and

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
going to build up these mountains and

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.970 
going to build up these mountains and
i'll<00:04:47.360> probably<00:04:47.540> put<00:04:47.690> like<00:04:47.810> a<00:04:47.900> big<00:04:48.320> tower<00:04:48.620> on

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
i'll probably put like a big tower on

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.310 
i'll probably put like a big tower on
that<00:04:49.160> on<00:04:49.370> that<00:04:49.430> sort<00:04:49.880> of<00:04:49.940> bit<00:04:50.780> sticking<00:04:51.020> out<00:04:51.200> on

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
that on that sort of bit sticking out on

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.210 
that on that sort of bit sticking out on
its<00:04:51.440> own<00:04:51.560> i<00:04:52.450> might<00:04:53.450> make<00:04:53.600> another<00:04:53.630> wall<00:04:54.220> sort

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
its own i might make another wall sort

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.480 
its own i might make another wall sort
of<00:04:55.310> so<00:04:55.610> it'll<00:04:55.760> go<00:04:55.880> down<00:04:56.290> and<00:04:57.290> up<00:04:57.530> to<00:04:57.560> there<00:04:57.920> and

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
of so it'll go down and up to there and

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.430 
of so it'll go down and up to there and
it<00:04:58.700> will<00:04:59.210> go<00:04:59.330> over<00:04:59.450> the<00:04:59.630> top<00:04:59.840> I'm<00:05:00.050> not<00:05:00.170> sure<00:05:00.230> to

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
it will go over the top I'm not sure to

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.050 
it will go over the top I'm not sure to
make<00:05:00.530> it<00:05:00.650> maybe<00:05:00.830> go<00:05:01.010> across<00:05:01.370> here<00:05:01.520> to<00:05:01.910> that

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
make it maybe go across here to that

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.330 
make it maybe go across here to that
