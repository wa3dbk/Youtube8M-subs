00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
i tried to drag scope into him but it

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.429

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.780 
wouldn't let me move this opening also
just<00:01:58.649> made<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.979> look<00:01:59.009> like<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.310> completely

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
just made it look like a completely

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.480 
just made it look like a completely
failed<00:02:00.210> but<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:01.560> wasn't<00:02:01.799> as<00:02:01.890> much<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.280> fail

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
failed but it wasn't as much of a fail

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.069 
failed but it wasn't as much of a fail
to<00:02:02.670> look<00:02:02.850> like<00:02:03.030> anyway<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.570> i<00:02:03.630> end<00:02:03.780> up<00:02:03.869> just

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
to look like anyway and i end up just

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:04.860 
to look like anyway and i end up just
doing<00:02:04.530> that

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
doing that

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.840 
doing that
which<00:02:05.470> is<00:02:05.560> pretty<00:02:05.710> cool<00:02:05.950> um<00:02:08.160> but<00:02:09.160> yeah<00:02:09.430> I<00:02:09.460> hope

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
which is pretty cool um but yeah I hope

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.700

you<00:02:10.090> enjoy<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.450> awesome<00:02:10.540> run<00:02:10.900> gameplay<00:02:11.170> I<00:02:11.380> try

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
you enjoy the awesome run gameplay I try

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.500 
you enjoy the awesome run gameplay I try
and<00:02:11.890> keep<00:02:12.130> it<00:02:12.310> original<00:02:12.580> by<00:02:13.000> using<00:02:13.210> that

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
and keep it original by using that

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.080 
and keep it original by using that
because<00:02:14.140> I<00:02:14.380> mean<00:02:14.530> every<00:02:15.250> single<00:02:15.400> sniper<00:02:15.730> out

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
because I mean every single sniper out

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.540 
because I mean every single sniper out
there<00:02:16.300> uses<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:18.670> m40<00:02:19.350> I<00:02:20.350> like<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.130> mix<00:02:21.250> up

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
there uses the the m40 I like to mix up

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.830 
there uses the the m40 I like to mix up
and<00:02:21.760> use<00:02:21.880> all<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.090> different<00:02:22.390> snipers

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
and use all the different snipers

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.110 
and use all the different snipers
especially<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.650> r700<00:02:24.070> just<00:02:24.520> because<00:02:24.790> I<00:02:25.000> think

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
especially the r700 just because I think

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.090 
especially the r700 just because I think
you<00:02:25.360> look<00:02:25.480> so<00:02:25.780> that<00:02:26.050> it's<00:02:26.560> my<00:02:26.680> favorite

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.700 
you look so that it's my favorite
looking<00:02:27.310> sniper<00:02:27.580> for<00:02:27.820> sure<00:02:28.060> like<00:02:29.020> broadening

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
looking sniper for sure like broadening

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.140 
looking sniper for sure like broadening
my<00:02:29.770> favorite<00:02:30.130> looking<00:02:30.370> gun<00:02:30.550> between<00:02:30.820> all<00:02:31.030> the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
my favorite looking gun between all the

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.810 
my favorite looking gun between all the
Cod's<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:31.930> I'd<00:02:32.680> use<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:33.010> whenever<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:33.400> can<00:02:33.670> the

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
Cod's so I'd use it whenever I can the

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.490 
Cod's so I'd use it whenever I can the
only<00:02:33.850> bad<00:02:34.150> thing<00:02:34.180> is<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.690> hit<00:02:34.870> markers<00:02:35.290> that

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
only bad thing is the hit markers that

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.200 
only bad thing is the hit markers that
constantly<00:02:36.250> you<00:02:36.370> get<00:02:36.490> hit<00:02:36.640> markets<00:02:36.970> with<00:02:37.090> this

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
constantly you get hit markets with this

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.900 
constantly you get hit markets with this
gun<00:02:37.950> but<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:39.100> think<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:39.430> is<00:02:39.490> already<00:02:39.790> coming

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
gun but I think this is already coming

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.020 
gun but I think this is already coming
to<00:02:40.030> an<00:02:40.120> end<00:02:40.300> actually<00:02:40.920> my<00:02:41.920> just<00:02:42.100> burden<00:02:42.700> aid<00:02:42.850> up
