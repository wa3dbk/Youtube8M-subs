00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.460
 cold pressed wheat and then the 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.640

 to help me lose weight 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.759
 well then I tell you about the vitamin e that 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.620
 is in the germ of wheat in the oil 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.210
 of wheat germ 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.370
 and he will help us for his own 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.190
 metabolism but the oil itself 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:58.360
 cold-pressed wheat germ is a 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.900
 Live oil is an unsaturated oil is 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.230
 an oil that when we take it 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:08.470
 is used for cellular metabolism is not 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:11.020
 an oil that accumulates in fact there 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.930
 scientific studies that show that 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.810
 when we supply a good 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.210
 amount of oil alive as oil 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.960
 of wheat germ or as the oil of 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:26.620
 flax the body itself assimilating this 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.480
 is what makes this quality oil what 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.090
 that makes its return to fats 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.420
 saturated that we have retained in the 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.060
 body especially in the abdomen area 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.280
 then when the body we give it the 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.750
 good fat the body releases the fat 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:47.050
 bad or the saturated fat that we have 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.120
