purpley<00:02:17.870> on<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.110> ends<00:02:18.410> but<00:02:18.560> not<00:02:18.620> enough<00:02:19.070> that

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
purpley on the ends but not enough that

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:28.479 
purpley on the ends but not enough that
it<00:02:19.430> would<00:02:19.550> do<00:02:19.700> anything<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.330> blue

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.000 

onto<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.610> blue<00:02:29.879> I<00:02:29.910> use<00:02:30.390> directions<00:02:31.319> hair<00:02:31.770> dye

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
onto the blue I use directions hair dye

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.600 
onto the blue I use directions hair dye
in<00:02:32.430> midnight<00:02:33.030> blue<00:02:33.269> and<00:02:33.830> a<00:02:34.830> whole<00:02:35.310> bunch<00:02:35.489> of

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
in midnight blue and a whole bunch of

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:44.510 
in midnight blue and a whole bunch of
conditioner<00:02:36.150> again

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:51.390 

you

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.960 

I<00:02:51.459> took<00:02:52.420> three<00:02:52.840> little<00:02:53.349> teeny<00:02:53.709> tiny<00:02:53.860> drops<00:02:54.489> I

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
I took three little teeny tiny drops I

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.520 
I took three little teeny tiny drops I
think<00:02:55.269> I'm<00:02:55.390> showing<00:02:55.569> you<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.930> size<00:02:56.170> of<00:02:56.439> the

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
think I'm showing you the size of the

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.110 
think I'm showing you the size of the
drops<00:02:56.799> but<00:02:57.189> three<00:02:57.459> of<00:02:57.549> those<00:02:57.670> little<00:02:57.909> teeny

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
drops but three of those little teeny

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.699 
drops but three of those little teeny
tiny<00:02:58.390> drops<00:02:58.689> and<00:02:58.900> I<00:02:58.959> put<00:02:59.110> it<00:02:59.200> into<00:02:59.470> about<00:02:59.650> a

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
tiny drops and I put it into about a

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.190 
tiny drops and I put it into about a
scoop<00:03:00.159> like<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.819> handful<00:03:01.329> of<00:03:01.390> conditioner<00:03:01.989> and

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
scoop like a handful of conditioner and

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.619 
scoop like a handful of conditioner and
I<00:03:02.500> mixed<00:03:02.769> it<00:03:02.890> together<00:03:03.000> into<00:03:04.000> almost<00:03:04.329> like<00:03:04.599> a

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629 
I mixed it together into almost like a

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:12.080 
I mixed it together into almost like a
dark<00:03:05.189> sky<00:03:06.189> blue<00:03:06.610> color

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.089 

so<00:03:12.780> you're<00:03:12.900> going<00:03:13.050> to<00:03:13.080> need<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.260> lot<00:03:13.500> of<00:03:13.530> foil<00:03:13.860> I

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
so you're going to need a lot of foil I

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.270 
so you're going to need a lot of foil I
laid<00:03:14.340> down<00:03:14.370> oil<00:03:14.870> flat<00:03:15.870> on<00:03:16.110> my<00:03:16.290> surface<00:03:16.830> and

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
laid down oil flat on my surface and

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.979 
laid down oil flat on my surface and
then<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.790> took<00:03:18.060> each<00:03:18.270> weft

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
then I took each weft

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.350 
then I took each weft
laid<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.590> out<00:03:19.680> flat<00:03:20.069> and<00:03:20.370> separated<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.150> into

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
laid it out flat and separated it into

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.270 
laid it out flat and separated it into
sections<00:03:21.599> probably<00:03:22.349> about<00:03:22.590> an<00:03:22.770> inch<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:23.190> an

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
sections probably about an inch to an

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.070 
sections probably about an inch to an
inch<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:23.640> half<00:03:23.670> thick<00:03:24.090> just<00:03:24.540> randomly

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
inch and a half thick just randomly

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.260 
inch and a half thick just randomly
wherever<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.709> want<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.040> on<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.250> left<00:03:26.430> then<00:03:27.180> I

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
wherever I want it on the left then I

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.600 
wherever I want it on the left then I
laid<00:03:27.480> down<00:03:27.510> that<00:03:27.720> sky-blue<00:03:28.530> color<00:03:28.800> on<00:03:29.160> the

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
laid down that sky-blue color on the

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.809 
laid down that sky-blue color on the
ends<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.269> then<00:03:30.630> almost<00:03:30.959> in<00:03:31.110> a<00:03:31.170> v-shape<00:03:31.830> on<00:03:32.040> the

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
ends and then almost in a v-shape on the

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.880 
ends and then almost in a v-shape on the
hair<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.330> I<00:03:34.170> don't<00:03:34.380> really<00:03:34.530> know<00:03:34.709> if<00:03:34.739> I'm

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
hair and I don't really know if I'm

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.240 
hair and I don't really know if I'm
doing<00:03:35.130> it<00:03:35.190> right<00:03:35.519> technically<00:03:36.360> but<00:03:37.170> from<00:03:38.099> what

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
doing it right technically but from what

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.790 
doing it right technically but from what
I've<00:03:38.370> seen<00:03:38.519> in<00:03:38.840> hairdressers<00:03:39.840> videos<00:03:40.260> this<00:03:40.680> is

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
I've seen in hairdressers videos this is

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.500 
I've seen in hairdressers videos this is
how<00:03:40.920> they<00:03:41.069> did<00:03:41.250> balayage<00:03:41.640> when<00:03:42.150> they're<00:03:42.300> doing

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
how they did balayage when they're doing

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.479 
how they did balayage when they're doing
balayage<00:03:42.810> highlights<00:03:43.349> and<00:03:43.650> they<00:03:43.950> bleach<00:03:44.280> the

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
balayage highlights and they bleach the

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.430 
balayage highlights and they bleach the
hair<00:03:44.670> this<00:03:45.299> way<00:03:45.510> they<00:03:45.690> make<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:45.900> almost<00:03:46.140> like<00:03:46.350> a

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
hair this way they make it almost like a

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.039 
hair this way they make it almost like a
B<00:03:46.709> on<00:03:46.980> those<00:03:47.519> strands<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.209> then<00:03:48.299> they<00:03:48.450> blended

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
B on those strands and then they blended

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:57.559 
B on those strands and then they blended
it<00:03:49.200> on<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.410> end

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.210 

you

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.670 

and<00:04:01.760> then<00:04:01.880> after<00:04:02.180> I<00:04:02.210> got<00:04:02.360> it<00:04:02.540> on<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:03.290> ends<00:04:03.620> of

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
and then after I got it on the ends of

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.010 
and then after I got it on the ends of
the<00:04:03.800> hair<00:04:03.950> I<00:04:04.010> took<00:04:04.340> the<00:04:04.970> dark<00:04:05.240> blue<00:04:05.540> straight

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
the hair I took the dark blue straight

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.290 
the hair I took the dark blue straight
from<00:04:06.290> midnight<00:04:06.680> blue<00:04:06.920> and<00:04:07.130> I<00:04:07.520> put<00:04:07.730> it<00:04:07.820> on<00:04:07.880> just

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
from midnight blue and I put it on just

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.330 
from midnight blue and I put it on just
the<00:04:08.450> tips<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:08.990> blended<00:04:09.380> it<00:04:09.470> up<00:04:09.620> into<00:04:09.920> the<00:04:10.190> sky

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
the tips and blended it up into the sky

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.100 
the tips and blended it up into the sky
blue<00:04:10.760> so<00:04:11.060> it<00:04:11.120> was<00:04:11.210> kind<00:04:11.450> of<00:04:11.480> like<00:04:11.600> it<00:04:11.780> faded

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
blue so it was kind of like it faded

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.250 
blue so it was kind of like it faded
into<00:04:12.640> darker<00:04:13.640> blue<00:04:13.820> as<00:04:14.180> you<00:04:14.330> can<00:04:14.450> see

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260
