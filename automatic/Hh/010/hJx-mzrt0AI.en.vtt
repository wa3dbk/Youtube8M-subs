would<00:01:11.340> work<00:01:11.520> but<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.510> don't<00:01:12.630> actually<00:01:12.930> think

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
would work but I don't actually think

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.510 
would work but I don't actually think
there'd<00:01:13.500> be<00:01:13.560> animals<00:01:14.010> which<00:01:14.189> could<00:01:14.369> follow

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
there'd be animals which could follow

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.429 
there'd be animals which could follow
you<00:01:14.729> around<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:15.090> free<00:01:15.299> room<00:01:15.479> due<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.229> amount

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
you around a free room due to the amount

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.630 
you around a free room due to the amount
of<00:01:16.530> work<00:01:16.740> which<00:01:16.979> rocks<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.369> would<00:01:17.490> actually

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
of work which rocks I would actually

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.580 
of work which rocks I would actually
have<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.939> put<00:01:18.090> into<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> game<00:01:18.509> as<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:19.470> is

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
have to put into the game as it is

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.320 
have to put into the game as it is
actually<00:01:19.920> quite<00:01:20.130> hard<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.460> imagine<00:01:20.729> having<00:01:21.150> a

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
actually quite hard to imagine having a

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.730 
actually quite hard to imagine having a
dog<00:01:21.540> which<00:01:21.720> follows<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.170> around<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.560> free

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
room wherever you want I mean what would

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.350 
room wherever you want I mean what would
actually<00:01:26.009> happen<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> dog<00:01:26.610> if<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.119> go

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
actually happen to the dog if you go

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.600 
actually happen to the dog if you go
into<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.600> car<00:01:27.869> or<00:01:28.320> if<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.500> want<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.770> plane<00:01:29.040> you

really sure if the dog would actually

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.160 
really sure if the dog would actually
get<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.119> plane<00:01:33.329> or<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.570> car<00:01:33.750> with<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.020> you

tongue<00:01:35.549> hanging<00:01:35.759> out<00:01:35.970> but<00:01:36.600> I'm<00:01:36.810> not<00:01:36.869> too<00:01:37.560> sure

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
tongue hanging out but I'm not too sure

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.440 
tongue hanging out but I'm not too sure
what<00:01:37.860> would<00:01:38.009> actually<00:01:38.220> happen<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.549> them<00:01:38.670> as<00:01:38.790> it

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
what would actually happen to them as it

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.510 
what would actually happen to them as it
does<00:01:39.600> really<00:01:39.869> sound<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.170> bit<00:01:40.220> it<00:01:41.220> didn't<00:01:41.430> really

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
does really sound a bit it didn't really

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.450 
does really sound a bit it didn't really
sound<00:01:41.729> right<00:01:42.119> really<00:01:43.220> but<00:01:44.220> what<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.399> would

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
sound right really but what I would

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.800 
sound right really but what I would
actually<00:01:44.729> think<00:01:44.880> would<00:01:45.090> happen<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.420> pets<00:01:45.630> is

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
actually think would happen to pets is

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.630 
actually think would happen to pets is
that<00:01:46.229> there<00:01:46.380> would<00:01:46.470> be<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.619> feature<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.430> your

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
that there would be a feature of your

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.490 
that there would be a feature of your
apartment<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.299> if<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.140> would<00:01:49.259> be<00:01:49.350> able<00:01:49.409> to

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
apartment so if you would be able to

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.050 
apartment so if you would be able to
customize<00:01:49.680> your<00:01:50.040> apartment<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.700> future

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
customize your apartment in the future

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.580 
customize your apartment in the future
then<00:01:51.600> you'll<00:01:51.720> be<00:01:51.869> able<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.079> buy<00:01:52.229> things<00:01:52.439> to

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
then you'll be able to buy things to

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.170 
then you'll be able to buy things to
your<00:01:52.710> pets<00:01:52.950> such<00:01:53.130> as<00:01:53.159> beds<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.790> things<00:01:53.970> like

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
your pets such as beds and things like

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.480 
your pets such as beds and things like
that<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:55.439> think<00:01:55.590> possibly<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.189> pet<00:01:56.369> would

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
that and I think possibly the pet would

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.469 
that and I think possibly the pet would
be<00:01:56.579> able<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.759> follow<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.149> around<00:01:57.270> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
be able to follow you around the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.330 
be able to follow you around the
apartment<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:58.530> you'd<00:01:58.710> have<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.860> dog<00:01:59.100> which<00:01:59.310> is

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
apartment so you'd have a dog which is

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.010 
apartment so you'd have a dog which is
following<00:01:59.759> you<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.689> either<00:02:00.750> choose

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
following you and you can either choose

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.480 
following you and you can either choose
if<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.259> wanted<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.590> follow<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.799> or<00:02:01.920> not<00:02:02.040> if

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
if you wanted to follow you or not if

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.060 
if you wanted to follow you or not if
you<00:02:02.700> want<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.000> be<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
you want it to be in the

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.430 
you want it to be in the
on<00:02:04.550> the<00:02:05.000> bed<00:02:05.210> or<00:02:05.510> you<00:02:05.600> want<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:05.780> sit<00:02:06.110> on<00:02:06.140> say<00:02:06.410> for

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
on the bed or you want to sit on say for

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.200 
on the bed or you want to sit on say for
us<00:02:06.650> and<00:02:06.800> then<00:02:06.920> then<00:02:07.400> I<00:02:07.730> think<00:02:07.940> that'd<00:02:08.060> be<00:02:08.180> a

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
us and then then I think that'd be a

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.440 
us and then then I think that'd be a
pretty<00:02:08.450> cool<00:02:08.540> thing<00:02:09.040> but<00:02:10.040> I'm<00:02:10.580> not<00:02:10.880> too<00:02:11.240> sure

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
pretty cool thing but I'm not too sure

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.410 
pretty cool thing but I'm not too sure
if<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:12.500> pet<00:02:13.400> would<00:02:13.580> be<00:02:13.760> able<00:02:13.850> to<00:02:14.060> leave<00:02:14.270> the

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
if the pet would be able to leave the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.450 
if the pet would be able to leave the
apartment<00:02:14.860> which<00:02:15.860> is<00:02:15.920> a<00:02:16.010> bit<00:02:16.160> of<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:16.250> shame

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
apartment which is a bit of a shame

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.900 
apartment which is a bit of a shame
really

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
really

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.820 
really
but<00:02:17.480> I'm<00:02:17.690> not<00:02:17.810> really<00:02:18.050> expecting<00:02:18.620> it<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.770> be

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
but I'm not really expecting it to be

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.650 
but I'm not really expecting it to be
honest<00:02:19.100> now<00:02:19.820> I'm<00:02:19.940> one<00:02:20.090> of<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.240> missions<00:02:20.540> of

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
Franklin actually had a dog and he would

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.660 
Franklin actually had a dog and he would

actually is called chop and actually in

actually is called chop and actually in
the<00:02:31.250> gta5<00:02:31.910> campaign<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:33.140> you're<00:02:33.890> actually

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
the gta5 campaign and you're actually

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.520 
the gta5 campaign and you're actually
able<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.460> play<00:02:34.850> with<00:02:35.000> him<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.260> he<00:02:36.260> could

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
able to play with him and he could

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.500 
able to play with him and he could
follow<00:02:36.709> you<00:02:36.890> around<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.430> he<00:02:37.880> played<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:38.420> know

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
follow you around and he played you know

follow you around and he played you know
could<00:02:38.660> play<00:02:38.780> all<00:02:39.140> with<00:02:39.350> him<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:39.620> things<00:02:39.740> like

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
could play all with him and things like

could play all with him and things like
that<00:02:39.920> now<00:02:40.490> actually<00:02:40.910> in<00:02:41.090> this<00:02:41.480> campaign<00:02:41.930> I

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
that now actually in this campaign I

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.199 
that now actually in this campaign I
think<00:02:42.860> you're<00:02:43.130> actually<00:02:43.370> able<00:02:43.490> to<00:02:43.640> play<00:02:43.970> as

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
think you're actually able to play as

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.790 
think you're actually able to play as
chop<00:02:44.690> so<00:02:45.650> I'm<00:02:46.400> not<00:02:46.610> sure<00:02:46.670> if<00:02:47.270> that's<00:02:48.200> of<00:02:48.530> sort

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
chop so I'm not sure if that's of sort

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.580 
chop so I'm not sure if that's of sort
of<00:02:48.830> a<00:02:48.950> bit<00:02:49.190> of<00:02:49.280> a<00:02:49.370> hint<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:50.330> do<00:02:50.570> whether<00:02:50.840> you

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
of a bit of a hint to do whether you

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.100 
of a bit of a hint to do whether you
could<00:02:51.770> have<00:02:51.980> me<00:02:52.160> free<00:02:52.400> Roma<00:02:52.610> not<00:02:52.850> but<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.959> meet

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
could have me free Roma not but to meet

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.780 
could have me free Roma not but to meet
that<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:54.290> know<00:02:54.350> that<00:02:54.500> was<00:02:54.680> only<00:02:54.860> one<00:02:55.340> mission

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
that you know that was only one mission

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.479 
that you know that was only one mission
that<00:02:55.820> was<00:02:56.180> one<00:02:56.390> very<00:02:56.720> small<00:02:57.170> mission<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.739> if

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
that was one very small mission and if

00:02:58.489 --> 00:02:59.830 
that was one very small mission and if
they<00:02:58.700> were<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:58.850> make<00:02:59.030> that<00:02:59.180> into<00:02:59.390> free<00:02:59.600> room

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
they were to make that into free room

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.160 
they were to make that into free room
then<00:03:00.080> I'd<00:03:00.320> be<00:03:00.590> very<00:03:00.739> surprised
