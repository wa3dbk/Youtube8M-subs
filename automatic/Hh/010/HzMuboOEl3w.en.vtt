00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.780 

I<00:00:04.640> think<00:00:05.390> sometimes<00:00:05.570> we<00:00:05.870> get<00:00:05.990> hung<00:00:06.350> up<00:00:06.530> on

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:06.790 
I think sometimes we get hung up on

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.210 
I think sometimes we get hung up on
surfaces<00:00:07.790> meaning<00:00:08.149> is<00:00:08.690> this<00:00:09.110> the<00:00:09.440> best

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:10.220 
surfaces meaning is this the best

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.670 
surfaces meaning is this the best
archival<00:00:11.000> surface<00:00:11.570> or<00:00:11.870> is<00:00:12.020> this<00:00:12.230> is<00:00:12.500> it's

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:12.680 
archival surface or is this is it's

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.440 
archival surface or is this is it's
gonna<00:00:12.830> withstand<00:00:13.070> the<00:00:13.490> test<00:00:13.700> of<00:00:13.850> time<00:00:13.910> and<00:00:14.090> all

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
gonna withstand the test of time and all

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.080 
gonna withstand the test of time and all
these<00:00:14.840> things<00:00:15.170> and<00:00:15.460> we<00:00:16.460> do<00:00:16.640> have<00:00:16.910> some<00:00:17.720> great

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
these things and we do have some great

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.170 
these things and we do have some great
surfaces<00:00:20.090> to<00:00:20.300> to<00:00:20.720> work<00:00:20.900> on<00:00:21.369> but<00:00:22.369> I<00:00:22.669> believe

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
surfaces to to work on but I believe

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.659 
surfaces to to work on but I believe
when<00:00:24.020> you're<00:00:24.349> working<00:00:24.680> on<00:00:24.770> studies<00:00:25.250> when<00:00:25.550> you

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:25.669 
when you're working on studies when you

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:27.460 
when you're working on studies when you
have<00:00:25.939> an<00:00:26.029> idea<00:00:26.390> and<00:00:26.570> you<00:00:26.689> want<00:00:26.720> to<00:00:26.930> get<00:00:27.140> it<00:00:27.290> down

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
have an idea and you want to get it down

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.950 
have an idea and you want to get it down
the<00:00:27.829> most<00:00:28.099> important<00:00:28.550> stuff<00:00:28.790> part<00:00:29.720> I<00:00:29.930> should

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
the most important stuff part I should

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.729 
the most important stuff part I should
say<00:00:30.290> is<00:00:30.439> you<00:00:30.560> just<00:00:30.710> getting<00:00:31.009> it<00:00:31.160> down<00:00:31.340> and<00:00:31.730> and

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
say is you just getting it down and and

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.380 
say is you just getting it down and and
that's<00:00:33.739> why<00:00:33.920> I<00:00:33.950> do<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:34.280> paper<00:00:34.550> studies<00:00:35.060> I<00:00:35.180> call

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
that's why I do the paper studies I call

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.819 
that's why I do the paper studies I call
them<00:00:35.540> I<00:00:35.600> think<00:00:35.660> some<00:00:35.960> of<00:00:36.050> you've<00:00:36.200> seen<00:00:36.290> it<00:00:36.649> and

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
them I think some of you've seen it and

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.160 
them I think some of you've seen it and
I<00:00:37.309> really<00:00:37.640> really<00:00:37.910> enjoy<00:00:38.269> doing<00:00:38.510> them<00:00:38.719> in<00:00:38.899> and

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
I really really enjoy doing them in and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.160 
I really really enjoy doing them in and
those<00:00:39.500> are<00:00:39.739> pieces<00:00:40.579> that<00:00:40.820> I<00:00:40.969> go<00:00:41.180> back<00:00:41.449> to<00:00:41.750> when

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
those are pieces that I go back to when

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.099 
those are pieces that I go back to when
I<00:00:42.199> want<00:00:42.530> to<00:00:42.620> work<00:00:42.890> work<00:00:43.789> them<00:00:44.030> up<00:00:44.059> larger<00:00:44.809> so

00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:45.109 
I want to work work them up larger so

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:47.490 
I want to work work them up larger so
this<00:00:45.949> was<00:00:46.250> actually<00:00:46.399> a<00:00:46.670> piece<00:00:46.969> of<00:00:47.120> cardboard

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
this was actually a piece of cardboard

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.130 
this was actually a piece of cardboard
backing<00:00:48.500> material<00:00:48.800> for<00:00:49.370> a<00:00:49.399> calendar<00:00:49.850> so<00:00:50.809> it

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
backing material for a calendar so it

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.430 
backing material for a calendar so it
was<00:00:51.260> a<00:00:51.289> large<00:00:51.829> like<00:00:52.070> 18<00:00:52.489> by<00:00:52.640> 24<00:00:53.170> sheet<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:54.379> I

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
was a large like 18 by 24 sheet and I

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.369 
was a large like 18 by 24 sheet and I
cut<00:00:54.679> it<00:00:54.769> up<00:00:54.829> to<00:00:55.250> be<00:00:55.370> small<00:00:55.699> 6<00:00:56.030> by<00:00:56.210> 8<00:00:56.239> pieces<00:00:57.019> and

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
cut it up to be small 6 by 8 pieces and

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.459 
cut it up to be small 6 by 8 pieces and
this<00:00:57.440> is<00:00:57.620> a<00:00:57.649> 6<00:00:57.949> by<00:00:58.100> 8<00:00:58.449> piece<00:00:59.449> that<00:00:59.660> you<00:00:59.780> see<00:01:00.019> here

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
this is a 6 by 8 piece that you see here

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.049 
this is a 6 by 8 piece that you see here
but<00:01:00.980> I<00:01:01.039> thought<00:01:01.309> this<00:01:01.519> would<00:01:01.640> be<00:01:01.699> just<00:01:01.910> a

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
but I thought this would be just a

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.290 
but I thought this would be just a
perfect<00:01:02.570> midtone<00:01:03.289> to<00:01:03.949> start<00:01:04.220> from<00:01:04.550> so<00:01:05.150> how

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
perfect midtone to start from so how

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.340 
perfect midtone to start from so how
wonderful<00:01:05.780> is<00:01:05.900> that

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
wonderful is that

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.320 
wonderful is that
so<00:01:06.610> I<00:01:07.870> don't<00:01:08.870> have<00:01:09.020> to<00:01:09.140> put<00:01:09.860> any<00:01:10.180> values<00:01:11.180> down

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
so I don't have to put any values down

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.600 
so I don't have to put any values down
to<00:01:11.540> start<00:01:11.810> from<00:01:12.080> it's<00:01:12.290> not<00:01:12.440> stark<00:01:12.860> white<00:01:13.130> it's

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
to start from it's not stark white it's

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.400 
to start from it's not stark white it's
just<00:01:13.820> I<00:01:14.030> thought<00:01:14.390> it'll<00:01:14.600> be<00:01:14.750> perfect<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:15.350> just

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
just I thought it'll be perfect and just

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.110 
just I thought it'll be perfect and just
to<00:01:15.590> show<00:01:15.800> you<00:01:15.830> that<00:01:16.100> you<00:01:16.190> can<00:01:16.340> do<00:01:16.490> so<00:01:16.700> much<00:01:16.910> with

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
to show you that you can do so much with

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.510 
to show you that you can do so much with
with<00:01:17.720> so<00:01:17.930> little<00:01:18.200> you<00:01:18.770> don't<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.070> spend<00:01:19.280> a<00:01:19.370> lot

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
with so little you don't you spend a lot

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.760 
with so little you don't you spend a lot
of<00:01:19.550> money<00:01:19.760> on<00:01:20.030> experience<00:01:20.870> of<00:01:20.990> surfaces<00:01:21.530> so

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
of money on experience of surfaces so

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.390 
of money on experience of surfaces so
the<00:01:22.250> second<00:01:22.640> step<00:01:22.790> was<00:01:23.030> just<00:01:23.090> laying<00:01:23.690> in

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
the second step was just laying in

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.150 
the second step was just laying in
establishing<00:01:25.720> starting<00:01:26.720> to<00:01:26.990> establish<00:01:27.620> the

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
establishing starting to establish the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
establishing starting to establish the
form<00:01:28.490> and<00:01:28.670> I<00:01:28.760> put<00:01:29.660> on<00:01:29.840> first<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:31.310> darkest<00:01:31.970> dark

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
form and I put on first the darkest dark

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.760 
form and I put on first the darkest dark
that's<00:01:32.390> what<00:01:32.570> I<00:01:32.600> generally<00:01:33.050> start<00:01:33.110> from<00:01:33.530> some

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
that's what I generally start from some

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.200 
that's what I generally start from some
of<00:01:33.890> you<00:01:33.980> that<00:01:34.010> have<00:01:34.160> taken<00:01:34.430> workshops<00:01:35.000> with<00:01:35.150> me

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
of you that have taken workshops with me

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.410 
of you that have taken workshops with me
you<00:01:35.330> know<00:01:35.450> that<00:01:35.660> I<00:01:35.900> kind<00:01:36.650> of<00:01:36.790> that's<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:38.210> way<00:01:38.390> I

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
you know that I kind of that's the way I

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.690 
you know that I kind of that's the way I
generally<00:01:39.230> approach<00:01:39.560> my<00:01:39.890> doesn't<00:01:40.550> matter

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
generally approach my doesn't matter

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.850 
generally approach my doesn't matter
what<00:01:41.000> what<00:01:41.570> type<00:01:42.200> of<00:01:42.230> painting<00:01:42.560> it<00:01:42.740> is

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
what what type of painting it is

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.340 
what what type of painting it is
architectural<00:01:43.520> or<00:01:43.610> landscape<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:44.360> this

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
architectural or landscape and this

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.710 
architectural or landscape and this
second<00:01:46.070> thing<00:01:46.730> I<00:01:46.880> did<00:01:47.090> here<00:01:47.240> right<00:01:47.450> away<00:01:47.570> I

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
second thing I did here right away I

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.230 
second thing I did here right away I
didn't<00:01:48.050> wait<00:01:48.200> for<00:01:48.230> the<00:01:48.470> sky<00:01:48.800> I<00:01:49.100> put<00:01:50.030> it<00:01:50.150> a

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
didn't wait for the sky I put it a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.950 
didn't wait for the sky I put it a
cerulean<00:01:50.600> hue<00:01:51.790> not<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:52.970> pure<00:01:53.240> cerulean<00:01:53.840> but

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
cerulean hue not the pure cerulean but

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.930 
cerulean hue not the pure cerulean but
to<00:01:54.080> cerulean<00:01:54.290> hue<00:01:54.860> that's<00:01:55.250> what<00:01:55.400> I<00:01:55.430> used<00:01:55.760> here

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
to cerulean hue that's what I used here

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.960 
to cerulean hue that's what I used here
and<00:01:56.450> it's<00:01:56.900> a<00:01:57.110> cheaper<00:01:57.770> color<00:01:58.010> and<00:01:58.310> it's<00:01:58.550> a<00:01:58.700> lot

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
and it's a cheaper color and it's a lot

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.570 
and it's a cheaper color and it's a lot
more<00:01:59.180> intense<00:01:59.540> than<00:01:59.840> this<00:01:59.990> pure<00:02:00.290> Cillian<00:02:00.770> so<00:02:01.550> I

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
more intense than this pure Cillian so I

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.810 
more intense than this pure Cillian so I
would<00:02:01.970> highly<00:02:02.600> urge<00:02:02.750> you<00:02:02.960> to<00:02:03.110> test<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:03.740> out<00:02:03.890> so

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
would highly urge you to test it out so

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.430 
would highly urge you to test it out so
the<00:02:05.120> the<00:02:05.420> third<00:02:05.990> step<00:02:06.290> here<00:02:06.850> laying<00:02:07.850> down<00:02:08.440> some

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
the the third step here laying down some

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.810 
the the third step here laying down some
darks<00:02:09.800> again<00:02:10.099> and<00:02:11.140> I'm<00:02:12.370> establishing<00:02:13.370> the

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
darks again and I'm establishing the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.390 
darks again and I'm establishing the
form<00:02:14.180> more<00:02:14.720> which<00:02:15.050> is<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.770> tree<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:16.130> the

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
form more which is the the tree is the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.800 
form more which is the the tree is the
the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
the

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.260 
the

between this yellow ocher right here one
pointing<00:02:22.060> this<00:02:22.330> is<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.630> board<00:02:22.959> this<00:02:23.380> is<00:02:23.440> the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
pointing this is the board this is the

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.260 
pointing this is the board this is the
board<00:02:23.860> showing<00:02:24.280> through<00:02:24.580> like<00:02:24.790> right<00:02:25.030> here

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
board showing through like right here

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.180 
board showing through like right here
you<00:02:25.300> can<00:02:25.480> see<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.810> too<00:02:25.989> right<00:02:26.709> here<00:02:26.890> it's<00:02:27.040> the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
you can see it too right here it's the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.720 
you can see it too right here it's the
board<00:02:27.459> so<00:02:28.239> it's<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.440> same<00:02:29.650> or<00:02:29.920> similar<00:02:30.069> value

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
board so it's the same or similar value

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.120 
board so it's the same or similar value
as<00:02:30.910> all<00:02:31.090> these<00:02:31.300> things<00:02:31.569> here<00:02:32.020> and<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.739> really

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
as all these things here and it really

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
as all these things here and it really
adds<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:33.760> nice<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:34.590> nice<00:02:35.590> backdrop<00:02:36.099> and<00:02:36.730> right

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
adds a nice a nice backdrop and right

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.300 
adds a nice a nice backdrop and right
here<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:37.480> can<00:02:37.660> see<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:38.040> board<00:02:39.040> kind<00:02:39.250> of

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
here you can see the board kind of

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.130 
here you can see the board kind of
peeking<00:02:39.670> through<00:02:39.700> it's<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.090> really<00:02:40.390> great<00:02:40.750> mid

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
peeking through it's a really great mid

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.040 
peeking through it's a really great mid
value<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:42.310> work<00:02:42.489> on<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:42.760> thought<00:02:43.150> so<00:02:43.900> the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
value to to work on I thought so the

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.620 
value to to work on I thought so the
next<00:02:44.230> step<00:02:44.500> again<00:02:44.739> anchoring<00:02:45.400> down<00:02:46.209> with<00:02:46.510> the

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
next step again anchoring down with the

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.120 
next step again anchoring down with the
shadow<00:02:48.390> adding<00:02:49.390> a<00:02:49.600> little<00:02:49.840> bit<00:02:49.959> more<00:02:50.130> tree

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
shadow adding a little bit more tree

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.210 
shadow adding a little bit more tree
limb<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:52.030> some<00:02:52.360> some<00:02:52.690> other<00:02:53.080> snow<00:02:53.560> snow<00:02:54.010> or

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
limb and some some other snow snow or

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.070 
limb and some some other snow snow or
area<00:02:54.850> sometimes<00:02:55.239> people's<00:02:55.540> trees<00:02:55.870> are

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
area sometimes people's trees are

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.100 
area sometimes people's trees are
hovering<00:02:56.500> it's<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:56.709> good<00:02:56.860> idea<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:58.750> anchor

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
hovering it's a good idea to to anchor

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.270 
hovering it's a good idea to to anchor
and<00:02:59.260> down<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.620> you'll<00:02:59.769> see<00:02:59.950> in<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.130> other

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
and down and you'll see in the other

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.780 
and down and you'll see in the other
steps<00:03:00.670> what<00:03:00.970> I<00:03:01.000> what<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:01.569> continue<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:02.260> do<00:03:02.799> and<00:03:03.730> I

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
steps what I what I continue to do and I

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.940 
steps what I what I continue to do and I
took<00:03:03.849> a<00:03:04.150> picture<00:03:04.569> of<00:03:04.750> my<00:03:04.989> pallet<00:03:05.530> as<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:05.769> was

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
took a picture of my pallet as I was

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.789 
took a picture of my pallet as I was
progressing<00:03:06.549> you<00:03:06.640> can<00:03:06.790> see<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.090> harmony<00:03:07.799> how

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
progressing you can see the harmony how

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.850 
progressing you can see the harmony how
they're<00:03:09.569> you<00:03:10.569> know<00:03:10.599> in<00:03:10.930> harmony<00:03:11.440> there's<00:03:11.680> no

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
they're you know in harmony there's no

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.410 
they're you know in harmony there's no
weird<00:03:12.190> green<00:03:13.180> like<00:03:13.510> put<00:03:14.380> right<00:03:14.590> in<00:03:14.739> here<00:03:15.069> and<00:03:15.430> I

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
weird green like put right in here and I

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.729 
weird green like put right in here and I
think<00:03:16.540> that's<00:03:16.750> important<00:03:17.349> when<00:03:17.410> you<00:03:17.530> look<00:03:17.650> at

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
think that's important when you look at

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.830 
think that's important when you look at
your<00:03:17.890> pallet<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:18.310> it<00:03:18.580> should<00:03:18.910> be<00:03:18.940> in<00:03:19.120> harmony<00:03:19.720> I

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
your pallet it it should be in harmony I

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.360 
your pallet it it should be in harmony I
think<00:03:20.140> your<00:03:20.290> paintings<00:03:20.620> will<00:03:20.799> be<00:03:20.950> in<00:03:21.040> harmony

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
think your paintings will be in harmony

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
think your paintings will be in harmony
too<00:03:21.640> with<00:03:21.910> that<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:23.709> we<00:03:24.640> move<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.150> next

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
too with that so and we move to the next

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.440 
too with that so and we move to the next
step<00:03:25.720> so<00:03:26.070> let's<00:03:27.070> go<00:03:27.220> back<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.609> this<00:03:27.820> and<00:03:28.239> then

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
step so let's go back to this and then

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.180 
step so let's go back to this and then
you'll<00:03:28.600> see<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.930> progression<00:03:29.290> of<00:03:29.560> what<00:03:30.070> I'm

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
you'll see the progression of what I'm

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.750 
you'll see the progression of what I'm
doing<00:03:30.430> doing<00:03:31.239> putting<00:03:31.540> in<00:03:31.690> more<00:03:32.680> more<00:03:33.489> lights

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
doing doing putting in more more lights

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.199 
doing doing putting in more more lights

see this right here

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.379 
see this right here
connecting<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.400> tree<00:03:57.579> with<00:03:57.760> the<00:03:57.880> snow<00:03:58.120> so

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
connecting the tree with the snow so

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:00.960 
connecting the tree with the snow so
it's<00:03:58.510> not<00:03:58.660> separate<00:03:59.109> it's<00:03:59.319> not<00:03:59.530> hovering<00:03:59.970> and

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
also I put down the the top of the fence

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.910 
also I put down the the top of the fence
some<00:04:04.389> snow<00:04:04.720> kind<00:04:05.079> of<00:04:05.170> sitting<00:04:05.500> on<00:04:05.590> there<00:04:05.799> to

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
some snow kind of sitting on there to

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.160 
some snow kind of sitting on there to
separate<00:04:06.340> these<00:04:06.489> this<00:04:07.000> shape<00:04:07.299> and<00:04:07.569> this<00:04:07.870> shape

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
separate these this shape and this shape

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.210 
separate these this shape and this shape
and<00:04:09.000> finally<00:04:10.000> this<00:04:10.750> was<00:04:11.019> the<00:04:11.139> final<00:04:11.590> final

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
and finally this was the final final

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.420 
and finally this was the final final
step<00:04:12.459> again<00:04:12.850> this<00:04:13.000> was<00:04:13.150> all<00:04:13.329> six<00:04:14.049> by<00:04:14.260> eight

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
step again this was all six by eight

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
just looking for those big shapes and

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.100 
just looking for those big shapes and
currying<00:04:28.729> down<00:04:28.910> this<00:04:29.120> big<00:04:29.419> big<00:04:29.690> element

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110

we<00:04:32.419> know<00:04:32.600> it's<00:04:32.780> a<00:04:32.840> building<00:04:33.250> putting<00:04:34.250> some

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
we know it's a building putting some

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.240 
we know it's a building putting some
detail<00:04:35.000> in<00:04:35.030> here<00:04:35.419> and<00:04:35.540> there<00:04:35.750> and<00:04:36.020> and<00:04:36.919> that's

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
detail in here and there and and that's

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.320 
detail in here and there and and that's
it<00:04:37.490> so<00:04:37.900> try<00:04:38.900> not<00:04:38.930> to<00:04:39.139> over<00:04:39.650> detail<00:04:40.040> a<00:04:40.340> painting

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
it so try not to over detail a painting

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.629 
it so try not to over detail a painting
it's<00:04:41.630> I<00:04:41.810> know<00:04:41.960> it's<00:04:42.199> not<00:04:42.350> not<00:04:42.740> easy<00:04:43.010> but<00:04:43.340> the

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
it's I know it's not not easy but the

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.340 
it's I know it's not not easy but the
bigger<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:43.970> painting<00:04:44.330> gets<00:04:44.870> the<00:04:45.110> more<00:04:45.320> detail

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
bigger the painting gets the more detail

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.240 
bigger the painting gets the more detail
unfortunately<00:04:48.350> we<00:04:48.410> can<00:04:48.590> put<00:04:48.770> in<00:04:48.860> there<00:04:49.010> too<00:04:49.220> so

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
unfortunately we can put in there too so

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.520 
unfortunately we can put in there too so
