a few of videos already took him down
because<00:06:24.160> the<00:06:24.490> quality<00:06:24.880> was<00:06:25.000> kind<00:06:25.240> of<00:06:25.330> crappy

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
because the quality was kind of crappy

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.390 
because the quality was kind of crappy
on<00:06:26.169> the<00:06:26.260> angle<00:06:26.410> i<00:06:26.560> had<00:06:26.680> on<00:06:26.800> the<00:06:26.890> field<00:06:27.130> I

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
on the angle i had on the field I

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.100 
on the angle i had on the field I
trusted<00:06:27.970> someone<00:06:28.180> else's<00:06:28.510> stuff<00:06:28.630> the<00:06:28.780> camera

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
trusted someone else's stuff the camera

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.390 
trusted someone else's stuff the camera
and<00:06:29.260> I<00:06:29.350> just<00:06:29.500> didn't<00:06:29.740> really<00:06:29.980> like<00:06:30.130> the<00:06:30.250> way<00:06:30.280> it

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
and I just didn't really like the way it

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.110 
and I just didn't really like the way it
looked<00:06:30.580> so<00:06:30.850> until<00:06:31.630> next<00:06:31.660> time<00:06:31.930> guys
