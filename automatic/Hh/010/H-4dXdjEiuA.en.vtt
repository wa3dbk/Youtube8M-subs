00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.070
 the melÃ©ndez campus of the university 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.560
 del valle is an oasis of nature in 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.079
 middle of the city its landscape its 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.579
 trees and their temperature make it a 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.470
 nice place so much for your 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:32.399
 inhabitants as for those who come from 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.310
 visit some even come flying 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.250
 from distant countries 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.620
 well the project is called use of 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.570
 habitat of migratory birds near 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.720
 on the campus of the University of 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.240
 Valley 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.190
 this research seeks to know the 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.440
 times of arrival and permanence of 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.250
 birds that in winter time come from 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.720
 countries like canada and usa too 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.160
 identify what resources are that 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.160
 they are offered in this place 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.900
 practically what has been done has been 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.380
 place mist nets perform in 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:18.330
 your weekly newspapers and do counting 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.330
 of the birds that we observe 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.100
 what I do is make trips 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.510
 the university using binoculars 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.570
 looking for the birds in the trees and 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.720
 when I find them, I look first at what 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.479
 species of birds in which tree is the 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:40.490
 height where they are and I look 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:43.490
 what activity is doing it because in 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.290
 total I had an observation of 150 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.110
 individuals distributed in nine 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.290
 species over the nine months 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.830
 that the wintering season lasted 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.720
 these migratory birds the birds begin 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.170
 to arrive from the month of September and 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:05.119
 they start to leave so to speak in the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:07.520
 months of May and June I could observe 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.310
 11 species of migratory birds 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.310
 most are very small parties 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.020
 that eat insects when I saw the 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.120
 birds classified what they were 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.670
 doing and then I have five 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.239
 activities that are already done here they 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.490
 they feed they rest they groom themselves 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.760
 how to clean 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:31.060
 Take care of the feathers to close 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.040
 simply move and in the case of 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.300
 nocturnal bird to that activity the 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.300
 we call prolonged rest 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.019
 samplings were made throughout the 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.900
 campus because in all its spaces there are 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.030
 resources for these visitors all 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.500
 were released after offering the 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.280
 information necessary for 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.280
 investigation 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.860
 why
