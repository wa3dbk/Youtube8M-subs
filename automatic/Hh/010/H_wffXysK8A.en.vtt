 this palette of soeva which is the new one that 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.600
 it has left that it leaves on February 23 and 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.430
 good is the first test I have with 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.650
 her so I can not tell you how it goes 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.810
 already in another video later when the 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.050
 I have tried more and I will comment and good 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:46.860
 is from the collection a golden rose 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.960
 and good is this palette here is very 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.030
 pretty the truth things as they are and 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.010
 nothing because I hope you like it and 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.690
 you will see what is good to prepare the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.760
 eyelid the first thing I'm going to do is going to 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.860
 be apply this paint potes the paint 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.450
 early of emac I will apply it with a 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.600
 Synthetic brush all over the eyelid 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.600
 mobile 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.409
 and now of the palette we are going to take this 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.600
 shadow that is called golden group 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.210
 As will be said, we are going to apply here in 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.580
 the first third of the eye without going down to the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.000
 bottom part that we will put another one 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.000
 shadow 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.250
 in the second third we're going to put this 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.930
 what is the temple ingrid I will use the 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.930
 same brush is what on the other side 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.500
 and we are going to blur the 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.570
 and now blur the top cut 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.649
 Now with the shadow copper is king let's go 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.899
 to put it all over the missing eyelid 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.250
 by filling the same brush used 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.869
 truth is that as they go in these same 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.039
 tones I do not need to go changing 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.039
 brush every two for three 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.440
 and I go back to blur everything 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.700
 let's take it with the blur 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.210
 little bit up without catching more 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.210
 product 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.350
 well I in this palette miss 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.630
 an umbrella to light up so I'm going 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.630
 to catch one is in the 127 of kiko 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.280
 and now before continuing to carry out 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.439
 steps with the shadows we are going to apply the 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.329
 Eyeliner is completely optional if 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:34.030
 you want and it would also look very nice 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:36.579
 we could put a pencil outline 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.650
 blur it but I already wanted to 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:41.319
 time that did not do my my delineated and 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.180
 today I wanted one so I do not use anything 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.129
 the mega liner of wet and wild that is my 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.959
 favorite eyeliner you already know that I've 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.459
 outlined I do it quite dramatic 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.849
 I already tell you that you can do what 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.849
 what do you want 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.989
 now let's use the shadow more 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.209
 dark of the palette that is the wonderful 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.250
 but in this case we are going to use it 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.530
 with a brush type goal we're going to catch 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.300
 from where we have done the delineation 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.430
 where the basin starts in my case 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.769
 in this area and we are going to make the 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.180
 basin with this brush that is going to 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.780
 allow to do so much more 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.780
 concentrated 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.060
 and in the outer zone we will go 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.800
 diffusing a bit outwards though 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.140
 now blur we have a little more 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.910
 well before we do not apply shade in the 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.620
 part of the blur because we're going to 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.570
 apply now again with the umbrella 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.090
 redder of the palette that you know that 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.010
 these tones make us mad at all 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.200
 we use with the brush to blur from 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.660
 new and now let's blur both the 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.080
 basin in the reddish color as what goes 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.550
 to be the fake account or dark basin 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.590
 that we have created right now with the 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.900
 brush type pen if you want we can 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.910
 add again in the basin but that already 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.200
 we are seeing according to the taste that you want 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.200
 you who have you 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.269
 with a cat tongue brush 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.130
 you can also use the type again 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.820
 bol and I'm going to darken the area more 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.920
 outer lower eyelid 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.310
 and now I use this shadow which is the 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.840
 shadow support for the lower eyelid 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.460
 for what is the lower eyelid and 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.240
 let's blur with the one we just 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.240
 now put 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.230
 now I'm going to use this pencil which is 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:51.910
 the mac teddy and he used it for both 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.910
 water the island of arriola below 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.100
 Now I'm going to do a little bit of 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.370
 eyelashes I do not want to curl those much 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.230
 because if not with the mask I changed in 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.570
 the area above and I do not want but good 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.860
 we are going to use the curler in this case 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.860
 of eyelashes of l'orÃ©al 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.730
 for the tabs in this case use 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.650
 the butterflies the intense and over 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.730
 I'm going to give him another layer of spelled 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.730
 retrograde light 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.400
 well now as blusher I'm going to use 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:39.560
 this is the sea skewer is a very tone 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.240
 nice even though I thought that this did not 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.240
 I would put it but you already know that yes 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:51.119
 and now also others that I use the 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.489
 illuminator is the center of attention and 

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:54.869
 it was from a collection it has two tones 

00:05:53.489 --> 00:05:56.369
 as you are seeing here is the tone 

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:59.789
 pink and the golden tone and I'm going to mix 

00:05:56.369 --> 00:06:01.709
 both I'm going to apply so much in the high 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:03.809
 of the eyebrows as in the cupid's bow 

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:06.289
 in the analysis center I will not add 

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:06.289
 nothing 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.360
 as the first option of the lipstick that I come 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.460
 lately to give giving several noticed 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.870
 it said that something strange good I will 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.950
 use 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:25.680
 this pint at once from avon is 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:27.810
 a news pitch I do not know of what range they 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.220
 will because I wear it a lot and that 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.650
 simply explain a capita vale 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:35.030
 so that the lips do not look overloaded 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.030
 and the eye has more prominence 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.330
 and good girls now that I've curled the 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:52.780
 hair and I've got half cute you're going to 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:55.300
 have the link to the video of the hairstyle if 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.740
 is already up you have it here below and if 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.560
 It is not raised because what you are going to have 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.810
 coming soon so do not worry good 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.900
 as a second option I will use this 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:09.100
 This delhi plus profiler is the 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:11.330
 tone 01 is a brown cited burgundy more or 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.789
 less and you know that this one 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.500
 this eyeliner I love to combine it 

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:16.970
 with this fashionable lipstick that 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.780
 unfortunately I think you can not 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:23.509
 find ya but come on it's an equal tone 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.789
 that the profiler completely matte and 

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:28.520
 Well then you can look for another similar 

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:32.740
 It also has a gloss but I'm just going 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.740
 to use the lipstick 

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.960
 Good girls, I hope you liked it 

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:52.150
 this video and this makeup already 

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:55.770
 you will say that the way they like it most and 

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.770
 nothing we see in the next video
