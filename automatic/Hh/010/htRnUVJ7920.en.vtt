00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.140
 hairpins 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.060
 maybe not 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.550
 look at this as they call it 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.360
 here for us is a new look at that 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:08.520
 oberto show 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:13.709

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:16.109

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:20.630

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:24.860
 I say this to you bye bye 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:31.430
 that's great let's move on 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.430
 who knows if we find high odds 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:45.330
 we of all of us go on to the 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:49.020
 our forest card which is for everyone e 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:56.659
 who knows then we find another point 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:05:02.330
 here this is another face I am open 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:02.330
 and so even if not 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:22.919
 look a bit it's open right bye me 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:25.730
 we expect there is another cost to 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.730
 this sport 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:35.130
 here's another hole 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:38.900
 look at little open but always a 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.900
 nice coconut or want 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.979
 European 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:55.469
 look at gianluca what i found 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:58.680
 holes completely closed and go to 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:06:00.749
 Gianluca, however, for the avoidance of doubt 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:06.659
 you must always check that it is a 

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:10.680
 peak and that is if we do so if we find that 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:12.659
 below a color here it is 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.360
 you see this is a comedy q because 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:17.930
 you may never be careful of that 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.719
 gian luca this is definitely where 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:25.999
 new one and will not find it close though 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:25.999
 you must always do the same test 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:36.659
 always the same test slowly but 

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:40.709
 you still have to see the bovo color well 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:43.020
 there he is beautiful and the other sky not 

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:47.279
 there are doubts because it is open 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:51.589
 I should from here in another round than that 

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:51.589
 among other things, yes 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.160
 I am still 

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:09.830
 the best 

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:27.100
 and then this sum, however, I am 

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:29.330
 I don't therefore know a bit brando 

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:32.539
 past run took a little too much 

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:35.050
 low don't let them just do it 

00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:35.050
 we test
