00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
whatever you just buy something off yeah

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.690 
whatever you just buy something off yeah
but<00:00:59.079> here's<00:00:59.290> an<00:00:59.470> time<00:00:59.739> just<00:00:59.950> barely<00:01:00.220> opening

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
but here's an time just barely opening

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.619 
but here's an time just barely opening
to<00:01:00.910> nothing<00:01:01.329> I<00:01:02.640> haven't<00:01:03.640> like<00:01:04.180> actually

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
to nothing I haven't like actually

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.020 
to nothing I haven't like actually
looked<00:01:04.809> at<00:01:04.960> it<00:01:05.110> till<00:01:05.260> just<00:01:05.320> barely<00:01:05.710> but<00:01:06.190> try<00:01:06.970> to

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
looked at it till just barely but try to

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.810 
looked at it till just barely but try to
do<00:01:07.300> this<00:01:07.420> upon<00:01:07.780> arm<00:01:10.560> but<00:01:11.560> yeah<00:01:11.800> let's<00:01:12.100> see<00:01:12.250> it's

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
do this upon arm but yeah let's see it's

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.860 
do this upon arm but yeah let's see it's
a<00:01:13.320> pretty<00:01:14.320> cool<00:01:14.820> can't<00:01:15.820> wait<00:01:16.000> to<00:01:16.120> get<00:01:16.240> actually

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
a pretty cool can't wait to get actually

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.130 
a pretty cool can't wait to get actually
wired<00:01:17.110> in<00:01:17.350> stuff<00:01:17.830> but<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:19.299> blue<00:01:19.659> light<00:01:19.870> turns

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
wired in stuff but this blue light turns

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.840 
wired in stuff but this blue light turns
on<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:21.549> then<00:01:21.610> these<00:01:21.820> must<00:01:22.150> be<00:01:22.330> the<00:01:22.420> little

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
on and then these must be the little

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.270 
on and then these must be the little
brackets<00:01:24.850> that<00:01:25.030> go<00:01:25.060> on<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:26.110> end<00:01:26.530> right<00:01:27.100> here

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
brackets that go on the end right here

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.190 
brackets that go on the end right here
so<00:01:27.580> it<00:01:27.760> covers<00:01:28.060> this<00:01:28.390> part<00:01:28.690> up<00:01:28.810> right<00:01:28.990> here<00:01:29.140> so

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
so it covers this part up right here so

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.859 
so it covers this part up right here so
it<00:01:29.409> looks<00:01:29.560> like<00:01:29.619> fast<00:01:29.979> you<00:01:30.190> can<00:01:30.369> see<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.580> wires

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
it looks like fast you can see the wires

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.850 
it looks like fast you can see the wires
for<00:01:31.869> a<00:01:31.900> nice<00:01:32.020> clean<00:01:32.320> look<00:01:32.670> but<00:01:34.320> here's<00:01:35.320> figure

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
for a nice clean look but here's figure

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.550 
for a nice clean look but here's figure
out<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.159> just<00:01:36.820> a<00:01:36.880> model<00:01:37.240> just<00:01:37.810> for<00:01:38.049> subs

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
out the just a model just for subs

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.250 
out the just a model just for subs
basically<00:01:40.080> battery<00:01:41.080> ground<00:01:41.500> remote<00:01:42.180> fuses

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
basically battery ground remote fuses

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:50.100 
basically battery ground remote fuses
basic<00:01:44.260> things<00:01:46.350> pretty<00:01:47.350> cool<00:01:48.750> regular<00:01:49.750> screws

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
basic things pretty cool regular screws

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.230 
basic things pretty cool regular screws
for<00:01:52.740> but<00:01:53.740> for<00:01:54.189> gauge<00:01:54.430> wires<00:01:54.790> what<00:01:55.119> they

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
for but for gauge wires what they

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.350 
for but for gauge wires what they
recommend<00:01:55.780> for<00:01:56.049> or<00:01:56.500> two<00:01:56.820> will<00:01:57.820> both<00:01:57.970> fit<00:01:58.240> in

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
recommend for or two will both fit in

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.200 
recommend for or two will both fit in
here<00:01:58.570> right<00:01:59.110> up<00:01:59.200> on<00:01:59.350> already<00:01:59.820> check<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:01.030> other

I'm<00:02:04.240> sure<00:02:05.110> speaker<00:02:05.590> output<00:02:06.009> level<00:02:06.549> looks<00:02:07.000> like

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
I'm sure speaker output level looks like

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.629 
I'm sure speaker output level looks like
it<00:02:07.299> didn't<00:02:07.479> come<00:02:07.810> with<00:02:07.840> wall<00:02:08.560> mounted<00:02:09.009> right

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:09.639 
it didn't come with wall mounted right

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.989 
it didn't come with wall mounted right
here

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:09.999 
here

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:12.690

oh<00:02:10.079> that's<00:02:11.079> not<00:02:11.680> cool

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
oh that's not cool

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.360 
oh that's not cool
first<00:02:13.700> take<00:02:14.000> yes<00:02:14.569> they<00:02:15.530> got<00:02:15.709> your<00:02:15.830> scroop

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
first take yes they got your scroop

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.030 
first take yes they got your scroop
speaker<00:02:16.790> wire<00:02:16.970> outlet<00:02:17.450> output<00:02:17.989> and<00:02:18.410> then<00:02:18.620> you

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
speaker wire outlet output and then you

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.770 
speaker wire outlet output and then you
know<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.730> regular<00:02:20.000> inputs<00:02:20.599> outputs

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
know the regular inputs outputs

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.370 
know the regular inputs outputs
adjustments<00:02:21.680> gains<00:02:21.920> but<00:02:22.430> uh<00:02:22.459> and<00:02:23.380> remote
