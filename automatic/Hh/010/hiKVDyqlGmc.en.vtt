00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
snowboard what Center is and then go the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.849 
snowboard what Center is and then go the

that point so that way you're going to

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.870 
that point so that way you're going to
keep<00:01:39.990> an<00:01:40.710> even<00:01:40.950> distance<00:01:41.399> from<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.609> center<00:01:41.820> of

writing freestyle board and you're on a
ride<00:02:05.140> or<00:02:05.409> mountain<00:02:05.740> can<00:02:06.130> set<00:02:06.369> it<00:02:06.460> back<00:02:06.610> so<00:02:06.909> go

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
ride or mountain can set it back so go

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.359 
ride or mountain can set it back so go
back<00:02:07.270> a<00:02:07.690> notch<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.800> use<00:02:08.979> those<00:02:09.160> as<00:02:09.340> a

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
reference point again now if it's a

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.770 
reference point again now if it's a
power<00:02:11.410> today<00:02:11.640> it's<00:02:12.640> good<00:02:12.790> idea<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:13.510> set<00:02:13.690> your

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
bindings all the way back so what you

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.350 
bindings all the way back so what you
want<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.100> do<00:02:15.160> on<00:02:15.280> your<00:02:15.400> back<00:02:15.520> binding<00:02:15.760> you're

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
want to do on your back binding you're

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.150 
want to do on your back binding you're
going<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.569> set<00:02:16.780> up<00:02:16.900> right<00:02:17.440> on<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.770> very<00:02:17.890> back
