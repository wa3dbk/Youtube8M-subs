00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:07.970
 [Music] 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.850
 in 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:14.090
 two Andean parts 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.070
 and the bolero rhythm has more 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.390
 low combinations then we're going to 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.390
 make minor 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:27.240
 we make you a bass up 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.570
 and two works one under one acid for 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.230
 up and down in the first part 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.230
 then it would be like that 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.440
 the first part 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.440
 ah 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.570
 now come two secondary bass 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.480
 remember the bolero has a low 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.870
 main and two secondary basses 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.950
 then we have the main one in the 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.950
 secondary lows that are 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.220
 when we are in my youngest we put the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.610
 fourth finger on the sixth string 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.730
 we play 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.670
 and we make a sated up then 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.790
 we remove and play the fifth string and 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.270
 then we do a scrape for irrigation 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.850
 so if we write it is on air already 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.580
 we had seen this now we make a 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.750
 under a torn a low a loaded in 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:31.149
 that then 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:33.530
 [Music] 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:37.270
 remember the basses always touch 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.270
 this way not for me 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.170
 [Music] 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.170
 one 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:02:02.699
 [Music] 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.879
 i 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.879
 ah 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.660
 that's the rhythm now let's see how 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.880
 we do in different chords in my 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.030
 less 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:26.520
 [Music] 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.170
 when we do in the least we do 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.620
 in the same way as we did in the 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:36.000
 smaller but with the strings below 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:39.690
 remove fifth fifth fifth fifth 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.690
 fourth fifth the fifth place 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:47.860
 [Music] 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.050
 now 17 we vary 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.760
 in the fifth string to the in such as 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.760
 there is the fifth string 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.770
 we see ourselves sixth fifth in the air 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.540
 Maybe more 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.540
 6a 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:22.819
 second air second second air 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:24.400
 [Music] 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.449
 Y 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.449
 [Music] 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.870
 Now we are going to do C major 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.379
 in the same way as we did 17 from 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.379
 the fifth agreement 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:47.710
 fifth the air and we put everything greater 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:50.250
 [Music] 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.250
 and you 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.850
 now we put a greater 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.110
 the main bass the sixth string now 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.870
 fifth fourth sixth 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:09.370
 fifth fourth sixth fifth fifth fourth 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.370
 fifth fourth sixth 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.379
 of 7 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.470
 the fourth finger we go to the fourth is about 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:27.420
 the fourth string 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:27.420
 [Music] 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:36.529
 fourth air fourth fret third 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:40.910
 rope and air if it does not reach 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:44.249
 Your fingers can go down a bit and come back 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:47.369
 [Music] 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:50.389
 now in my 77 it changes a bit too 

00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:50.389
 the sixth string to the air 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.560
 then we make the fourth finger to 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:05:01.610
 back room 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:01.610
 [Music] 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.390
 here is a little clarification when 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:10.310
 we play chords of my youngest child or 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.140
 D minor 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.460
 always the secondary basses are made 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:19.899
 with the room of the extras 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.899
 [Music] 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.250
 but when we change the biggest or seventh 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.350
 the fourth finger goes down to the room after 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.579
 2007 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.579
 [Music] 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:36.770
 the biggest 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:39.259
 contrast most of the frets do not 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.509
 third frets and the fourth fret if it is 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:44.980
 that do not reach the fingers stretched him 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:48.020
 we take a little out and come back 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:51.880
 and if the fingers arrive there is no 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:55.300
 problem in the 72 the same way 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.300
 fourth fret 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:11.430
 re greater in the same way quarter back 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:11.430
