00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.419 
okay so this is the another little
experience<00:00:07.290> that<00:00:07.500> I<00:00:07.529> had<00:00:07.769> that<00:00:08.010> I<00:00:08.069> thought<00:00:08.309> was

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
experience that I had that I thought was

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.950 
experience that I had that I thought was
kind<00:00:08.639> of<00:00:08.700> interesting<00:00:10.310> this<00:00:11.310> is<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.970> visual

see<00:00:16.460> into<00:00:17.460> an<00:00:17.550> airport<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.119> know<00:00:18.300> very

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
see into an airport that I know very

see into an airport that I know very
well<00:00:20.449> at<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.869> on<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:22.980> flight<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.689> DA<00:00:24.689> 42

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
well at this on this flight the DA 42

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.149 
well at this on this flight the DA 42
was<00:00:25.710> loaded<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.630> about<00:00:27.630> sixty<00:00:28.259> kilos<00:00:28.769> less

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:29.159 
was loaded to about sixty kilos less

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:32.569 
was loaded to about sixty kilos less
than<00:00:29.550> its<00:00:29.699> maximal<00:00:30.300> landing<00:00:30.749> mass

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
than its maximal landing mass

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.130 
than its maximal landing mass
and<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:33.750> was<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.469> course<00:00:34.530> aware<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.129> this<00:00:35.430> and

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
and I was of course aware of this and

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.920 
and I was of course aware of this and
it's<00:00:37.140> flown<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:38.309> sectors<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.090> day<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.750> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
it's flown to sectors that day and the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.689 
it's flown to sectors that day and the
other<00:00:39.960> landing<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.649> did<00:00:40.890> was<00:00:41.750> kept<00:00:42.750> at<00:00:42.960> a

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
other landing I did was kept at a

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.600 
other landing I did was kept at a
appropriately<00:00:44.699> high<00:00:44.989> landing<00:00:45.989> speed<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.610> set

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
appropriately high landing speed I set

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.850 
appropriately high landing speed I set
it<00:00:47.760> down<00:00:47.790> very<00:00:48.300> gently<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.170> tarmac

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
it down very gently on the tarmac

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.149 
it down very gently on the tarmac
I<00:00:50.070> chose<00:00:50.309> long<00:00:50.610> runways<00:00:51.409> and<00:00:52.409> I<00:00:52.530> plan<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.860> do

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
I chose long runways and I plan to do

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:56.540 
I chose long runways and I plan to do
the<00:00:53.309> same<00:00:53.339> thing<00:00:53.850> at<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.659> landing

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the same thing at this on this landing

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.300 
the same thing at this on this landing
but<00:00:57.550> a<00:00:58.030> visual<00:00:59.790> approach<00:01:00.790> is<00:01:01.480> less

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
but a visual approach is less

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.160 
but a visual approach is less
predictable<00:01:03.310> for<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.790> tower<00:01:04.000> when<00:01:04.809> you<00:01:04.930> come

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
predictable for the tower when you come

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.380

which<00:01:46.640> one<00:01:46.820> you're<00:01:46.910> gonna<00:01:47.030> do<00:01:47.300> so<00:01:47.870> it's<00:01:48.020> not

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
which one you're gonna do so it's not

know<00:02:26.360> saw<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:27.380> ph1<00:02:27.650> heat<00:02:27.980> easily<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:29.080> never

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
know saw the ph1 heat easily and never

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.000 
know saw the ph1 heat easily and never
close<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.470> each<00:02:30.590> other<00:02:30.800> but<00:02:31.720> yeah<00:02:32.720> as<00:02:33.590> he

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
close to each other but yeah as he

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.040 
close to each other but yeah as he
landed<00:02:34.489> it<00:02:34.640> was<00:02:34.790> became<00:02:35.209> clear<00:02:35.570> to<00:02:35.600> both<00:02:35.810> be<00:02:36.020> in

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
landed it was became clear to both be in

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.690 
landed it was became clear to both be in
the<00:02:36.170> tower<00:02:36.440> that<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:36.709> was<00:02:36.980> not<00:02:37.190> going<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.459> have

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
the tower that I was not going to have

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.090 
the tower that I was not going to have
be<00:02:38.570> able<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:38.840> complete<00:02:39.200> that<00:02:39.500> approach

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
be able to complete that approach

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.980 
be able to complete that approach
because<00:02:40.610> he<00:02:40.760> would<00:02:40.880> never

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
because he would never

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.310 
because he would never
the<00:02:43.110> lamp<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:45.000> towers<00:02:45.390> kind<00:02:46.230> of

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
the lamp and the towers kind of

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.350 
the lamp and the towers kind of
suggested<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:47.010> know<00:02:47.040> if<00:02:47.310> you<00:02:47.460> can<00:02:47.700> if<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.210> can

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
suggested you know if you can if you can

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.800 
suggested you know if you can if you can
keep<00:02:48.540> your<00:02:48.600> approach<00:02:49.020> speed<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.920> know<00:02:50.040> lower

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
keep your approach speed you know lower

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.110 
keep your approach speed you know lower
maybe<00:02:51.810> you'll<00:02:52.290> make<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.740> and<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.550> tried<00:02:53.850> that

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
maybe you'll make it and I tried that

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.210 
maybe you'll make it and I tried that
I<00:02:54.270> tried<00:02:54.570> make<00:02:54.960> Mike<00:02:55.260> approached<00:02:55.740> me<00:02:55.980> lower

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
I tried make Mike approached me lower

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.300 
I tried make Mike approached me lower
but<00:02:58.010> I<00:02:59.010> didn't

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
but I didn't

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.100 
but I didn't
you<00:03:01.640> know<00:03:01.730> I<00:03:01.790> knew<00:03:02.000> I<00:03:02.030> had<00:03:02.300> some<00:03:02.540> limit<00:03:02.870> there

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
you know I knew I had some limit there

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.490 
you know I knew I had some limit there
and<00:03:03.890> as<00:03:04.280> you're<00:03:04.490> gonna<00:03:04.610> see<00:03:04.970> as<00:03:05.270> I<00:03:05.450> as<00:03:05.810> I<00:03:06.020> spin

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
and as you're gonna see as I as I spin

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.470 
and as you're gonna see as I as I spin
this<00:03:06.710> forward<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.610> where<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.910> approach<00:03:08.180> comes

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
this forward to where the approach comes

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.980 
this forward to where the approach comes
in

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
in

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.370 
in
I<00:03:09.020> actually<00:03:09.730> slowed<00:03:10.730> down<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:12.080> point

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
I actually slowed down to the point

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.360 
I actually slowed down to the point
where<00:03:12.590> I<00:03:12.620> got<00:03:12.740> a<00:03:13.190> wobble<00:03:13.970> in<00:03:14.300> the<00:03:14.540> roll<00:03:14.750> plane

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
where I got a wobble in the roll plane

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.410 
where I got a wobble in the roll plane
which<00:03:16.370> is<00:03:16.490> the<00:03:16.610> beginning<00:03:16.760> of<00:03:17.090> a<00:03:17.180> stall

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
which is the beginning of a stall

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.690 
which is the beginning of a stall
behavior<00:03:17.960> which<00:03:18.290> of<00:03:18.770> course<00:03:18.860> is<00:03:19.190> extremely

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
behavior which of course is extremely

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.510 
behavior which of course is extremely
disconcerting<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:21.620> as<00:03:21.950> you'll<00:03:22.130> see<00:03:22.190> on<00:03:22.400> the

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
disconcerting and as you'll see on the

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.960 
disconcerting and as you'll see on the
tape<00:03:22.730> then<00:03:23.000> I<00:03:23.320> give<00:03:24.320> it<00:03:24.440> power<00:03:24.650> sink<00:03:25.580> the<00:03:25.760> nose

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
tape then I give it power sink the nose

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.500 
tape then I give it power sink the nose
get<00:03:26.630> it<00:03:26.720> a<00:03:26.810> stabilized<00:03:27.320> but<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.980> gear<00:03:28.190> up<00:03:28.510> full

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
get it a stabilized but the gear up full

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.020 
get it a stabilized but the gear up full
power<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:31.340> go<00:03:31.790> around<00:03:32.740> clean<00:03:33.740> up<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.190> then<00:03:34.580> do

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
power and go around clean up and then do

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.070 
power and go around clean up and then do
another<00:03:35.060> approach<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.710> land<00:03:36.980> okay<00:03:37.780> but<00:03:38.780> what

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
another approach and land okay but what

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.780 
another approach and land okay but what
I<00:03:39.110> want<00:03:39.350> to<00:03:39.470> show<00:03:39.680> you<00:03:39.740> is<00:03:40.070> this<00:03:40.280> stall<00:03:40.610> Bay

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
I want to show you is this stall Bay

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.520 
I want to show you is this stall Bay
because<00:03:41.480> it<00:03:41.690> it<00:03:42.200> demonstrates<00:03:43.010> what<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:45.170> FAA

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
because it it demonstrates what the FAA

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.790 
because it it demonstrates what the FAA
and<00:03:46.300> our<00:03:47.300> talks<00:03:47.540> about<00:03:47.690> a<00:03:47.840> lot<00:03:48.050> in<00:03:48.350> terms<00:03:48.560> of

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
and our talks about a lot in terms of

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.840 
and our talks about a lot in terms of
cause<00:03:49.130> of<00:03:49.160> accidents<00:03:49.940> which

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
cause of accidents which

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.400 
cause of accidents which
people<00:03:51.270> in<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:52.350> circuit<00:03:52.830> who<00:03:54.020> let<00:03:55.020> this<00:03:55.170> be

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
people in the circuit who let this be

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.640 
people in the circuit who let this be
deteriorate<00:03:56.070> and<00:03:56.400> just<00:03:56.730> stalled

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.339 

it's<00:03:59.920> been<00:04:00.160> into<00:04:00.340> the<00:04:00.430> ground

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
it's been into the ground

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.030 
it's been into the ground
so<00:04:02.920> it's<00:04:03.129> it's<00:04:03.340> pretty<00:04:03.430> it's<00:04:03.909> pretty<00:04:03.999> uh<00:04:05.040> it

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
so it's it's pretty it's pretty uh it

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.410 
so it's it's pretty it's pretty uh it
gets<00:04:06.189> your<00:04:06.400> attention<00:04:06.489> what<00:04:07.359> happens

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
gets your attention what happens

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.120 
gets your attention what happens
and<00:04:09.840> I<00:04:10.020> want<00:04:10.200> to<00:04:10.230> show<00:04:10.410> it<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.560> you<00:04:10.800> because<00:04:10.980> if

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
and I want to show it to you because if

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.430 
and I want to show it to you because if
you<00:04:11.280> fly<00:04:11.550> if<00:04:11.819> you<00:04:11.850> fly<00:04:12.180> you'll<00:04:12.510> recognize<00:04:13.080> how

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
you fly if you fly you'll recognize how

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:22.300 
you fly if you fly you'll recognize how
scary<00:04:14.190> this<00:04:14.370> would<00:04:14.520> be<00:04:15.290> okay<00:04:16.290> so<00:04:16.350> let's

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.460 

okay<00:04:23.310> so<00:04:23.370> here<00:04:23.880> you<00:04:24.060> see<00:04:24.090> I've<00:04:24.870> passed<00:04:25.170> the

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
okay so here you see I've passed the

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.430 
okay so here you see I've passed the
threshold<00:04:26.400> my<00:04:26.850> gear<00:04:27.090> is<00:04:27.300> down<00:04:27.510> the<00:04:27.840> flaps

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
threshold my gear is down the flaps

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.730 
threshold my gear is down the flaps
I've<00:04:28.800> got<00:04:28.950> approach<00:04:29.220> flaps<00:04:29.550> down<00:04:29.960> I'm<00:04:30.960> looking

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
I've got approach flaps down I'm looking

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.730 
I've got approach flaps down I'm looking
at<00:04:31.890> the<00:04:32.100> threshold<00:04:32.370> and<00:04:33.020> making<00:04:34.020> my<00:04:34.170> turn<00:04:34.530> onto

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
at the threshold and making my turn onto

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.589 
at the threshold and making my turn onto
base

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
base

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.219 
base
and<00:04:36.689> soon<00:04:37.319> I'm<00:04:37.469> gonna<00:04:37.679> turn<00:04:37.979> it<00:04:38.129> on<00:04:38.189> to<00:04:38.399> final

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
and soon I'm gonna turn it on to final

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.059 
and soon I'm gonna turn it on to final
I've<00:04:40.229> been<00:04:40.409> cleared<00:04:40.649> on<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.860> approach

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:41.069 
I've been cleared on the approach

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:44.269 
I've been cleared on the approach
obviously<00:04:41.960> not<00:04:42.960> cleared<00:04:43.229> to<00:04:43.289> land<00:04:43.469> yet<00:04:43.770> but<00:04:44.159> at

00:04:44.269 --> 00:04:44.279 
obviously not cleared to land yet but at

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:46.940 
obviously not cleared to land yet but at
the<00:04:44.369> same<00:04:44.550> time

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.330 

this<00:04:47.490> pH<00:04:47.820> 28<00:04:48.180> gets<00:04:48.390> cleared<00:04:48.660> to<00:04:48.780> land<00:04:49.340> and

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
this pH 28 gets cleared to land and

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.890 
this pH 28 gets cleared to land and
comes<00:04:50.730> in<00:04:51.080> right<00:04:52.080> in<00:04:52.320> front<00:04:52.740> of<00:04:52.920> me

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:08.120 

you<00:04:56.139> can<00:04:56.320> see<00:04:56.650> them<00:04:57.150> right

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.050 

various<00:05:09.120> right<00:05:09.870> here<00:05:10.550> coming<00:05:11.550> it<00:05:11.640> right<00:05:11.790> under

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
various right here coming it right under

various right here coming it right under
the<00:05:12.090> visor

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.050 

now<00:05:21.290> is<00:05:21.500> in<00:05:21.680> front<00:05:21.920> of<00:05:22.040> me

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
now is in front of me

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.940 
now is in front of me
and<00:05:24.450> he's<00:05:24.690> saying<00:05:24.930> slow<00:05:25.260> down<00:05:25.470> now<00:05:25.710> if<00:05:25.830> you

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
and he's saying slow down now if you

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.010 
and he's saying slow down now if you
look<00:05:26.130> at<00:05:26.250> my<00:05:26.370> speed<00:05:26.730> if<00:05:27.000> you<00:05:27.060> look<00:05:27.240> at<00:05:27.330> the<00:05:27.480> back

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
look at my speed if you look at the back

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.630 
look at my speed if you look at the back
up<00:05:28.200> speed<00:05:28.440> indicator<00:05:28.890> you'll<00:05:29.160> see<00:05:29.400> it<00:05:29.520> it's

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
up speed indicator you'll see it it's

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.280 
up speed indicator you'll see it it's
gonna<00:05:29.790> point<00:05:30.210> out<00:05:30.390> what<00:05:30.600> looks<00:05:30.780> like<00:05:30.870> three

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
gonna point out what looks like three

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.620 
gonna point out what looks like three
o'clock<00:05:31.650> on<00:05:32.010> that<00:05:32.640> clock<00:05:33.290> that's<00:05:34.290> 80<00:05:34.590> knots<00:05:35.630> on

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
o'clock on that clock that's 80 knots on

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.820 
o'clock on that clock that's 80 knots on
that<00:05:36.900> indicator<00:05:37.320> if<00:05:37.410> you<00:05:37.530> look<00:05:37.680> at<00:05:37.800> a

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
that indicator if you look at a

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.710 
that indicator if you look at a
photograph<00:05:38.130> above<00:05:38.760> that<00:05:38.940> indicator<00:05:39.480> that's

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
photograph above that indicator that's

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.890 
photograph above that indicator that's
80<00:05:39.960> knots<00:05:40.230> is<00:05:40.500> at<00:05:40.650> three<00:05:40.860> o'clock<00:05:41.600> and<00:05:42.600> now<00:05:42.840> you

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
80 knots is at three o'clock and now you

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.500 
80 knots is at three o'clock and now you
see<00:05:43.230> it<00:05:43.260> I'm<00:05:43.470> letting<00:05:43.740> it<00:05:43.860> get<00:05:43.980> under<00:05:44.250> 80<00:05:44.730> knots

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
see it I'm letting it get under 80 knots

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.990 
see it I'm letting it get under 80 knots
not<00:05:45.780> a<00:05:45.810> lot<00:05:46.020> under<00:05:46.230> 100<00:05:47.190> and<00:05:47.370> now<00:05:47.520> watch<00:05:47.760> what

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
not a lot under 100 and now watch what

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.379 
not a lot under 100 and now watch what
happens

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
happens

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:55.530 
happens
see<00:05:50.960> it's<00:05:51.080> dr.<00:05:51.379> wobble<00:05:51.789> watch

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.870 

no<00:05:56.080> now<00:05:56.470> it's<00:05:56.680> wobbling<00:05:57.160> a<00:05:57.250> lot<00:05:57.430> look<00:05:57.640> at<00:05:57.730> this

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
no now it's wobbling a lot look at this

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.680 
no now it's wobbling a lot look at this
wobble<00:05:58.800> so<00:05:59.800> I<00:05:59.830> push<00:06:00.460> a<00:06:00.520> speed<00:06:00.850> the<00:06:01.120> throttles

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
wobble so I push a speed the throttles

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.980 
wobble so I push a speed the throttles
up<00:06:03.060> drop<00:06:04.060> the<00:06:04.180> nose<00:06:04.330> a<00:06:04.360> little<00:06:04.510> bit<00:06:04.660> to<00:06:04.810> gain

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
up drop the nose a little bit to gain

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.750 
up drop the nose a little bit to gain
speed<00:06:05.290> you<00:06:05.440> see<00:06:05.470> this<00:06:05.650> big<00:06:05.890> set<00:06:06.160> to<00:06:06.250> go<00:06:06.340> back<00:06:06.520> up

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
speed you see this big set to go back up

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.380 
speed you see this big set to go back up
then<00:06:07.150> I<00:06:07.180> put<00:06:07.450> the<00:06:07.540> gear<00:06:07.780> in

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.390 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:17.379 

get<00:06:12.390> positive<00:06:12.960> rate<00:06:13.200> put<00:06:14.070> the<00:06:14.190> flaps<00:06:14.430> up

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:17.389 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:20.460 

anyway

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.420 

and<00:06:20.890> then<00:06:21.130> I'm<00:06:21.280> that<00:06:21.940> I'm<00:06:22.090> going<00:06:22.420> for<00:06:22.630> the<00:06:23.430> for

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
and then I'm that I'm going for the for

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.270 
and then I'm that I'm going for the for
the<00:06:24.520> go-around

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.240 

I<00:06:28.370> don't<00:06:29.030> know<00:06:29.350> if<00:06:30.350> you<00:06:30.530> could<00:06:30.770> recognize<00:06:31.220> it

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
I don't know if you could recognize it

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.590 
I don't know if you could recognize it
on<00:06:31.520> film<00:06:31.790> but<00:06:32.000> that<00:06:32.120> was<00:06:32.300> a<00:06:32.330> pretty<00:06:33.280> unusual

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:34.600 
on film but that was a pretty unusual

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.790 
on film but that was a pretty unusual
feeling<00:06:35.600> into<00:06:35.870> the<00:06:35.990> airplane<00:06:36.290> you<00:06:36.410> just<00:06:36.620> sort

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
feeling into the airplane you just sort

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.740 
feeling into the airplane you just sort
of<00:06:36.940> roll<00:06:37.940> like<00:06:38.419> that

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
of roll like that

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.440 
of roll like that
all<00:06:39.320> by<00:06:39.560> itself<00:06:39.889> it<00:06:40.130> felt<00:06:40.340> very<00:06:40.400> mushy<00:06:41.120> and

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.450 
all by itself it felt very mushy and

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.590 
all by itself it felt very mushy and
uncomfortable

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.600 
uncomfortable

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.130 
uncomfortable
not<00:06:44.110> an<00:06:44.230> experience<00:06:44.650> you<00:06:44.740> want<00:06:44.860> to<00:06:45.040> have

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:48.140 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.500 

okay<00:06:48.830> so<00:06:48.890> here<00:06:49.310> I'm<00:06:49.430> coming<00:06:49.910> in<00:06:50.150> for<00:06:50.360> the

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:50.510 
okay so here I'm coming in for the

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.960 
okay so here I'm coming in for the
actual<00:06:50.990> landing<00:06:51.410> that<00:06:51.560> I<00:06:51.590> have<00:06:51.980> to<00:06:52.100> go<00:06:52.700> around

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:52.970 
actual landing that I have to go around

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.240 
actual landing that I have to go around
now<00:06:53.900> if<00:06:54.020> you<00:06:54.140> look<00:06:54.260> at<00:06:54.380> the<00:06:54.470> airspeed<00:06:54.800> again<00:06:55.070> on

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.250 
now if you look at the airspeed again on

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.630 
now if you look at the airspeed again on
the<00:06:55.400> on<00:06:56.060> the<00:06:56.390> auxilary<00:06:57.050> clock<00:06:57.470> you<00:06:58.310> can<00:06:58.490> see

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:58.640 
the on the auxilary clock you can see

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.760 
the on the auxilary clock you can see
it's<00:06:58.820> up<00:06:58.940> around<00:06:59.150> 90<00:06:59.420> 95<00:06:59.870> on<00:07:00.380> my<00:07:00.530> approach

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:00.770 
it's up around 90 95 on my approach

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.850 
it's up around 90 95 on my approach
speed<00:07:01.100> which<00:07:01.850> with<00:07:02.210> this<00:07:02.360> with<00:07:03.170> this<00:07:03.290> way<00:07:03.500> you

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:03.860 
speed which with this with this way you

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.420 
speed which with this with this way you
know<00:07:03.950> that's<00:07:04.360> normally<00:07:05.360> what<00:07:05.450> I<00:07:05.510> would<00:07:05.630> do<00:07:06.430> if

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:07.430 
know that's normally what I would do if

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.200 
know that's normally what I would do if
I<00:07:07.550> wasn't<00:07:07.760> trying<00:07:08.120> to<00:07:08.210> slow<00:07:08.600> down<00:07:08.810> and<00:07:09.940> you<00:07:10.940> see

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.210 
I wasn't trying to slow down and you see

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.320 
I wasn't trying to slow down and you see
over<00:07:11.420> the<00:07:11.510> threshold<00:07:11.750> I'm<00:07:12.080> still<00:07:12.350> at<00:07:12.500> 90<00:07:13.330> and

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.330 
over the threshold I'm still at 90 and

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.750 
over the threshold I'm still at 90 and
then<00:07:14.480> only<00:07:14.630> after<00:07:14.810> I<00:07:15.020> get<00:07:15.110> over<00:07:15.320> the<00:07:15.410> threshold

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:15.760 
then only after I get over the threshold

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.240 
then only after I get over the threshold
do<00:07:16.760> I<00:07:16.820> let<00:07:17.060> it<00:07:17.180> come<00:07:17.390> down<00:07:17.620> toward<00:07:18.620> 80<00:07:18.950> which<00:07:19.220> is

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:19.250 
do I let it come down toward 80 which is

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:24.100 
do I let it come down toward 80 which is
where<00:07:19.550> I<00:07:19.580> was<00:07:21.160> on<00:07:22.160> the<00:07:22.700> approach<00:07:22.970> before<00:07:23.420> and

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.110 
where I was on the approach before and

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.220 
where I was on the approach before and
now<00:07:24.350> I'm<00:07:24.530> still<00:07:24.890> not<00:07:25.310> as<00:07:26.210> low<00:07:26.450> the<00:07:26.750> speed<00:07:26.990> isn't

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:27.230 
now I'm still not as low the speed isn't

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.710 
now I'm still not as low the speed isn't
as<00:07:27.500> I<00:07:27.650> was<00:07:27.860> before<00:07:28.190> and<00:07:28.310> now<00:07:28.490> you<00:07:29.420> could<00:07:29.570> see

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:29.720 
as I was before and now you could see

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.590 
as I was before and now you could see
it's<00:07:29.840> not<00:07:29.960> the<00:07:30.080> same<00:07:30.290> spot<00:07:30.650> and<00:07:31.400> I'm<00:07:31.820> not<00:07:32.060> that

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:32.600 
it's not the same spot and I'm not that

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.510 
it's not the same spot and I'm not that
far<00:07:33.050> from<00:07:33.080> putting<00:07:33.560> it<00:07:33.710> down<00:07:33.950> that's<00:07:34.250> how

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.520 
far from putting it down that's how

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.930 
far from putting it down that's how
close<00:07:34.790> it<00:07:35.030> was

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:37.940 

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.810 

that's<00:07:38.510> how<00:07:38.690> close<00:07:38.810> it<00:07:38.960> was<00:07:39.590> and<00:07:39.980> the

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:40.820 
that's how close it was and the

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.450 
that's how close it was and the
difference<00:07:41.210> being<00:07:41.540> that<00:07:41.890> when<00:07:42.890> I<00:07:42.920> put<00:07:43.220> the

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:43.460 
difference being that when I put the

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.880 
difference being that when I put the
when<00:07:44.090> you<00:07:44.210> set<00:07:44.480> it<00:07:44.510> when<00:07:44.720> you<00:07:44.810> flare<00:07:45.110> then<00:07:45.650> you

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:45.890 
when you set it when you flare then you

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.440 
when you set it when you flare then you
increase<00:07:46.280> your<00:07:46.400> angle<00:07:46.670> of<00:07:46.730> attack<00:07:46.850> which<00:07:47.300> of

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:47.450 
increase your angle of attack which of

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.290 
increase your angle of attack which of
course<00:07:48.460> which<00:07:49.460> of<00:07:49.610> course<00:07:49.640> causes<00:07:50.180> it<00:07:50.270> to

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:50.300 
course which of course causes it to

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.080 
course which of course causes it to
stall<00:07:50.630> under<00:07:50.900> the<00:07:50.990> runway<00:07:51.290> which<00:07:51.760> which<00:07:52.760> is<00:07:53.000> I

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:53.090 
stall under the runway which which is I

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.850 
stall under the runway which which is I
didn't<00:07:53.360> do<00:07:53.540> obviously<00:07:53.750> when<00:07:54.200> I<00:07:54.230> went<00:07:54.500> to<00:07:54.560> go<00:07:54.740> to

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:54.860 
didn't do obviously when I went to go to

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.770 
didn't do obviously when I went to go to
do<00:07:55.100> to<00:07:55.220> go<00:07:55.340> around<00:07:55.550> instead<00:07:55.790> of<00:07:55.880> increasing<00:07:56.750> my

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:56.780 
do to go around instead of increasing my

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.350 
do to go around instead of increasing my
angle<00:07:57.050> of<00:07:57.110> attack<00:07:57.230> I<00:07:57.530> put<00:07:57.770> the<00:07:57.860> nose<00:07:58.010> down<00:07:58.280> so<00:07:58.640> I

00:07:59.350 --> 00:07:59.360 
angle of attack I put the nose down so I

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.940 
angle of attack I put the nose down so I
increase<00:08:00.110> the<00:08:00.260> lift<00:08:00.610> but<00:08:02.530> but<00:08:03.530> it<00:08:03.650> was<00:08:03.770> very

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:03.950 
increase the lift but but it was very

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.120 
increase the lift but but it was very
close<00:08:04.420> so<00:08:05.420> I<00:08:05.450> thought<00:08:05.750> you<00:08:05.900> might<00:08:06.050> want<00:08:06.290> to<00:08:06.410> see

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.130 
close so I thought you might want to see

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.720 
close so I thought you might want to see
that<00:08:07.370> could<00:08:08.180> be<00:08:08.300> of<00:08:08.390> some<00:08:08.600> interest
