I<00:01:35.130> said<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.400> just<00:01:35.610> makes<00:01:35.759> me<00:01:35.909> feel<00:01:36.240> better<00:01:36.299> I

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
I said it just makes me feel better I

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.679 
I said it just makes me feel better I
don't<00:01:36.930> feel<00:01:37.229> cleaner<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.159> don't<00:01:38.610> notice<00:01:39.420> like

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
don't feel cleaner I don't notice like

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.700 
don't feel cleaner I don't notice like
much<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.079> difference<00:01:40.320> it's<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:40.590> like<00:01:40.680> a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
much of a difference it's just like a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.960 
much of a difference it's just like a
preference<00:01:41.220> kind<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.520> thing<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.790> think

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
preference kind of thing and I think

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.969 
preference kind of thing and I think
that's<00:01:42.119> what<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.750> people<00:01:43.470> want<00:01:43.950> to

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
that's what it is that people want to

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.340 
that's what it is that people want to
turn<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.250> into<00:01:44.310> something<00:01:44.549> else

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
turn it into something else

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.890 
turn it into something else
so<00:01:45.500> yeah<00:01:45.740> pop<00:01:46.100> that<00:01:46.310> on<00:01:46.520> let<00:01:47.240> it<00:01:47.360> marinate<00:01:47.690> and

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
so yeah pop that on let it marinate and

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.620 
so yeah pop that on let it marinate and
then<00:01:47.960> I<00:01:48.409> go<00:01:48.800> ahead<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.370> the<00:01:50.240> first<00:01:50.450> step<00:01:50.600> of

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
then I go ahead and the first step of

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.719 
then I go ahead and the first step of
this<00:01:50.840> is<00:01:50.990> pretty<00:01:51.140> like<00:01:51.380> old-fashioned<00:01:52.010> of<00:01:52.130> me
