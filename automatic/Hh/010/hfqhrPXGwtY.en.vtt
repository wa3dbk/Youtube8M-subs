00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.090 

I<00:00:21.060> pulled<00:00:22.060> out<00:00:22.180> a<00:00:22.240> few<00:00:22.480> bits<00:00:22.960> and<00:00:23.080> pieces<00:00:23.320> from

I pulled out a few bits and pieces from

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.240 
I pulled out a few bits and pieces from
my<00:00:24.160> box<00:00:24.670> and<00:00:25.529> trying<00:00:26.529> to<00:00:26.619> find<00:00:26.770> something<00:00:27.010> to

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
my box and trying to find something to

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.720 
my box and trying to find something to
use<00:00:28.180> as<00:00:28.210> a<00:00:28.360> background<00:00:28.540> I<00:00:32.250> cut<00:00:33.250> down<00:00:33.460> this

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
use as a background I cut down this

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.299 
use as a background I cut down this
backing<00:00:34.270> from<00:00:34.690> a<00:00:35.200> set<00:00:35.559> of<00:00:35.710> Amy<00:00:35.980> tangerine

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
backing from a set of Amy tangerine

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:44.750 
backing from a set of Amy tangerine
stance<00:00:36.760> to<00:00:37.090> see<00:00:37.239> how<00:00:37.390> that<00:00:37.600> would<00:00:37.690> fit

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.599 

I<00:00:45.050> then<00:00:46.050> arranged<00:00:46.829> everything<00:00:47.100> else<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
I then arranged everything else on the

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:50.090 
I then arranged everything else on the
page<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.210> ended<00:00:48.780> up<00:00:48.870> not<00:00:49.079> using<00:00:49.109> the<00:00:49.680> Amy

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
page I ended up not using the Amy

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.950 
page I ended up not using the Amy
tangerine<00:00:50.609> backing<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.269> end

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.270 

I<00:00:56.360> sucked<00:00:57.360> down<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.540> few<00:00:57.809> things<00:00:58.079> where<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.980> knew

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
I sucked down a few things where I knew

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:24.330 
I sucked down a few things where I knew
I<00:00:59.579> wanted<00:00:59.760> them<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.090> go

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.660 

I<00:01:24.719> ended<00:01:25.719> up<00:01:25.840> ripping<00:01:26.079> this<00:01:26.469> in<00:01:26.859> half<00:01:27.310> because

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
I ended up ripping this in half because

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.179 
I ended up ripping this in half because
I<00:01:27.909> just<00:01:28.090> didn't<00:01:28.270> like<00:01:28.359> how<00:01:28.630> much<00:01:28.899> of<00:01:29.229> the

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
I just didn't like how much of the

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:45.370 
I just didn't like how much of the
original<00:01:30.909> background<00:01:31.689> it<00:01:31.990> was<00:01:32.140> covering<00:01:32.649> up

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.730 

I<00:01:45.640> added<00:01:46.640> washi<00:01:47.150> tape<00:01:47.390> going<00:01:47.780> in<00:01:48.200> opposite

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
I added washi tape going in opposite

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.070 
I added washi tape going in opposite
directions<00:01:48.799> down<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:49.580> left-hand<00:01:49.880> side<00:01:50.270> just

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
directions down the left-hand side just

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.450 
directions down the left-hand side just
to<00:01:51.170> balance<00:01:51.290> out<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.619> page<00:01:51.890> a<00:01:51.920> bit<00:01:52.220> more

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
to balance out the page a bit more

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.340 
to balance out the page a bit more
because<00:01:52.820> I<00:01:53.119> was<00:01:53.210> putting<00:01:53.450> a<00:01:53.540> lot<00:01:53.690> of<00:01:53.780> things<00:01:53.990> on

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
because I was putting a lot of things on

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:13.190 
because I was putting a lot of things on
the<00:01:54.650> opposite<00:01:54.890> side

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.280 

I<00:02:13.730> found<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.970> yellow<00:02:15.120> ribbon<00:02:15.420> which<00:02:16.020> went

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
I found a yellow ribbon which went

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.600 
I found a yellow ribbon which went
really<00:02:16.830> well<00:02:16.860> with<00:02:17.129> the<00:02:17.250> color<00:02:17.430> scheme

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
really well with the color scheme

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.240 
really well with the color scheme
obviously<00:02:18.209> so<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.780> tied<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.080> in<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.349> bow<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.920> then

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
obviously so I tied it in a bow and then

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.400 
obviously so I tied it in a bow and then
kind<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.090> tried<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.540> out<00:02:21.690> in<00:02:21.900> different<00:02:22.050> places

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
kind of tried it out in different places

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.680 
kind of tried it out in different places
on<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.800> page

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.410 

I<00:02:30.100> added<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.190> couple<00:02:31.220> more<00:02:31.640> bits<00:02:31.820> of<00:02:31.940> washi<00:02:32.120> tape

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
I added a couple more bits of washi tape

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.020 
I added a couple more bits of washi tape
and<00:02:32.830> then<00:02:33.830> I<00:02:33.950> decided<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.490> bow<00:02:34.610> was<00:02:34.790> probably

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
and then I decided the bow was probably

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.330 
and then I decided the bow was probably
a<00:02:35.090> bit<00:02:35.210> too<00:02:35.240> big<00:02:35.600> so<00:02:35.930> I<00:02:36.560> cut<00:02:36.800> it<00:02:36.890> down<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:37.100> little

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
a bit too big so I cut it down a little

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.130 
a bit too big so I cut it down a little
and<00:02:37.760> tied<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.270> up<00:02:38.360> again

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.430 

I<00:02:44.530> felt<00:02:45.370> like<00:02:45.550> it<00:02:45.700> fit<00:02:45.730> really<00:02:46.510> well<00:02:46.630> in<00:02:47.050> the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
I felt like it fit really well in the

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.860 
I felt like it fit really well in the
top<00:02:47.710> right<00:02:47.980> corner<00:02:48.160> kind<00:02:49.090> of<00:02:49.270> hanging<00:02:49.630> off<00:02:49.750> the

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
top right corner kind of hanging off the

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.520 
top right corner kind of hanging off the
page<00:02:50.050> I<00:02:50.290> quite<00:02:50.530> like<00:02:50.709> that

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.800 

lastly<00:02:56.530> for<00:02:56.920> today<00:02:57.220> I<00:02:57.490> added<00:02:57.940> two<00:02:58.270> little<00:02:58.540> blue

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
lastly for today I added two little blue

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.110 
lastly for today I added two little blue
flowers<00:02:59.080> and<00:02:59.770> I<00:03:00.130> will<00:03:00.340> probably<00:03:00.610> come<00:03:00.760> back<00:03:00.790> as

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
flowers and I will probably come back as

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
flowers and I will probably come back as
some<00:03:01.510> more<00:03:01.660> things<00:03:01.900> in<00:03:02.080> space<00:03:02.290> data<00:03:04.020> for<00:03:05.020> this

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
some more things in space data for this

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.680 
some more things in space data for this
page<00:03:05.440> there<00:03:05.920> was<00:03:06.010> only<00:03:06.130> two<00:03:06.520> main<00:03:06.850> things<00:03:07.209> that

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.970

I added this pink tissue paper at the
bottom<00:03:37.310> to<00:03:37.700> tie<00:03:37.909> in<00:03:37.969> the<00:03:38.150> pink<00:03:38.719> washi<00:03:38.840> tape<00:03:39.200> and

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
bottom to tie in the pink washi tape and

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.399 
bottom to tie in the pink washi tape and
that<00:03:39.590> pink<00:03:39.920> piece<00:03:40.219> of<00:03:40.249> paper<00:03:40.599> that<00:03:41.599> I<00:03:41.629> have<00:03:41.930> to

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:42.409 
that pink piece of paper that I have to

00:03:42.409 --> 00:04:16.210 
that pink piece of paper that I have to
put<00:03:42.560> on<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.739> page

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.830

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
I find that adding washi tape behind

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.920 
I find that adding washi tape behind
things<00:04:21.410> and<00:04:21.739> on<00:04:22.100> top<00:04:22.310> of<00:04:22.460> things<00:04:22.610> really<00:04:23.510> helps
