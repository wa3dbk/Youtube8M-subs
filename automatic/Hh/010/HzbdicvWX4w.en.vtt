00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
that's the first thing curtain-raiser

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.700 
that's the first thing curtain-raiser
so<00:00:16.750> first<00:00:16.930> of<00:00:17.020> all<00:00:17.109> this<00:00:17.230> is<00:00:17.349> a<00:00:17.380> one<00:00:17.500> gigahertz

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
so first of all this is a one gigahertz

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.490 
so first of all this is a one gigahertz
phone<00:00:18.070> so<00:00:18.400> pretty<00:00:19.180> fast<00:00:19.449> very<00:00:20.259> very<00:00:20.829> fast

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
phone so pretty fast very very fast

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.900 
phone so pretty fast very very fast
it's<00:00:23.500> got<00:00:23.650> magnetic<00:00:24.039> scrolling<00:00:24.460> so<00:00:24.610> what<00:00:24.820> that

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
it's got magnetic scrolling so what that

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.060 
it's got magnetic scrolling so what that
means<00:00:25.150> is<00:00:25.329> basically<00:00:25.419> it<00:00:25.750> follows<00:00:25.900> your<00:00:26.230> this

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
means is basically it follows your this

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.069 
means is basically it follows your this
thing<00:00:27.309> just<00:00:27.550> like<00:00:27.669> when<00:00:27.820> we<00:00:27.939> are<00:00:28.029> dancing<00:00:28.180> yeah

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:29.079 
thing just like when we are dancing yeah

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.280 
thing just like when we are dancing yeah
and<00:00:29.700> if<00:00:30.700> I<00:00:30.879> reach<00:00:31.149> the<00:00:31.360> bottom<00:00:31.390> it<00:00:31.899> bounces

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
and if I reach the bottom it bounces

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.510 
and if I reach the bottom it bounces
back<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.969> it's<00:00:34.239> it's<00:00:34.510> pretty<00:00:34.660> natural

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
back so it's it's pretty natural

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.200 
back so it's it's pretty natural
designed<00:00:36.520> that<00:00:36.700> way

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
designed that way

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.920 
designed that way
then<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.770> this<00:00:38.860> is<00:00:38.950> the<00:00:39.010> main<00:00:39.190> when<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:40.750> have

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
then so this is the main when you have

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.810 
then so this is the main when you have
lots<00:00:41.170> of<00:00:41.350> things<00:00:41.590> out<00:00:41.770> here<00:00:41.800> we<00:00:42.370> can<00:00:42.489> keep<00:00:42.640> on

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
lots of things out here we can keep on

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.370 
lots of things out here we can keep on
adding<00:00:43.030> to<00:00:43.360> this<00:00:43.480> basically<00:00:43.870> whatever<00:00:44.170> you

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
adding to this basically whatever you

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.640 
adding to this basically whatever you
downloading<00:00:44.920> stuff<00:00:45.100> as<00:00:45.220> a<00:00:45.310> pinning<00:00:45.790> here<00:00:46.650> if

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
downloading stuff as a pinning here if

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.080 
downloading stuff as a pinning here if
you<00:00:47.800> swipe<00:00:48.070> right<00:00:48.370> swipe<00:00:48.400> you<00:00:48.760> get<00:00:48.880> to<00:00:49.000> the

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
you swipe right swipe you get to the

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.850 
you swipe right swipe you get to the
tagging<00:00:49.420> directly<00:00:49.899> and<00:00:50.140> you<00:00:50.230> can<00:00:50.380> make<00:00:50.590> a<00:00:50.620> call

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
tagging directly and you can make a call

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.340 
tagging directly and you can make a call
from<00:00:50.980> here<00:00:51.480> if<00:00:52.480> you<00:00:52.540> write<00:00:52.720> swap<00:00:52.960> again<00:00:53.170> you

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
from here if you write swap again you

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.830 
from here if you write swap again you
can<00:00:53.470> basically<00:00:54.090> run<00:00:55.090> up<00:00:55.210> in<00:00:55.329> this<00:00:55.420> home<00:00:55.600> screen

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
can basically run up in this home screen

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.060 
can basically run up in this home screen
either<00:00:55.930> customize<00:00:56.410> it<00:00:56.559> whichever<00:00:56.770> way<00:00:56.950> you

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
me to show you so what about the maps

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.009 
me to show you so what about the maps
and<00:03:08.349> music<00:03:08.799> or<00:03:09.099> do<00:03:09.190> you<00:03:09.280> have<00:03:09.430> those<00:03:09.579> apps<00:03:10.019> yeah

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
and music or do you have those apps yeah

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.929 
and music or do you have those apps yeah
so<00:03:11.260> music<00:03:11.560> is<00:03:11.680> basically<00:03:11.859> from<00:03:12.250> here<00:03:12.459> so<00:03:12.909> I

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:12.939 
so music is basically from here so I

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.119 
so music is basically from here so I
mean<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.359> low<00:03:13.659> curve<00:03:13.900> is<00:03:14.019> if<00:03:14.140> you<00:03:14.409> have<00:03:14.560> the

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
mean the low curve is if you have the

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:22.470 
mean the low curve is if you have the
Nokia<00:03:15.400> Music<00:03:15.459> Store<00:03:15.849> yeah<00:03:16.269> okay<00:03:17.079> so<00:03:18.480> I<00:03:21.480> think

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
Nokia Music Store yeah okay so I think

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.420 
Nokia Music Store yeah okay so I think
that's<00:03:22.870> in<00:03:23.049> the<00:03:23.139> variant<00:03:23.530> what<00:03:24.099> we're<00:03:24.250> showing

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
that's in the variant what we're showing

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.129 
that's in the variant what we're showing
you<00:03:24.609> right<00:03:24.730> now<00:03:24.790> is<00:03:24.970> without<00:03:25.629> the<00:03:25.780> variant

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
you right now is without the variant

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:42.809 
you right now is without the variant
okay<00:03:26.620> so<00:03:27.810> let<00:03:28.810> me<00:03:28.989> see<00:03:29.170> if<00:03:29.200> we<00:03:29.379> put<00:03:29.680> it<00:03:29.799> there

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.890 

what<00:03:43.819> are<00:03:43.879> you<00:03:43.940> can<00:03:44.030> show<00:03:44.209> us<00:03:44.300> the<00:03:44.390> map<00:03:44.569> yeah

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
what are you can show us the map yeah

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:52.210 
what are you can show us the map yeah
that's<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.290> Nokia<00:03:45.560> Store<00:03:48.910> so<00:03:50.709> Madison<00:03:51.709> Nokia

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
itself is ours for the possible so if I

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.380 
itself is ours for the possible so if I
get<00:03:58.250> connected<00:03:58.549> and<00:03:58.790> we<00:03:58.910> take<00:03:59.180> you<00:03:59.209> to<00:03:59.269> the

get connected and we take you to the

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.449 
get connected and we take you to the
store<00:03:59.629> and<00:03:59.810> you<00:03:59.900> have<00:04:00.110> the<00:04:00.260> same<00:04:00.650> experiment

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
store and you have the same experiment

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.150 
store and you have the same experiment
me<00:04:01.549> to<00:04:01.640> connect<00:04:02.230> that's<00:04:03.230> okay<00:04:03.470> I<00:04:03.650> just<00:04:03.950> wanted

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
me to connect that's okay I just wanted

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.949 
me to connect that's okay I just wanted
to<00:04:04.280> see<00:04:04.459> if<00:04:04.580> it's<00:04:04.760> there<00:04:04.940> yeah<00:04:05.330> it's<00:04:05.629> there<00:04:07.959> and

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
to see if it's there yeah it's there and

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.259 
to see if it's there yeah it's there and
it's<00:04:09.110> really<00:04:09.260> in<00:04:09.709> fast<00:04:10.099> you<00:04:10.879> can<00:04:11.000> figure<00:04:11.150> it

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
it's really in fast you can figure it

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.759 
it's really in fast you can figure it
out<00:04:11.299> basically<00:04:11.540> with<00:04:12.110> the<00:04:12.230> speeds<00:04:12.470> that<00:04:12.620> I'm

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
out basically with the speeds that I'm

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.050 
out basically with the speeds that I'm
doing<00:04:12.920> and<00:04:13.129> stuff<00:04:13.190> like<00:04:13.400> that<00:04:13.580> right<00:04:13.790> now

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
doing and stuff like that right now

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.280 
doing and stuff like that right now
there's<00:04:14.360> no<00:04:14.450> SIM<00:04:14.599> card<00:04:14.780> otherwise<00:04:14.870> I<00:04:15.170> would

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
there's no SIM card otherwise I would

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:22.659 
there's no SIM card otherwise I would
have<00:04:15.319> kind<00:04:15.590> of<00:04:19.810> then<00:04:20.889> you<00:04:21.889> have<00:04:22.070> various<00:04:22.370> apps

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
have kind of then you have various apps

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.219 
have kind of then you have various apps
which<00:04:22.910> are<00:04:23.060> already<00:04:23.270> here<00:04:23.690> as<00:04:23.900> you<00:04:24.020> can<00:04:24.050> see

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
which are already here as you can see

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:40.010 
which are already here as you can see
after<00:04:25.070> that<00:04:25.220> so<00:04:31.300> again<00:04:32.300> game<00:04:32.660> of<00:04:32.840> game

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.080 

and<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.650> one<00:04:40.770> yours<00:04:41.070> really<00:04:41.250> pause<00:04:41.580> it<00:04:41.820> in

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
and the one yours really pause it in

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.190 
and the one yours really pause it in
such<00:04:42.300> a<00:04:42.330> manner<00:04:42.420> that<00:04:42.630> you<00:04:42.750> have<00:04:44.990> quite<00:04:45.990> a<00:04:46.050> rich

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
such a manner that you have quite a rich

00:04:46.200 --> 00:05:07.150 
such a manner that you have quite a rich
experience

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:21.909 

Oh

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.669 

so<00:05:22.919> the<00:05:23.069> for<00:05:23.249> example<00:05:23.669> Facebook<00:05:24.360> Twitter<00:05:24.679> the

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:25.679 
so the for example Facebook Twitter the

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:29.509 
so the for example Facebook Twitter the
plants<00:05:26.039> are<00:05:26.159> all<00:05:26.279> here<00:05:26.869> again<00:05:27.869> I<00:05:28.559> need<00:05:29.249> to<00:05:29.309> get

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:29.519 
plants are all here again I need to get

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:30.949 
plants are all here again I need to get
connected<00:05:29.759> for<00:05:30.089> you<00:05:30.179> to<00:05:30.299> basically<00:05:30.569> take<00:05:30.839> you

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:30.959 
connected for you to basically take you

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:33.339 
connected for you to basically take you
through<00:05:31.169> many<00:05:32.009> of<00:05:32.159> them<00:05:32.309> so<00:05:32.459> it<00:05:32.669> gives<00:05:32.849> you<00:05:32.969> a

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:33.349 
through many of them so it gives you a

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:35.600 
through many of them so it gives you a
automatic<00:05:34.349> or<00:05:34.439> Wi-Fi<00:05:34.769> if<00:05:35.159> I<00:05:35.309> have<00:05:35.399> the<00:05:35.459> same

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
automatic or Wi-Fi if I have the same

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:47.590 
automatic or Wi-Fi if I have the same
base<00:05:44.179> by<00:05:45.179> finding<00:05:45.539> can<00:05:45.749> connect

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
base by finding can connect

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.750 
base by finding can connect
let's<00:05:48.320> okay<00:05:48.500> can<00:05:49.220> you<00:05:49.250> show<00:05:49.310> us<00:05:49.430> the<00:05:49.550> Maps

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:04.189 
okay I need to put in a memory card for

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:06.669 
okay I need to put in a memory card for
the<00:06:04.249> maps<00:06:04.459> so<00:06:05.419> it<00:06:05.539> comes<00:06:05.719> with<00:06:05.959> a<00:06:06.169> memory<00:06:06.439> card

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:06.679 
the maps so it comes with a memory card
