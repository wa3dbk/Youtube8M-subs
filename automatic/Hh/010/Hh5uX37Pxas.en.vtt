00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:09.269
 always an accessory for olympus 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:13.620
 very ingenious accessory that is this 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.900
 accessory for particular to do of the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.699
 macro you will see with the pictures that 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.949
 I tried on our mannequins or 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.859
 permanent to portray 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.859
 full darkness 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:29.310
 so the principle is all stupid huh 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.689
 when we love the floch put at the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.710
 place you are very light the very 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.200
 variable benefits that he takes 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.969
 the feeding of the duel 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.090
 So here you guide the second case 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.219
 makoun toulalan what is 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.800
 interesting is that each light 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:53.370
 orders and so the position appears and 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.550
 with light power tribute to 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.550
 Moon 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.640

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.299
 less important 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.970
 maximum power stop paris 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.600

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:18.899

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.270
 objects they are pretty much at a 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.600
 meter fifty to two meters that 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.360
