00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
is a shame because arm balances are

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.520 
is a shame because arm balances are

their own inner power in this DVD Shimon
and<00:01:02.120> I<00:01:02.239> will<00:01:02.600> target<00:01:02.899> arm<00:01:03.289> balances<00:01:03.949> in<00:01:04.220> a<00:01:04.699> non

and I will target arm balances in a non
conventional<00:01:05.360> way<00:01:07.540> through<00:01:08.540> our<00:01:08.689> approach<00:01:09.310> we

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
conventional way through our approach we

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.550 
conventional way through our approach we
have<00:01:10.490> found<00:01:10.759> that<00:01:11.000> practitioners<00:01:11.659> of<00:01:11.960> yoga

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
have found that practitioners of yoga

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.550 
have found that practitioners of yoga
not<00:01:12.979> only<00:01:13.280> can<00:01:13.460> achieve<00:01:13.880> these<00:01:14.090> assonance<00:01:14.750> but

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
not only can achieve these assonance but

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.840 
not only can achieve these assonance but
also<00:01:15.799> have<00:01:16.250> a<00:01:16.280> lot<00:01:16.520> of<00:01:16.549> fun<00:01:16.850> practicing<00:01:17.570> them

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
also have a lot of fun practicing them

your body as you practice these postures
we<00:01:34.010> have<00:01:34.190> also<00:01:34.370> seen<00:01:34.580> that<00:01:35.120> many<00:01:35.270> people<00:01:35.780> who

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
we have also seen that many people who

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.780 
we have also seen that many people who
attempt<00:01:36.590> there's<00:01:36.830> assonance<00:01:37.370> might<00:01:37.610> be

attempt there's assonance might be

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.840 
attempt there's assonance might be

correct muscular action to perform them

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.450 
correct muscular action to perform them
they<00:01:44.720> have<00:01:44.930> strength<00:01:45.350> but<00:01:45.680> no<00:01:45.860> awareness<00:01:46.250> of

they have strength but no awareness of

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.670 
they have strength but no awareness of

aspects of our being these poses will

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.170 
aspects of our being these poses will
remain<00:01:58.280> out<00:01:58.520> of<00:01:58.640> one's<00:01:59.060> reach<00:02:00.850> we<00:02:01.850> have<00:02:02.000> also

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
remain out of one's reach we have also

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.420 
remain out of one's reach we have also
found<00:02:02.570> that<00:02:02.780> arm<00:02:02.990> balances<00:02:03.530> require<00:02:03.980> not<00:02:04.400> only

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
found that arm balances require not only

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.250 
found that arm balances require not only
strength<00:02:05.090> in<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.330> arms<00:02:05.600> and<00:02:05.690> shoulders<00:02:06.140> but

also flexibility open hips are also

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.310 
also flexibility open hips are also
needed<00:02:10.460> when<00:02:10.640> practicing<00:02:11.270> arm<00:02:11.450> balances<00:02:12.050> and

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
needed when practicing arm balances and

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.550 
needed when practicing arm balances and
the<00:02:12.920> ability<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.880> engage<00:02:14.030> with<00:02:14.300> one's<00:02:14.900> inner

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
core strength stiffness in the hips will

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.150 
core strength stiffness in the hips will
always<00:02:20.210> be<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.480> setback<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:21.350> performing<00:02:21.920> arm

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
always be a setback to performing arm

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.730 
always be a setback to performing arm
balances<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.210> this<00:02:23.900> is<00:02:24.080> something<00:02:24.530> we<00:02:24.710> will

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
balances and this is something we will

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.290 
balances and this is something we will
address<00:02:25.130> in<00:02:25.640> this<00:02:25.910> program<00:02:26.510> in<00:02:27.340> this<00:02:28.340> DVD<00:02:28.790> we
