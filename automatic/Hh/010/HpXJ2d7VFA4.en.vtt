00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
prevent exhaustion from kicking in I

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.209 
prevent exhaustion from kicking in I
mean<00:00:48.059> if<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:49.110> don't<00:00:49.320> keep<00:00:49.770> yourself<00:00:50.100> hydrated

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
mean if you don't keep yourself hydrated

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.010 
mean if you don't keep yourself hydrated
I<00:00:50.640> mean<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.940> just<00:00:51.000> put<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.539> strain<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:51.930> your

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
I mean you just put the strain on your

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.410 
I mean you just put the strain on your
body<00:00:52.430> it<00:00:53.430> doesn't<00:00:53.760> seem<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.270> since

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
body it doesn't seem like it since

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.700 
body it doesn't seem like it since
you're<00:00:54.570> sitting<00:00:54.840> down<00:00:55.020> most<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.800> time<00:00:56.030> but

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
you're sitting down most of the time but

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.250 
you're sitting down most of the time but
at<00:00:58.710> once<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.280> get<00:00:59.460> like<00:00:59.670> really<00:01:00.120> into<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.660> it

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
at once you get like really into it it

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.529 
at once you get like really into it it
can<00:01:01.680> take<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.890> toll<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.850> body<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.180> little<00:01:03.390> bit

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
can take a toll on the body a little bit

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.899 
can take a toll on the body a little bit
so<00:01:04.379> keeping<00:01:04.680> yourself<00:01:05.040> hydrated<00:01:05.189> can<00:01:05.729> help

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
so keeping yourself hydrated can help

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.600 
so keeping yourself hydrated can help
out<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> lot<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:08.520> night<00:01:08.729> before<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:10.610> tournament

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
matchups and you don't have to worry

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.700 
matchups and you don't have to worry
about<00:01:41.460> running<00:01:41.909> something<00:01:42.240> you've<00:01:42.479> never<00:01:42.710> ran

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
about running something you've never ran

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.620 
about running something you've never ran
before<00:01:43.740> because<00:01:44.520> odds<00:01:44.759> are<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.240> will<00:01:45.390> miss

play

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.969 

I<00:01:48.250> mean<00:01:49.210> through<00:01:49.659> my<00:01:49.780> own<00:01:49.930> experience<00:01:50.409> I<00:01:50.619> can

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
I mean through my own experience I can

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.370 
I mean through my own experience I can
say<00:01:51.189> that's<00:01:51.700> just<00:01:52.030> a<00:01:52.420> hunch<00:01:52.630> like<00:01:52.869> almost<00:01:53.200> one

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
say that's just a hunch like almost one

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.920 
say that's just a hunch like almost one
hundred<00:01:53.469> percent<00:01:53.649> true<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:55.270> sticking<00:01:55.659> what

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
hundred percent true so sticking what

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.450 
hundred percent true so sticking what
with<00:01:56.470> what<00:01:56.680> you<00:01:56.799> know<00:01:57.030> helps<00:01:58.030> out<00:01:58.149> a<00:01:58.180> lot

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
with what you know helps out a lot

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.830 
with what you know helps out a lot
during<00:02:00.460> a<00:02:00.729> match<00:02:00.939> it's<00:02:01.360> good<00:02:02.259> to<00:02:02.500> stay<00:02:02.770> calm

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
during a match it's good to stay calm

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.359 
during a match it's good to stay calm
because<00:02:04.840> once<00:02:05.439> you<00:02:05.530> start<00:02:05.770> getting<00:02:05.799> mad<00:02:06.159> that

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
because once you start getting mad that

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.759
