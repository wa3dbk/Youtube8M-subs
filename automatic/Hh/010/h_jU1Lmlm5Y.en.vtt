drink sorry and it's 450 Mills or
milliliters<00:03:21.650> so<00:03:22.460> what<00:03:22.730> you<00:03:23.360> have<00:03:23.390> to<00:03:23.570> do<00:03:23.810> to

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
milliliters so what you have to do to

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.840 
milliliters so what you have to do to
this<00:03:24.050> 11.5<00:03:24.980> is<00:03:25.340> times<00:03:25.760> it<00:03:26.120> by<00:03:26.840> 4.5<00:03:27.680> because<00:03:28.459> 100

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
this 11.5 is times it by 4.5 because 100

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.730 
this 11.5 is times it by 4.5 because 100
mils<00:03:29.260> 450<00:03:30.260> miles<00:03:30.440> obviously<00:03:31.400> 450<00:03:32.300> is<00:03:32.740> 4.5

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
mils 450 miles obviously 450 is 4.5

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.780 
mils 450 miles obviously 450 is 4.5
times<00:03:34.130> bigger<00:03:34.430> than<00:03:34.730> hundred<00:03:35.480> mils<00:03:35.660> therefore

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
times bigger than hundred mils therefore

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.060 
times bigger than hundred mils therefore
11.5<00:03:37.790> have<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.209> be<00:03:38.300> x<00:03:38.830> by<00:03:39.830> 4<00:03:40.750> 4.5<00:03:41.750> now<00:03:42.620> if<00:03:42.770> you<00:03:42.890> do

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
11.5 have to be x by 4 4.5 now if you do

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.020 
11.5 have to be x by 4 4.5 now if you do
that<00:03:43.340> that<00:03:43.820> will<00:03:44.000> give<00:03:44.120> you<00:03:44.240> a<00:03:44.270> number<00:03:44.540> of<00:03:46.030> 51.7

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
that that will give you a number of 51.7

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:54.520 
that that will give you a number of 51.7
five<00:03:48.640> milligrams<00:03:49.840> of<00:03:50.840> sugar<00:03:51.790> which<00:03:52.790> is<00:03:53.530> more

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
five milligrams of sugar which is more

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.310 
five milligrams of sugar which is more
than<00:03:54.920> a<00:03:55.490> can<00:03:55.730> of<00:03:55.880> coke<00:03:56.150> now<00:03:56.930> what<00:03:57.080> we<00:03:57.170> also

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
than a can of coke now what we also

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.380 
than a can of coke now what we also
worked<00:03:57.709> out<00:03:57.980> is<00:03:58.160> the<00:03:58.310> equivalent<00:03:58.580> so<00:03:59.090> if<00:03:59.240> this

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
worked out is the equivalent so if this

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.380 
worked out is the equivalent so if this
was<00:03:59.600> a<00:03:59.630> 330<00:04:00.530> mill<00:04:00.920> drink<00:04:01.250> it<00:04:01.880> would<00:04:02.090> be<00:04:02.240> exactly

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
was a 330 mill drink it would be exactly

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.770 
was a 330 mill drink it would be exactly
the<00:04:02.990> same<00:04:03.020> as<00:04:03.560> a<00:04:03.650> can<00:04:04.160> of<00:04:04.310> coke<00:04:04.550> so<00:04:05.420> what<00:04:05.600> you're

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
the same as a can of coke so what you're

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.170 
the same as a can of coke so what you're
I<00:04:06.910> suppose<00:04:07.910> getting<00:04:08.480> from<00:04:08.810> this<00:04:08.990> drink<00:04:09.440> is<00:04:10.180> or

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
I suppose getting from this drink is or

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.910 
I suppose getting from this drink is or
getting<00:04:11.600> for<00:04:11.840> your<00:04:11.959> money<00:04:12.020> is<00:04:12.500> a<00:04:12.530> very

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
getting for your money is a very

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.440 
getting for your money is a very
expensive<00:04:14.230> can<00:04:15.230> of<00:04:15.350> coke<00:04:15.530> because<00:04:16.370> it's<00:04:16.549> got

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
expensive can of coke because it's got

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.630 
expensive can of coke because it's got
just<00:04:17.750> as<00:04:17.959> much<00:04:18.140> sugar<00:04:18.709> held<00:04:19.010> within<00:04:19.280> it<00:04:19.520> so

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
just as much sugar held within it so

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.200 
just as much sugar held within it so
it's<00:04:19.790> not<00:04:20.859> again<00:04:21.859> a<00:04:22.130> health<00:04:22.490> drink<00:04:22.700> and<00:04:23.060> that

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
it's not again a health drink and that

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.700 
it's not again a health drink and that
is<00:04:23.419> one<00:04:23.660> of<00:04:23.690> the<00:04:23.810> big<00:04:23.960> things<00:04:24.169> that<00:04:24.320> people

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
is one of the big things that people

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.360 
is one of the big things that people
need<00:04:24.890> to<00:04:24.919> look<00:04:25.190> at<00:04:25.370> when<00:04:25.580> it<00:04:25.700> comes<00:04:26.000> to<00:04:27.370> these

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
need to look at when it comes to these

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.400 
need to look at when it comes to these
fruit<00:04:28.820> drinks<00:04:29.210> because<00:04:29.510> again<00:04:30.080> when<00:04:30.200> I<00:04:30.229> was

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
fruit drinks because again when I was

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.810 
fruit drinks because again when I was
stood<00:04:30.560> up<00:04:30.650> in<00:04:30.800> front<00:04:30.830> of<00:04:31.040> a<00:04:31.100> class

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
stood up in front of a class

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.780 
stood up in front of a class
I<00:04:32.530> think<00:04:33.530> it<00:04:33.590> was<00:04:33.650> September<00:04:34.750> 2011<00:04:35.750> and<00:04:36.640> we<00:04:37.640> had

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
I think it was September 2011 and we had

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.090 
I think it was September 2011 and we had
a<00:04:37.820> nutritionist<00:04:38.480> on<00:04:38.630> the<00:04:38.720> course<00:04:38.960> and<00:04:39.260> I<00:04:39.920> was

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
a nutritionist on the course and I was

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.300 
a nutritionist on the course and I was
up<00:04:40.220> talking<00:04:40.430> about<00:04:41.620> vitamins<00:04:42.620> and<00:04:42.890> minerals

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
up talking about vitamins and minerals

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.370 
up talking about vitamins and minerals
and<00:04:43.640> you<00:04:43.880> know<00:04:44.030> soft<00:04:44.270> fruits<00:04:44.810> and<00:04:44.960> vegetables

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
and you know soft fruits and vegetables

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.530 
and you know soft fruits and vegetables
and<00:04:45.800> I<00:04:46.040> said<00:04:47.980> fruits<00:04:48.980> aren't<00:04:49.910> the<00:04:50.060> be-all<00:04:50.510> and

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
and I said fruits aren't the be-all and

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.720 
and I said fruits aren't the be-all and
end-all<00:04:50.810> they<00:04:51.680> aren't<00:04:51.920> the<00:04:52.010> healthiest<00:04:52.550> food

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
end-all they aren't the healthiest food

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.080 
end-all they aren't the healthiest food
on<00:04:52.880> the<00:04:52.970> planet<00:04:53.150> so<00:04:53.480> don't<00:04:54.370> think<00:04:55.370> that<00:04:55.580> when

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
on the planet so don't think that when

right fruits and vegetables without the

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.860 
right fruits and vegetables without the
sugar<00:06:25.040> because<00:06:25.340> it's<00:06:25.490> not<00:06:25.670> the<00:06:26.030> food<00:06:26.480> itself

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870 
sugar because it's not the food itself

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.900 
sugar because it's not the food itself
that's<00:06:27.170> the<00:06:27.260> problem<00:06:27.470> it's<00:06:27.830> the<00:06:28.070> sugar<00:06:28.430> so<00:06:28.850> if

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 
that's the problem it's the sugar so if

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.880 
that's the problem it's the sugar so if
we<00:06:29.000> can<00:06:29.090> take<00:06:29.210> the<00:06:29.360> sugar<00:06:29.480> away<00:06:29.840> then<00:06:30.440> we<00:06:30.620> start

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890 
we can take the sugar away then we start

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.050 
we can take the sugar away then we start
to<00:06:31.010> get<00:06:31.190> somewhere<00:06:31.490> then<00:06:31.610> we<00:06:31.700> start<00:06:31.880> to<00:06:31.940> get

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
to get somewhere then we start to get

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.860 
to get somewhere then we start to get
healthier<00:06:32.420> fitter<00:06:32.660> and<00:06:32.840> more<00:06:33.260> alive<00:06:33.700> so
