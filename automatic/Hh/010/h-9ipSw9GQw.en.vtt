today we're going to actually redo a
video<00:00:06.120> we<00:00:06.420> did<00:00:06.450> last<00:00:06.839> week<00:00:07.080> because<00:00:07.589> the

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
video we did last week because the

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.589 
video we did last week because the
viewer<00:00:07.980> response<00:00:08.370> I<00:00:08.610> was<00:00:08.940> just<00:00:09.269> through<00:00:09.570> the

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
viewer response I was just through the

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.749 
viewer response I was just through the
roof<00:00:09.840> so<00:00:10.500> I<00:00:10.530> don't<00:00:10.950> have<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.160> cover<00:00:11.340> things<00:00:11.639> a

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
roof so I don't have to cover things a

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.759 
roof so I don't have to cover things a
little<00:00:11.940> bit<00:00:12.120> more<00:00:12.330> detail<00:00:12.690> this<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:13.740> a

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
little bit more detail this is a

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:14.990 
little bit more detail this is a

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
audio technica at2020 and it's fitting

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.970 
audio technica at2020 and it's fitting
because<00:00:18.510> what<00:00:19.050> we<00:00:19.170> just<00:00:19.350> had<00:00:19.500> new<00:00:19.619> years<00:00:19.830> for

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
because what we just had new years for

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.630 
because what we just had new years for
2010<00:00:20.430> now<00:00:21.180> pay<00:00:21.900> close<00:00:22.170> attention<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.519> we

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
2010 now pay close attention so that we

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.009 
2010 now pay close attention so that we
can<00:00:23.820> people<00:00:24.060> writing<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.480> saying<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:24.810> was

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
can people writing and saying this was

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.769 
can people writing and saying this was
faked<00:00:25.289> yeah<00:00:25.920> it's<00:00:26.250> not<00:00:26.430> there<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.820> no<00:00:27.000> CGI<00:00:27.449> used

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
faked yeah it's not there is no CGI used

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.599 
faked yeah it's not there is no CGI used
in<00:00:27.990> any<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.560> your<00:00:28.710> videos<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.189> only<00:00:29.279> thing

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
in any of your videos the only thing

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.310 
in any of your videos the only thing
that<00:00:29.760> we<00:00:29.910> do<00:00:30.060> that's<00:00:30.210> computer-generated<00:00:30.869> is

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
that we do that's computer-generated is

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.990 
that we do that's computer-generated is
the<00:00:31.920> titles<00:00:32.369> than<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> very<00:00:32.820> beginning

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
the titles than the very beginning

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:49.940 
the titles than the very beginning
that's<00:00:33.390> pretty<00:00:33.719> much<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.020> now

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.770 

this<00:00:50.190> cable<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.850> plugged<00:00:51.030> directly<00:00:51.239> into<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
this cable is plugged directly into the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.930 
this cable is plugged directly into the
camera<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.860> condenser<00:00:53.250> microphone<00:00:53.430> so

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
camera so it's a condenser microphone so

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.490 
camera so it's a condenser microphone so
it<00:00:54.030> might<00:00:54.149> take<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> second<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.840> come<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.350> by

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
it might take a second to come on but by

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.810 
it might take a second to come on but by
now<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.710> should<00:00:56.039> absolutely<00:00:56.250> hear

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
now you should absolutely hear

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.760 
now you should absolutely hear
everything<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.239> say<00:00:57.270> crystal<00:00:57.930> clear<00:00:58.140> you'll

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
everything I say crystal clear you'll

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.650 
everything I say crystal clear you'll
notice<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.129> audio<00:00:59.250> changed<00:00:59.850> because<00:01:00.270> before

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
notice the audio changed because before

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.930 
notice the audio changed because before
we<00:01:00.899> were<00:01:00.930> using<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.469> microphone<00:01:01.940> that's

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
we were using the microphone that's

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.910 
we were using the microphone that's
mounted<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.539> camera<00:01:03.870> itself<00:01:04.199> our<00:01:04.530> camera

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
mounted on the camera itself our camera

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.390 
mounted on the camera itself our camera

is 75 thousand watts of direct current
this<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.280> massive<00:01:44.970> amount<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.270> power<00:01:45.500> what

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
this is a massive amount of power what

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.609 
this is a massive amount of power what
we're<00:01:46.649> doing<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.390> we<00:01:48.390> run<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.840> from<00:01:49.439> there

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
we're doing is we run that from there

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.230 
we're doing is we run that from there
that's<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.340> output<00:01:50.610> terminal<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.119> up

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
that's the the output terminal is up

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.870 
that's the the output terminal is up
here<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.600> there's<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.350> small<00:01:52.950> piece<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.250> wire

gauge<00:02:01.520> that<00:02:02.520> goes<00:02:02.759> into<00:02:03.060> here<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.350> a

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
gauge that goes into here this is a

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.550 
gauge that goes into here this is a
station<00:02:05.310> post<00:02:05.490> insulator<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.329> it

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
station post insulator and it

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.260 
station post insulator and it
absolutely<00:02:08.560> not<00:02:08.710> rated<00:02:08.980> for<00:02:09.100> 75,000<00:02:10.000> volts

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
absolutely not rated for 75,000 volts

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.790 
absolutely not rated for 75,000 volts
but<00:02:10.390> because<00:02:10.720> we're<00:02:10.870> using<00:02:11.020> it<00:02:11.200> indoors<00:02:11.530> and

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
but because we're using it indoors and

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.260 
but because we're using it indoors and
it's<00:02:11.920> clean<00:02:12.160> and<00:02:12.370> dry<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:12.670> everything<00:02:13.030> it

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
it's clean and dry and everything it

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.690 
it's clean and dry and everything it
seems<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.660> be<00:02:13.750> working<00:02:13.870> for<00:02:14.260> now<00:02:14.350> it<00:02:14.710> goes<00:02:15.430> into

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
seems to be working for now it goes into

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
we do this in the room from there we

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.330 
we do this in the room from there we

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
simple brass plumb-bob that we use for

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.090 
simple brass plumb-bob that we use for
all<00:02:49.690> kinds<00:02:49.990> of<00:02:50.050> stuff<00:02:50.230> in<00:02:50.350> a<00:02:50.440> high<00:02:50.530> voltage<00:02:50.680> lab

part you've been waiting for I'm going
to<00:02:57.100> unplug<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.550> microphone<00:02:58.000> I<00:02:58.180> do<00:02:58.270> this

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
to unplug the microphone I do this

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
to unplug the microphone I do this
because<00:02:58.720> I<00:02:58.960> don't<00:02:58.990> want<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.320> damage<00:02:59.470> the

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
because I don't want to damage the

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.840 
because I don't want to damage the
camera<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.190> I<00:03:00.220> don't<00:03:00.280> want<00:03:00.490> to<00:03:00.520> feed<00:03:00.670> high

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
camera and I don't want to feed high

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.090 
camera and I don't want to feed high
voltage<00:03:01.240> directly<00:03:01.660> into<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:01.870> camera<00:03:02.100> under

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
voltage directly into the camera under

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.730 
voltage directly into the camera under
this<00:03:03.340> is<00:03:03.550> a<00:03:04.030> eighth<00:03:04.900> inch<00:03:05.140> thick<00:03:05.230> aluminium

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
this is a eighth inch thick aluminium

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.060 
this is a eighth inch thick aluminium
plate<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.100> a<00:03:06.880> small<00:03:07.300> insulator<00:03:07.780> now<00:03:08.770> I<00:03:08.800> put

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
plate and a small insulator now I put

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.470 
plate and a small insulator now I put
the<00:03:09.160> insulator<00:03:09.550> under<00:03:09.880> it<00:03:10.000> so<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.240> you<00:03:10.300> can

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
the insulator under it so that you can

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.580 
the insulator under it so that you can
see<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:10.780> microphone<00:03:11.020> is<00:03:11.350> actually

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
see the microphone is actually

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.380 
see the microphone is actually
conducting<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.580> electricity<00:03:12.820> because

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
conducting the electricity because

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.910 
conducting the electricity because
you'll<00:03:13.570> see<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.810> arcs<00:03:14.110> jumping<00:03:14.530> down<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.830> the

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
you'll see the arcs jumping down to the

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:51.460 
you'll see the arcs jumping down to the
floor<00:03:15.190> so<00:03:15.790> here<00:03:16.209> we<00:03:16.330> go

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.470 

the<00:03:51.920> sound<00:03:52.220> will<00:03:52.430> change<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:53.090> it<00:03:53.210> will<00:03:53.240> turn

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
the sound will change and it will turn

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.790 
the sound will change and it will turn
into<00:03:53.630> what<00:03:53.870> looks<00:03:54.050> like<00:03:54.110> a<00:03:54.230> line<00:03:54.440> of<00:03:54.470> fire

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
into what looks like a line of fire

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.040 
into what looks like a line of fire
that's<00:03:55.070> a<00:03:55.190> power<00:03:55.550> curve<00:03:55.910> and<00:03:56.210> when<00:03:56.750> it's<00:03:56.870> doing

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
that's a power curve and when it's doing

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.500 
that's a power curve and when it's doing
that<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.560> full<00:03:57.860> power<00:03:58.820> of<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.150> transformer

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
that the full power of the transformer

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.690 
that the full power of the transformer
all<00:03:59.990> the<00:04:00.080> current<00:04:00.530> is<00:04:00.830> being<00:04:01.160> pulled<00:04:01.460> through

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
all the current is being pulled through

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.040 
all the current is being pulled through
and<00:04:01.940> there's<00:04:02.150> so<00:04:02.300> much<00:04:02.420> current<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:02.900> earth

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
and there's so much current the earth

00:04:03.050 --> 00:05:03.970 
and there's so much current the earth
can't<00:04:03.350> greater<00:04:03.620> so

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:33.620 

okay<00:05:30.410> and<00:05:31.410> just<00:05:31.980> like<00:05:32.160> that<00:05:32.400> now<00:05:32.970> you<00:05:33.030> hear<00:05:33.270> me

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
okay and just like that now you hear me

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.410 
okay and just like that now you hear me
so<00:05:33.900> yes<00:05:34.320> the<00:05:34.560> microphone<00:05:35.040> really<00:05:35.610> did<00:05:36.000> survive

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
so yes the microphone really did survive

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.970 
so yes the microphone really did survive
the<00:05:36.600> shoot<00:05:36.810> now<00:05:36.840> we've<00:05:37.170> done<00:05:37.320> it<00:05:37.380> with<00:05:37.590> both<00:05:37.950> of

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
the shoot now we've done it with both of

the shoot now we've done it with both of
the<00:05:38.280> microphones<00:05:38.730> they've<00:05:38.940> sent<00:05:39.180> us<00:05:39.500> I'll<00:05:40.500> get

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
the microphones they've sent us I'll get

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.970 
the microphones they've sent us I'll get
some<00:05:41.150> close-up<00:05:42.150> still<00:05:42.510> images<00:05:43.080> of<00:05:43.320> the<00:05:43.770> top

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
just how much abuse this microphone will

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.420 
just how much abuse this microphone will
survive<00:06:28.440> we'll<00:06:28.770> call<00:06:29.010> it<00:06:29.160> like<00:06:29.250> the

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430 
survive we'll call it like the

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.770 
survive we'll call it like the
indestructible<00:06:30.090> microphone<00:06:30.480> or<00:06:30.630> something

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:46.910 
here take a look inside I'll show you

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.090 
here take a look inside I'll show you
there's<00:06:47.910> the<00:06:48.090> capsule<00:06:48.570> and<00:06:49.230> shiny<00:06:49.590> and<00:06:49.920> happy

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100
