so if jump into an auto sprayer so we're
gonna<00:00:22.680> talk<00:00:22.800> about<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.130> Wagner<00:00:23.820> sprayer<00:00:24.150> and

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
gonna talk about the Wagner sprayer and

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.599 
gonna talk about the Wagner sprayer and
Erickson<00:00:25.140> talked<00:00:25.350> about<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.830> okay<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.430> is

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
Erickson talked about it okay this is

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.660 
Erickson talked about it okay this is
the<00:00:26.730> Wagner<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.570> our<00:00:27.779> easy<00:00:28.349> tote<00:00:28.890> there's

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
the Wagner this is our easy tote there's

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.490 
the Wagner this is our easy tote there's
actually<00:00:29.970> three<00:00:30.000> models<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.349> EZ

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
actually three models this is the EZ

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.670 
actually three models this is the EZ
tilt<00:00:31.859> max<00:00:32.690> basically<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.079> big<00:00:34.260> deal<00:00:34.500> about

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
tilt max basically the big deal about

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.720 
tilt max basically the big deal about
this<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.149> can<00:00:37.219> do<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:38.430> different

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
this is that you can do it on different

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.000 
this is that you can do it on different
angles<00:00:38.850> which<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.540> very<00:00:39.750> cool<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.500> reason<00:00:40.829> for

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
angles which is very cool the reason for

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.330 
angles which is very cool the reason for
that<00:00:41.070> as<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.969> can<00:00:42.090> see<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.360> suction<00:00:42.629> inside

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
that as you can see the suction inside

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.569 
that as you can see the suction inside
just<00:00:44.340> goes<00:00:44.520> with<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> gravity<00:00:45.410> so<00:00:46.579> obviously

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
just goes with the gravity so obviously

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.180 
just goes with the gravity so obviously
just<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.059> paint<00:00:48.329> down<00:00:48.690> below<00:00:48.960> see<00:00:49.800> just

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
just the paint down below see just

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.439 
just the paint down below see just
basically<00:00:50.430> follows<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.789> paint<00:00:51.030> down<00:00:51.210> below

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
basically follows the paint down below

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.830 
basically follows the paint down below
which<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.750> very<00:00:51.960> cool<00:00:52.199> it's<00:00:52.949> electric<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:54.210> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
which is very cool it's electric on the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.319 
which is very cool it's electric on the
back<00:00:55.070> there's<00:00:56.070> sorry<00:00:56.520> there's<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.789> switch<00:00:57.030> for

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
back there's sorry there's a switch for

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.459 
back there's sorry there's a switch for
paint<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.930> then<00:00:58.500> if<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.680> turn<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.070> you<00:01:00.469> have

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
paint and then if you turn it you have

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.229 
paint and then if you turn it you have
stain<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:02.129> shows<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.730> right<00:01:02.910> out<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.090> there

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
stain it shows you right out of there

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.359 
stain it shows you right out of there
which<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.510> nice<00:01:03.690> also<00:01:04.680> gives<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> little

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
which is nice also gives you a little

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.420 
which is nice also gives you a little
indicator<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.240> you're<00:01:06.479> low<00:01:06.630> on<00:01:06.659> paint<00:01:07.430> exactly

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
indicator so you're low on paint exactly

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
indicator so you're low on paint exactly
you<00:01:08.580> don't<00:01:08.640> want<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.909> air<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> paint<00:01:09.479> sprayer

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
you don't want to air a paint sprayer

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.600 
you don't want to air a paint sprayer
for<00:01:12.450> obviously<00:01:12.810> reasons<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.950> got<00:01:14.070> high<00:01:14.310> and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
for obviously reasons you got high and

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.940 
for obviously reasons you got high and
low<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.659> they<00:01:15.900> should<00:01:16.020> how<00:01:16.320> much<00:01:16.470> material

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
low so they should how much material

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.620 
low so they should how much material
you're<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.310> be<00:01:17.369> spraying<00:01:17.670> out<00:01:18.000> kind<00:01:18.600> of
