 spring the products that we have 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.050
 I used the ones I like the most, so 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.059
 Nothing I hope is one of the most 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.300
 favorites that I have had 20 time has 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.380

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.810
 Well I sent him since 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.150
 johnny how good you know I made a 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.210
 video a while ago and the truth is that 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.960
 I love it because it's good that 9 in 1 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:36.570
 not that eliminated by or be removed 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:40.060
 visibly the pores unifies moisturizes and 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.310
 it does not leave a super nice appearance and 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.440
 using then practically for all 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.750
 the days I want to go something made up 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.980
 and using a lot and I think that in 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.010
 all that remains summer follow 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.730
 using also because I love 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.050
 has a pretty good coverage is not 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.360
 just a cream on the front with 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.030
 colors a bible cream in conditions 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.380
 and nothing because that I still use it and 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.080
 I do like the world 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.590
 the tone light the tone more clearly and is 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.290
 the next one that I'm going to teach is a 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.030
 eye contour that fascinates me and I think 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.820
 that you can know it exceeds or that you 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:21.000
 the brand ok jobs 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:24.000
 it's good that I love it because you know 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.880
 that I have many pretty bags 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.649
 swollen and this takes it from me so great 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.270
 and in the morning he uses it mostly 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:35.820
 it's worth the refreshing blue has two 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.850
 pulsations and already gives you to good for 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.890
 and get two more, nothing other what 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.570
 what I love and I had to take it out 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.659
 and then also have to take out and 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.690
 name and put on a pedestal this this 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:53.320
 serum is a gel for many skin 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.260
 fats I have the dry mixed but 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.380
 still, I love it because it leaves the 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.500
 skin this is that I do not have it 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.230
 it's a wonder because 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.830
 contains vitamin e here you can see 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:12.170
 but you can see the red particles 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.020
 that are vitamin is that they calm me down 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.880
 heaps the stress of the face is worth 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.800
 example then here the credits that 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.590
 I get out of the stress hormones of 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.560
 Whatever it is, it's also that laughter 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.290
 irritation redness me what calms everything 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.580
 I do not have the face of new truth and 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.130
 It is that there has been a discovery is 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.250
 I do not want this to offer in life 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.710
 well, well, nothing that buys it 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.990
 I want yes I love the super truth 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.030
 recommended 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.560
 to see something else that has also 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.710
 liked a lot that the ch using 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.170
 much now in this time since what 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.610
 I have is this exfoliating mask is 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.810
 a little bathroom guards but good 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:57.800
 exfoliating mask the time is a 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.660
 It's not a face mask, it's a facial scrub 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.930
 that you massage if you have the face of 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.180
 amazing oils you had all the 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.270
 Super soft skin pieces no 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.280
 situation I have sensitive skin 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:16.380
 nothing irritation nothing watches anything 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:19.410
 of allergy and it seems to me a gesture of 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.730
 truth the lemon pear is worth something else 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.280
 I liked it a lot this is 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.019
 illuminator a good illuminating blusher 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.870
 is an illuminator the rouge this is not 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:32.239
 things to run is the detail also the 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:35.340
 number 69 and it's good as well in birds 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.600
 well to put it with a magnet for 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.150
 put it in palette it's worth and it's a 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.420
 Illuminator that is very soft very 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.099
 subtle but very beautiful you are going to see if 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.200
 because it's so subtle that the same thing does not 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:50.670
 you can appreciate but well there it is 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.230
 above all is that a highlight 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.970
 high used a lot this time and 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.900
 I follow it up and fixing because it's a 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.150
 hand 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.880
 illuminating only two things the next 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.460
 it's good then 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.890
 a rouge that I used a lot in 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.100
 this spring that is the life pitch of 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.640
 sling more I leave here the reference the 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.330
 visa pitch and that really this rouge 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.670
 is 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:22.220
 good because it 's an orange with a 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.410
 little fluorine I always say it but it is that 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.580
 then it is actually very smooth to see 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.280
 yes 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.860
 so much to give you with the one that gives a nice 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.389
 super pretty spring and now of 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.759
 summer also because you do not want 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:37.460
 use for the most precious summer and 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:39.259
 finally the bar that you are using 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.700
 well not really all spring 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:44.100
 because I have it from 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.730
 at the end of April I think good but 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.950
 neither the following a bar 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.920
 lips that I liked a lot is the 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.200
 of the hurt finish of that of mascara 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.610
 london by Kate Moss from the collection that 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:03.300
 imos is the 101 is a very soft pink 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:06.229
 totally and very creamy mate and the 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.229
 truth is that I have used it 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.480
 1 if it is a very nice lip color 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:17.350
 soft but that greatly enhances the lip if 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:19.150

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.240
