00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 so here we are in front of that 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.330
 for my blog it's for the trick so 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.649
 what is she to this one then you 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.160
 say that's what it is with what year 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.509
 this one look what details 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.889
 already it is that I have ever seen 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.490
 it was not trying to hunt fires 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.049
 additional 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.859
 yeah but it's never seen them 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.600
 carene as holy ah yes yes it's me 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.920
 serves I remember the hells shined 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.869
 as they say but that was at the beginning 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.000
 on all the pieces no no it's 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.289
 why I saw them against 61 cents 2 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.480
 because we would be first had a 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.090
 cooling problem 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.790
 a clear laser came back and went out badly 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.540
 so there was a problem of 2.2 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.460
 hot air exhaust so before the 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.020
 restyling 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.090
 after they first have this very 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.710
 solution to evacuate the air so no 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.610
 one two years ago there was a little more 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.710
 two years and there you see you had 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.149
 to close here for the winter when he 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.390
 is that we had to keep some air 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.610
 hot 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.719
 we wanted to close so it was 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.370
 not very appreciated as always 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.320
 rare and it gives a stamp etc 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.790
 m 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.940
 it's not wonderful to feel that 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.940
 him 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.140
 ah it reminds me disappointed 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.500
 mission of the famous this case we still have 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.110
 our dashboard this is the 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.730
 dashboard the first one of yes 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.400
 yes you have a first we can 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.170
 source she's debating it and all of you 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.120
 could read like a dashboard 4 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.000
 in the end do not have or more with the idea 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.710
 more watched solid olive greenhouses 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.979
 in the end there is everything there she is still 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:41.900
 in red liquid the lhm it works again 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.040
 sahar you have this is why they 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.350
 had problems or less in 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.080
 less the prettiest euro so 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.729
 in synthetic with banks the 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.380
 purists can continue to ride with 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.729
 the first liquid that was so 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.049
 aggressive to ask the problems so 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.700
 the cars it does it's appreciated my 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:02.420
 momentum but caesary change youtube beat 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:04.899
 tools his freelance at the gnawing yes I can 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.899
 to enter 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.840
 it is what year this one the 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.019
 oldest known in the world 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:22.420
 report the privileges I have 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:30.620
 Looked at that it's the ghosts what 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:38.239
 practically yeah that huge breath 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:42.790
 glove box includes the revolution 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.790
 so there we just had a storyteller a 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.500
 gasoline water temperature 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.850
 the heating had been used only 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.320
 car of 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.320
 links between Paris and the fertÃ© vidame 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.070
 does not conform to the series because 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.290
 she has no ride height 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.420
 adjustable ie they have me 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.550
 directly to a level it looks like 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.170
 a chalk series and then there and 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.720
 collectively a little bit modernized it 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.590

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.590
