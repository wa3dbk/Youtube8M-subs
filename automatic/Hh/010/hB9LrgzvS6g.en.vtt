00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.260
 the open beta of Battlefield 3 is now launched and 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.260
 we show you first impressions from the game 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.119
 Moody and card selection are very manageable, there is only one 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.390
 Mode and a map to choose from 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.320
 to create your own games is not possible you can only the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.550
 Use filter function to get into a running last week 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.410
 There are four different classes, for example, the first-second weapon 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.499
 or change equipment 

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:38.399
 it should be to him I could differ and support let me differ 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.139
 Of course, mainly in the beginning should be from armaments shops 

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:44.139
 ideally be filled with all classes 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.530
 also break the map Metro is in the French capital Paris 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.480
 settled and divided into two large areas 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.510
 on the one hand, an expansive parking area with plenty of cover options 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.850
 and on the other hand the actual subway station the significantly more up 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.850
 Melee and short distances are aligned 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.550
 The mode quickly based mainly on individual mission goal in Paris must 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.690
 you first blow up two satellite systems and then in the metro station 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.730
 make two other goals harmless 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.890
 one team attacks the other defends so far so easy 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.520
 in that always two goals simultaneously attacker sense comes 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.000
 neat movement into the game even if just busy on the weekdays 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 is fought 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.940
 the control with the playstation controller makes in the Vita 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.870
 already a good figure and can in many points in the once again 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.130
 be adjusted 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.560
 Above all, the shoulder buttons with the following are important 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.369
 Anvisiert or grenades on which everything goes smoothly from the hand and played 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.369
 rare after a short time 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.150
 Graphically, the bidder of the ps3 version makes a good impression 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.220
 Of course, it does not come in the class of the pc version 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.980
 Esteban calculator on 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.640
 Nevertheless, the animations and weapons Bechtle had worked very well 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.550
 the sound lets you through the barren stages and pulls you to it 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.210
 suffice 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.090
 both around the ears
