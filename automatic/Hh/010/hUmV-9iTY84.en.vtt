00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.410
 once 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.220
 truly 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.880
 of nothing 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.939
 there is anxiety 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.020
 that where youtubers first video that 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.120
 I go up on Sunday to upload it 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.650
 Sunday since we got one more uploaded 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.740
 videos during the week for institutions 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.070
 video today sunday 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.450
 this video consists of a mac theme 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.940
 to do it faster we're going to this 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.460
 link for them to download a 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.340
 once the file and put it to 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.990
 download I tell you what it is 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.320
 can save time sale we go to the 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.320
 link 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.580
 is going to download this 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.740
 this tablet does not say how much is already 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.160
 I just downloaded it and right now 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.160
 same 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.290
 we are going to give it 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:27.390
 it says it weighs 57.82 megabytes 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.520
 approximately 60 mb good is going to 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.990
 create this tablet that what 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.840
 unzip and we will create that 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.690
 folder in this folder is found with 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.510
 what we are going to work 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.560
 Okay, so let's explain this 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.470
 It is a matter of mac 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.509
 I do not know if there have already searched for topics but 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.329
 you have to install a program so that 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.500
 I change this 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.000
 it's going to be something like that 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.050
 and you have to be like two or three 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.290
 programs to make it work 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.080
 completely the subject which you have 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.880
 individually and battle in a few 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.010
 words this topic we just have to 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.920
 run this file and this file is 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.300
 executable will be all for us not 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.950
 more will be to a program that yes the 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.390
 clarified 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.890
 I do not recommend it to begin with 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.660
 people who have computers with 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:20.019
 low resources because it consumes a sum 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.209
 significant of ram and not much the 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.489
 processor but it takes processor goes 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.500
 ok please I recommend it to 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.300
 people that this go and those who want 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.430
 it is in your criteria you decide 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.940
 If visualization is much for you 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.980
 or have always wanted to have our 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.060
 windows like mac then the solution exists 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.709
 you decide 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.709
 the video no more 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.570
 it will be in two parts because 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.120
 it does not let me save the program and it 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.620
 reboot the computer well then here 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.820
 we are not going to change anything just 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.280
 we'll give it as set out 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.930
 they saw also works for xp those that 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:09.130
 they are attentive and it is for xp and for 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.110
 windows 7 look 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.360
 I will tell you to explain what changes 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.950
 change how our windows starts how 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.440
 it turns off our windows change the 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.730
 sounds of windows changes the bar 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:25.740
 Tasks changes icons change org 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:28.110
 they change the design of the windows 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:32.820
 and it changes a lot of things the truth what 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:36.450
 leaves much like loving more is not more 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.940
 there are certain differences that you no longer that 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.640
 there is no otan, so if you hold 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.170
 a mac and then you see this topic you're going to 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.770
 kill that if there are a few things here 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.890
 but the important thing and the main thing that the 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.810
 amac distinction if it does good then 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.870
 then I'm going to stop the video and we 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.580
 we see there 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.060
 Well then install and I'll 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.060
 restart 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.820
 where youtubers and restart the 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.630
 computer and how can you see that is 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.630
 how is our 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.240
 on our desk this what does 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:17.260
 the topic 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:21.130
 These icons are not changed since I 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:24.180
 the configure is how I wanted but 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.060
 let's go to an example as you saw here 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.250
 change what is 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.380
 what is the shape of the window the 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.280
 icons that we have in the computer 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.280
 usually 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:41.050
 Saleh is worth knowing that more change 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.050
 downloads 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:49.370
 change the icons as you can 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.370
 see change the smell of this start 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.260
 they change the icons here as they can 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.050
 see these two are the two programs that 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.650
 they are running that I told them that it's going to 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.650
 think something 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.210
 and as you can see there are the changes 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.210
 What did 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.520
 we are going to go to performance as they can 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:12.680
 watch 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:17.800
 what are these programs called for 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.800
 to see how much they consume wind expos 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:23.559
 windspot is consuming 22 megabytes 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:34.140
 nothing of the processor we are going to look for the 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:37.010
 disk 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:40.800
 Well, that's a virtual desktop 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:43.050
 well that would be all I think already 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.310
 is a little video Larguita the 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.770
 wallpaper I did not put it what 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.720
 change simply the subject you are going to 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.720
 notice the differences also change 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.290
 the sounds you are going to notice 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.570
 simply the time depends on the 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:58.290
 accountant are to realize that 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:01.290
 turn on different so very nice sounds 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.020
 different so very nice capellans good 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:06.750
 because that's what the program consists of 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:10.110
 the good well said the subject and 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:12.240
 does not affect anything if you believe that 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.950
 swim if you plot things like that are not 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.810
 Myths I do not know if you have heard things 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.350
 but it works normally like mind 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:21.920
 we just have the subject d 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:24.080
 Mac has really gives you a 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.520
 very similar appearance I hope you have them 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:30.699
