00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello in this video I show you 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.000
 my field trailer sews respectively 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.460
 tinkering for the filter trailer needed 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 her felt had to stuff 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.880
 a heart shape for cutting out needle and 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.949
 thread to sew buttons to decorate 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.720
 and attach the bowl trailer 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:27.769
 with the help of the heart shape I have from the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.060
 felt two hearts cut 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.710
 after making a small hole in both 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.840
 made hearts for later 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.950
 Attachment to the clavicle I have 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.020
 to start 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.620
 At the first hole you can make a small one 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.200
 make knots to keep the tape better 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.300
 you do not have to do it properly 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.670
 because you'll be pulling that down later 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.620
 but be careful that in any case 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.520
 at each strike both would have 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.520
 be taken into account 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.270
 I almost completely sewed the heart 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.450
 one piece left open on one side 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.560
 Do it now on the left side, so roll up 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.720
 it around and then stuffs in the heart 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.510
 bit of liter of water fits in perfectly 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.470
 but on the wing with the yes 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.210
 So that's enough 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.330
 wait in it is the heart 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.620
 in advance so if you are not so good around 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.550
 You can also easily get the corners 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:50.220
 help with a pen and easy 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:52.710
 there's a bit cram as such 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.210
 Now that I have a full debate in that 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.850
 heart stuffed I have the rest 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.920
 sewed and then in the hole what we 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.770
 at the very beginning have such a 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.970
 keychain made that you can completely 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.800
 just by stuffing in case it still 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.820
 could now be filled with the cotton 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.209
 Just come back with the pencil 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.870
 important so and now we already have 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.010
 our finished pendant heart and yes that 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.440
 Of course, it could be the same with everyone else 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.910
 We will start with different shapes in the beginning 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.800
 I still have buttons 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.570
 worried you can of course that he 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.890
 maybe a little bit tall you might 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.170
 also take it somehow if 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.090
 you may also want somehow 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.620
 in other smaller or so that can 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.760
 you can still make it to my liking 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.390
 it's so nice 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.390
 and that's it until next time
