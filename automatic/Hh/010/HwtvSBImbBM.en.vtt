chemical put in a lot of canned foods
it's<00:00:28.790> also<00:00:28.970> found<00:00:29.360> in<00:00:29.540> a<00:00:29.599> lot<00:00:29.779> of<00:00:29.899> baby<00:00:30.110> bottles

it's also found in a lot of baby bottles
and<00:00:30.829> that's<00:00:31.009> the<00:00:31.910> main<00:00:32.239> product<00:00:33.140> that<00:00:33.530> people

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
and that's the main product that people

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.680 
and that's the main product that people
are<00:00:34.340> up<00:00:34.700> in<00:00:34.820> arms<00:00:34.969> about<00:00:35.180> they're<00:00:35.450> trying<00:00:35.660> to

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
this chemical that's found in hundreds

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.030 
this chemical that's found in hundreds
if<00:00:43.820> not<00:00:43.850> thousands<00:00:44.720> of<00:00:44.840> consumer<00:00:45.350> products

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
if not thousands of consumer products

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.230 
if not thousands of consumer products
that<00:00:47.030> is<00:00:47.360> a<00:00:47.750> known<00:00:48.340> endocrine<00:00:49.340> disruptor<00:00:50.030> and

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:50.240 
that is a known endocrine disruptor and

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.390 
that is a known endocrine disruptor and
that<00:00:50.720> means<00:00:50.900> that<00:00:51.020> it<00:00:51.140> interferes<00:00:51.440> with<00:00:52.280> how

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
that means that it interferes with how

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.450 
that means that it interferes with how
hormones<00:00:53.000> work<00:00:53.450> in<00:00:53.600> your<00:00:53.750> body<00:00:53.990> by<00:00:54.740> blocking

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
hormones work in your body by blocking

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.880 
hormones work in your body by blocking
how<00:00:55.670> they<00:00:55.850> work<00:00:56.090> and<00:00:56.360> this<00:00:57.050> chemical<00:00:57.380> is<00:00:57.680> so

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
how they work and this chemical is so

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.670 
how they work and this chemical is so
widespread<00:00:58.250> that<00:00:58.940> it's<00:00:59.360> actually<00:00:59.780> been<00:01:00.350> found

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
widespread that it's actually been found

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.560 
widespread that it's actually been found
in<00:01:00.980> over<00:01:01.190> 90%<00:01:02.030> of<00:01:02.510> Americans<00:01:03.110> muddies<00:01:03.909> so<00:01:04.909> it's

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
in over 90% of Americans muddies so it's

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.850 
in over 90% of Americans muddies so it's
something<00:01:05.780> that<00:01:05.930> we<00:01:06.140> really<00:01:06.500> want<00:01:06.680> to<00:01:06.770> avoid

something that we really want to avoid

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.050 
something that we really want to avoid
so<00:01:07.700> which<00:01:07.909> is<00:01:08.090> why<00:01:08.299> we<00:01:08.780> find<00:01:09.079> people<00:01:10.060> using

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060
