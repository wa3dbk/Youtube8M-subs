looking right on my turn now but it
looks<00:05:32.460> like<00:05:33.180> I've<00:05:33.570> got<00:05:33.600> the<00:05:33.960> measure<00:05:34.170> of<00:05:34.320> you

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
looks like I've got the measure of you

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.960 
looks like I've got the measure of you
here<00:05:36.470> scheduled<00:05:37.470> pit<00:05:37.740> stop<00:05:38.010> this<00:05:38.310> black

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.370 

I<00:05:41.000> wanted<00:05:41.300> to<00:05:41.360> be<00:05:41.450> able<00:05:41.540> to<00:05:41.750> hold<00:05:41.930> off<00:05:42.230> from

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
I wanted to be able to hold off from

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.340 
I wanted to be able to hold off from
Hamilton<00:05:42.890> until<00:05:43.160> the<00:05:43.280> end<00:05:43.370> of<00:05:43.430> the<00:05:43.520> race

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
Hamilton until the end of the race

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.980 
Hamilton until the end of the race
then<00:05:45.350> I<00:05:45.380> find<00:05:45.680> out<00:05:45.800> the<00:05:46.280> answer<00:05:46.310> was<00:05:46.700> no<00:05:46.940> as<00:05:47.720> you

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
then I find out the answer was no as you

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.620 
then I find out the answer was no as you
can<00:05:48.140> see<00:05:48.290> Hamilton<00:05:48.800> now<00:05:49.130> needs<00:05:49.430> to<00:05:49.640> race<00:05:49.880> on

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
can see Hamilton now needs to race on

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.400 
can see Hamilton now needs to race on
that<00:05:50.990> 26<00:05:51.650> of<00:05:51.800> 29

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.970 

why<00:05:55.740> doing<00:05:56.040> the<00:05:56.160> dirty<00:05:56.400> air<00:05:56.790> and<00:05:57.150> I<00:05:57.240> will<00:05:57.480> not

little bit deep in there that 29 of 29 I

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.570
