as ever on the bitch has been a fair

my<00:01:13.320> sense<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.729> big<00:01:14.939> Bugaboo<00:01:15.420> of

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
my sense is this is the big Bugaboo of

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.310 
my sense is this is the big Bugaboo of
riders<00:01:16.409> isn't<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.830> really<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.810> it<00:01:18.810> certainly

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
riders isn't it really and it certainly

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.760 
riders isn't it really and it certainly
was<00:01:19.619> for<00:01:20.040> me<00:01:20.189> back<00:01:20.580> through<00:01:20.909> time<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.600> my<00:01:22.500> hope

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
was for me back through time and my hope

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.429 
was for me back through time and my hope
is<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.460> an<00:01:23.580> opportunity<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.750> dispel

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
is that this is an opportunity to dispel

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.450 
is that this is an opportunity to dispel
some<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.979> myths<00:01:26.189> about<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.060> bit<00:01:27.270> to

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
some of the myths about on the bit to

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.740 
some of the myths about on the bit to
tell<00:01:29.460> some<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.850> stories<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.600> think

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
tell some of the stories that I think

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.480 
tell some of the stories that I think
gives<00:01:31.259> some<00:01:31.500> really<00:01:31.530> good<00:01:32.189> illustrations<00:01:33.150> of

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
gives some really good illustrations of

gives some really good illustrations of
on<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.119> bits<00:01:36.299> kind<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.950> histories<00:01:37.950> with

and my hope is to get you since this is
a<00:01:46.680> talk<00:01:47.369> rather<00:01:47.820> than<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.180> practical<00:01:48.869> demo<00:01:49.500> to

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
a talk rather than a practical demo to

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.350 
a talk rather than a practical demo to
get<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.009> at<00:01:50.220> least<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.579> think<00:01:50.790> about<00:01:51.119> it

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
get you at least to think about it

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.749 
get you at least to think about it
differently<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.250> hopefully<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.399> maybe<00:01:53.579> have

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
differently and hopefully to maybe have

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.209 
differently and hopefully to maybe have
a<00:01:53.790> few<00:01:54.000> physical<00:01:54.360> strategies<00:01:55.079> but<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.860> think

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
a few physical strategies but to think

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.789 
a few physical strategies but to think
about<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.729> differently<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:58.170> way<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.560> might

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
about it differently in a way that might

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.800 
about it differently in a way that might
change<00:01:59.219> your<00:01:59.610> attitude<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.240> your<00:02:00.329> horse<00:02:00.600> and

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
change your attitude to your horse and

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.830 
change your attitude to your horse and
how<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.049> think<00:02:01.229> about<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.280> bit<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.840> your

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
role in coming on the bit so for me as I

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.700 
role in coming on the bit so for me as I
think<00:02:11.340> many<00:02:11.790> riders<00:02:12.090> my<00:02:12.510> days<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:13.020> innocence

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
think many riders my days of innocence

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.480 
think many riders my days of innocence
of<00:02:13.890> my<00:02:14.270> teenage<00:02:15.270> riding<00:02:16.140> years<00:02:16.470> kind<00:02:17.100> of<00:02:17.250> come

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
of my teenage riding years kind of come

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.400 
of my teenage riding years kind of come
to<00:02:17.640> an<00:02:17.760> abrupt<00:02:17.880> halt<00:02:18.420> with<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.840> idea<00:02:19.230> that

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
to an abrupt halt with the idea that

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.840 
to an abrupt halt with the idea that
today<00:02:19.560> we<00:02:19.860> were<00:02:19.980> going<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.220> get<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.430> horses<00:02:20.730> on

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850

today we were going to get the horses on
the<00:02:20.970> bit<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.590> I<00:02:22.590> think<00:02:23.580> in<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.240> process<00:02:24.450> of

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
the bit and I think in the process of

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.550 
the bit and I think in the process of
learning<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.910> take<00:02:26.910> my<00:02:27.060> BHS<00:02:27.510> exams<00:02:27.840> all<00:02:28.140> the

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
learning to take my BHS exams all the

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.500 
learning to take my BHS exams all the
training<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.370> working<00:02:29.580> students<00:02:30.300> and

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
training and working students and

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.140 
training and working students and
various<00:02:31.290> things<00:02:31.320> I<00:02:31.800> did<00:02:32.040> in<00:02:32.250> those<00:02:32.430> days

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
various things I did in those days

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.450 
various things I did in those days
I<00:02:33.180> got<00:02:33.780> besotted<00:02:34.110> by<00:02:34.530> getting<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.310> bit

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
I got besotted by getting the bit

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.750 
I got besotted by getting the bit
thoughts<00:02:35.910> on<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.180> bit<00:02:36.500> because<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:38.430> just

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
thoughts on the bit because it just

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.100 
thoughts on the bit because it just
seemed<00:02:39.030> like<00:02:39.270> that<00:02:39.450> was<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.780> be-all<00:02:40.080> and

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
seemed like that was the be-all and

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.080 
seemed like that was the be-all and
end-all<00:02:40.440> of<00:02:40.710> riding<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.400> if<00:02:41.490> I<00:02:41.580> could<00:02:41.790> do<00:02:41.940> that

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
end-all of riding and if I could do that

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.600 
end-all of riding and if I could do that
I<00:02:42.300> was<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.510> good<00:02:42.720> rider<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.380> if<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.100> couldn't<00:02:44.490> do

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
I was a good rider and if I couldn't do

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.340 
I was a good rider and if I couldn't do
that<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:44.970> was<00:02:45.210> not<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.420> good<00:02:45.690> rider<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.290> of

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
that I was not a good rider and of

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.690 
that I was not a good rider and of
course<00:02:46.560> what<00:02:46.740> I<00:02:46.770> wanted<00:02:47.130> more<00:02:47.310> than<00:02:47.370> anything

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
course what I wanted more than anything

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.480 
course what I wanted more than anything
else<00:02:47.910> was<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.180> be<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.570> good<00:02:48.750> rider<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.650> what

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
else was to be a good rider and what

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.640 
else was to be a good rider and what
starts<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:50.940> happen<00:02:51.030> then<00:02:51.600> is<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:52.080> becomes<00:02:52.380> so

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
starts to happen then is it becomes so

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.190 
starts to happen then is it becomes so
supremely<00:02:53.220> important<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.720> horses<00:02:54.960> on

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
supremely important that the horses on

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.050 
supremely important that the horses on
the<00:02:55.290> bit<00:02:55.470> because<00:02:56.160> you're<00:02:56.430> going<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.670> be<00:02:56.790> so

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
the bit because you're going to be so

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.060 
the bit because you're going to be so

his nose to come down and I think like
many<00:03:10.080> people<00:03:10.350> I<00:03:10.860> learnt<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.370> kick<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:11.790> fiddle

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
many people I learnt to kick and fiddle

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.180 
many people I learnt to kick and fiddle
and<00:03:12.240> pull<00:03:12.480> all<00:03:12.960> and<00:03:13.350> jiggle<00:03:13.740> around<00:03:13.950> with<00:03:14.070> my

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
and pull all and jiggle around with my

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.090 
and pull all and jiggle around with my
hands<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:14.910> do<00:03:15.600> things<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:16.200> would<00:03:16.560> make<00:03:16.800> the

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
hands and do things that would make the

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.700 
hands and do things that would make the
horse's<00:03:17.490> head<00:03:17.640> come<00:03:18.060> down<00:03:18.380> largely<00:03:19.380> so<00:03:19.680> I

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
horse's head come down largely so I

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.980 
horse's head come down largely so I
wouldn't<00:03:20.100> get<00:03:20.220> screamed<00:03:20.580> at<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:23.690> once<00:03:24.690> those

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
wouldn't get screamed at and once those

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.590 
wouldn't get screamed at and once those
kind<00:03:25.320> of<00:03:25.410> things<00:03:25.620> have<00:03:25.740> been<00:03:25.890> learnt<00:03:26.600> they

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
kind of things have been learnt they

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.460 
kind of things have been learnt they
become<00:03:28.100> pretty<00:03:29.100> hard<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.790> unlearn<00:03:30.270> so<00:03:30.960> I<00:03:31.260> now

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
become pretty hard to unlearn so I now

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.250 
become pretty hard to unlearn so I now
believe<00:03:31.830> it<00:03:32.010> is<00:03:32.250> actually<00:03:32.490> possible<00:03:33.270> to<00:03:33.510> learn

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
believe it is actually possible to learn

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.590 
believe it is actually possible to learn
to<00:03:34.800> bring<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.430> core<00:03:35.670> horse<00:03:36.150> into<00:03:36.450> what<00:03:36.570> I

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
to bring the core horse into what I

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.780 
to bring the core horse into what I
might<00:03:36.810> call<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.110> seeking<00:03:37.590> reflexes<00:03:38.310> or<00:03:38.610> the

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
might call the seeking reflexes or the

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.770 
might call the seeking reflexes or the
spiral<00:03:39.210> of<00:03:39.270> ease<00:03:40.580> in<00:03:41.580> a<00:03:42.060> way<00:03:42.240> that<00:03:42.480> doesn't

spiral of ease in a way that doesn't

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.960 
spiral of ease in a way that doesn't
become<00:03:43.140> a<00:03:44.010> huge<00:03:44.700> big<00:03:44.970> deal<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.660> a<00:03:46.620> drama<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.430> a

become a huge big deal and a drama and a

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.170 
become a huge big deal and a drama and a
desperation<00:03:48.620> but<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:49.830> starts<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.370> evolve<00:03:50.730> as

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
desperation but that starts to evolve as

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.910 
desperation but that starts to evolve as
somebody's<00:03:51.930> skills<00:03:52.290> evolve<00:03:52.910> but<00:03:53.910> most<00:03:54.330> of<00:03:54.570> us

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
are in the business of unlearning

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.910 
are in the business of unlearning
those<00:03:58.920> early<00:03:59.660> desperate<00:04:00.660> measures<00:04:01.110> by<00:04:01.890> which

those early desperate measures by which

the<00:04:10.890> horse's<00:04:11.220> head<00:04:11.340> is<00:04:11.490> down<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:11.970> they<00:04:12.060> do

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
the horse's head is down and they do

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.390 
the horse's head is down and they do
when<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.510> head<00:04:12.660> is<00:04:12.690> up<00:04:13.050> and<00:04:13.290> for<00:04:13.950> some<00:04:14.130> horse

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
when the head is up and for some horse

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.849 
when the head is up and for some horse
so<00:04:14.790> some<00:04:15.000> riders<00:04:15.270> it's<00:04:15.900> just<00:04:16.200> about<00:04:16.440> looking

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
so some riders it's just about looking

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.440 
so some riders it's just about looking

writing and our joke used to be that she

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.440 
writing and our joke used to be that she
had<00:04:36.840> a<00:04:36.870> BSc<00:04:37.230> in<00:04:37.800> fiddling<00:04:38.610> horses<00:04:39.030> heads<00:04:39.210> down

had a BSc in fiddling horses heads down

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.470 
had a BSc in fiddling horses heads down
and<00:04:39.690> it<00:04:40.560> taken<00:04:40.920> her<00:04:41.040> three<00:04:41.310> years<00:04:41.550> to<00:04:41.880> get<00:04:42.300> that

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
and it taken her three years to get that

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.720 
and it taken her three years to get that
BSC<00:04:43.020> and<00:04:43.260> it<00:04:43.380> took<00:04:43.590> her<00:04:43.770> at<00:04:43.920> least<00:04:44.160> three<00:04:44.520> years

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
BSC and it took her at least three years

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.660 
BSC and it took her at least three years
to<00:04:45.390> unlearn<00:04:46.020> all<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:47.130> fiddling<00:04:47.520> and

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
to unlearn all the fiddling and

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.150 
to unlearn all the fiddling and
twiddling<00:04:48.150> that<00:04:48.570> she<00:04:48.810> learned<00:04:49.080> during<00:04:49.980> the

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
twiddling that she learned during the

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.610 
twiddling that she learned during the
process<00:04:50.580> of<00:04:50.790> getting<00:04:50.970> that<00:04:51.150> degree<00:04:51.420> and<00:04:52.050> I

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
process of getting that degree and I

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.230 
process of getting that degree and I
think<00:04:52.890> that's<00:04:53.070> probably<00:04:53.280> actually<00:04:53.790> in<00:04:54.150> the

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
think that's probably actually in the

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.610 
think that's probably actually in the
overall<00:04:54.540> scheme<00:04:54.780> of<00:04:54.840> things<00:04:55.110> a<00:04:55.200> relatively

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
overall scheme of things a relatively

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.580 
overall scheme of things a relatively
short<00:04:55.920> time<00:04:56.130> to<00:04:57.090> undo<00:04:57.780> that<00:04:57.960> learning<00:04:58.470> and

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
short time to undo that learning and

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.530 
short time to undo that learning and
undo<00:04:58.950> that<00:04:59.130> desperation<00:04:59.720> so<00:05:02.090> she<00:05:03.090> is<00:05:03.180> someone

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
undo that desperation so she is someone

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.810 
undo that desperation so she is someone
like<00:05:04.170> me<00:05:04.380> who<00:05:04.650> struggled<00:05:05.130> a<00:05:05.190> whole<00:05:05.340> load<00:05:05.580> on

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
like me who struggled a whole load on

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.670 
like me who struggled a whole load on
that<00:05:05.850> and<00:05:06.360> what<00:05:06.900> happens<00:05:07.200> with<00:05:07.290> people<00:05:07.440> in

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
that and what happens with people in

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.800 
that and what happens with people in
their<00:05:07.860> learning<00:05:07.980> process<00:05:08.640> is<00:05:08.880> they<00:05:09.060> start<00:05:09.510> to

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
their learning process is they start to

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.350 
their learning process is they start to
begin<00:05:09.990> to<00:05:10.230> realize<00:05:10.650> what<00:05:11.580> to<00:05:11.760> do<00:05:11.910> that<00:05:11.940> can

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
begin to realize what to do that can

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.750 
begin to realize what to do that can
work<00:05:12.690> and<00:05:12.990> they<00:05:13.650> start<00:05:13.920> to<00:05:14.070> get<00:05:14.190> it<00:05:14.370> to<00:05:14.490> work

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
work and they start to get it to work

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.610 
work and they start to get it to work
and<00:05:15.060> there's<00:05:15.570> that<00:05:15.750> desperate<00:05:16.170> moment<00:05:16.500> when

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
and there's that desperate moment when

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.590 
and there's that desperate moment when
the<00:05:16.710> horse's<00:05:17.040> head<00:05:17.190> comes<00:05:17.490> up<00:05:17.670> and<00:05:17.970> in<00:05:18.390> that

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
the horse's head comes up and in that

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.180 
the horse's head comes up and in that
desperate<00:05:18.840> moment<00:05:19.410> they<00:05:19.500> revert<00:05:19.860> to<00:05:20.040> all

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
desperate moment they revert to all

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.610 
desperate moment they revert to all
those<00:05:20.400> old<00:05:20.790> tactics<00:05:21.480> and<00:05:21.750> all<00:05:22.080> they<00:05:22.200> can<00:05:22.260> think

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
those old tactics and all they can think

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.970 
those old tactics and all they can think
of<00:05:22.800> is<00:05:23.070> pulling<00:05:23.490> and<00:05:23.760> fiddling<00:05:24.300> it<00:05:24.420> down<00:05:25.110> and<00:05:25.410> I

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
of is pulling and fiddling it down and I

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.340 
of is pulling and fiddling it down and I
try<00:05:26.280> to<00:05:26.340> get<00:05:26.520> people<00:05:26.580> to<00:05:26.970> be<00:05:27.090> able<00:05:27.210> to<00:05:27.360> say<00:05:27.630> okay

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
try to get people to be able to say okay

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.830 
try to get people to be able to say okay
so<00:05:28.380> it's<00:05:28.830> 11:15<00:05:29.520> on<00:05:29.670> Thursday<00:05:30.210> morning<00:05:30.390> and<00:05:30.720> my

horse's nose is up in the air so what it
doesn't<00:05:34.500> mean<00:05:34.650> I'm<00:05:34.800> a<00:05:34.830> bad<00:05:35.040> rider

something just changed between him and
me<00:05:45.750> from<00:05:46.530> which<00:05:46.770> what<00:05:47.160> we<00:05:47.310> really<00:05:47.730> want<00:05:47.910> to<00:05:48.000> do

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
me from which what we really want to do

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.170 
me from which what we really want to do
is<00:05:48.720> extract<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:49.410> learning<00:05:49.920> because<00:05:50.880> I<00:05:50.970> think

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
is extract the learning because I think

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.330 
is extract the learning because I think
one<00:05:51.360> of<00:05:51.510> the<00:05:51.600> big<00:05:51.810> deals<00:05:52.080> in<00:05:52.560> that<00:05:52.770> desperation

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
one of the big deals in that desperation

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.790 
one of the big deals in that desperation
about<00:05:53.640> on<00:05:54.000> the<00:05:54.150> bit<00:05:54.360> is<00:05:54.630> that<00:05:55.320> when<00:05:55.470> it<00:05:55.590> goes

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
about on the bit is that when it goes

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.190 
about on the bit is that when it goes
wrong<00:05:56.160> people<00:05:56.970> want<00:05:57.150> to<00:05:57.270> get<00:05:57.390> it<00:05:57.510> right<00:05:57.810> as

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
wrong people want to get it right as
