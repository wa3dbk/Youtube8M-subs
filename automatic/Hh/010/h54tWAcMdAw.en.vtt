00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
my hair my hair was damp then I applied

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.159

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
my hair and it was in four sections I

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.360 
my hair and it was in four sections I
probably<00:05:14.780> sectioned<00:05:15.740> it<00:05:15.830> off<00:05:15.950> and<00:05:16.220> maybe

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
probably sectioned it off and maybe

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.240 
probably sectioned it off and maybe
three<00:05:16.880> to<00:05:17.120> four<00:05:17.390> parts<00:05:18.050> when<00:05:18.500> applying<00:05:18.890> the

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
jail so I made sure that it can be

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.420
