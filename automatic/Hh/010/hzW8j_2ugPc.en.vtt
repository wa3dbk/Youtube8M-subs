00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:15.980
 spring pruning them good afternoon today 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:20.789
 we will try to trim leaked more precisely 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.339
 make our spring pruning we will 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.529
 pay attention 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:27.169
 Well, basically we will cut these 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.960
 here 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:41.160
 internal branches that interfere now 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:45.739
 I will drink and show you what will happen and how it will be 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.739
 see a little thinned 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:01:00.769
 Fresh cuts them necessarily need for 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:01:00.769
 cover up some fresh spinning 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.210
 because it wounds can get 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.320
 infection 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:19.060
 the tree will start to go away so we will 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.640
 now gloss over the usual 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:26.730
 oil paint 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.730
 mix 50 by 50 with normal or otherwise 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:36.130
 stirring and now you take it like this 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:44.340
 that's good for not sparing paint gloss over 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:44.340
 and all the wounds suddenly formed and 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.190
 so all wounds all thanks for 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.190
 Attention 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.430
 ask questions in the comments
