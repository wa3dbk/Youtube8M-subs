00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
worried about trim but not too bad it

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.680 
worried about trim but not too bad it
could<00:01:41.610> be<00:01:41.700> part<00:01:41.940> of<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.090> reason<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:42.570> the

could be part of the reason for the

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:51.190 
could be part of the reason for the
weird<00:01:43.080> control

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.800

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.510 

so<00:02:03.310> sloppy<00:02:03.729> on<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.890> cyclic<00:02:05.890> I<00:02:06.040> had<00:02:06.189> my<00:02:06.340> hand

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
so sloppy on the cyclic I had my hand

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.900 
so sloppy on the cyclic I had my hand
off<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.700> cyclic<00:02:07.299> stick

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.760 

that's<00:02:12.690> not<00:02:12.840> too<00:02:12.960> bad<00:02:12.990> it's<00:02:13.320> about<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.620> same

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
that's not too bad it's about the same

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.750 
that's not too bad it's about the same
as<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.040> mcps

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.420 

Rose<00:02:20.450> kind<00:02:20.750> of<00:02:20.870> slow<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:21.409> may<00:02:21.769> want<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.129> increase

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
Rose kind of slow I may want to increase

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:30.650 
Rose kind of slow I may want to increase
that<00:02:22.670> throw<00:02:23.030> quite<00:02:23.299> a<00:02:23.360> bit

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:40.770 

that<00:02:31.260> was<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.410> full<00:02:31.680> stick<00:02:31.920> rule

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:52.410 

that's<00:02:41.590> still<00:02:41.770> fun

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.170 

pretty<00:02:52.990> much<00:02:53.230> care<00:02:53.530> for<00:02:53.560> that<00:02:53.770> I'm<00:02:54.760> kind<00:02:55.120> of

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
pretty much care for that I'm kind of

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:02.340 
pretty much care for that I'm kind of
slow

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.010 

I<00:03:02.470> don't<00:03:03.040> have<00:03:03.130> a<00:03:03.190> timer<00:03:03.460> on<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:04.000> on<00:03:04.960> the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
I don't have a timer on the on the

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.140 
I don't have a timer on the on the
control<00:03:05.560> so<00:03:05.920> I'm<00:03:06.070> a<00:03:06.130> little<00:03:06.460> worried<00:03:06.940> about

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
control so I'm a little worried about

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.780 
control so I'm a little worried about
speed<00:03:07.750> yeah<00:03:08.050> this<00:03:08.320> definitely<00:03:08.950> some<00:03:09.400> sickly

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
speed yeah this definitely some sickly

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.720 
speed yeah this definitely some sickly
getting<00:03:10.060> fit<00:03:10.300> into<00:03:10.510> that<00:03:10.720> when<00:03:11.080> I<00:03:12.960> my<00:03:13.960> pyro<00:03:14.730> I'm

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
getting fit into that when I my pyro I'm

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.320 
getting fit into that when I my pyro I'm
gonna<00:03:15.910> have<00:03:16.030> to<00:03:16.180> toy<00:03:16.450> around<00:03:16.480> with<00:03:16.840> the

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
gonna have to toy around with the

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:38.260 
gonna have to toy around with the
swashplate<00:03:19.330> try<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:19.900> get<00:03:20.020> it<00:03:20.110> leveled<00:03:20.350> out

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.840 

that's<00:03:38.830> reacting<00:03:39.830> a<00:03:40.070> little<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.490> wind<00:03:40.700> I

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
that's reacting a little to the wind I

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.400 
that's reacting a little to the wind I
guess<00:03:41.060> that's<00:03:41.330> what<00:03:41.540> part<00:03:41.960> of<00:03:42.020> what's<00:03:42.200> going

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
guess that's what part of what's going

00:03:42.410 --> 00:04:04.320 
guess that's what part of what's going
on

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.050

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:12.590 

sounds<00:04:54.010> like<00:04:54.100> that<00:04:54.310> battery<00:04:54.670> is<00:04:54.730> about<00:04:54.790> dead
