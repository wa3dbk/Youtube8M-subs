00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 hey that happens very good family to all 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:11.099
 I am lady box and today I bring you a boxing 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:13.679
 the channel more man if he is my dearest 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.690
 Mr. guinea pig always so timely 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.119
 Yes and yes I've been like a year without 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.710
 a boxing but you are a veteran in the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.390
 channel you should know that I've made some 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.230
 how many to know what would you be doing 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.230
 to not see them 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.560
 I do not want to know, you have to see, it leaves me 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.560
 continue with the unboxing 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.719
 so let's continue so here I bring you this 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.460
 piece of xbox one pack that is a 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.290
 assassin's creed pack but also 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.079
 takes some other game that then what 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.899
 we will see is a version without kinect and is 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.879
 the 500 gigabyte has passed a year since 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.440
 the output of the console and after being fulfilled 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.600
 some of the requirements that I 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.899
 I personally needed to decide 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.850
 whether to buy it or not as for example a 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.250
 version without kinect a price decrease 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.860
 or a little more catalog a little more than 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.150
 chicha I think the time has come for 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.240
 take the leap to the new 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.370
 action so let's start seeing the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.040
 console regarding the design of the 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:17.370
 console is to say that when I saw it by 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.160
 first time in e3 and if I look at what course 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.160
 more ugly scored goal if I really thought 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.410
 horrible or be a very ugly thing believe 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.180
 I thought they had gone backwards in 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.590
 As regards design, but I have to recognize 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.870
 that when you have it close when the 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.230
 you have in front of you does not look so ugly indeed 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.690
 It looks pretty elegant but one thing 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.330
 that I do not like anything is that brightness that 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.619
 has is the lacquer there in brightness plan 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.229
 black that you have on one of the sides 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.300
 because all fingers are marked if 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.610
 It takes more care than milk but 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.229
 apart from that is quite pretty 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.450
 recognize it let's see it a little bit 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.330
 better to see the connections you have 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.330
 behind has the cable 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.970
 feeding has two hdmi the in and out 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.090
 an optical outlet that is where I usually 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.509
 connect my headphones two connections 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.039
 usb connection to kinect that I do not 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.189
 I have 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.400
 1st out I do not know what kind of connections 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:16.799
 sincerely and the connection for the cable 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.739
 ethernet another thing that I did not like 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.620
 absolutely not that in the part of 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.000
 forward or rather on the side 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.000
 it only carries a usb connection when 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.879
 the 360 ​​carries two connections in the part 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.640
 in front and I always use it 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:35.040
 I usually have a USB connected and the 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.200
 command or competitive so in this no 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.290
 I know how I would have to connect 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.389
 something behind so it's a minus point 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.159
 for the water not and since we're going to 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:46.019
 make a small comparison since 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.900
 I have here the other two versions of the 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.510
 360 let's compare them I'll compare 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.669
 first the 360 fatá and it is the logo of 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.950
 jerson wear fur and as you can see 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:03:00.090
 still the one is a little bigger than 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.159
 the fat 360 or dating but now I'm going to 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.049
 put the slim and you will see the difference 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.120
 daily, that is, four fingers of the 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.410
 mine that are quite small I know of 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.030
 recognize them but it's still a pass 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.490
 Now let's move on to the little box 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.410
 cables and cool things first we go 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.170
 to see the games that it brings as you can 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.110
 see comes with the assassin's creed black 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.180
 flag and with the assassin's creed johnny 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.890
 team and also also comes with the rail 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.930
 man legends that is a game that calls me 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.200
 quite the attention for its aesthetic the 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.200
 true 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.120
 Little, I do not know, mister guinea pigs 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.590
 various animals but guinea pigs but what 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:42.380
 more da I do not think to let you play every 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.750
 campaign but good anyway let's continue and here 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.610
 come all the cables we have a hdmi 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.830
 that it is appreciated that one comes in the 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.660
 box because in the 360 did not come you had 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.120
 than to buy it apart the cable 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.630
 power the power supply 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.400
 which is quite big to recognize him 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.350
 you can break someone's head 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.850
 I command that is one of the things that most 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.400
 like this console and not only 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.610
 aesthetically but economically 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.380
 is the 360 ​​for me it was already the best 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.610
 command that I have never tasted of all 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.880
 consoles that I could prove in life 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.799
 and this command at least visually looks 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.160
 pretty well it looks very comfortable I've 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.660
 could prove on occasion and 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.790
 It really is one of the things that most 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.400
 they like and well I still have to try 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.260
 the best to reach conclusions a 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.600
 little bit more reliable but I like a 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.580
 heap and finally the headset he 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.370
 changed a lot with respect to those of 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.530
 360 and I also hope it's a little bit 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.020
 more durable because good I have three of 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.030
 the 360 and none works well at all 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.010
 I must say hope is go one 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.650
 little bit better but good at least 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.690
 aesthetically I wish and pretty huayno and 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.340
 good guys here ends this a boxing 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.890
 how much illusion did I bring 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.290
 channel in addition to that to finalize 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.810
 I wanted to tell you that it also brings a 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.640
 14 day code of xbox live world that 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.470
 I would like to draw between all of you 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.750
 and it's just that the goal of 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.910
 some months and I do not even know if I can 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.710
 buy it but I do not care we'll see 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.690
 what I do at that moment I feel like 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.600
 make a person happy one of 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.280
 you guys so let's sort it out 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.260
 an improvised drawing but I thought 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.380
 what we could do is 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:22.290
 that you retweet the tweet where I 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.600
 I share this video on twitter very 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.760
 simple to see if you can not find them 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.740
 I'll make it easy do not worry 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.970
 I leave it in the description the link to 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.670

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.500

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.480
 14 day winner of xbox live gold and 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.100
