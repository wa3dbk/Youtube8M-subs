 hello and welcome to foto ak.de my 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.150
 name is alexander acker and I am 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.050
 me here in my studio in the 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.670
 rÃ¶delheimer highway in frankfurt on 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.280
 this newly created page of mine 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.049
 Homepage I want things from now on 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.539
 especially the photo 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.560
 Excited may be interesting 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.420
 could be 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.650
 I've been holding it since march 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.109
 last year 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.730
 Photo workshops in Frankfurt and will 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.990
 always asked what else important 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.359
 what else could I need 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.949
 and I want to stop that from now on 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.630
 this page just present what 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.820
 could still be important to them 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.480
 if you are professional or even in college 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.280
 want to photograph a thing 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.200
 with which many people have big problems 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.090
 have or never have 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.200
 have heard is the so-called 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.910
 calibrating your monitor 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.559
 that is a very important thing altogether 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.260
 whether professional or hobby 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.320
 and this is about the correct one 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.829
 Color rendering of your monitor or too 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.570
 laptops in my case here and that 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.400
 you have to imagine them 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.350
 have a look before you have a very nice 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.990
 picture shot edit the am 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.729
 computer really with a lot of trouble to 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.030
 a print it out or send it 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.110
 I manage it to friends &amp; e mail 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.810
 out that the picture is completely different 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.520
 looks more colorful than she actually does 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.409
 Maybe you know 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.610
 this phenomenon and thinking in the end 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.290
 even where you have the picture but I have that 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.880
 not worked and then are 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.670
 disappointed yes or says 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.960
 maybe your customer also the picture 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.340
 had a green cast and they think each other 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.580
 even my picture has no 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.110
 greenish yes 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.640
 I have not seen the 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.010
 simply because of your monitor 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.510
 not calibrated correctly 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.280
 and i want you to do that now 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.290
 Imagine it a very important thing 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.240
 Everybody should have done it 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.260
 Many say you should do it every week 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.790
 I think I can do that a bit 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.290
 Exaggerated I do it once a month 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.300
 always for the first we only have the 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.410
 first july fits so well 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.260
 really it has to do anyway and indeed 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:03.400
 I do that with this software 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:06.820
 colormunki smile the company extra and it 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.369
 this is a living yes I am 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.200
 So my really gets that one 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.050
 I think I can afford it 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.540
 80 euro at amazon is definitely 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.520
 worth an investment and renounce 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.640
 I can not do that anymore now 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.950
 included are quite simple 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.630
 a quick description and of course 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.240
 also the software the same way 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.850
 good records can and the most important 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.920
 Do you still have something to add ? 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.900
 Of course this is the device itself 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.670
 reminds in the first often only the first time 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.440
 looks like a mouse so changes 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.970
 Everything but it is just there for it 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.290
 The color of your monitor is correct 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.030
 set and it works completely 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.350
 I just want him here completely 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.840
 well ahead now so let's start 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.300
 I open the software first 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.670
 which counts within a few minutes 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.410
 k is looking at that is scary 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.940
 there are even sons built up 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.459
 nothing to note but not 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.600
 difficult so start very simple 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.670
 structured software 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.200
 So now we have it right here 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.630
 start and calibrate this monitor 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.090
 is right there already since I confirm 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.400
 that now click on the start button 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.330
 the software now recognizes that 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.870
 does not start yet 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:23.650
 that's why the big exclamation mark 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:26.700
 and now the device is looking for the device 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.220
 ok so this is me on now 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.560
 by usb the software or the 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.090
 laptops is looking for me now the calama 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.600
 this time already has him 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.910
 discovered and finally says that 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.880
 Software me that I get it now 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.470
 this should be placed on the monitor 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.620
 by also that it is a counterweight 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.560
 So, the following should do it depends 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.260
 now just about this around it 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.850
 to place exactly here 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.370
 it really depends on it now 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:01.300
 the monitor and confirm the whole then 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.709
 now comes with that and the software 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.790
 start now we can start 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.740
 wonderful to recognize 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:10.600
 I think you can tell that now 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:13.810
 several colors run out and that 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.520
 device sees the colors now recognized 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.890
 just like the color is given again 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.390
 and had calculated accordingly simply the 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.830
 correct color rendering like it 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.790
 would be actually reproduced 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:28.770
 So now it's easy 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:31.930
 perfect real couple profile created 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.630
 And it only really takes a few 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.500
 few minutes so you can undertake 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.710
 see bar that is just really just 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.020
 That's 15 minutes if at all 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.220
 should last 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.300
 and it works so easy 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.919
 really want to see totally 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.140
 I'm just going to make short here 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:53.380
 Cut and when it's done 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:57.460
 shows it again then I will myself 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.900
 then back so we can now 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.450
 see that we are now at the very end 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.919
 it's about five, yes 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:07.919
 six seven minutes has passed and 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:10.840
 The software now has several colors 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:13.610
 displayed and so is this now 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.960
 completed you could now wonderful 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.520
 So what happens now what happens here? 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.380
 finished device is calibrated please 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.620
 Remove it kate from your monitor 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.690
 that means I'll take it off again 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.420
 away and now I have the 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.110
 possibility me before and after 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.300
 show 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.430
 I'm sure that's it now 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.230
 to recognize the uni gate if 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.150
 I now clique here and after 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.550
 so before that is now 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.770
 actually not calibrated sosas 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.150
 before and it's about now 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.560
 three weeks passed since the 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.460
 Last time you can see 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.870
 that the different again 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.520
 grab is really serious 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.890
 I'll go back to later 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.140
 we really see something 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.790
 we look for a big difference in the 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.280
 colors and also in the brightness 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.920
 so we have, we have really young 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:02.550
 always sisas not calibrated before 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:07.320
 and that's what it looks like now 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:09.360
 I recalibrated the laptop yes 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.100
 So I am very surprised how extreme 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.810
 the differences are already possible 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.540
 So already see that the more time 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.980
 the more likely it is 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.419
 that you have to calibrate again 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.669
 So now here again when I go to 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.860
 after that ds much warmer of the picture 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:25.020
 simply just things just makes 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.430
 not much cold as it is 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.510
 shut up there was already there 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.030
 extremely different 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.190
 I'll just finish it 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.980
 come right out of the 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:37.400
 software and that's it 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.800
 that's what happened to me 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.300
 may not be done now 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.300
 could one reboot again but 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.160
 it is not absolutely necessary for me either 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.570
 I know now with 100 percent 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.759
 safety once I have a picture 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.830
 edited it is also just as on 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:54.070
 to look like an expression or just as well 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.300
 with a friend on the monitor 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:59.300
 I have a picture, for example 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.130
 I edited the monitor here 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.320
 calibrated it is already a few 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:07.039
 Weeks ago this is about this 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.570
 picture here as I finished it 

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:10.310
 had turned out 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.199
 So I thought it was really great 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.810
 have said so is really great 

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:16.280
 after watching the laptop the first time 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.660
 had stood the candidate very much 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.030
 strong out that the picture is extreme 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.620
 GrÃ¼nstich I think they can 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.330
 do not recognize it now 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.680
 and there I was thank god 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.600
 I did not send the picture out like this 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.180
 because with the green cast it does 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.229
 Of course not that much ago 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:33.160
 That's why I really would 

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:35.780
 recommend this software times 

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:39.949
 dare to use this software 

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:41.720
 It is really important when you are 

00:07:39.949 --> 00:07:42.470
 to deliver professional pictures and 

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.690
 want to do 

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:47.840
 you will find the link to the article 

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:49.639
 right next to the video and were 

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.020
 go through the review and try 

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:51.380
 they just love it 

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.560
 his 

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:57.289
 yes that has been already I want one 

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.820
 ask a few slips and fuels
