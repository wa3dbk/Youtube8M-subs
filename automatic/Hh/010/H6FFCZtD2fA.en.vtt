00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:09.630
 name Julian Draxler position midfield 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.360
 born 20 september 93 steffi graf 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.460
 won when I was little was the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.650
 first wm I actively followed 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.630
 actually the 2006 where I am complete 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.770
 remember 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.840
 In 2002 I was still a bit young 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.949
 I know only fragments but 2006 was 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.289
 of course in your own country here in 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.650
 Germany and there I was and also 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.820
 my whole family full of people 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.320
 germany has that at the time 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.520
 whole country was excited because of that was there 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.000
 every game with safety a highlight 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.760
 and otherwise I was actually then 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.079
 very focused on brazil because the 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.989
 a lot of superstars 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.960
 those without line had kaka and then 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.660
 even from aldo the brazilian 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.660
 around 200 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.770
 what jogi LÃ¶w with for the first time 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.110
 Offered when I was still in the 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.940
 school and then have my break during the break 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.620
 mailbox listened and thought then 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.780
 actually a bad joke but it 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.220
 were a huge feeling and after that I have 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.390
 Do not wait for a word 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.990
 teaching like that I mean me 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.980
 thoughts still with national team me 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.070
 I think I'm on the offensive right now 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.780
 I am very willing to take risks 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.330
 in one-on-one sometimes two against 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.950
 One thing has to be tricky and that 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.260
 makes women's football the most fun 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.740
 makes the direct battles the 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.150
 opponent and that's why I think that 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.710
 In any case, my strengths are running 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.610
 fly and not in witten 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.960
 childhood dream will she deal with it 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.780
 If you meet at the World Cup final 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.670
 is that what every boy actually plays 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.910
 dreaming of what to do on the playground 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.600
 plays what you simulate with with buddies 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.159
 wm finale in the wm semifinal and 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.280
 there in real life there is then 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.360
 is it a huge thing I'm glad 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.159
 most on the games 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.990
 the challenge against the big ones 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.400
 teams at such a huge tournament 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.930
 of course that is very nice and to play 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.090
 The country of Brazil is also fascinated 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.490
 of course the people and not and and 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.860
 I believe that we are really in the country 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.720
 are football and that's why it's 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.360
 a huge challenge and also a 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.830
 great incentive more 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.630
 I believe that's the potential 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.370
 no doubt that we make it to the final 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.230
 but we also know how to do it 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.060
 that he does not have his in brazil any 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.840
 normal wm is that there are many things 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.209
 can happen 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.500
 but I think if you look at ours 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.120
 current squad looks that we are there 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.870
 already big already loaded in the 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.870
 title plays
