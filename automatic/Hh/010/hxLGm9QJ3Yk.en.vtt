shake it before we start and then get

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.210 
shake it before we start and then get

duh<00:02:45.240> nonetheless<00:02:45.390> weathering<00:02:46.350> on<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.560> back

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
duh nonetheless weathering on the back

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.160 
duh nonetheless weathering on the back
I'm<00:02:47.550> assuming<00:02:48.030> this<00:02:48.090> is<00:02:48.240> gonna<00:02:48.390> have<00:02:48.720> its<00:02:48.750> back

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
I'm assuming this is gonna have its back

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.570 
I'm assuming this is gonna have its back
against<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.650> wall<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:50.070> it's<00:02:50.190> probably<00:02:50.460> had

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
against the wall so it's probably had

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.810 
against the wall so it's probably had
less<00:02:50.910> rain<00:02:51.240> and<00:02:51.570> less<00:02:52.380> wind<00:02:52.700> attacking<00:02:53.700> the

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
less rain and less wind attacking the

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.020 
less rain and less wind attacking the
metal<00:02:54.090> so<00:02:54.330> it'll<00:02:54.570> be<00:02:54.720> probably<00:02:55.650> not<00:02:55.890> quite<00:02:56.820> as

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
metal so it'll be probably not quite as

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.720 
metal so it'll be probably not quite as
effective<00:02:57.270> as<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:58.350> front<00:02:58.620> now<00:02:59.490> we<00:02:59.550> want

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
effective as the the front now we want

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.540 
effective as the the front now we want
to<00:02:59.790> get<00:02:59.910> into<00:03:00.060> some<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.600> details<00:03:00.990> and<00:03:01.550> with

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
to get into some of the details and with

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.080 
to get into some of the details and with
a<00:03:02.580> smaller<00:03:02.880> brush<00:03:03.890> just<00:03:04.890> fill<00:03:05.100> that<00:03:05.310> right<00:03:05.550> in

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.430 

where<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.210> where<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:09.630> elements<00:03:09.990> have<00:03:10.080> really

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
where the where the elements have really

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.440 
where the where the elements have really
really<00:03:10.650> attacked<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.040> metal<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:15.120> then<00:03:15.300> wipe

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
really attacked the metal and then wipe

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.150 
really attacked the metal and then wipe
it<00:03:15.600> off<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:15.960> this<00:03:16.500> is<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.710> finished<00:03:17.010> thing
