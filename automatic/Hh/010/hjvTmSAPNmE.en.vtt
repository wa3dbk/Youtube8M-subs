make sure I have enough knowing how to
much<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.710> mix<00:00:34.950> it's<00:00:35.190> kind<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.399> your<00:00:35.579> own<00:00:35.700> thing

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
much to mix it's kind of your own thing

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.680 
much to mix it's kind of your own thing
you<00:00:36.620> know<00:00:37.620> some<00:00:37.980> jobs<00:00:38.760> are<00:00:39.030> small<00:00:39.329> some<00:00:39.660> are

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
you know some jobs are small some are

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.470 
you know some jobs are small some are
big<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.649> pretty<00:00:40.980> big<00:00:41.160> panel<00:00:41.550> but

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
big this is a pretty big panel but

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.270 
big this is a pretty big panel but
that's<00:00:42.870> kind<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.140> how<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.320> get<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.739> off<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.920> there

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
that's kind of how I get it off of there

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.549 
that's kind of how I get it off of there
and<00:00:44.960> I<00:00:45.960> take<00:00:46.170> my<00:00:46.469> hardener<00:00:48.140> don't<00:00:49.140> you've<00:00:49.320> seen

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
and I take my hardener don't you've seen

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.590 
and I take my hardener don't you've seen
in<00:00:49.680> my<00:00:49.770> other<00:00:49.800> videos<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.370> just<00:00:50.399> use<00:00:50.730> one<00:00:51.000> line<00:00:51.300> I

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
in my other videos I just use one line I

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.000 
in my other videos I just use one line I
find<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.050> works<00:00:52.260> good<00:00:52.500> for<00:00:52.530> me<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.860> takes

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
find that works good for me it takes

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.819 
find that works good for me it takes
about<00:00:53.100> 15<00:00:53.610> minutes<00:00:53.640> for<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.180> dry<00:00:54.539> if<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:55.680> do

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
about 15 minutes for it to dry if you do

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.500 
about 15 minutes for it to dry if you do
two<00:00:56.070> lines<00:00:56.340> it'll<00:00:56.730> dry<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:56.969> about<00:00:57.120> five

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
two lines it'll dry in about five

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.680 
two lines it'll dry in about five
minutes<00:00:57.809> really<00:00:58.649> dries<00:00:59.039> fast<00:00:59.430> you<00:01:00.210> do<00:01:00.359> one

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
minutes really dries fast you do one

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.660 
minutes really dries fast you do one
line<00:01:00.960> drives<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.620> real<00:01:01.800> slow<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.340> get<00:01:02.520> about

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
line drives a real slow you get about

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.509 
line drives a real slow you get about
thirty<00:01:03.000> minutes<00:01:03.359> before<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.780> dries<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.519> just

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
thirty minutes before it dries so just

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.760 
thirty minutes before it dries so just
like<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:06.590> and<00:01:07.590> take<00:01:08.130> your<00:01:08.340> spreader<00:01:08.610> and

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
like that and take your spreader and

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.070 
like that and take your spreader and
just<00:01:10.770> mix<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.250> together<00:01:11.659> back<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.869> forth<00:01:13.170> I

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
just mix it together back and forth I

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.539 
just mix it together back and forth I
think<00:01:16.080> I've<00:01:16.170> done<00:01:16.290> another<00:01:16.560> video<00:01:16.799> on<00:01:17.009> glaze

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
think I've done another video on glaze

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.050 
think I've done another video on glaze
as<00:01:17.850> well<00:01:18.150> same<00:01:18.869> process<00:01:19.369> glaze<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> little

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
as well same process glaze is a little

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.460 
as well same process glaze is a little
thinner<00:01:21.509> than<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:22.049> bud<00:01:22.700> and<00:01:24.200> you<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.350> get

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
thinner than the bud and you can get

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.140 
thinner than the bud and you can get
this<00:01:25.590> stuff<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:25.979> our<00:01:26.070> website<00:01:26.490> as<00:01:26.610> well

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.390 

I<00:01:30.240> just<00:01:30.570> mix<00:01:30.870> it<00:01:31.080> up<00:01:31.230> where<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.740> can't<00:01:31.980> see<00:01:32.220> any

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
I just mix it up where you can't see any

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.190 
I just mix it up where you can't see any
blue<00:01:32.700> streams<00:01:33.240> through<00:01:33.660> it<00:01:33.840> from<00:01:34.050> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
blue streams through it from the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.110 
blue streams through it from the
hardener<00:01:34.620> you<00:01:35.400> want<00:01:35.550> it<00:01:35.640> as<00:01:35.760> even<00:01:36.180> as<00:01:36.300> possible

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
hardener you want it as even as possible

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.210 
hardener you want it as even as possible
what<00:01:39.120> I<00:01:39.150> like<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.600> do<00:01:39.780> when<00:01:40.380> I'm<00:01:40.500> done<00:01:40.740> mixing

get that on our website too I just cut

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.420 
get that on our website too I just cut
the<00:03:34.780> top<00:03:34.989> off<00:03:35.200> so<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:35.470> can<00:03:35.680> get<00:03:35.830> everything<00:03:36.100> out

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
of there when they get empty they're

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.490

hard<00:03:39.250> to<00:03:39.310> get<00:03:39.489> out<00:03:39.640> so<00:03:40.080> what<00:03:41.080> I<00:03:41.110> do<00:03:41.200> is<00:03:41.350> just

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
hard to get out so what I do is just

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.140 
hard to get out so what I do is just
take<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.970> lid<00:03:42.970> off

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
I always just do a line that's what I

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.660 
I always just do a line that's what I
find<00:03:45.970> works<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.450> best<00:03:46.630> for<00:03:46.750> me<00:03:47.580> depending<00:03:48.580> on

make it really hot you can do half a

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.840 
make it really hot you can do half a
line<00:03:53.260> if<00:03:53.530> it's<00:03:53.739> you<00:03:54.100> want<00:03:54.280> to<00:03:54.370> make<00:03:54.459> it<00:03:54.580> cold

line if it's you want to make it cold

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.810 
line if it's you want to make it cold
and<00:03:55.060> drive<00:03:55.299> slow<00:03:55.660> I<00:03:55.959> do<00:03:56.680> it<00:03:56.890> that<00:03:57.040> way<00:03:57.220> and<00:03:57.400> then

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
and drive slow I do it that way and then

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.110 
and drive slow I do it that way and then
I'll<00:03:57.910> take<00:03:58.120> my<00:03:58.180> mixer<00:03:59.110> and<00:03:59.950> then<00:04:00.790> I'll<00:04:00.910> just

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
I'll take my mixer and then I'll just

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.780 
I'll take my mixer and then I'll just
turn<00:04:01.930> it<00:04:02.080> around<00:04:02.170> you<00:04:03.040> want<00:04:03.220> to<00:04:03.310> get<00:04:03.610> all<00:04:03.700> the

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
turn it around you want to get all the

turn it around you want to get all the
air<00:04:03.940> bubbles<00:04:03.970> out<00:04:04.590> so<00:04:05.590> this<00:04:05.709> is<00:04:05.769> how<00:04:06.010> you<00:04:06.070> do

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
air bubbles out so this is how you do

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.310 
air bubbles out so this is how you do
the<00:04:06.400> air<00:04:06.519> bubbles<00:04:06.910> you<00:04:07.120> just<00:04:07.690> go<00:04:07.930> back<00:04:08.110> and

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
the air bubbles you just go back and

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.670 
the air bubbles you just go back and
forth<00:04:09.150> so<00:04:10.150> you<00:04:10.269> get<00:04:10.450> it<00:04:10.510> all<00:04:10.660> mixed<00:04:11.290> up<00:04:11.410> real

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
forth so you get it all mixed up real

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.640 
forth so you get it all mixed up real
nice<00:04:12.660> when<00:04:13.660> it's<00:04:13.810> all<00:04:13.900> one<00:04:14.110> color<00:04:14.140> then

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
nice when it's all one color then

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.370 
nice when it's all one color then
obviously<00:04:14.799> it's<00:04:15.700> ready<00:04:15.910> to<00:04:16.060> apply<00:04:16.299> but<00:04:17.200> just

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
obviously it's ready to apply but just

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.789 
obviously it's ready to apply but just
keep<00:04:17.530> going<00:04:17.769> back<00:04:17.950> and<00:04:17.979> forth<00:04:18.250> just<00:04:18.820> like<00:04:18.880> this

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
keep going back and forth just like this

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.690 
keep going back and forth just like this
it's<00:04:20.799> important<00:04:21.130> to<00:04:21.220> get<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.400> air<00:04:21.519> bubbles

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
it's important to get the air bubbles

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.000 
it's important to get the air bubbles
out<00:04:21.940> especially<00:04:22.180> on<00:04:22.510> the<00:04:22.660> glaze

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
out especially on the glaze

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.680 
out especially on the glaze
this<00:04:23.310> your<00:04:23.460> final<00:04:23.640> coat<00:04:24.350> the<00:04:25.350> body<00:04:25.620> filler<00:04:26.690> so

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
this your final coat the body filler so

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.620 
this your final coat the body filler so
just<00:04:27.930> go<00:04:28.050> back<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:28.410> forth<00:04:28.590> just<00:04:28.830> like<00:04:29.010> this

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
just go back and forth just like this

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.150 
just go back and forth just like this
once<00:04:30.630> it's<00:04:30.780> all<00:04:30.990> mixed<00:04:31.020> up<00:04:31.530> then<00:04:31.800> you're<00:04:31.950> ready

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
once it's all mixed up then you're ready

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.610 
once it's all mixed up then you're ready
to<00:04:32.370> apply<00:04:32.580> it<00:04:34.460> and<00:04:35.460> take<00:04:35.760> your<00:04:35.940> brush<00:04:36.500> or<00:04:37.500> your

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
to apply it and take your brush or your

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.710 
to apply it and take your brush or your
applicator<00:04:38.160> and<00:04:38.670> just<00:04:38.880> smooth<00:04:39.150> it<00:04:39.300> out<00:04:39.390> on<00:04:39.600> the

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
applicator and just smooth it out on the

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.350 
applicator and just smooth it out on the
bottom<00:04:40.430> you<00:04:41.430> can<00:04:41.580> kind<00:04:41.790> of<00:04:41.880> see<00:04:42.060> there's<00:04:42.270> still

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
bottom you can kind of see there's still

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.990 
bottom you can kind of see there's still
more<00:04:42.720> in<00:04:42.900> there

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
more in there

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.820 
more in there
the<00:04:45.000> glaze<00:04:45.300> is<00:04:45.510> really<00:04:45.840> thin<00:04:46.110> if<00:04:46.260> it's<00:04:46.410> hot<00:04:46.620> out

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
the glaze is really thin if it's hot out

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.580 
the glaze is really thin if it's hot out
it<00:04:47.280> likes<00:04:47.670> to<00:04:47.880> run<00:04:48.090> so<00:04:48.450> a<00:04:48.720> little<00:04:49.230> harder<00:04:49.470> to

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
it likes to run so a little harder to

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.550 
it likes to run so a little harder to
mix<00:04:49.800> up<00:04:50.510> but<00:04:51.510> I<00:04:51.600> always<00:04:51.720> put<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.110> mud<00:04:52.290> up<00:04:52.440> at

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
mix up but I always put the mud up at

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.400 
mix up but I always put the mud up at
the<00:04:52.650> top<00:04:54.080> everybody's<00:04:55.080> got<00:04:55.230> their<00:04:55.380> own

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
the top everybody's got their own

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.190 
the top everybody's got their own
technique<00:04:55.950> but<00:04:56.360> then<00:04:57.360> I<00:04:57.420> keep<00:04:57.630> a<00:04:57.720> thinner<00:04:58.020> on

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
technique but then I keep a thinner on

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.670 
technique but then I keep a thinner on
the<00:04:58.230> bottom<00:04:58.710> so<00:04:59.370> I<00:04:59.400> can<00:04:59.700> apply<00:04:59.970> it<00:05:00.060> better

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
the bottom so I can apply it better

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:07.960 
the bottom so I can apply it better
bring<00:05:01.680> you<00:05:01.800> over<00:05:01.860> here<00:05:01.980> and<00:05:02.190> we'll<00:05:02.280> apply<00:05:02.370> it

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.960 

there<00:05:08.970> you<00:05:09.060> go

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.500 

let's<00:05:12.720> start<00:05:12.960> at<00:05:13.080> the<00:05:13.110> furthest<00:05:13.560> point<00:05:14.510> and

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
let's start at the furthest point and

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.330 
let's start at the furthest point and
work<00:05:15.720> your<00:05:15.930> way<00:05:16.050> towards<00:05:16.470> you<00:05:16.680> I<00:05:19.220> don't<00:05:20.220> know

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
work your way towards you I don't know

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.890 
work your way towards you I don't know
if<00:05:20.430> I've<00:05:20.550> ever<00:05:20.670> showed<00:05:21.000> you<00:05:21.150> how<00:05:21.270> to<00:05:21.390> apply<00:05:21.480> mud

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
if I've ever showed you how to apply mud

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.620 
if I've ever showed you how to apply mud
but<00:05:22.200> mud<00:05:22.380> is<00:05:22.500> exactly<00:05:22.890> the<00:05:23.100> same<00:05:23.340> way<00:05:23.630> much

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
but mud is exactly the same way much

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.860 
but mud is exactly the same way much
just<00:05:24.960> thicker<00:05:25.290> than<00:05:25.590> this<00:05:25.800> glaze<00:05:26.510> so<00:05:27.510> I<00:05:27.570> go<00:05:27.750> all

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
just thicker than this glaze so I go all

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.750 
just thicker than this glaze so I go all
the<00:05:27.960> way<00:05:28.020> to<00:05:28.110> the<00:05:28.230> edge<00:05:28.440> it's<00:05:29.310> kind<00:05:29.550> of<00:05:29.610> work

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
the way to the edge it's kind of work

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.600 
the way to the edge it's kind of work
your<00:05:29.970> way<00:05:30.090> towards<00:05:30.480> you<00:05:31.190> remember<00:05:32.190> how<00:05:32.310> I<00:05:32.340> said

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
your way towards you remember how I said

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.060 
your way towards you remember how I said
this<00:05:32.760> is<00:05:32.940> a<00:05:32.970> little<00:05:33.240> deep<00:05:33.560> valley<00:05:34.560> here<00:05:34.920> so

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
this is a little deep valley here so

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.530 
this is a little deep valley here so
I'll<00:05:35.160> put<00:05:35.340> a<00:05:35.370> little<00:05:35.520> bit<00:05:35.610> extra<00:05:35.700> mud<00:05:36.180> in<00:05:36.330> there

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
I'll put a little bit extra mud in there

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:43.070 
I'll put a little bit extra mud in there
a<00:05:36.810> little<00:05:37.410> bit<00:05:37.530> lighter<00:05:37.830> pressure<00:05:40.280> off<00:05:42.080> kind

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
a little bit lighter pressure off kind

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.530 
a little bit lighter pressure off kind
of<00:05:43.200> even<00:05:43.410> it<00:05:43.500> out<00:05:43.590> here<00:05:43.860> in<00:05:43.950> a<00:05:43.980> little<00:05:44.010> bit<00:05:47.540> you

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
of even it out here in a little bit you

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.850 
of even it out here in a little bit you
want<00:05:48.720> to<00:05:48.780> try<00:05:48.930> to<00:05:48.990> make<00:05:49.200> sure<00:05:49.350> you<00:05:49.440> mix<00:05:49.620> up

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
want to try to make sure you mix up

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.330 
want to try to make sure you mix up
enough<00:05:50.990> glaze<00:05:51.990> for<00:05:52.410> the<00:05:52.650> whole<00:05:53.130> application

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
enough glaze for the whole application

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:59.600 
enough glaze for the whole application
to<00:05:53.940> keep<00:05:54.120> everything<00:05:54.690> all<00:05:54.920> uniform<00:05:58.400> take<00:05:59.400> some

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
to keep everything all uniform take some

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.570 
to keep everything all uniform take some
practice<00:06:00.060> learning<00:06:00.300> how<00:06:00.540> to<00:06:01.040> mix<00:06:02.040> everything

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
practice learning how to mix everything

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:13.080 
practice learning how to mix everything
just<00:06:02.760> right

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.620 

let's<00:06:13.450> go<00:06:13.630> over<00:06:13.780> one<00:06:14.050> even<00:06:14.380> coat<00:06:15.510> leveling<00:06:16.510> all

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
let's go over one even coat leveling all

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.430 
let's go over one even coat leveling all
out<00:06:17.970> may<00:06:18.970> need<00:06:19.150> another<00:06:19.300> thin<00:06:19.900> coat<00:06:20.200> after

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
out may need another thin coat after

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:28.020 
out may need another thin coat after
this<00:06:22.050> maybe<00:06:25.919> then<00:06:26.919> light<00:06:27.250> or<00:06:27.430> pressure<00:06:27.700> here

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.030 
this maybe then light or pressure here

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.490 
this maybe then light or pressure here
where<00:06:28.240> it<00:06:28.360> was<00:06:28.510> a<00:06:28.540> little<00:06:28.840> low<00:06:29.020> like<00:06:29.260> we<00:06:29.410> were

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
where it was a little low like we were

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:35.280 
where it was a little low like we were
talking<00:06:29.680> about<00:06:31.980> take<00:06:32.980> your<00:06:33.130> edge<00:06:33.310> and<00:06:34.290> just

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.290 
talking about take your edge and just

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.020 
talking about take your edge and just
let<00:06:35.470> that<00:06:35.620> dry<00:06:35.680> and<00:06:36.370> come<00:06:36.580> back<00:06:36.700> and<00:06:36.910> do

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.030 
let that dry and come back and do

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.690 
let that dry and come back and do
another<00:06:37.060> coat<00:06:37.450> later
