that makes this more interesting for us

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.130 
that makes this more interesting for us
is<00:00:58.350> if<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:59.120> put<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.210> into<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.540> hand<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:00.989> we're

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
is if we put it into the hand that we're

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.810 
is if we put it into the hand that we're
not<00:01:01.290> normally<00:01:01.710> used<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.010> drawing<00:01:02.220> with<00:01:02.519> so<00:01:02.760> I'm

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
not normally used to drawing with so I'm

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.750 
not normally used to drawing with so I'm
going<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:02.970> put<00:01:03.150> it<00:01:03.210> into<00:01:03.330> my<00:01:03.629> left<00:01:03.989> hand<00:01:04.290> and

going to put it into my left hand and
that's<00:01:05.760> going<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.090> help<00:01:06.240> us<00:01:07.190> problem-solve

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
that's going to help us problem-solve

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.039 
that's going to help us problem-solve
much<00:01:08.460> quicker<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.030> warm<00:01:09.390> up<00:01:09.570> much<00:01:09.780> quicker

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
subject is we're dealing with volumes

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.020 
subject is we're dealing with volumes
we're<00:02:31.920> dealing<00:02:32.220> with<00:02:32.250> three-dimensional

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
we're dealing with three-dimensional

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.539 
we're dealing with three-dimensional
shapes<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:34.560> were<00:02:34.709> trying<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.069> translate

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
shapes that were trying to translate

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.520 
shapes that were trying to translate
onto<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.500> two-dimensional<00:02:37.500> surface<00:02:38.390> so<00:02:39.530> we're

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
onto a two-dimensional surface so we're

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.770 
onto a two-dimensional surface so we're
thinking<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.069> those<00:02:41.370> volumes<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.239> this<00:02:42.599> is

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
thinking of those volumes and this is

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.750 
thinking of those volumes and this is
why<00:02:43.019> I'm<00:02:43.379> going<00:02:43.709> around<00:02:43.829> a<00:02:44.040> few<00:02:44.190> times<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.670> you

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
why I'm going around a few times and you

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.030 
why I'm going around a few times and you
notice<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.180> difference<00:02:45.599> as<00:02:45.750> I<00:02:45.780> do<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.079> it

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
notice the difference as I do that it

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.789 
notice the difference as I do that it
starts<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.610> create<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:48.510> feeling<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:49.079> a<00:02:49.230> actual

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
starts to create the feeling of a actual

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.330 
starts to create the feeling of a actual
three-dimensional<00:02:50.579> shape<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:52.680> also<00:02:52.980> in

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
three-dimensional shape and also in

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.259 
three-dimensional shape and also in
nature<00:02:53.790> everything's<00:02:54.420> full<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:54.840> curves<00:02:55.200> and

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
nature everything's full of curves and

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.789 
nature everything's full of curves and
arcs<00:02:57.269> and<00:02:57.890> a<00:02:58.890> lot<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.549> the<00:03:00.030> structure<00:03:00.359> of<00:03:00.810> our

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
arcs and a lot of the structure of our

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.490 
arcs and a lot of the structure of our
design<00:03:02.870> especially<00:03:03.870> when<00:03:04.019> it<00:03:04.109> comes<00:03:04.260> to

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
design especially when it comes to

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.729 
design especially when it comes to
character<00:03:04.859> or<00:03:05.250> made<00:03:05.879> up<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.239> these<00:03:07.109> shapes<00:03:07.470> and

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
character or made up of these shapes and

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.470 
character or made up of these shapes and
this<00:03:07.859> is<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.129> easiest<00:03:08.579> shape<00:03:09.590> to<00:03:10.879> place<00:03:11.879> more

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
this is the easiest shape to place more

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.460 
this is the easiest shape to place more
detail<00:03:12.900> on<00:03:12.930> so<00:03:13.680> hence<00:03:14.359> why<00:03:15.359> it's<00:03:15.569> so<00:03:15.870> important

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
detail on so hence why it's so important

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.030 
detail on so hence why it's so important
to<00:03:16.970> begin<00:03:17.970> practicing<00:03:18.209> this<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:19.409> I<00:03:19.530> promise

what I mean by a dynamic quality is a

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.890 
what I mean by a dynamic quality is a

with<00:04:55.080> my<00:04:55.290> drawing<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:59.460> you'll<00:04:59.670> see<00:04:59.970> the<00:05:00.300> other

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
with my drawing and you'll see the other

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.590 
with my drawing and you'll see the other
important<00:05:01.700> aspect<00:05:02.700> of<00:05:02.820> my<00:05:03.000> technique<00:05:03.510> is<00:05:04.460> that

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
important aspect of my technique is that

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.300 
important aspect of my technique is that
it's<00:05:06.600> flowing<00:05:07.140> the<00:05:07.290> line<00:05:07.500> is<00:05:07.710> flowing<00:05:08.160> and

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
it's flowing the line is flowing and

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.720 
it's flowing the line is flowing and
constantly<00:05:09.030> I'm<00:05:09.420> moving<00:05:10.230> my<00:05:10.410> crayon<00:05:10.860> across

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
constantly I'm moving my crayon across

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:22.240 
constantly I'm moving my crayon across
the<00:05:11.940> surface<00:05:13.430> let<00:05:14.430> me<00:05:14.580> go<00:05:14.760> to<00:05:14.930> this<00:05:15.930> one<00:05:16.170> here

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.000 

I'm<00:05:23.250> never<00:05:23.550> quite<00:05:23.790> sure<00:05:24.410> how<00:05:25.410> I'm<00:05:25.650> going<00:05:25.920> to

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
I'm never quite sure how I'm going to

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.600 
I'm never quite sure how I'm going to
place<00:05:26.250> the<00:05:26.550> elements<00:05:27.030> of<00:05:27.180> the<00:05:28.160> character<00:05:29.160> on

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
place the elements of the character on

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.970 
place the elements of the character on
the<00:05:29.880> page<00:05:30.120> and<00:05:30.480> that's<00:05:31.020> the<00:05:31.230> fun<00:05:31.470> and<00:05:31.650> beauty

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
the page and that's the fun and beauty

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.720 
the page and that's the fun and beauty
of<00:05:32.100> this<00:05:32.250> little<00:05:32.610> practice<00:05:33.030> and<00:05:33.150> exercise<00:05:34.730> and

of this little practice and exercise and
I'm<00:05:36.120> going<00:05:36.330> to<00:05:36.360> make<00:05:36.510> lots<00:05:36.750> of<00:05:36.990> mistakes<00:05:37.230> and

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:37.920 
I'm going to make lots of mistakes and

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.230 
I'm going to make lots of mistakes and
again<00:05:38.850> I<00:05:38.880> encourage<00:05:39.540> you<00:05:39.750> at<00:05:40.410> this<00:05:40.830> stage<00:05:41.240> to

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
again I encourage you at this stage to

again I encourage you at this stage to
really<00:05:42.570> embrace<00:05:42.870> that<00:05:43.260> that<00:05:43.560> you're<00:05:43.680> going<00:05:43.920> to

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:43.980

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
make lots of mistakes and this is where

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.870 
make lots of mistakes and this is where
we're<00:05:46.080> going<00:05:46.260> to<00:05:46.350> learn<00:05:48.350> and<00:05:49.430> then<00:05:50.430> let<00:05:50.610> me<00:05:50.640> go

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
we're going to learn and then let me go

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.080 
we're going to learn and then let me go
to<00:05:50.940> this<00:05:51.180> one<00:05:51.390> up<00:05:51.570> here<00:05:52.700> now<00:05:53.700> I'm<00:05:53.850> not<00:05:54.060> sure

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
to this one up here now I'm not sure

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.250 
to this one up here now I'm not sure
again<00:05:54.840> I<00:05:54.870> stress<00:05:55.350> what<00:05:55.740> angle<00:05:56.690> this<00:05:57.690> character

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
again I stress what angle this character

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.740 
again I stress what angle this character
is<00:05:58.320> going<00:05:58.410> to<00:05:58.470> be<00:05:58.530> placed<00:05:59.010> along<00:05:59.310> this<00:05:59.820> path<00:06:00.540> of

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
is going to be placed along this path of

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.680 
is going to be placed along this path of
action<00:06:00.900> and<00:06:01.760> that's<00:06:02.760> the<00:06:02.970> fun<00:06:04.880> and<00:06:05.880> look<00:06:06.420> at

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
action and that's the fun and look at

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.570 
action and that's the fun and look at
I'm<00:06:07.100> not<00:06:08.100> gripping<00:06:08.820> the<00:06:09.060> crayon<00:06:09.510> hard<00:06:10.050> and

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
I'm not gripping the crayon hard and

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:16.100 
I'm not gripping the crayon hard and
it's<00:06:11.580> flowing<00:06:12.030> across<00:06:12.620> the<00:06:13.620> paper<00:06:14.780> go<00:06:15.780> to<00:06:15.840> this

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
it's flowing across the paper go to this

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.680 
it's flowing across the paper go to this
one

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:28.330 

and<00:06:24.310> he'd<00:06:25.310> change<00:06:25.730> his<00:06:26.560> pose<00:06:27.560> a<00:06:27.590> little<00:06:28.070> with

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:28.340 
and he'd change his pose a little with

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.420 
and he'd change his pose a little with
the<00:06:28.520> cycle<00:06:29.210> that<00:06:29.240> looks<00:06:29.450> like<00:06:29.600> he's<00:06:29.900> running

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:39.940 

this<00:06:34.430> one<00:06:34.670> back<00:06:36.520> now<00:06:37.520> with<00:06:37.880> the<00:06:38.030> last<00:06:38.270> one<00:06:38.950> it's

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:39.950 
this one back now with the last one it's

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.710 
this one back now with the last one it's
straight<00:06:40.280> up<00:06:40.310> and<00:06:40.550> down<00:06:40.670> and<00:06:41.030> that<00:06:41.420> really

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 
straight up and down and that really

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.950 
straight up and down and that really
restricts<00:06:42.290> me<00:06:42.470> and<00:06:43.010> you'll<00:06:43.580> see<00:06:46.060> what<00:06:47.060> what

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
restricts me and you'll see what what

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.910 
restricts me and you'll see what what
will<00:06:48.140> happen<00:06:49.780> if<00:06:50.780> I<00:06:50.900> call<00:06:51.200> it<00:06:51.410> the<00:06:52.130> tin<00:06:52.520> soldier

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:53.920 
will happen if I call it the tin soldier

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.920 
will happen if I call it the tin soldier
it's<00:06:54.920> symmetrical<00:06:55.670> it<00:06:55.910> twins

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930 
it's symmetrical it twins

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.560 
it's symmetrical it twins
twinning<00:06:57.770> meaning<00:06:58.280> it<00:06:58.400> repeats<00:06:58.760> itself<00:06:58.970> the

00:06:59.560 --> 00:06:59.570 
twinning meaning it repeats itself the

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.120 
twinning meaning it repeats itself the
same<00:06:59.780> from<00:07:00.140> one<00:07:00.170> side<00:07:00.680> to<00:07:00.980> the<00:07:01.010> other<00:07:02.710> and<00:07:03.710> you

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.130 
same from one side to the other and you

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.190 
same from one side to the other and you
can<00:07:04.280> see<00:07:04.610> the<00:07:04.760> big<00:07:04.970> difference<00:07:05.390> between<00:07:05.480> these

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:06.200 
can see the big difference between these

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.330 
can see the big difference between these
characters<00:07:06.500> and<00:07:07.070> this<00:07:07.760> character<00:07:08.300> here<00:07:08.690> and

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.340 
characters and this character here and

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.560 
characters and this character here and
again<00:07:10.340> you<00:07:10.490> might<00:07:10.640> ask<00:07:11.380> why<00:07:12.380> do<00:07:12.700> a<00:07:13.700> path<00:07:14.420> of

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:14.570 
again you might ask why do a path of

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.980 
again you might ask why do a path of
action<00:07:14.720> and<00:07:15.230> you<00:07:15.890> can<00:07:15.920> see<00:07:16.520> when<00:07:16.880> I<00:07:16.910> curve<00:07:17.360> have

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:17.990 
action and you can see when I curve have

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.370 
action and you can see when I curve have
a<00:07:18.110> nice<00:07:18.380> curvy<00:07:18.920> line<00:07:19.130> or<00:07:19.460> path<00:07:20.000> of<00:07:20.180> action<00:07:20.380> look

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:21.380 
a nice curvy line or path of action look

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.200 
a nice curvy line or path of action look
what<00:07:21.560> it<00:07:21.680> does<00:07:21.860> to<00:07:21.920> these<00:07:22.490> characters<00:07:23.030> it

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.210 
what it does to these characters it

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.050 
what it does to these characters it
gives<00:07:23.480> me<00:07:23.690> a<00:07:23.720> reference<00:07:24.580> yet<00:07:25.580> look<00:07:25.760> at<00:07:25.880> this

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:26.060 
gives me a reference yet look at this

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:31.270 
gives me a reference yet look at this
one<00:07:26.300> here<00:07:27.010> straight<00:07:28.010> up<00:07:28.160> and<00:07:28.370> down<00:07:29.920> so<00:07:30.920> again<00:07:31.100> I

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 
one here straight up and down so again I

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.780 
one here straight up and down so again I
recommend<00:07:31.550> you<00:07:32.480> do<00:07:32.690> this<00:07:32.900> before<00:07:33.790> every
