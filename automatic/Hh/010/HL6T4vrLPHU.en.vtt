00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.480
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.020
 my youtube channel to another 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.730
 film about the the phantom quadrocopter 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.160
 I had one of the first episodes 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.109
 show you how her head together 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.630
 Today I would like to build the 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.460
 go backwards and show you 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.259
 how her head apart again 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.480
 could take and even one more 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.619
 a little bit more than that 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.359
 delivery condition we want 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.760
 look like you at the internees 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.199
 This can be important, for example 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.680
 be if you change a motor 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:40.899
 wanted or if you the battery compartment 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.090
 too small is her usb connection after 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.730
 wanted to lay outside or a gimbel 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.949
 system would have to start yes we start 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.149
 directly with the preparations what you 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.149
 for that needs 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.730
 Here we come to the preparations you 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.469
 needs some tools around the head 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.830
 first of all, completely disassemble 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.750
 helpful here is this key of 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.210
 wrench because we have to go here 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.680
 also take the propellers off again 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.659
 to get inside 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.270
 Furthermore, a helpful tool 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.820
 again and again is a small knife 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.479
 I'll show you what it takes 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.409
 and last but not least we need one 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.770
 screw box a screwdriver 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.899
 box similar to this beer should 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.159
 contain a philips cross 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:34.000
 screwdriver in small and one 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.509
 screwdriver that's what I think 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.619
 made the gate we need for 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:43.959
 the phantom quadrocopter the first thing 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.100
 we have to do is propeller 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:49.630
 to decrease 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:52.539
 Unfortunately, this is not different here 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.360
 top part must be removed and we 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:58.049
 otherwise not with the voters 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.630
 that's why I have to come over here 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:05.649
 First of all, all four propellers 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.109
 be taken down when we do that 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:11.350
 Then we take care 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:13.030
 next the knife because as I yes 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.299
 already said the shell will 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.220
 Removed and these stickers are here 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.000
 on it are the connecting upper and 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.340
 lower part 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.560
 Now you can certainly completely off 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.600
 and do that a few times 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.410
 but then they have their adhesive power 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.200
 lost 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.019
 I believe there is one more 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.340
 Replacement scope of delivery but it works 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.890
 we take that too differently 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.019
 knife and cut carefully here 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.650
 the seam along between upper and 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:44.769
 bottom part and cut the sticker 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.730
 in two parts you can see that later 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.970
 Not 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.129
 however, it can be so wonderful then 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.950
 separate upper and lower part from each other 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:57.480
 without the stickers to here 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.459
 had to do yes front and back 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.790
 you have to blame that for a total of 44 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.739
 make small cuts here 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.080
 careful that you do not hurt yourself 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.129
 with the knife and that's not true 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.319
 too much in the plastic cuts here 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:17.200
 and if you did that then 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.299
 We can put our heads down there once 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.739
 turn head 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.480
 so there is now a whole lot 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.579
 sometimes they just look in the screw 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.680
 detail 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.239
 alone here in the field of motors are 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.390
 a total of seven screws 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.959
 we have a small cross here in front 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.750
 then screw a total of four here 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.549
 unscrew the outside well too little 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.560
 these four screws are here 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.510
 the four engine screws the engine 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.239
 hold in position we need 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.269
 not to solve and then we have here 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.730
 maybe again sunk two 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:55.030
 screw the upper and lower parts 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.010
 Get together a last screw 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.440
 an eighth screw is finally here 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.450
 in this hole also sunk a torx 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.430
 screw just like the two here and 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.370
 this also holds upper and lower parts 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.400
 together to solve upper and lower part 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.130
 So we have to be at each of the four poor 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.919
 on the one hand solve the cross screw here 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:18.340
 and on the other hand these three courts 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:20.289
 screw the small cross screw here 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.630
 It's the easiest way out and is 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:25.240
 also solved quickly 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:28.950
 the two talks here in front 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.880
 they are also relatively easy 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.650
 relatively small screws so 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.860
 You do not need to stay there long 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.860
 screw 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.070
 a bit more difficult is these talks 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.800
 screw because everyone still has that 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.210
 Landesstelle is who has problems because of the 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.289
 Of course, this can also be done beforehand 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.889
 dismantle the frame 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:53.710
 if you like that here a bit 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:56.210
 but then that's the way it goes 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:02.030
 quite well 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:05.610
 and you get these screws solved 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.410
 which is the most difficult of 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.690
 all 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.340
 if you all screw on the four then 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.270
 you have solved poor then you can 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.889
 Carefully here, the top up 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.010
 pull 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:21.389
 as straight as possible here is one more 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.760
 Connection of the two connections 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:29.550
 rather, this is a bit difficult now 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.990
 I hope you can see that shows you 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.800
 the connections now here 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.490
 In the year so this is now the cover 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.060
 again 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.430
 you see two cables still with the 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.990
 lid are connected 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.389
 that's the cable from here 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.090
 walk down in one foot to 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:51.120
 compass this is that grief and here 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:54.990
 is still a second cable that goes here 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:57.320
 over in the big na velvet chip and what 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.630
 here below hides among these 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.300
 women here this is the gps antenna of the 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:06.599
 body is so here in the reason 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.310
 taken with the chip and the board 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:10.620
 connected so there you have to be relative 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.660
 Be careful when looking at the lid 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.760
 decreases 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:17.250
 so the dsi phantom quadrocopter 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.539
 apart so you come to the 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.240
 internees ran 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:23.310
 that was it first of all in me 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.110
 In reverse order, the head will be there 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.620
 of course that means built together 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.990
 Carefully put the lid on it again 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.710
 screw in and also the propellers 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.960
 turn it back on 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.520
 you should not be left with a screw at the end 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.860
 if you have then you have something 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.270
 wrong 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.830
 By the way, please take care of the screws 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.660
 that they are not lost 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.180
 it's best you get involved like one 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:48.240
 small bowl or something like that you where 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.949
 you can do screws in if you like 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.330
 I liked the movie then 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:54.330
 I look forward to a nice comment 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:57.949
 Subscribed for a positive rating 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.949
 me and recommend me
