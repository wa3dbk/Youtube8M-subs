00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:19.660
 to start the square what we have 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.750
 What to do are 5 chains 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.240
 a 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.369
 2. 3. 4. 5 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.470
 I make five chains so that the 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:35.670
 middle circle do not come out very big 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.809
 then we put the needle into the light 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.809
 from the first 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:47.170
 and I strapped myself and took out both 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.170
 both 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.239
 then we have a small circle to 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:58.070
 be at the base of the square now 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.909
 we make 3 high points the first 3 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.909
 cadenetas 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.059
 we put inside the circle 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.220
 and we make 2 high points 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:25.130
 now we make 3 chains this is going to be 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.130
 a corner of the square 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.100
 three other high points 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.300
 and three other chains 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.530
 if you notice, it's already taking shape 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.840
 we no longer only have one side of the 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.730
 square three more chains to make 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.849
 the corners 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.849
 three and three high points 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.110
 and to the last corner three chainlets 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.530
 and click on the first 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.469
 we take the thread as we have closed 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.530
 the little circle both at the same time 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:30.980
 and we have the first round 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:39.569
 from the square the next turn we have 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:43.610
 what to do 5 chain 1 2 3 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:48.710
 4 and 5 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:51.160
 and here in the corner we make 3 points 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.160
 tall 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.239
 and three as we see we are already in the 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.660
 corner as we have done in the turn 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:18.980
 previous three chains for for the 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:21.650
 corner 1 2 and 3 and now we make 3 points 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.940
 high in what we have left of chains 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.940
 in this same hole 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:38.209
 to leave this instead of doing three 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:38.209
 chains we make two 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.470
 and three high points 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:57.430
 so it would be at four in the four 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:00.999
 sides three corner chains three 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.990
 high points two cadenetas of hollow and 

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:03.990
 three high points 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.409
 now in the end is where we have to 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:14.740
 have a little more care because 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:18.069
 now that it would enter would be three points 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:22.180
 high but to finish we only do 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:24.810
 two because we have already done one is to say 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.810
 we make 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.500
 one 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.900
 and 2 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:37.470
 and the third would be the three chains 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.470
 High 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:46.410
 what we have done before 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.410
 go 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:54.900
 and so all the laps are done here in 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.870
 we would do 1 2 and 3 that would be the first 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.560
 vareta 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.160
 and here 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.160
 two 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:12.969
 agree now two chains the 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:17.540
 corner and so always so many laps 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:20.620
 as big as we want 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.620
 the square 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.750
 as I said all the laps 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:29.870
 following are the same and we can 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:32.960
 make it as big as we want here 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.920
 extracted this shows that you see is a 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.740
 square 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:40.200
 with many more laps than it has 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.480
 they are also the point is tiniest 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:46.050
 because it's the thread is number 8 is not 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:49.130
 the number 5 but they do exactly what 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:54.350
 same and we have converted it into 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:54.350
 We have put a key holder here 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:00.220
 to hook the keys and take it in 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:03.940
 the bag is lined 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:07.270
 and if you want to buy it I have already done and 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:10.510
 finished in our store you can do it 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:13.660
 you can acquire but above all 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:17.910
 important that you see that the square is 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.910
 makes it as big as we want 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:24.629
 in the next video we will see I will explain 

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:28.409
 how to change color 

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:31.740
 the turns without being seen without 

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:36.539
 see the added agreement and the edge that 

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:41.180
 it is also with high points but this one 

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:41.180
 I called wave point also explain 

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:47.360
 Well nothing if you liked subscribe and 

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.360
 share until later
