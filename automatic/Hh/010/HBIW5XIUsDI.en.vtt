mikado<00:00:58.370> and<00:01:00.829> we'll<00:01:01.829> do<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.280> nicely<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:03.680> know

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
mikado and we'll do that nicely I know

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.289 
mikado and we'll do that nicely I know
it's<00:01:04.830> very<00:01:04.979> very<00:01:05.220> difficult<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.909> get<00:01:06.150> those

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
it's very very difficult to get those

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.660 
it's very very difficult to get those
slices<00:01:06.570> out<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.930> there<00:01:07.200> everybody<00:01:08.040> hates<00:01:08.340> to

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
slices out of there everybody hates to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.520 
slices out of there everybody hates to
peel<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.180> avocado<00:01:09.680> so<00:01:10.820> if<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.390> take<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.930> large

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
peel and avocado so if you take a large

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.359 
peel and avocado so if you take a large
enough<00:01:13.860> spoon<00:01:14.250> right<00:01:15.119> along<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.750> edge<00:01:16.369> move

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
enough spoon right along the edge move

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.840 
enough spoon right along the edge move
around<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.420> then<00:01:19.110> loosen<00:01:20.009> everything<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.729> it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
around and then loosen everything and it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.950 
around and then loosen everything and it
gets<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.240> goop<00:01:22.159> right<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.430> through<00:01:23.759> then<00:01:24.150> you

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
gets this goop right on through then you

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.070 
gets this goop right on through then you
get<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.259> avocado<00:01:25.740> all<00:01:26.009> sliced<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:27.090> out<00:01:27.299> very

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
cleanly again same things around get the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.230 
cleanly again same things around get the
edges<00:01:34.939> loose<00:01:36.650> from<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> big<00:01:37.979> end<00:01:38.250> all<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:39.030> way

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
and it gets a little bit of irony if you

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.630 
and it gets a little bit of irony if you
let<00:02:10.810> it<00:02:10.929> sit<00:02:11.140> too<00:02:11.410> long<00:02:11.440> but<00:02:12.060> Romain<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:14.640> very

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
chopping off the four parts we don't

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:38.039 
chopping off the four parts we don't
need<00:02:28.569> this<00:02:28.690> down<00:02:30.599> have<00:02:31.599> it<00:02:33.209> order<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:37.049> it's

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
and there we have a little hearts of

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.750 
and there we have a little hearts of
romaine<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:52.060> let's<00:02:52.299> just<00:02:53.190> add<00:02:54.190> a<00:02:54.220> bit<00:02:54.730> more

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
romaine and let's just add a bit more

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.690 
romaine and let's just add a bit more
over<00:02:55.269> here<00:02:55.299> outside<00:02:56.940> fill<00:02:57.940> this<00:02:58.120> up<00:02:58.329> just<00:02:59.700> so

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
over here outside fill this up just so

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.369 
over here outside fill this up just so
it<00:03:00.790> helps<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.090> push<00:03:01.329> our<00:03:01.510> avocados<00:03:02.140> out<00:03:02.349> a

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
it helps to push our avocados out a

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:07.979 
it helps to push our avocados out a
little<00:03:02.709> bit<00:03:02.860> farther<00:03:03.129> to<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.430> side<00:03:06.989> seasoning

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
little bit farther to the side seasoning
