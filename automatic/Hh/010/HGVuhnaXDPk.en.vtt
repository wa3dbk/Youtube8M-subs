get to some of these questions shall we

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.279 
get to some of these questions shall we
why<00:00:46.239> do<00:00:46.539> ninjas<00:00:46.989> run<00:00:47.170> up<00:00:47.260> trees<00:00:47.500> like<00:00:47.980> Xena

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
why do ninjas run up trees like Xena

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.259 
why do ninjas run up trees like Xena
first<00:00:50.289> off<00:00:50.530> those<00:00:50.710> are<00:00:50.859> two<00:00:51.129> different<00:00:51.370> tree

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
first off those are two different tree

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:53.340 
first off those are two different tree
running<00:00:52.600> skills

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
running skills

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.979 
running skills
I<00:00:53.379> think<00:00:54.249> ninjas<00:00:54.670> are<00:00:54.820> just<00:00:54.999> so<00:00:55.179> Swift<00:00:55.570> and<00:00:55.809> so

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
I think ninjas are just so Swift and so

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.680 
I think ninjas are just so Swift and so
fast<00:00:56.320> and<00:00:56.859> can<00:00:57.309> control<00:00:57.789> chakra<00:00:58.420> and<00:00:58.539> other

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
fast and can control chakra and other

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.560 
fast and can control chakra and other
powers<00:00:59.079> like<00:00:59.260> that<00:00:59.289> they<00:01:00.280> just<00:01:00.309> run<00:01:00.730> up<00:01:00.879> up<00:01:01.210> and

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
powers like that they just run up up and

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.259 
powers like that they just run up up and
down<00:01:01.629> trees<00:01:02.050> all<00:01:02.230> they<00:01:02.379> feel<00:01:02.739> like<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:04.059> it

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
down trees all they feel like but it

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.300 
down trees all they feel like but it
does<00:01:04.480> take<00:01:04.720> a<00:01:04.750> little<00:01:04.930> bit<00:01:05.019> out<00:01:05.199> of<00:01:05.230> them<00:01:05.470> as

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
does take a little bit out of them as

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.060 
does take a little bit out of them as
for<00:01:06.700> Xena<00:01:06.970> I<00:01:07.330> think<00:01:07.660> she's<00:01:08.020> more<00:01:08.320> magical<00:01:08.920> I

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
for Xena I think she's more magical I

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.070 
for Xena I think she's more magical I
mean<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.760> gods<00:01:10.000> blessed<00:01:10.510> her<00:01:10.660> with<00:01:10.690> all<00:01:10.960> these

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
mean the gods blessed her with all these

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.460 
mean the gods blessed her with all these
abilities<00:01:11.410> she<00:01:11.770> can<00:01:11.920> even<00:01:12.010> kill<00:01:12.400> gods<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:14.080> I

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
abilities she can even kill gods so I

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.380 
abilities she can even kill gods so I
would<00:01:14.830> have<00:01:14.920> to<00:01:15.070> say<00:01:15.280> she<00:01:15.520> doesn't<00:01:15.820> use<00:01:16.210> the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
would have to say she doesn't use the

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.950 
would have to say she doesn't use the
same<00:01:16.630> tactics<00:01:17.140> as<00:01:17.350> ninjas<00:01:17.830> to<00:01:18.630> take<00:01:19.630> away<00:01:19.810> the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
same tactics as ninjas to take away the

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.410 
same tactics as ninjas to take away the
gods<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:21.070> Xena<00:01:21.370> can't<00:01:21.670> run<00:01:21.880> him<00:01:22.000> tree<00:01:22.210> she

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
gods and the Xena can't run him tree she

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.870 
gods and the Xena can't run him tree she
just<00:01:22.600> fall<00:01:22.870> right<00:01:22.900> off<00:01:23.080> like<00:01:23.350> we<00:01:23.590> would

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
just fall right off like we would

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.330

lie no it was more like front corner so

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.669 
lie no it was more like front corner so
I<00:01:49.969> could<00:01:50.210> see<00:01:50.479> everything<00:01:50.929> perfectly<00:01:50.960> clearly

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
I could see everything perfectly clearly

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.710 
I could see everything perfectly clearly
but<00:01:52.009> I<00:01:52.039> was<00:01:52.220> in<00:01:52.340> a<00:01:52.399> corner<00:01:52.820> so<00:01:53.000> I<00:01:53.030> wasn't<00:01:53.360> seen

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
but I was in a corner so I wasn't seen

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.240 
but I was in a corner so I wasn't seen
as<00:01:53.750> well<00:01:54.640> also<00:01:55.640> right<00:01:55.939> behind<00:01:56.090> me<00:01:56.479> there<00:01:56.899> was

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
as well also right behind me there was

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.139 
as well also right behind me there was
another<00:01:58.250> me<00:01:58.549> I<00:01:59.590> was<00:02:00.590> that<00:02:00.770> cool<00:02:00.979> and<00:02:01.310> then

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
another me I was that cool and then

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.300 
another me I was that cool and then
behind<00:02:02.479> that<00:02:02.689> me<00:02:02.869> there<00:02:03.229> was<00:02:03.409> a<00:02:03.439> gaping<00:02:03.890> hole

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
behind that me there was a gaping hole

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.520 
behind that me there was a gaping hole
in<00:02:04.340> time-space<00:02:07.119> which<00:02:08.119> I<00:02:08.360> did<00:02:08.599> not<00:02:08.780> create<00:02:09.049> and

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
in time-space which I did not create and

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.370 
in time-space which I did not create and
have<00:02:10.310> yet<00:02:10.640> to<00:02:10.700> figure<00:02:11.060> out<00:02:11.269> how<00:02:11.599> it<00:02:11.959> came<00:02:12.200> to

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
have yet to figure out how it came to

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.910 
have yet to figure out how it came to
occur<00:02:12.739> that<00:02:13.099> there<00:02:13.400> was<00:02:14.110> yet<00:02:15.110> a<00:02:15.140> hole<00:02:15.650> in

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
occur that there was yet a hole in

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.870 
occur that there was yet a hole in
time-space<00:02:16.160> but<00:02:16.790> it<00:02:17.360> was<00:02:17.569> there<00:02:18.190> so<00:02:19.190> it's

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
time-space but it was there so it's

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.050 
time-space but it was there so it's
still<00:02:20.239> there<00:02:20.510> you<00:02:21.610> obviously<00:02:22.610> couldn't<00:02:22.819> have

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
still there you obviously couldn't have

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.260 
still there you obviously couldn't have
