battery<00:00:28.789> this<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:30.650> perhaps<00:00:31.650> something<00:00:32.610> that

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
battery this is perhaps something that

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.810 
battery this is perhaps something that
are<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> light<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.190> basically<00:00:35.760> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
are this is a light of basically the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.510 
are this is a light of basically the
same<00:00:36.120> type<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.899> function<00:00:37.770> but<00:00:38.219> then<00:00:38.370> most

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
same type of function but then most

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.310 
same type of function but then most
everybody<00:00:39.090> would<00:00:39.329> know<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.809> old<00:00:39.930> light<00:00:40.110> might

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
everybody would know the old light might

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.709 
everybody would know the old light might
be<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> stranger<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.100> some<00:00:41.340> but<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.969> Phoenix<00:00:42.390> is

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
be a stranger to some but the Phoenix is

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.170 
be a stranger to some but the Phoenix is
usually<00:00:43.350> more<00:00:43.530> widely<00:00:43.829> known<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.730> p2

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
usually more widely known this is the p2

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.490 
usually more widely known this is the p2
d<00:00:46.010> which<00:00:47.149> has<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.390> same<00:00:48.600> basic<00:00:49.110> functionality

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
d which has the same basic functionality

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.760 
d which has the same basic functionality
as<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.250> o<00:00:50.489> light<00:00:50.940> now<00:00:51.539> i<00:00:51.600> review<00:00:52.260> both<00:00:52.500> these

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
as the o light now i review both these

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.950 
as the o light now i review both these
together<00:00:53.039> because<00:00:53.610> they<00:00:54.120> are<00:00:54.149> basically<00:00:54.750> in

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
together because they are basically in

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.889 
together because they are basically in
the<00:00:55.020> same<00:00:55.110> class<00:00:55.820> they<00:00:56.820> are<00:00:56.850> both<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.719> newer

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the same class they are both the newer

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.139 
the same class they are both the newer
editions<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.859> these<00:00:59.039> lights<00:00:59.399> therefore<00:01:00.000> they

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
editions of these lights therefore they

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.969 
editions of these lights therefore they
both<00:01:00.420> run<00:01:00.750> 180<00:01:01.500> lumens<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.609> their<00:01:02.910> top

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
both run 180 lumens and in their top

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.630 
both run 180 lumens and in their top
illumination<00:01:04.979> mode<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:06.979> the<00:01:07.979> phoenix

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
illumination mode and the phoenix

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.120 
illumination mode and the phoenix
basically<00:01:09.119> has<00:01:09.420> four<00:01:09.979> modes<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.280> illumination

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
basically has four modes of illumination

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.370 
basically has four modes of illumination
plus<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.520> well<00:01:15.150> including<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.689> turbo<00:01:16.140> mode

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
plus the well including the turbo mode

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.870 
plus the well including the turbo mode
and<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:18.090> o<00:01:18.119> light<00:01:18.570> has<00:01:18.990> five<00:01:19.650> levels<00:01:20.610> of

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
and the o light has five levels of

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.109 
and the o light has five levels of
illumination<00:01:21.950> including<00:01:22.950> its<00:01:23.130> top<00:01:23.580> spot<00:01:24.000> of

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
illumination including its top spot of

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.429 
illumination including its top spot of
180<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.140> they<00:01:25.830> both<00:01:26.130> go<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.640> both<00:01:27.299> SOS<00:01:28.110> mode

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
180 and they both go to both SOS mode

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.999 
180 and they both go to both SOS mode
and<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:29.700> strobe<00:01:30.090> mode<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.140> if<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.619> put<00:01:31.829> them

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
and a strobe mode and if you put them

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.510 
and a strobe mode and if you put them
both<00:01:32.600> side<00:01:33.600> by<00:01:33.869> side<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:35.070> can<00:01:35.280> see<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.880> the

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
both side by side you can see that the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.819 
both side by side you can see that the
Phoenix<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.909> just<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.540> little<00:01:40.229> bit<00:01:40.380> smaller

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
Phoenix is just a little bit smaller

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.100 
Phoenix is just a little bit smaller
than<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.820> old<00:01:42.000> light<00:01:42.240> there's<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.750> Phoenix

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
than the old light there's the Phoenix

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.660 
than the old light there's the Phoenix
on<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.470> right<00:01:43.680> it's<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.250> little<00:01:44.280> bit

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
on the right it's just a little bit

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.090 
on the right it's just a little bit
smaller<00:01:44.939> than<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.360> old<00:01:45.509> light<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.049> as<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.920> say

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
smaller than the old light and as I say

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.109 
smaller than the old light and as I say
they<00:01:47.250> both<00:01:47.430> use<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:48.750> one<00:01:49.140> 3<00:01:50.130> volt<00:01:50.399> lithium

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
they both use just one 3 volt lithium

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.020 
they both use just one 3 volt lithium
battery<00:01:51.630> they<00:01:52.290> both<00:01:52.530> have<00:01:52.920> reverse<00:01:53.520> cookies

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
battery they both have reverse cookies

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.760 
battery they both have reverse cookies
and<00:01:54.329> they<00:01:55.049> both<00:01:55.200> stand<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.829> end<00:01:56.250> very<00:01:56.939> nicely

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
and they both stand on end very nicely

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.260 
and they both stand on end very nicely
and<00:01:58.770> there's<00:01:59.070> the<00:02:00.200> actual<00:02:01.340> cree<00:02:02.340> bulb<00:02:02.759> there

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
and there's the actual cree bulb there

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.100 
and there's the actual cree bulb there
inside<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.189> bezel<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.659> p2<00:02:06.659> d

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.760 
at the bottom mode followed by 55
followed<00:02:42.459> by<00:02:42.580> 107<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.630> then<00:02:44.170> their<00:02:44.350> turbo

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
followed by 107 and then their turbo

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.490 
followed by 107 and then their turbo
mode<00:02:45.010> is<00:02:45.780> 180<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:47.380> pretty<00:02:47.680> much<00:02:47.940> they're

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
mode is 180 so pretty much they're

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.470 
mode is 180 so pretty much they're
relatively<00:02:50.500> similar<00:02:51.070> as<00:02:51.910> far<00:02:51.940> as<00:02:52.300> their

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
relatively similar as far as their

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.880 
relatively similar as far as their
lumens<00:02:52.780> are<00:02:52.900> concerned<00:02:53.290> now<00:02:53.440> we're<00:02:53.620> going<00:02:53.770> to

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
lumens are concerned now we're going to

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.490 
lumens are concerned now we're going to
take<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:54.730> look<00:02:55.000> at<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.510> lights<00:02:55.720> performances

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
take a look at the lights performances

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.240 
take a look at the lights performances
themselves<00:02:57.130> okay<00:02:57.940> I<00:02:58.120> am<00:02:58.450> outside<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:59.380> I<00:02:59.860> have

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
themselves okay I am outside and I have

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.430 
themselves okay I am outside and I have
right<00:03:00.520> here<00:03:00.550> although<00:03:01.330> you<00:03:01.510> can't<00:03:01.840> see<00:03:02.110> it<00:03:02.260> I

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
right here although you can't see it I

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.760 
right here although you can't see it I
have<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:03.040> Phoenix<00:03:03.480> p.2d<00:03:04.510> I'm<00:03:05.170> gonna<00:03:05.380> turn<00:03:05.590> it

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
have the Phoenix p.2d I'm gonna turn it

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.310 
have the Phoenix p.2d I'm gonna turn it
on<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.280> it's<00:03:06.730> gonna<00:03:06.880> start<00:03:07.209> at<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.630> low<00:03:07.840> level

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
on and it's gonna start at the low level

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.890 
on and it's gonna start at the low level
and<00:03:08.650> I'm<00:03:09.310> not<00:03:09.459> sure<00:03:09.670> what<00:03:09.850> exactly<00:03:10.360> we<00:03:10.480> can<00:03:10.600> see

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
and I'm not sure what exactly we can see

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.080 
and I'm not sure what exactly we can see
here<00:03:11.320> but<00:03:11.800> this<00:03:11.980> is<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.280> very<00:03:12.310> lowest<00:03:12.820> level

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
here but this is the very lowest level

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.430 
here but this is the very lowest level
of<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.930> P<00:03:14.110> 2d<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:15.480> as<00:03:16.480> I<00:03:17.019> click<00:03:17.080> the<00:03:17.290> button

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
of the P 2d and as I click the button

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.080 
of the P 2d and as I click the button
there<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:18.310> goes<00:03:18.519> to<00:03:18.910> level<00:03:19.540> 2<00:03:20.670> hit<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:21.790> again

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
there it goes to level 2 hit it again

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.130 
there it goes to level 2 hit it again
and<00:03:22.299> now<00:03:22.900> we're<00:03:23.140> at<00:03:23.290> level<00:03:23.680> 3<00:03:24.160> and<00:03:24.510> if<00:03:25.510> I<00:03:25.660> turn

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
and now we're at level 3 and if I turn

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.420 
and now we're at level 3 and if I turn
in<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.350> bezel<00:03:26.560> here

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.589 

let's<00:03:30.849> see<00:03:31.090> there<00:03:31.659> we<00:03:31.780> go<00:03:32.189> now<00:03:33.189> we're<00:03:33.459> at<00:03:33.700> turbo

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
let's see there we go now we're at turbo

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:35.220 
let's see there we go now we're at turbo
mode

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
mode

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.740 
mode
this<00:03:35.470> is<00:03:35.650> turbo<00:03:36.069> mode<00:03:36.310> on<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:37.599> Phoenix<00:03:38.099> p2d

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
this is turbo mode on the Phoenix p2d

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.920 
this is turbo mode on the Phoenix p2d
okay<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:41.049> again<00:03:41.890> if<00:03:42.220> I<00:03:42.340> turn<00:03:42.640> it<00:03:42.819> again<00:03:43.510> it

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
okay and again if I turn it again it

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.770 
okay and again if I turn it again it
goes<00:03:44.170> right<00:03:44.470> back<00:03:44.739> down<00:03:45.099> to<00:03:45.849> the<00:03:46.030> very<00:03:46.239> lowest

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
goes right back down to the very lowest

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.110 
goes right back down to the very lowest
level<00:03:47.019> perhaps<00:03:47.709> you<00:03:47.829> can<00:03:48.010> see<00:03:48.489> it<00:03:48.519> flickering

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
level perhaps you can see it flickering

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.690 
level perhaps you can see it flickering
there<00:03:49.359> and<00:03:49.599> turn<00:03:50.230> it<00:03:50.379> again<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:51.189> bezel<00:03:51.549> and

there's the high mode and of course now

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.670 
there's the high mode and of course now
we<00:03:55.090> have<00:03:55.239> strobe<00:03:55.780> mode<00:03:56.109> right<00:03:56.439> there<00:03:56.739> and<00:03:57.010> the

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
we have strobe mode right there and the

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.220

better<00:04:29.410> than<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:29.860> Phoenix<00:04:30.509> because<00:04:31.509> it<00:04:31.630> does

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
better than the Phoenix because it does

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.480 
better than the Phoenix because it does
have<00:04:32.080> a<00:04:32.470> much<00:04:32.770> narrower<00:04:33.599> spot<00:04:34.599> now<00:04:35.560> if<00:04:35.800> I<00:04:35.979> turn

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.140 
similar beams although the Oh light is a
much<00:05:44.520> narrower<00:05:45.510> beam<00:05:46.260> such<00:05:46.890> as<00:05:47.070> a<00:05:47.100> much<00:05:47.910> more
