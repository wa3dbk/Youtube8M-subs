00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.109
 we are students of cbta 20 and we are going to 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.240
 submit a tutorial and we're going to 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.700
 show them how to change the stack to a 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.830
 computer can be identified when 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.780
 a battery works badly by means of the 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.480
 wrong time and date and it gives us a 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.170
 error in the bios now let's grant 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.700
 the singer 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.890
 let's go the outside of the 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.890
 computer leaving the part of the 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.599
 mother card up after before 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.369
 of touching any internal part of the 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.010
 tip now we play with both hands 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.130
 in front of the eliminate the energy 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.590
 static now if we proceed to locate 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.840
 the pile the stack that we are going to change is 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.690
 a lithium battery type 3 box button 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.000
 nominal capacity of 150,000 copies 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.239
 per hour and has a diameter of 2 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.500
 centimeters is the part the round part 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.809
 that is in this part of the 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.839
 computer we will see a small button 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.839
 here on the side of it we press it 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.570
 we press the jumper and extract the 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.570
 battery 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.920
 that's the small part that we have to 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.560
 change this computer 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.020
 and we look for the new one I am in this same 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.909
 stack is placed in the same place 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.060
 just put it like that and you press 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.060
 gently 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.700
 and ready 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.640
 we will proceed to assemble the new purchases 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.640
 Do you sell 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.969
 once the battery was changed you have 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.969
 to set the date and time 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.420
 to change the date and time you have 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.630
 that use the keys to big buck and network 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.630
 back 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.030
 to save the configuration that we have 

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:54.820
 fact must be given 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.560
 Efe 10 and give it excellent 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.500
 it saves the configuration of the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.620
 computer and will normally start at 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.460
 from this moment and we can 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.460
 work with her
