00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.250
 hello girls hello everyone what a pleasure it gives me 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.990
 as always to greet you and in this video 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.059
 we're going to go very fast because the 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.370
 design is very simple to perform as 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.429
 always this design is made based on 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:18.310
 fancy pebble of some details 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:20.340
 of shiny enamel and let's start 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.800
 with our nails totally clean 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.950
 completely dry as always 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.860
 I recommend to apply a base of 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.989
 transparent glaze and also this is going to 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.420
 make the enamel last longer this is the 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:37.630
 base that I used is made from garlic 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.180
 and then apply a very tone 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.540
 clarito very subtle 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.450
 and in the form of French enameling I applied 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.390
 an enamel with glitter this one has 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:53.260
 rose glitter accents and 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:56.020
 apply only one layer so the 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.690
 enameled itself is very subtle but what 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.500
 bright is going to make it stand out let's 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.410
 employ these glitter there were not 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.570
 seen before they are very very cute since 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.360
 They are butterflies that are made from 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.280
 shines that is already integrated is like 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.700
 if it was the caviar that I used 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.160
 in other videos with glitters and this way 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.700
 butterflies as well as complete butterflies 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.009
 half butterflies let's break this 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.960
 We will apply this detail in our 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.060
 a 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.299
 with the help of tweezers for 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.810
 placing these bright and we're going to 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.479
 use other types of applications 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.670
 decorative in this case are flowers are 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.909
 rigid are not as smooth as 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.740
 you explain and we are going to place them in the 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:49.100
 part that aesthetically we like the most 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.200
 in this case I put the center what it is 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.780
 the butterfly 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.450
 at the top and bottom place 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.270
 the flowers here I love them 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.990
 emphasize how important it is that 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.850
 you make the designs to your liking and 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.850
 that can give you the variant both in 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.220
 colors like in the way you paste the 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.370
 stickers and the details that I mention 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.220
 in the thumbnail apply the 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.769
 bright with butterfly shape on the 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.739
 center and laterally as I repeat 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.989
 the flowers on the rest of the nails 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.140
 apply differently in some 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.090
 just apply the flowers and they can 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.160
 apply and if it is very convenient that 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.870
 use encapsulator in the part 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.049
 higher since that is going to make it last 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.360
 much more this design as they are pieces a 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.940
 so much how big do they tend to 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.280
 detach easily however 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.490
 if they apply it well they apply it calmly 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.040
 it will last 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.050
 about three days or so depends what 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.840
 to do the activities they do 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.000
 that yes that is clear is a very design 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.030
 simple very very nice I share it with 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.670
 you send them a huge kiss we 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.650
 we see in the next video and do not forget 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.750
 I am also subscribe attending 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.030
 the requests that have made me I do 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.810
 little by little as time goes by 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.910
 giving the pattern and I send them a kiss 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.780
 again see you in the next video 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.780
 bye
