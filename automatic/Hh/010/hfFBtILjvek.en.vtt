zig this is eight pound cruise of
control<00:01:19.740> mono<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.369> I'm<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:21.030> adding<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.420> nice

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
control mono and I'm just adding a nice

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
little anti-tangle sleeve at the end

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.760 
little anti-tangle sleeve at the end
that<00:01:24.330> just<00:01:24.570> helps<00:01:24.869> kick<00:01:25.080> everything<00:01:25.500> away

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
that just helps kick everything away

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.590 
that just helps kick everything away
from<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.100> lead<00:01:26.280> system<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.880> use<00:01:27.270> either<00:01:27.450> a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
from the lead system I use either a

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.480 
from the lead system I use either a
drop-off<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.200> line<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:28.950> occasion

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
drop-off in line on this occasion

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.910 
drop-off in line on this occasion
because<00:01:29.850> I've<00:01:30.180> been<00:01:30.329> using<00:01:30.500> actual<00:01:31.500> hybrid

to<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.470> it's<00:01:37.619> tired<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:38.040> there<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.810> it's

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
to that and it's tired on there and it's

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.080 
to that and it's tired on there and it's
just<00:01:39.869> coupled<00:01:40.380> with<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.920> dark<00:01:41.159> matter<00:01:41.520> tubing

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
just coupled with the dark matter tubing

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.450 
just coupled with the dark matter tubing
now<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.720> might<00:01:42.960> look<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.560> Tom<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.430> a

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
front we're casting out these owlman's

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.600 
front we're casting out these owlman's
has<00:01:48.990> been<00:01:49.200> tearing<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:49.920> place<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.369> pieces

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
has been tearing this place to pieces

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.389 
has been tearing this place to pieces
and<00:01:51.090> no<00:01:51.930> different<00:01:52.140> on<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.560> zigs<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:53.100> before

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
and no different on the zigs just before

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.980 
and no different on the zigs just before
casting<00:01:53.880> out<00:01:54.030> i've<00:01:54.390> been<00:01:54.540> putting<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.810> bit<00:01:54.960> of

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
casting out i've been putting a bit of

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.389 
casting out i've been putting a bit of
this<00:01:55.140> out<00:01:55.320> on<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.530> liquid<00:01:55.860> straight<00:01:56.130> onto<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
this out on the liquid straight onto the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.940 
this out on the liquid straight onto the
zigs<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.119> foam<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.600> also<00:01:57.960> soaked<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.530> the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
zigs the foam is also soaked in the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.600 
zigs the foam is also soaked in the
pineapple<00:01:59.189> supreme<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:01.350> really<00:02:02.100> i<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.189> cake

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
pineapple supreme and really i just cake

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.789 
pineapple supreme and really i just cake
it<00:02:02.880> on<00:02:02.969> like<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.450> if<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:04.049> sun's<00:02:04.320> out<00:02:04.560> then

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
it on like this if the sun's out then

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.620 
it on like this if the sun's out then
what<00:02:04.920> I'd<00:02:05.040> do<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.430> actually<00:02:05.640> just<00:02:06.360> let<00:02:06.509> this

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
what I'd do is actually just let this

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.119 
what I'd do is actually just let this
dry<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.140> Sun<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.409> little<00:02:07.590> bit<00:02:07.740> before

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
dry and the Sun a little bit before

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.710 
dry and the Sun a little bit before
casting<00:02:08.429> out<00:02:08.759> because<00:02:08.970> what<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.360> will<00:02:09.450> do<00:02:09.599> is

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
casting out because what that will do is

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.199 
casting out because what that will do is
give<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:10.050> bit<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.349> residue<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:11.459> will<00:02:11.670> hold

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
give it a bit of residue that will hold

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.670 
give it a bit of residue that will hold
on<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:12.900> for<00:02:13.379> a<00:02:13.440> bit

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
on to that for a bit

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.080 
on to that for a bit
longer<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.069> when<00:02:14.189> it<00:02:14.280> goes<00:02:14.430> out<00:02:14.670> it's<00:02:14.879> going<00:02:15.030> to

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
longer so when it goes out it's going to

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.479 
longer so when it goes out it's going to
last<00:02:15.390> out<00:02:15.689> out<00:02:16.379> there<00:02:16.739> in<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:16.980> water<00:02:17.189> for<00:02:17.430> a

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
last out out there in the water for a

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.190 
last out out there in the water for a
bit<00:02:17.670> longer<00:02:17.879> but<00:02:18.150> even<00:02:18.540> putting<00:02:18.719> it<00:02:18.870> out<00:02:18.959> like

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
bit longer but even putting it out like

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.410 
bit longer but even putting it out like
this<00:02:19.349> it'll<00:02:19.620> stay<00:02:19.890> stay<00:02:20.400> on<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:20.640> hook<00:02:20.760> Peter

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
this it'll stay stay on the hook Peter

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.509 
this it'll stay stay on the hook Peter
in<00:02:21.689> a<00:02:21.780> way<00:02:21.959> smoking<00:02:22.859> away<00:02:22.950> underwater

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
in a way smoking away underwater

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.750 
in a way smoking away underwater
probably<00:02:24.030> for<00:02:24.239> about<00:02:24.450> 10<00:02:25.049> 15<00:02:25.379> 20<00:02:26.010> minutes<00:02:26.310> long

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
probably for about 10 15 20 minutes long

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.429 
probably for about 10 15 20 minutes long
enough<00:02:27.030> for<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.269> fish<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.599> investigate<00:02:28.230> and

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
enough for a fish to investigate and

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.619 
enough for a fish to investigate and
it's<00:02:28.739> been<00:02:28.920> working<00:02:29.159> superb<00:02:29.819> Li<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.269> that

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
it's been working superb Li and that

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.629 
it's been working superb Li and that
brace<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:31.139> 30s<00:02:31.530> just<00:02:31.680> goes<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.129> prove<00:02:32.370> how

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:32.639 
brace of 30s just goes to prove how
