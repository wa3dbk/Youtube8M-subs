anyway<00:00:48.899> here's<00:00:49.200> where<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.530> real<00:00:49.770> design<00:00:50.250> has

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
anyway here's where the real design has

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.369 
anyway here's where the real design has
to<00:00:50.700> be<00:00:50.850> questioned<00:00:51.390> it's<00:00:51.809> what's<00:00:52.020> going<00:00:52.170> on

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
to be questioned it's what's going on

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
this central unit they've taken a bit of

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.680 
this central unit they've taken a bit of
a<00:00:59.100> beating<00:00:59.309> from<00:00:59.609> various<00:01:00.030> sources<00:01:00.239> us

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
a beating from various sources us

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.049 
a beating from various sources us
included<00:01:01.199> about<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> earlier<00:01:02.129> incarnations

slack it was early days today's system

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.940 
slack it was early days today's system
works<00:03:42.910> really<00:03:43.180> well<00:03:43.419> quick<00:03:43.810> thorough<00:03:44.230> simple

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
works really well quick thorough simple

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.920 
works really well quick thorough simple
and<00:03:45.099> requires<00:03:45.489> about<00:03:46.209> as<00:03:46.450> many<00:03:46.660> new
