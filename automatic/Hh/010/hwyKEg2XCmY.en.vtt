matt brown will work I'm again just
taking<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.879> little<00:02:31.909> bit<00:02:32.239> on<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.629> end<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:33.170> this

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
taking a little bit on the end of this

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.190 
taking a little bit on the end of this
blending<00:02:33.860> brush<00:02:34.069> and<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:35.840> want<00:02:36.110> to

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
blending brush and you want to

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.750 
blending brush and you want to
concentrate<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.799> color<00:02:37.040> mostly<00:02:37.519> on<00:02:37.730> the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
concentrate that color mostly on the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
concentrate that color mostly on the
outer<00:02:38.269> V<00:02:40.090> next<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.209> want<00:02:41.299> to<00:02:41.450> just<00:02:41.599> add<00:02:41.750> a

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
outer V next you want to just add a

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.750 
outer V next you want to just add a
little<00:02:42.110> bit<00:02:42.290> more<00:02:42.530> dimension<00:02:42.829> to<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.549> look

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
little bit more dimension to the look

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.030 
little bit more dimension to the look
and<00:02:44.000> I<00:02:44.150> think<00:02:44.180> adding<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:44.900> plum<00:02:45.230> color<00:02:45.530> really

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
and I think adding a plum color really

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.369 
and I think adding a plum color really
kind<00:02:46.970> of<00:02:47.060> brightens<00:02:47.480> up<00:02:47.599> the<00:02:47.659> brown<00:02:48.049> that<00:02:48.290> you

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
kind of brightens up the brown that you

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.349 
kind of brightens up the brown that you
add<00:02:48.530> it<00:02:48.680> into<00:02:48.829> the<00:02:49.010> crease<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.640> so<00:02:50.060> I'm<00:02:50.209> going

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
add it into the crease and so I'm going

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.479 
add it into the crease and so I'm going
to<00:02:50.390> be<00:02:50.480> using<00:02:50.569> this<00:02:50.959> plum<00:02:51.530> again<00:02:52.099> from<00:02:52.370> his

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
to be using this plum again from his

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.550 
to be using this plum again from his
sleek<00:02:52.760> palette<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.329> I<00:02:53.420> like<00:02:53.599> it<00:02:53.750> because<00:02:53.870> it

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
sleek palette and I like it because it

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.369 
sleek palette and I like it because it
almost<00:02:54.799> comes<00:02:55.129> off<00:02:55.370> as<00:02:55.519> a<00:02:55.549> bit<00:02:55.760> of<00:02:55.790> a<00:02:55.909> brown<00:02:56.379> or

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
almost comes off as a bit of a brown or

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.319 
almost comes off as a bit of a brown or
just<00:02:57.620> with<00:02:57.890> plum<00:02:58.250> undertone<00:02:58.819> so<00:02:59.090> it's<00:02:59.209> not

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
just with plum undertone so it's not

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.020 
just with plum undertone so it's not
like<00:02:59.540> a<00:02:59.569> super<00:03:00.019> super<00:03:00.290> purple<00:03:00.680> color<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.280> it's

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
like a super super purple color and it's

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.069 
like a super super purple color and it's
definitely<00:03:02.329> a<00:03:02.510> warm<00:03:03.109> plum<00:03:03.440> not<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:03.709> cool<00:03:04.609> plum

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
definitely a warm plum not a cool plum

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.890 
definitely a warm plum not a cool plum
so<00:03:06.079> I'm<00:03:06.200> taking<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:06.680> color<00:03:07.459> again<00:03:08.060> right<00:03:08.720> on

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
so I'm taking that color again right on

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:16.869 
so I'm taking that color again right on
that<00:03:09.170> brush<00:03:09.409> that<00:03:09.769> same<00:03:10.040> lending<00:03:10.430> brush<00:03:15.879> next

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
I'm going to be going into my 88 shimmer

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.710 
I'm going to be going into my 88 shimmer
palette<00:03:19.040> and<00:03:19.430> there<00:03:20.090> are<00:03:20.180> these<00:03:20.269> really

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720

really<00:03:21.200> pretty<00:03:21.530> light<00:03:22.010> blues<00:03:22.370> in<00:03:22.639> here<00:03:23.000> and

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
really pretty light blues in here and

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.059 
really pretty light blues in here and
there<00:03:23.629> are<00:03:23.689> a<00:03:23.720> little<00:03:23.840> bit<00:03:24.049> more<00:03:24.349> blue<00:03:24.769> and<00:03:25.010> a

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
there are a little bit more blue and a

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:26.830 
there are a little bit more blue and a
little<00:03:25.310> bit<00:03:25.430> less<00:03:25.700> aqua<00:03:26.150> so<00:03:26.359> I'm<00:03:26.420> just<00:03:26.599> taking

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
little bit less aqua so I'm just taking

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.660 
little bit less aqua so I'm just taking
those<00:03:26.930> on<00:03:27.139> another<00:03:27.409> shader<00:03:27.680> brush<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:28.310> I'm

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
those on another shader brush and I'm

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.849 
those on another shader brush and I'm
going<00:03:28.760> over<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:30.680> Aqua<00:03:31.069> in<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.310> middle<00:03:32.859> just

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
going over the Aqua in the middle just

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.599 
going over the Aqua in the middle just
so<00:03:34.639> it<00:03:35.319> appears<00:03:36.319> a<00:03:36.379> little<00:03:36.709> bit<00:03:36.799> more<00:03:36.949> blue<00:03:37.250> and

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
so it appears a little bit more blue and

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.909 
so it appears a little bit more blue and
is<00:03:38.060> a<00:03:38.090> little<00:03:38.540> bit<00:03:38.720> more<00:03:38.959> vibrant<00:03:39.530> because<00:03:39.680> you

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
is a little bit more vibrant because you

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.409 
is a little bit more vibrant because you
kind<00:03:40.099> of<00:03:40.160> blend<00:03:40.370> it<00:03:40.519> a<00:03:40.579> lot<00:03:40.760> of<00:03:40.849> that<00:03:40.970> blew<00:03:41.180> out

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:41.419 
kind of blend it a lot of that blew out

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:45.849 
kind of blend it a lot of that blew out
when<00:03:41.690> we<00:03:41.810> put<00:03:42.049> in<00:03:42.169> the<00:03:42.379> Browns<00:03:44.680> next<00:03:45.680> you<00:03:45.769> want
