 bring a video here I'm finally from 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.219
 back with another gameplay video 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.500
 video that people from a game who is in 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:19.070
 development have not put alpha star 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.600
 right that is the bric runner in the version 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:27.689
 10.1 3.4 in the race and how exactly they 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.300
 the world I think thousand thousand opinion 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.180
 soon the meeting talking he will be 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.250
 the Maine maine substitute means 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.340
 I said I said no to minecraft 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.710
 That's it, guys, in this game, I 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.820
 I found him to be a real guy. 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.710
 said 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.320
 the game developer actually told me 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.210
 said and that game was it's being 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.550
 very developed clear magic can see 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.949
 some optimizations in the graphs as 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.680
 You see here the granny is the background 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.289
 the clouds predict that I tested had not 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.780
 and now there is this is the map that I 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.570
 I downloaded it and it's actually I 'm here to 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.430
 divulge the game to you that the sound that 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.640
 I say will be the substitute minecraft 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.920
 yes he seems to be is different like this 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.049
 how the strike was for the time so here I 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.220
 I'm not creative, you're going to have a survival 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.119
 it is still in full swing 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.159
 development 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.520
 this was the map that I downloaded there nobody 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.790
 will be the ups close the game 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.710
 guys I play I closed unintentionally but 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.460
 I'm here to spread the word to 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.500
 you 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.900
 he is already with 31 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.280
 players very few people know 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.500
 smart but has enough 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.420
 views it will consist of 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.119
 two modules as well as you 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.360
 will see and believe and I'm here mode 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.310
 creative is obvious and if you pass here 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.890
 will have less secrecy here on the side and 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.079
 appear the blocks you can place and 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.229
 this map that I downloaded actually I already 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.030
 I saw it was from r calls the parent guideline 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.560
 I downloaded a link that will also have 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.640
 the inscription is for you to see how it is 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.430
 what is 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.130
 and it's so I do not know that this map is 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.070
 right but I see this game before 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.320
 of this update and he had almost no 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.330
 Nothing and I want to make some videos. 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.270
 always when some update comes out 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.510
 of this game is the graphics as 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.720
 You already said that it's enough to weigh you. 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.959
 probes here I'm running at 25 frames 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.520
 per second and it's a small thing because my 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.860
 pc he i thought he would hold 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.230
 so much so but it 's not rolling smooth 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.100
 This is great because the sim game game has 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.560
 great graphics and good personal right and how 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.300
 here to spread the word I saw the game I go 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.390
 show that a little bit for you is 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.989
 an item 3 layers where you could 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.030
 possibly put and blocks items etc 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.640
 as we do not know the right purpose 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.400
 of the game still because the game leaving it 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.830
 is still under development and here it is 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.410
 several blogs for example land and something 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.989
 very curious and innovative game that has 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.760
 good idea from developers went to 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:06.390
 layers galera type a f1 is f same f 1 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.570
 you modify the background f2 objects 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.750
 and f3 where the pizzetti player by 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.420
 For example I picked up the grass what 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.160
 either as right will disappear still have 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.829
 two more layers behind the acclaimed 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.940
 play where the player may fall out of effect 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:26.430
 and layer 2 would be objects that are 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.890
 there behind it and that's great and 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.340
 background there and so on. 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:36.420
 is in some way innovative 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:39.690
 and ops first game 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.940
 I'll play again, but it's finally 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.549
 here, please continue to apply 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.250
 outline of the game you can zoom out and 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.950
 zhu min with chrome 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:54.200
 here you can also move 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:56.690
 the hand of your little affection that we alone 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.780
 that I could not get there, my right hand 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.950
 And the left hand is on, that's it. 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.830
 Beautiful, I just could not do it. 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.790
 gatabakana wrong button do not let the 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.510
 head 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.459
 the right left arm and etc for this 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.690
 I still do not know what's going to work but have 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.150
 many things one can keep in hand 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:18.829
 here tools that will be 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:21.049
 available in survival mode I want to see 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.940
 that this map serves because it does not 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.840
 seems to be nothing much 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:30.169
 so galera oil was ken keen 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.790
 I did again okay guys is me 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.919
 I wanted to explore the sea ​​whatever I 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.840
 I downloaded and got the ipp out here and I do not know 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:39.440
 because it serves so we will send you 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.100
 front here will it seem like a 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.380
 part I think is not conceived no more 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:49.820
 Anyway, this game is for now and the 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:52.729
 I think it's okay because it looks good 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.370
 of obstacles but anyway, this is it 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.440
 This was the beckham video and we want to 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.010
 bring more videos of this game when 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.440
 have new updates 77 and of course 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.660
 whenever possible I think that the 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.729
 developers will watch this video 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.039
 so if you can give a like and 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.610
 show to your friends to pick up 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:15.919
 enough visualizations for them to see 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.750
 Raja, kidding, but this is it people 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.490
 the video will stop here hope 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.919
 You liked this game more 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.229
