00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.550
 borrowed the wifi signal from our neighbor 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.349
 with 6.0 point 1 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.889
 if they still do not have the jailbreak there 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.269
 I will leave the links well to start 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.269
 to enter Syria 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.490
 to start we will go to manage 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.740
 sources and we're going to add the repo to 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.890

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.160
 the box that is from iphone e am we're going 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.480
 to install 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.480
 and in confirm 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.840
 if they do not know how to do the jailbreak 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:15.400
 look it up in the description box 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.980
 Well this will not take long 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.130
 will give us the button to return like this 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.130
 day 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.700
 let's wait for it to finish loading 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.700
 the data 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.350
 loading and returning to Syria 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.430
 well I 'm going to get out of here and I'll go to 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.570
 already try the water but I will not change 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.570
 to my homepage 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.860
 another here 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.159
 I do not open 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.840
 and everything is fine then to close 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.670
 and we're going to go back to cydia 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.380
 and they are going to add another repo now 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.740
 in driving the same is going to be the one to make a 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.870
 iphone will also be in the 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.800
 description that is what I have here 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.800
 with the blue logo 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.810
 and we are going to add the same network 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.890
 form by clicking on edit and add and 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.190
 then add source 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.500
 and add anyway well I already 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:40.630
 I have installed so I'm leaving 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:43.120
 I go back to search and I put web etc and I'm going to 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.900
 add those two dictionaries in 2010 and 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.930
 this 2011 is going to cost a bit 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.750
 more time since the download is a 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.780
 little bit more or less I think they are 52 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:00.810
 if I remember correctly 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:03.959
 52 if I'm on megas 52.3 and if it takes 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:08.310
 I'm going to cut out the video and 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:11.959
 you put a pause or something you owe 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.959
 confirm and here advance 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.650
 well I'm back and I added the 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:23.060
 2010 and now I'm going for 2011 we're going to 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.280
 do exactly the same 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.239
 that load we are going to give in install and 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.239
 to confirm 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.280
 I will also advance the video because 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:40.230
 same is a little heavier 59 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.130
 let's wait for it to finish loading 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:48.650
 I will advance the dictionary 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.650
 and it is recharging the data 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.280
 and we will return back to cydia 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.860
 we click on return to cydia 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:13.310
 well now we got out of here error 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:16.000
 I close this I go to the web 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.000
 here 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.580
 well you will give in this and that is in 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.370
 the top right 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.560
 and where the application is activated 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.689
 just on the little blue arrow now 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.479
 where paypal code says we put three 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:37.289
 Letters that are and we give in 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:40.230
 license variety we hope and it's already 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:42.529
 activated in ok 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.779
 again in ok 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:46.519
 and we will be able to see how I 

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:50.460
 I'm connected to my own network does not have 

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:52.620
 if I took it out or borrowed it 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.819
 I'm going to leave here and I'll go to 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.819
 omit my own network 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:01.150
 is not something 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:04.230
 I'm going to adjustments 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.230
 here on wifi 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.050
 later 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.310
 and I'm going to omit this network 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.720
 as you will see here back already detects me another 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.840
 part that's what I'm going to 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:30.009
 to use with the web like I'm going again to 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:32.729
 the web to see if it works 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:35.770
 there are times that he says finish or continuous 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:38.289
 but there are times when it only restarts 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.509
 and it automatically connects us as it is 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:44.050
 probably this is the only case 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:46.119
 let's give it a touch and it will execute 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.069
 the vulnerability and it's going to put a 

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:51.670
 password if it works for us we'll see it 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:54.490
 let's see what he puts 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.110
 and it restarted and now we wait and then 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:01.050
 then we see that above we have the 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.050
 wifi let's see what network connects us 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:11.470
 and we see that it is that same network 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.470
 well that's all thanks
