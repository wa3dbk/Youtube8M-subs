00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
transitioning to natural and I'm finding

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.529 
transitioning to natural and I'm finding
it<00:00:48.629> fairly<00:00:48.930> hard<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.680> wash<00:00:49.920> my<00:00:50.219> hair<00:00:50.539> because

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
it fairly hard to wash my hair because

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.720 
it fairly hard to wash my hair because
my<00:00:51.600> hair<00:00:52.020> will<00:00:52.140> eventually<00:00:52.649> become<00:00:52.949> very<00:00:53.460> dry

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
my hair will eventually become very dry

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.060 
my hair will eventually become very dry
and<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.120> loses<00:00:54.329> his<00:00:54.660> moisture<00:00:55.140> by<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.710> morning

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
and it loses his moisture by the morning

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.610

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
that's a lot thicker that can really

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.570 
that's a lot thicker that can really
keep<00:03:20.959> that<00:03:21.110> moisture<00:03:21.320> in<00:03:21.650> but<00:03:22.070> you<00:03:22.190> have<00:03:22.400> to

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
really it's like trial and error because

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.170 
really it's like trial and error because
you<00:03:25.010> have<00:03:25.160> to<00:03:25.280> figure<00:03:25.549> out<00:03:25.580> what<00:03:25.850> works<00:03:26.030> for

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
you have to figure out what works for

which ones are silicones by looking at
the<00:04:54.310> end<00:04:54.490> of<00:04:54.880> the<00:04:55.870> name<00:04:56.080> so<00:04:56.470> if<00:04:56.530> is<00:04:56.650> like

the end of the name so if is like

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.029 
the end of the name so if is like
dimethicone<00:04:57.669> then<00:04:58.570> cone<00:04:59.260> will<00:04:59.530> be<00:04:59.650> at<00:04:59.770> the<00:04:59.889> end

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
dimethicone then cone will be at the end

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:01.740 
dimethicone then cone will be at the end
and<00:05:00.460> you'll<00:05:00.639> know<00:05:00.820> that<00:05:00.850> that's<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:01.330> silicone

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
and you'll know that that's the silicone
