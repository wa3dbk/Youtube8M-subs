00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
the red on the costume seems to be a

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.370 
the red on the costume seems to be a
little<00:01:25.920> more<00:01:26.159> vibrant<00:01:26.460> than<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.840> comic

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
little more vibrant than on the comic

little more vibrant than on the comic
2-pack<00:01:28.799> version<00:01:29.299> but<00:01:30.299> for<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> most<00:01:31.049> part

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
2-pack version but for the most part

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.319 
2-pack version but for the most part
these<00:01:31.770> appear<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.310> be<00:01:32.460> basically<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.299> same

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
these appear to be basically the same

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.069 
these appear to be basically the same
figures<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.640> do<00:01:35.640> kind<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.360> paint<00:01:36.810> a

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
figures I do kind of like the paint a

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.469 
figures I do kind of like the paint a
little<00:01:37.710> more<00:01:37.860> vibrant<00:01:38.070> red<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.030> figure

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
little more vibrant red on the figure

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.350 
little more vibrant red on the figure
than<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.930> do<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.380> comic<00:01:40.909> 2-pack<00:01:41.909> version

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
than I do on the comic 2-pack version

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.300 
than I do on the comic 2-pack version
however<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:43.500> know<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.770> already<00:01:44.100> have

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
however you know if you already have

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.730 
however you know if you already have
that<00:01:44.520> 2-pack<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.270> wouldn't<00:01:45.780> recommend<00:01:46.079> getting

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
that 2-pack I wouldn't recommend getting

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.219 
that 2-pack I wouldn't recommend getting
this<00:01:46.860> figure<00:01:47.189> again<00:01:47.549> just<00:01:47.850> for<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.390> they've

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
this figure again just for that they've

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.679 
this figure again just for that they've
got<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:50.009> black<00:01:50.280> throughout<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.939> costume<00:01:51.450> to

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
got the black throughout the costume to

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.100 
got the black throughout the costume to
give<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.990> extra<00:01:52.460> detail<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.670> everything<00:01:54.110> just

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
give it extra detail on everything just

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.530 
give it extra detail on everything just
like<00:01:55.229> on<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.530> comic<00:01:56.040> 2-pack<00:01:56.430> version<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.180> it

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
like on the comic 2-pack version and it

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.030 
like on the comic 2-pack version and it
looks<00:01:57.750> really<00:01:58.049> good

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.920 
looks really good
I<00:01:59.100> like<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.790> sculpting<00:02:00.270> with<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.509> line<00:02:00.689> work

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
I like the sculpting with the line work

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.200 
I like the sculpting with the line work
on<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.259> mask<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:02.250> looks<00:02:02.549> really<00:02:02.729> good<00:02:03.030> he's

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
on the mask that looks really good he's

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.740

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
double D on his chest is a little more

brighter red color

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.970

and<00:02:12.060> then<00:02:12.210> with<00:02:12.540> his<00:02:12.690> eyes<00:02:12.870> as<00:02:13.200> well<00:02:13.470> it's

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
and then with his eyes as well it's

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.220 
and then with his eyes as well it's
almost<00:02:14.100> like<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.430> metallic<00:02:14.810> red<00:02:15.810> that<00:02:16.050> they've

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.110 
almost like a metallic red that they've
used<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:17.070> think<00:02:17.130> that<00:02:17.400> looks<00:02:17.640> really<00:02:17.730> good

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
used so I think that looks really good

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.670 
used so I think that looks really good

the<00:02:24.600> paint<00:02:24.870> some<00:02:25.650> black<00:02:25.860> marks<00:02:26.250> on<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.610> on<00:02:26.760> the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
the paint some black marks on it on the

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.870 
the paint some black marks on it on the
skin<00:02:27.480> tones<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:28.680> don't<00:02:29.310> know<00:02:29.370> how<00:02:29.490> well<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:29.760> can

see<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.150> on<00:02:30.270> camera<00:02:30.480> it's<00:02:30.870> not<00:02:30.930> anything<00:02:31.320> major

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
see it on camera it's not anything major

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.860 
see it on camera it's not anything major
but<00:02:31.860> just<00:02:32.340> wanted<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.580> point<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:32.850> out<00:02:33.000> but

better<00:02:56.430> than<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:56.790> first<00:02:57.209> daredevil<00:02:57.840> figure

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
better than that first daredevil figure

okay<00:04:03.870> so<00:04:03.930> articulation<00:04:04.830> on<00:04:04.980> this<00:04:05.190> figure<00:04:05.610> is

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
okay so articulation on this figure is

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.640 
okay so articulation on this figure is
pretty<00:04:06.390> nice<00:04:06.630> because<00:04:06.900> it's<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.350> reissue

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
pretty nice because it's a reissue

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.030 
pretty nice because it's a reissue
figure<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:08.580> it<00:04:09.570> doesn't<00:04:10.530> have<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.739> reduced

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
figure and it doesn't have the reduced

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.100 
figure and it doesn't have the reduced
articulation<00:04:11.910> like<00:04:12.090> most<00:04:12.360> of<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.570> figures<00:04:12.900> in

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
articulation like most of the figures in

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.180 
articulation like most of the figures in
this<00:04:13.290> wave<00:04:13.910> so<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.269> head<00:04:15.450> is<00:04:15.480> on<00:04:15.750> a<00:04:15.780> ball-joint

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
this wave so the head is on a ball-joint

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.750 
this wave so the head is on a ball-joint
so<00:04:17.190> he's<00:04:17.609> got<00:04:17.910> good<00:04:18.239> up-and-down<00:04:18.750> movement

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
so he's got good up-and-down movement

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.720 
so he's got good up-and-down movement
and<00:04:19.880> he<00:04:20.090> can<00:04:20.240> look<00:04:20.420> left<00:04:20.690> and<00:04:20.870> right<00:04:21.550> arms<00:04:22.550> are

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
and he can look left and right arms are

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.150 
and he can look left and right arms are
attached<00:04:23.000> at<00:04:23.480> with<00:04:24.440> your<00:04:24.560> standard<00:04:24.950> ball

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
attached at with your standard ball

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.220 
attached at with your standard ball
hinge<00:04:25.430> joints<00:04:26.000> so<00:04:26.180> you<00:04:26.240> can<00:04:26.480> get<00:04:26.660> his<00:04:26.810> arm<00:04:27.020> out

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
hinge joints so you can get his arm out

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.780 
hinge joints so you can get his arm out
good<00:04:27.560> and<00:04:28.460> he's<00:04:28.640> got<00:04:28.850> good<00:04:29.030> rotation

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.900 

he's<00:04:32.270> got<00:04:32.570> the<00:04:32.720> biceps<00:04:33.230> level<00:04:33.710> he's<00:04:34.640> got<00:04:34.880> a

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
he's got the biceps level he's got a

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.150 
he's got the biceps level he's got a
single<00:04:35.270> hinge<00:04:35.570> to<00:04:35.900> elbow<00:04:36.290> so<00:04:36.620> he<00:04:36.710> can<00:04:36.830> bend<00:04:37.040> his

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
single hinge to elbow so he can bend his

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.890 
single hinge to elbow so he can bend his
elbow<00:04:37.460> about<00:04:37.850> that<00:04:38.060> much<00:04:38.270> was<00:04:38.450> just<00:04:38.480> pretty

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
elbow about that much was just pretty

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.110 
elbow about that much was just pretty
good<00:04:39.110> and<00:04:39.380> then<00:04:39.800> he's<00:04:39.920> got<00:04:40.070> swivel<00:04:40.610> wrists<00:04:41.000> no

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
good and then he's got swivel wrists no

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.490 
good and then he's got swivel wrists no
hinges<00:04:41.540> at<00:04:41.690> the<00:04:41.840> wrists

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
hinges at the wrists

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.640 
hinges at the wrists
he's<00:04:42.950> got<00:04:43.220> the<00:04:43.400> midsection<00:04:43.820> joint<00:04:44.530> so<00:04:45.530> he's

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
he's got the midsection joint so he's

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.650 
he's got the midsection joint so he's
got<00:04:45.830> rotation<00:04:46.430> there<00:04:46.640> at<00:04:46.730> the<00:04:46.850> midsection<00:04:47.180> and

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
got rotation there at the midsection and

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.980 
got rotation there at the midsection and
he<00:04:47.780> has<00:04:47.930> some<00:04:48.110> up<00:04:48.260> and<00:04:48.740> in<00:04:49.190> back<00:04:49.400> movement<00:04:49.990> he

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
he has some up and in back movement he

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.890 
he has some up and in back movement he
also<00:04:51.170> has<00:04:51.470> the<00:04:51.650> waist<00:04:51.860> swivel<00:04:52.690> legs<00:04:53.690> are

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
also has the waist swivel legs are

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.110 
also has the waist swivel legs are
attached<00:04:54.200> with<00:04:54.380> ball<00:04:54.710> ball<00:04:55.310> joints<00:04:55.760> so<00:04:55.850> he<00:04:55.970> can

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
attached with ball ball joints so he can

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.720 
attached with ball ball joints so he can
do<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.330> splits<00:04:56.660> about<00:04:56.930> that<00:04:57.140> much<00:04:57.410> and<00:04:57.860> he<00:04:58.580> can

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
do the splits about that much and he can

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.670 
do the splits about that much and he can
get<00:04:58.820> his<00:04:58.970> leg<00:04:59.180> forward<00:04:59.690> pretty<00:04:59.870> good<00:05:00.170> he<00:05:00.440> can't

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
get his leg forward pretty good he can't

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.920 
get his leg forward pretty good he can't
really<00:05:00.830> get<00:05:01.580> his<00:05:01.700> leg<00:05:01.880> back<00:05:02.120> too<00:05:02.450> much<00:05:02.600> that's

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
really get his leg back too much that's

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.800 
really get his leg back too much that's
about<00:05:03.080> as<00:05:03.260> much<00:05:03.290> back<00:05:03.710> as<00:05:03.950> he<00:05:04.070> can<00:05:04.220> get<00:05:04.340> the<00:05:04.460> leg

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
about as much back as he can get the leg

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.660 
about as much back as he can get the leg
the<00:05:05.810> holster<00:05:06.320> that's<00:05:06.590> attached<00:05:06.890> to<00:05:07.100> the<00:05:07.490> one

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
the holster that's attached to the one

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.780 
the holster that's attached to the one
leg<00:05:07.880> kind<00:05:08.210> of<00:05:08.300> restricts<00:05:08.780> that<00:05:08.930> movement<00:05:09.790> the

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
leg kind of restricts that movement the

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.850 
leg kind of restricts that movement the
other<00:05:10.910> leg<00:05:11.180> you<00:05:11.210> can<00:05:11.540> do<00:05:11.720> better<00:05:11.960> you<00:05:12.320> can<00:05:12.620> kind

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
other leg you can do better you can kind

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.120 
other leg you can do better you can kind
of<00:05:12.920> get<00:05:13.070> out<00:05:13.220> and<00:05:13.430> back<00:05:13.610> pretty<00:05:14.090> good<00:05:14.920> it's<00:05:15.920> got

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
of get out and back pretty good it's got

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.670 
of get out and back pretty good it's got
the<00:05:16.250> thigh<00:05:16.460> swivel<00:05:17.060> and<00:05:17.360> the<00:05:17.990> holster<00:05:18.320> doesn't

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
the thigh swivel and the holster doesn't

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.830 
the thigh swivel and the holster doesn't
really<00:05:19.090> prohibit<00:05:20.090> the<00:05:20.210> movement<00:05:20.630> there

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
really prohibit the movement there

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.030 
really prohibit the movement there
because<00:05:21.170> the<00:05:21.290> holster<00:05:21.650> is<00:05:21.770> a<00:05:21.800> separate<00:05:22.310> piece

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
because the holster is a separate piece

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.550 
because the holster is a separate piece
so<00:05:25.040> and<00:05:25.490> then<00:05:26.390> he's<00:05:26.540> got<00:05:26.720> the<00:05:26.840> double<00:05:27.020> jointed

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
so and then he's got the double jointed

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.050 
so and then he's got the double jointed
knees

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
knees

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.990 
knees
he's<00:05:29.060> got<00:05:29.330> the<00:05:29.510> boot<00:05:29.810> swivel<00:05:30.380> and<00:05:30.880> then<00:05:31.880> he

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
he's got the boot swivel and then he

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.120 
he's got the boot swivel and then he
does<00:05:32.180> have<00:05:32.420> also<00:05:32.630> the<00:05:32.930> ankle<00:05:33.140> pivot<00:05:33.710> so<00:05:33.980> he's

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
does have also the ankle pivot so he's

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.250 
does have also the ankle pivot so he's
got<00:05:34.340> good<00:05:34.520> movement<00:05:34.790> at<00:05:35.150> the<00:05:35.360> at<00:05:35.630> the<00:05:35.900> feet<00:05:36.110> and

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
got good movement at the at the feet and

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.660 
got good movement at the at the feet and
then<00:05:36.470> he's<00:05:36.590> got<00:05:36.770> to<00:05:36.950> pick<00:05:37.190> holes<00:05:37.400> on<00:05:37.550> the

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
then he's got to pick holes on the

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
then he's got to pick holes on the
bottom<00:05:37.940> of<00:05:38.060> his<00:05:38.180> feet<00:05:40.000> ok<00:05:41.000> so<00:05:41.060> that's<00:05:41.360> my<00:05:41.450> view

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
bottom of his feet ok so that's my view

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.510 
bottom of his feet ok so that's my view
overall<00:05:42.290> I<00:05:42.410> think<00:05:42.560> this<00:05:42.830> is<00:05:42.980> a<00:05:43.010> really<00:05:43.280> good

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
overall I think this is a really good

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.400 
overall I think this is a really good
figure<00:05:43.910> I<00:05:43.970> really<00:05:44.330> like<00:05:44.510> the<00:05:44.660> detail<00:05:44.840> and

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
figure I really like the detail and

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.140 
figure I really like the detail and
articulation<00:05:45.770> on<00:05:46.340> this<00:05:46.520> figure<00:05:46.820> is<00:05:46.970> really

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
articulation on this figure is really

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.440 
articulation on this figure is really
nice<00:05:47.710> if<00:05:48.710> you<00:05:49.310> already<00:05:49.460> have<00:05:49.760> the<00:05:49.910> comic<00:05:50.270> to

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
nice if you already have the comic to

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.970 
nice if you already have the comic to
pack<00:05:50.720> then<00:05:51.080> it's<00:05:51.260> probably<00:05:51.440> not<00:05:51.740> worth

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 
pack then it's probably not worth

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.280 
pack then it's probably not worth
picking<00:05:52.430> this<00:05:52.550> figure<00:05:52.910> up<00:05:53.060> again<00:05:53.450> of<00:05:53.750> the

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
picking this figure up again of the

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.290 
picking this figure up again of the
paint<00:05:54.530> is<00:05:54.770> a<00:05:54.950> little<00:05:55.310> nicer<00:05:55.490> on<00:05:55.880> this<00:05:56.090> one<00:05:56.270> I

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
paint is a little nicer on this one I

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.360 
paint is a little nicer on this one I
think<00:05:56.450> I<00:05:56.750> like<00:05:56.960> the<00:05:57.140> little<00:05:57.320> brighter<00:05:57.590> red<00:05:57.920> on

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
think I like the little brighter red on

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.670 
think I like the little brighter red on
it<00:05:58.790> but<00:05:59.150> it's<00:05:59.540> not<00:05:59.960> a<00:05:59.990> big<00:06:00.230> enough<00:06:00.260> difference

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
it but it's not a big enough difference

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.380 
it but it's not a big enough difference
that<00:06:01.130> I<00:06:01.160> would<00:06:01.340> recommend<00:06:01.610> buying<00:06:01.940> it<00:06:02.150> for<00:06:02.330> a

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.390 
that I would recommend buying it for a

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.060 
that I would recommend buying it for a
second<00:06:02.750> time<00:06:02.780> but<00:06:03.260> if<00:06:03.380> you<00:06:03.470> don't<00:06:03.710> have<00:06:03.920> the

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
second time but if you don't have the

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.860 
second time but if you don't have the
comic<00:06:04.430> to<00:06:04.580> pack<00:06:04.850> then<00:06:05.480> I<00:06:05.510> definitely
