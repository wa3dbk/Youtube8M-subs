00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
so that's the first two measures we play

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
the next two two measures are very

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.380 
the next two two measures are very
similar<00:02:23.500> slightly<00:02:24.500> different<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:26.060> here's<00:02:26.270> the

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
similar slightly different so here's the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.880 
similar slightly different so here's the
difference<00:02:26.510> we're<00:02:27.080> starting<00:02:27.410> on<00:02:27.500> this<00:02:27.680> a

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
difference we're starting on this a

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.920 
difference we're starting on this a
minor<00:02:28.130> chord<00:02:28.400> instead<00:02:28.820> of<00:02:28.910> instead<00:02:29.420> of<00:02:29.510> the

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
minor chord instead of instead of the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.199 
minor chord instead of instead of the
seventh<00:02:30.350> we're<00:02:30.500> starting<00:02:30.830> on<00:02:31.000> just<00:02:32.000> an<00:02:32.120> a

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
seventh we're starting on just an a

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.940 
seventh we're starting on just an a
minor

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
minor

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.950 
minor
move<00:02:34.460> down<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.819> that<00:02:34.970> same<00:02:35.180> F<00:02:35.420> chord<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:35.810> we

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
move down to that same F chord that we

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.610 
move down to that same F chord that we
saw<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:37.240> the<00:02:38.240> C<00:02:38.420> chord<00:02:38.660> this<00:02:38.780> time<00:02:38.990> is<00:02:39.170> an<00:02:39.290> open

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
saw and the C chord this time is an open

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.800 
saw and the C chord this time is an open
no<00:02:40.069> third<00:02:40.430> so<00:02:40.880> we<00:02:40.910> call<00:02:41.209> that<00:02:41.300> a<00:02:41.360> c5<00:02:42.010> CGC<00:02:43.810> so

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
no third so we call that a c5 CGC so

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.230 
no third so we call that a c5 CGC so
let's<00:02:44.959> look<00:02:45.020> at<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.230> first<00:02:45.380> four<00:02:45.650> measures<00:02:45.800> a

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
let's look at the first four measures a

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:54.180 
let's look at the first four measures a
minor<00:02:47.240> 7<00:02:47.690> F<00:02:49.750> C<00:02:50.830> anticipated<00:02:52.690> hold-hold<00:02:53.690> a

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
minor 7 F C anticipated hold-hold a

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:03.490 
minor 7 F C anticipated hold-hold a
minor<00:02:55.780> same<00:02:56.780> f<00:02:57.020> chord<00:02:57.550> open<00:02:58.550> C<00:02:59.090> 2<00:02:59.950> 3<00:03:00.950> 4<00:03:02.319> so<00:03:03.319> that

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
minor same f chord open C 2 3 4 so that

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.350 
minor same f chord open C 2 3 4 so that
is<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:04.010> introduction<00:03:04.459> those<00:03:04.850> first<00:03:05.150> four

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
is the introduction those first four

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.900 
is the introduction those first four
measures<00:03:05.510> no<00:03:05.930> lyrics<00:03:06.350> no<00:03:06.530> vocals<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.130> the

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
measures no lyrics no vocals and the

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.699 
measures no lyrics no vocals and the
next<00:03:08.239> four<00:03:08.420> measures<00:03:08.750> happen<00:03:09.380> to<00:03:09.470> be<00:03:09.590> exactly

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
next four measures happen to be exactly

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.050 
next four measures happen to be exactly
the<00:03:10.250> same<00:03:10.550> so<00:03:11.270> let's<00:03:12.170> play<00:03:12.550> slowly<00:03:13.550> at<00:03:13.790> a<00:03:13.850> slow

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
the same so let's play slowly at a slow

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.850 
the same so let's play slowly at a slow
tempo<00:03:14.090> we'll<00:03:14.810> say<00:03:14.989> we<00:03:15.110> just<00:03:15.290> play<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.470> intro

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
tempo we'll say we just play the intro

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.229 
tempo we'll say we just play the intro
now<00:03:16.130> let's<00:03:16.340> play<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.489> verse<00:03:16.730> you<00:03:16.970> already

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
now let's play the verse you already

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.699 
now let's play the verse you already
know<00:03:17.360> the<00:03:17.510> verse<00:03:17.690> at<00:03:17.900> least<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.320> first<00:03:18.560> four

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
know the verse at least the first four

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.490 
know the verse at least the first four
measures<00:03:18.860> so<00:03:19.220> here<00:03:19.370> they<00:03:19.489> are<00:03:19.519> one<00:03:20.269> to<00:03:21.050> play

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
measures so here they are one to play

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.930 
measures so here they are one to play
along<00:03:21.950> with<00:03:22.400> me

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.970 

two<00:03:27.940> three<00:03:28.870> we<00:03:29.860> got<00:03:30.010> our<00:03:30.130> a<00:03:30.160> minor<00:03:30.840> RF<00:03:31.860> and<00:03:32.860> our

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
two three we got our a minor RF and our

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.970 
two three we got our a minor RF and our
open<00:03:33.250> side<00:03:33.840> two<00:03:34.840> three

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
open side two three

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.550 
open side two three
here's<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.370> next<00:03:36.580> four<00:03:36.819> measures<00:03:36.970> just<00:03:40.440> as<00:03:41.440> we

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
here's the next four measures just as we

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.550 
here's the next four measures just as we
know<00:03:41.739> it<00:03:42.120> here's<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.270> one<00:03:43.450> difference<00:03:43.900> at<00:03:44.440> the

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
know it here's the one difference at the

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.309 
know it here's the one difference at the
very<00:03:44.800> end

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.520 

so<00:03:48.950> this<00:03:49.129> cord<00:03:49.459> is<00:03:49.670> this<00:03:50.000> is<00:03:50.299> a<00:03:50.420> G<00:03:50.780> sus<00:03:51.079> it's<00:03:51.409> the

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
so this cord is this is a G sus it's the

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.959 
so this cord is this is a G sus it's the
first<00:03:51.769> time<00:03:51.920> we<00:03:52.099> see<00:03:52.250> this<00:03:52.370> cord<00:03:52.609> in<00:03:52.700> the<00:03:52.760> song

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:52.969 
first time we see this cord in the song

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:55.990 
first time we see this cord in the song
and<00:03:53.920> it's<00:03:54.920> going<00:03:55.010> to<00:03:55.069> come<00:03:55.219> on<00:03:55.340> beat<00:03:55.579> three

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
and it's going to come on beat three

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.209 
and it's going to come on beat three
toward<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.629> end<00:03:56.750> of<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:56.900> verse<00:03:57.079> one<00:03:57.439> two

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:58.219 
toward the end of the verse one two

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:02.559 
toward the end of the verse one two
three<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.480> four<00:04:00.109> and<00:04:00.409> and<00:04:00.859> our<00:04:01.670> final<00:04:01.939> C<00:04:02.269> chord

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
three and four and and our final C chord

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.140 
three and four and and our final C chord
is<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.890> different<00:04:04.430> inversion<00:04:04.849> than<00:04:04.970> we've<00:04:05.120> seen

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
is a different inversion than we've seen

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.860 
is a different inversion than we've seen
it's<00:04:05.450> the<00:04:05.540> same<00:04:05.720> notes<00:04:07.420> this<00:04:08.420> time<00:04:08.480> we<00:04:08.840> just

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
it's the same notes this time we just

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.319 
it's the same notes this time we just
see<00:04:09.260> a<00:04:09.640> different<00:04:10.640> arrangement<00:04:10.879> of<00:04:11.209> those

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
see a different arrangement of those

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.949 
see a different arrangement of those
notes<00:04:11.569> so<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:14.090> verse<00:04:14.299> and<00:04:14.569> the<00:04:14.629> introduction

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
notes so the verse and the introduction

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.319 
notes so the verse and the introduction
happened<00:04:15.439> to<00:04:15.500> be<00:04:15.650> exactly<00:04:16.340> the<00:04:16.519> same<00:04:16.549> until

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
happened to be exactly the same until

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.560 
happened to be exactly the same until
the<00:04:17.449> last<00:04:17.600> two<00:04:17.900> measures<00:04:18.079> so<00:04:19.039> we've<00:04:19.850> seen<00:04:20.090> this

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
the last two measures so we've seen this

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.950 
the last two measures so we've seen this
a<00:04:20.870> minor<00:04:21.169> seven<00:04:21.620> this<00:04:21.799> F<00:04:22.009> this<00:04:22.250> C<00:04:22.630> and<00:04:23.630> we<00:04:23.780> see

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
a minor seven this F this C and we see

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.159 
a minor seven this F this C and we see
this<00:04:24.080> a<00:04:24.229> minor<00:04:24.470> again<00:04:24.830> this<00:04:25.220> F<00:04:25.490> is<00:04:25.729> open<00:04:26.030> C<00:04:26.240> so

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
this a minor again this F is open C so

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.950 
this a minor again this F is open C so
first<00:04:27.440> for<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:27.800> same<00:04:27.979> as<00:04:28.099> the<00:04:28.220> intro<00:04:28.520> a<00:04:28.960> minor

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
first for the same as the intro a minor

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.800 
first for the same as the intro a minor
7<00:04:30.440> F<00:04:30.560> C<00:04:30.949> this<00:04:31.130> is<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.370> next<00:04:31.639> two<00:04:31.789> measures<00:04:32.000> the

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
7 F C this is the next two measures the

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.480 
7 F C this is the next two measures the
last<00:04:33.080> two<00:04:33.349> are<00:04:33.500> different<00:04:33.680> so<00:04:34.039> here<00:04:34.220> the<00:04:34.340> last

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
last two are different so here the last

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.600 
last two are different so here the last
two

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.680 

okay<00:04:41.610> let's<00:04:41.820> do<00:04:41.910> those<00:04:42.060> last<00:04:42.210> two<00:04:42.419> measures

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
okay let's do those last two measures

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:52.100 
okay let's do those last two measures
slowly<00:04:44.090> one<00:04:45.090> two<00:04:45.780> ready<00:04:46.590> and

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.370 

and<00:04:53.820> that<00:04:54.820> rounds<00:04:55.180> out<00:04:55.300> our<00:04:55.480> introduction<00:04:56.290> in

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
and that rounds out our introduction in

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.170 
and that rounds out our introduction in
our<00:04:56.500> verse<00:04:56.770> so<00:04:57.490> if<00:04:57.580> you<00:04:57.700> can<00:04:57.850> get<00:04:57.970> comfortable

with<00:04:58.510> those<00:04:58.720> two<00:04:59.139> tiny<00:04:59.530> progressions<00:05:00.190> and

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
with those two tiny progressions and

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.640 
with those two tiny progressions and
they're<00:05:00.580> slight<00:05:00.940> alterations<00:05:01.660> I<00:05:01.900> think

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
they're slight alterations I think
