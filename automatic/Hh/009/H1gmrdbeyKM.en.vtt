00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.350
 hey people welcome to 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.500
 second part of a gamer pc build yourself 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.930
 2014 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.649
 Today it's about random access 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.990
 memory 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.190
 as far as I know that the abbreviation for it 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.049
 will probably be around again 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.730
 others , if not quite so 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.949
 is correct or someone else 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.760
 otherwise not know what he does 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.109
 could mean 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.920
 He likes that in the comments 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.000
 I take the corsa venture 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.670
 I actually go the last one 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.800
 time and again used the sees 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.109
 so that's four times four gigabytes 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.450
 in the beginning occupancy I always use 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.340
 only two slots on the mainboard later 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.500
 Of course, the whole thing can go on 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.940
 be set up and so now I come 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.899
 First of all, that's all right 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.000
 center 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.129
 it's about these slots here 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.390
 he comes in the Rhine 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.180
 There is a score in the ram slots 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.760
 this gift has a meaning and is 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.550
 extremely important when mounting the ram 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.100
 that your animal is also important 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.850
 There are different types of 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.780
 ddr ram ddr3 look right up there 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.189
 is dpa 3 16 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.630
 please pay attention in any case if you 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.700
 you buy a new mainboard or synonymous 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.530
 a used on what ram up 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.600
 This board can be installed 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.799
 there is more information on this 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.790
 every case in the user manual 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.340
 of the mainboard or on the outer carton and 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.360
 Now I want the first 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.880
 Installation instructions of the quantity 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.580
 relations of the ram we look first 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.890
 in the installation instructions of the 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.060
 mainboards and here are some 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.380
 interesting be lower so 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.380
 At least you have to go far 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.060
 Build on ddr3 ram for dual channel 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.439
 Configuration definitely needs 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.640
 the 1 and the two or the one two 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.829
 three and four occupy 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.560
 and now something else 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.820
 important to many is not at first 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.780
 Eighth because they think that is just 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.000
 not important to the 1 2 3 and 4 are 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.119
 that is necessarily me on top of each other 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.360
 you can not just pull it off then 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.159
 namely the following happens 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.380
 theoretical one system 3 the second one 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.789
 is in the 1 the third is the 4 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.010
 the fourth is the 2 and now that 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.989
 chaos perfect now no one knows where anymore 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:22.450
 must actually making him the course 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:26.620
 whole with a little bit more in here 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.599
 middle I know now for example 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.980
 a double occupancy as I like it 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:35.319
 Go ahead with these two ram 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.730
 building blocks now happens in the following 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.769
 the manual is in there 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.900
 Attention to a dual channel 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.329
 configuration and want two rams 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.709
 Do you please do the following things like that ? 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.579
 of course it is not in there is mine 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.819
 occupation of it 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:50.500
 you take the dimm slot 1 that is 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.739
 blue marks that it is here in the 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.810
 middle and did not see but this 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.959
 little check mark satan with her 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.319
 action is now that and for the 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:05.290
 second run building block you take the dimm 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.780
 slot 2 maybe not including one 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.370
 at the bottom of these two slots must 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.349
 Now the room will be installed with it 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.359
 the whole thing actually in the dual 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.680
 channel mode can run when the room 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.870
 that supports at all 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.120
 So you see it's extremely important 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.159
 before with the user manual or 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.470
 inform in the net how is the board 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.720
 built and which in which 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.819
 For example, the configuration must be dual 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.190
 channel run if you are 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.599
 just now somewhere a purely infected 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.299
 and say oh no matter 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.650
 fuck on it look what happens 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.150
 then you might have that 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.750
 problem that nothing happens 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.040
 and special situations at pc 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.090
 you do not necessarily have to assemble 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.340
 have or 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.560
 I do not necessarily have to have it 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.930
 Now that we know that ddr3 is from 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.319
 the right one is after we know too 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.760
 that in the slot 1, the first comes 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.819
 should be installed is the question 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.310
 as we all installed here in the 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.620
 slot there is a small notch that you see 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:07.629
 her here's the setting rose 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:11.879
 counterpart in the room is building block 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:13.840
 a notch you can see here 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.609
 You should not necessarily go for it here 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.340
 I do that too , exceptionally 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.000
 do not you see here is this cable 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.320
 and here is this 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.700
 yes and as you can see there is 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.740
 actually only one 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.410
 possibility in these ram building blocks too 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.300
 install in slot 1 you put it 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.040
 above just a right and left and 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.860
 small guide rails is so 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.020
 continue down and now right and left 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.000
 Carefully let a hook that alone 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.320
 by the pressure that means you 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.580
 the girls have to be here at the side 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.169
 do not click up 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.500
 that was completely alone through the 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:48.300
 contact pressure of the ram happen times 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.550
 see if that really works 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.220
 I 'll do it here on the right 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:58.229
 side a lot of pressure so the left side 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:00.150
 and you see these two braces call 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.160
 I have times a pincer new york 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.270
 gone up now included the 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.350
 frame a bit tight 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.000
 thus, the first ram slots is occupied and 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.340
 Now we go to the second ramspott of the 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.770
 it also highlighted blue because it exists 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.950
 a color equality in these slots 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.330
 which should be merged 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.830
 Now we take the second eighth too 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.690
 here again that the score on 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.940
 So the right side is in it 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.970
 once so and put it again 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.770
 on and press the whole carefully 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.419
 down to the right and left as I said 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.940
 there are the guide rails that should 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.140
 We already meet my case now 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.930
 kinda a little bit now 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:39.120
 works hit and now easy 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.490
 From top to bottom press gently 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:45.240
 but with enough pressure so this 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.340
 small blue particles on the side 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.310
 also with go up you see number 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.020
 one and two number two there is little 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.639
 klack noise and that's it 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.950
 appropriate room also installed 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.300
 would you like to install more later 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.780
 then please pay attention to the 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:03.150
 occupancy what the mainboard or the 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.680
 mainboard instructions says in the case 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.100
 Here, for example, you could still do the im 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.590
 occupy slot 3 and 4 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.150
 that looks all from the top now 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.910
 I hope that was not too long and 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.470
 detailed enough in front of all 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.910
 please work the earth and the end 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.100
 probably completely forgotten as always 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.660
 important if you liked the video 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.050
 then I'm looking forward to a thumb 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.400
 up 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.320
 if she did not like you can 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.789
 like to thumb down and we 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.070
 see us at the next video on fashion 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:30.599
 but pull 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:33.180
 here it goes for the first part now gamer 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:35.310
 pc himself born 2014 use 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.169
 intel cpu above you can my channel 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.580
 Subscribe if you like and goes here 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:40.580
 very much fun to my homepage
