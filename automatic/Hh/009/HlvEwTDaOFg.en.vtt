one<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.340> things<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.820> kind<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.090> suck<00:01:42.329> and

by three aspect ratio sometimes that it
tends<00:04:43.260> to<00:04:43.610> struggle<00:04:44.610> with<00:04:44.820> that<00:04:45.000> hopefully

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
tends to struggle with that hopefully

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.460 
tends to struggle with that hopefully
the<00:04:45.750> iPhone<00:04:46.110> 5<00:04:46.290> is<00:04:46.440> 16<00:04:47.070> by<00:04:47.250> 9<00:04:47.280> aspect<00:04:47.790> ratio<00:04:48.470> so

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
the iPhone 5 is 16 by 9 aspect ratio so

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.200 
the iPhone 5 is 16 by 9 aspect ratio so
maybe<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:50.130> videos<00:04:50.430> will<00:04:50.640> work<00:04:50.790> a<00:04:50.880> little<00:04:51.000> bit

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
maybe the videos will work a little bit

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.520 
maybe the videos will work a little bit
