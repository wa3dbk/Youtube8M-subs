00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.040
 you are on technological puntonet and we are 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.289
 here today to do a very quick 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.720
 navigation comparison between three smartphones 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.410
 dual sim on the Italian market 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.350
 on the left in como k 5 turbo al 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.660
 center we find acer liquid and 2 e on 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.060
 right we find ngm forward instead 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.160
 infinite ones really in 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.489
 competition we can say right away are 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.739
 lacer the model acer the model of ngm 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.239
 since they both use the processor 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:45.420
 mediatek 65 89 quad core from 1.2 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.450
 gigahertz while the k 5 turbo model 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.610
 owns the turbo processor la 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.559
 turbo version of these two since 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:58.020
 we are talking about a maximum frequency 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:01.440
 supported by 1.5 ghz of stand and 4.5 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.750
 inches for this and this and display from 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.360
 5 inches instead with full hd resolution 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.990
 and therefore visibility we assure you 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.590
 much better for the model of 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.210
 como 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.960
 let's try browsing now 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.960
 web we open stock browsers in the case of 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.979
 ngm forward finally stock browser in the 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:30.210
 case of como k 5 turbo and google chrome 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.700
 pre-installed on the acer liquid and two 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.280
 let's try we have 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.280
 previously downloaded the cache 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.330
 and in fact as you can see it does not appear 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.330
 not even in aid 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.729
 we are also connected via wi fi network 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.950
 if we must say that then to the acer model 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.489
 liquid and two the one that struggles a little 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.069
 most impressive for all three 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.130
 loading speed in our opinion 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.110
 we are on really good levels because 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.360
 in everyday life we ​​think that 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.209
 you can hardly want anything else 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.330
 from a model that is dual sim and that 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.950
 supports up to these speeds is there 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.530
 some doubts about the specifics you and 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.900
 acer has officially declared that yes 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.959
 up to 7.2 megabits per second but 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.450
 in reality but in speed test we are not 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.069
 were able or able to overcome them and 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.780
 however to say with extreme 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.010
 certainty that this could be his 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.840
 limit 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.840
 we load another page on the fly 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:10.220
 rather fast rendering and uploading 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.220
 exactly on the very precise page 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.840
 let's try we are noticing that anyway 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.440
 he was still loading the k 5 model 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.310
 como turbo we find one of the most sites 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.830
 web browsing classics 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:32.070
 repubblica.it which is also extremely 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:34.320
 heavy we were wrong I already had 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.310
 done loading but basically you can 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.460
 also see from you 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.820
 since we are talking about the version 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.820
 mobile 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:59.340
 ngm loads it directly in version 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:01.950
 desktop while on pleasure we go to 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.620
 upload the classic version are 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.420
 subsequently we point out that 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.470
 despite everything it was not loaded 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:14.270
 completely on the chat 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.270
 sorry on the model ng m 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.660
 what to say 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.310
 acer liquid due is what he has 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.900
 really kept the arrangement of 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.520
 data 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.550
 nevertheless it can be said that this 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.650
 site has put a strain on both 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.630
 smartphone 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.610
 in reality it must be said that in any case 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.130
 we greeted the cache and deleted 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.540
 enology so we are facing 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.710
 to the smartphones that have been 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.660
 subjected to a severe test 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.610
 if you want to regularly visit sites 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.370
 web technically expect me 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.950
 considerably faster the result is 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.540
 obviously very pleasant for everyone e 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.750
 three of us talking about one 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.760
 smartphone that costs at least 200 euros 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:13.419
 about 270 euros as list price 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.790
 while the k 5 turbo model that is 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:16.720
 however much more evolved than for 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.570
 regarding the features 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.600
 techniques is found above 300 euros 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.490
