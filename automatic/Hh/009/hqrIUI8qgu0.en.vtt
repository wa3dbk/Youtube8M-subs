00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
research but what happens I've been

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.619 
research but what happens I've been
teamed<00:02:49.489> up<00:02:49.609> with<00:02:49.730> Damon<00:02:50.090> all<00:02:50.180> year<00:02:50.450> and

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
teamed up with Damon all year and

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.869 
teamed up with Damon all year and
obviously<00:02:51.469> I<00:02:51.560> go<00:02:51.799> before<00:02:52.189> him<00:02:52.280> in<00:02:52.430> freestyle

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
obviously I go before him in freestyle

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.199 
obviously I go before him in freestyle
so<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.930> go<00:02:54.739> out<00:02:54.769> I<00:02:54.949> do<00:02:55.189> my<00:02:55.489> run<00:02:55.699> and<00:02:55.939> I<00:02:56.030> have<00:02:56.060> a

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
so I go out I do my run and I have a

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.059 
so I go out I do my run and I have a
pretty<00:02:56.389> good<00:02:56.510> run<00:02:56.810> while<00:02:56.870> he<00:02:57.349> sits<00:02:57.620> there<00:02:57.709> and

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
pretty good run while he sits there and

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.699 
pretty good run while he sits there and
watches<00:02:58.489> what<00:02:58.879> I<00:02:58.909> do<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.510> then<00:02:59.989> elevates<00:03:00.530> it

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
watches what I do and then elevates it

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.030 
watches what I do and then elevates it
so<00:03:01.069> I<00:03:01.370> take<00:03:02.000> half<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.329> credit<00:03:02.780> for<00:03:03.139> what<00:03:03.620> Damon

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
so I take half the credit for what Damon

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.789 
so I take half the credit for what Damon
does<00:03:04.250> on<00:03:04.639> his<00:03:05.030> freestyle<00:03:05.599> you<00:03:06.169> know<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.409> I<00:03:06.530> you

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
truck to truck doesn't it actually not

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.210 
truck to truck doesn't it actually not
you<00:03:20.090> know<00:03:20.239> for<00:03:20.599> me<00:03:20.689> I<00:03:20.720> again<00:03:21.500> kind<00:03:21.889> of<00:03:21.949> coming

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
you know for me I again kind of coming

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.259 
you know for me I again kind of coming
to<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.370> research<00:03:22.609> thing<00:03:22.819> and<00:03:23.000> watching

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
to the research thing and watching

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.670 
to the research thing and watching
videos<00:03:23.299> i<00:03:23.659> don't<00:03:23.870> i<00:03:24.049> just<00:03:24.079> kind<00:03:24.439> of<00:03:24.470> wing<00:03:24.650> it

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
videos i don't i just kind of wing it

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.800 
videos i don't i just kind of wing it
and<00:03:24.829> it<00:03:25.189> seems<00:03:25.459> to<00:03:25.579> work<00:03:25.819> for<00:03:26.060> me<00:03:26.209> i<00:03:26.239> think<00:03:26.509> if<00:03:26.629> i

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
and it seems to work for me i think if i

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.990 
and it seems to work for me i think if i
overthink<00:03:27.799> it<00:03:27.889> too<00:03:28.040> much<00:03:28.220> which<00:03:28.459> i<00:03:28.609> do<00:03:28.669> some

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
overthink it too much which i do some

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.729 
overthink it too much which i do some
things<00:03:29.239> that<00:03:29.389> I<00:03:29.599> think<00:03:29.780> it'll<00:03:30.109> probably<00:03:30.379> come

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
things that I think it'll probably come

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.740 
things that I think it'll probably come
off<00:03:30.919> the<00:03:31.069> wrong<00:03:31.099> way<00:03:31.250> so<00:03:31.459> I<00:03:31.970> just<00:03:32.419> kind<00:03:32.599> of<00:03:32.629> go

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
off the wrong way so I just kind of go

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.300 
off the wrong way so I just kind of go
out<00:03:32.900> there<00:03:33.079> i<00:03:33.109> try<00:03:33.379> to<00:03:33.439> glance<00:03:33.709> at<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:33.919> track<00:03:34.159> I

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
out there i try to glance at the track I

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.770 
out there i try to glance at the track I
probably<00:03:34.519> look<00:03:34.759> at<00:03:34.879> this<00:03:34.970> track<00:03:35.209> more<00:03:35.449> so<00:03:35.599> than

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
probably look at this track more so than

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.110 
probably look at this track more so than
I<00:03:35.900> do<00:03:35.959> throughout<00:03:36.409> the<00:03:36.500> year<00:03:36.650> I<00:03:37.370> just<00:03:37.909> kind<00:03:38.090> of

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
I do throughout the year I just kind of

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.219 
I do throughout the year I just kind of
like<00:03:38.269> to<00:03:38.389> go<00:03:38.509> out<00:03:38.659> and<00:03:38.780> let<00:03:38.930> it<00:03:38.959> be<00:03:39.139> a<00:03:39.169> surprise

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:39.229 
like to go out and let it be a surprise

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:41.349 
like to go out and let it be a surprise
and<00:03:39.859> I<00:03:39.919> like<00:03:40.069> to<00:03:40.220> see<00:03:40.400> a<00:03:40.609> lot<00:03:40.970> of<00:03:41.000> different

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
and I like to see a lot of different

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:42.670 
and I like to see a lot of different
tracks<00:03:41.569> i<00:03:41.720> like<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:41.989> see<00:03:42.109> them<00:03:42.199> technical

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
tracks i like to see them technical

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.589 
tracks i like to see them technical
because<00:03:42.949> i<00:03:42.979> think<00:03:43.099> there's<00:03:43.489> fewer<00:03:44.120> guys<00:03:44.329> that

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
because i think there's fewer guys that

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.479 
because i think there's fewer guys that
can<00:03:44.720> drive<00:03:44.840> a<00:03:44.900> technical<00:03:45.409> track<00:03:45.620> i<00:03:45.889> think<00:03:46.400> this

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
can drive a technical track i think this

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:47.800 
can drive a technical track i think this
is<00:03:46.549> going<00:03:46.699> to<00:03:46.759> be<00:03:46.909> a<00:03:46.939> great<00:03:47.090> show<00:03:47.419> this<00:03:47.599> year

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
is going to be a great show this year

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.099 
is going to be a great show this year
but<00:03:48.290> i<00:03:48.319> think<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.919> track<00:03:49.220> is<00:03:49.489> going<00:03:49.669> to<00:03:49.729> be

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
but i think the track is going to be

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.569 
but i think the track is going to be
it's<00:03:51.109> an<00:03:51.259> easier<00:03:51.530> track<00:03:51.829> it's<00:03:52.069> more<00:03:52.280> spread

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
it's an easier track it's more spread

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:53.979 
it's an easier track it's more spread
out<00:03:52.609> which<00:03:52.939> i<00:03:53.090> think<00:03:53.150> will<00:03:53.389> be<00:03:53.509> a<00:03:53.540> better<00:03:53.689> show

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
out which i think will be a better show

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.479 
out which i think will be a better show
but<00:03:54.199> i<00:03:54.229> think<00:03:54.470> it's<00:03:54.590> going<00:03:54.709> to<00:03:54.769> be<00:03:54.919> harder<00:03:55.310> to

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
but i think it's going to be harder to

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.069 
but i think it's going to be harder to
pick<00:03:56.090> that<00:03:56.239> freestyle<00:03:56.659> winter<00:03:56.900> because

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
pick that freestyle winter because

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.509 
pick that freestyle winter because
there's<00:03:57.319> going<00:03:57.439> to<00:03:57.500> be<00:03:57.530> so<00:03:57.799> many<00:03:57.949> freestyles

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
there's going to be so many freestyles

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.819 
there's going to be so many freestyles
which<00:03:58.699> is<00:03:58.969> what<00:03:59.269> the<00:03:59.389> fans<00:03:59.569> want<00:03:59.719> to<00:03:59.900> see<00:03:59.930> so
