00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.840
 tenth victory of fc barcelona in the 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.639
 bbva league 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.480
 the barça consolidates in the first 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:16.270
 position and get in this way 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.830
 defeat the mallorca at home adding 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.689
 the fourth consecutive victory of the 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.510
 season the club has only given a 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:26.290
 tie in this league against Real Madrid 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:29.970
 and the meeting was very much in his face 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:32.850
 the first period when he got 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.489
 almost in the last quarter hour 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.710
 advantage from 0 to 3 this is the first notice 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.270
 of dani alves with that ball that ends 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.629
 rejecting aouate in mallorca very 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.489
 desperate for his situation in the table 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.930
 he also had opportunities to put the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.840
 1 to 0 in fact the best 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.670
 they had the set of caparrós as 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.620
 for example, this gm head shot 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.079
 that ends up taking víctor valdés 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.239
 the club found that if the first goal 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.940
 of the game thanks to a lack in the 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.200
 frontal of the area a lack on cesc 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.530
 fabregas 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.090
 who executed with mastery xavi hernández 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.619
 a fault that also caused the 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.470
 yellow cardboard for veteran pep 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.470
 lluís martí a foul that would mark 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.710
 xavi hernandez 28 minutes for the 0 to 1 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.710
 from barcelona 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.470
 fantastic the execution by sending the 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.470
 ball 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.580
 to the right of the aouate goal 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.810
 the 0 to 1 was good to Barcelona for 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.659
 have a little more stuck there was already 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.299
 had a lot of party control 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.700
 very much possession and see the one that has t 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.820
 me with via 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.579
 Here we see the move by xavi for tello and 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.649
 had as delivery via that does not get 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.840
 finally finish because it takes it out very 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.799
 clean jerome he the barça listened 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.950
 A lot bottled the mallorca in your area 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:10.379
 and I would end up getting 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.379
 the 0 to 2 with this villa shot 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.650
 at minute 43 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.650
 and what this second goal means 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.379
 fortune in which you have months true that 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.629
 the shot is strong but it's over 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:30.200
 eating aouate with this goal is the same 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:33.459
 to go the mark of fight in year 58 that 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.420
 had scored 75 goals in the calendar year 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.609
 I would still have the opportunity to read 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.750
 Messi to overcome that mark of or king 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:42.710
 peel and this would be the play from 0 to 3 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.650
 shot of you 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.200
 from the front all the right 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.730
 to score this third goal of the 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.349
 Barcelona 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.970
 and in this way know an advantage 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.970
 very important of the culé set 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.120
 Tello maneuver looks for the profile of the 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.000
 right and ends up sending the ball to 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.940
 another stick of aouate's goal 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.420
 the club hungry for a goal in the first 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.420
 period 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.930
 and with a start of the second half 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.450
 that surprised the Barça team 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.000
 this steal of ball from víctor casadesús 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:25.000
 allows michael pereira 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.250
 work to Victor Víctor 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.250
 and mark this way 1 to 3 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.950
 here we see the action 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.260
 in which casadesús finishes delivering the 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.250
 pereira ball 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.890
 that does not even let the ball vote 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.020
 when it arrives and hits it with all the 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.460
 force of the world and this would be also 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.010
 a very important play of the game 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.710
 because if the 1 to 3 arrived in 9 this 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.360
 search penalties would come in the 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:00.260
 13th minute 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.629
 yellow for the Spanish international 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.380
 and the mallorca that I got from this 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.210
 way 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.000
 will cut distances because víctor 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:12.470
 casadesús a notary from the 11 meters 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.470
 2 to 3 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.799
 without having made too much noise 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.530
 mallorca returned to get into the game 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.750
 and almost almost neutralized that advantage of 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.750
 three goals that tito's team had 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.580
 vilanova the barça looked for the fourth goal 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.860
 give him 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.860
 Absolute tranquility and found it 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.430
 in minute 25 in this action in which 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.300
 alexis 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:43.349
 messi and it ends up working putting the 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:47.639
 ball for the squad 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:47.639
 alexis assistance 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.369
 the best one that had entered the second 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.990
 Refreshment period for Barcelona 

00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:56.930
 here we see how there is no offside 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.699
 asked by the players of mallorca 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.339
 possible anti-regulatory situation of 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.349
 Alexis out of positional play 

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:07.349
 because it's in the path they understand 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:08.939
 the edges that reproached him 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.740
 collegiate alexis is on the path 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:13.080
 from leo messi's shot 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.899
 we have the assistance as it leaves you 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.969
 the ball with the chest and as a rifle to 

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:20.309
 messi the barça left very touched the biggest 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:22.259
 that there are with 2 to 4 and had even 

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:25.139
 occasions to mark 2 to 5 and 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:28.139
 they asked alexis penalty what happens 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:31.650
 that the Chilean got up right away 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.539
 and the play continued with this shot of 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.069
 messi that went very high 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:39.120
 a leonine and by the way that has already arrived 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:41.409
 to 15 goals in the bbva league in these 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.899
 11 league matches 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:46.269
 at the end of the barcelona victory to be 

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:51.029
 more leader of this first division in the 

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:51.029
