00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
grains above the bottom of your kettle

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.100 
grains above the bottom of your kettle
to<00:01:05.350> keep<00:01:05.530> you<00:01:05.620> from<00:01:05.740> scorching<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:06.280> grains<00:01:07.110> it

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
two and a half grant with these false

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.650 
two and a half grant with these false
bottoms<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:12.640> a<00:01:12.670> three<00:01:12.970> gallon<00:01:13.120> depending<00:01:13.570> on

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
bottoms to a three gallon depending on

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
for the Pico style false bottom and

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.859 
for the Pico style false bottom and
you'll<00:01:19.240> have<00:01:19.420> six<00:01:19.810> pieces<00:01:20.770> for<00:01:21.160> the<00:01:21.310> legs<00:01:21.869> and

you'll have six pieces for the legs and

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.359 
you'll have six pieces for the legs and
you're<00:01:23.170> going<00:01:23.200> to<00:01:23.320> start<00:01:23.590> off<00:01:23.680> by<00:01:23.740> taking<00:01:24.220> one

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
you're going to start off by taking one

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.310 
you're going to start off by taking one
of<00:01:24.400> these<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:26.470> one<00:01:26.740> of<00:01:26.800> these<00:01:27.930> put<00:01:28.930> it<00:01:28.990> in<00:01:29.110> like

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
of these and one of these put it in like

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.440 
of these and one of these put it in like
so<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:32.729> follow<00:01:33.729> through<00:01:34.000> with<00:01:34.240> the

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
so and follow through with the

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:41.310 
so and follow through with the
additional<00:01:35.020> pieces<00:01:39.360> like<00:01:40.360> so<00:01:40.390> then<00:01:41.200> you

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
additional pieces like so then you

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.700 
additional pieces like so then you
simply<00:01:41.710> add<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:41.979> last<00:01:42.190> one<00:01:42.520> on<00:01:42.790> top<00:01:43.119> and<00:01:43.710> then

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
simply add the last one on top and then

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.490 
simply add the last one on top and then
lift<00:01:44.979> up<00:01:45.130> on<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.460> other<00:01:45.610> side<00:01:46.410> and<00:01:47.410> then

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
lift up on the other side and then

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.630 
lift up on the other side and then
you're<00:01:47.619> just<00:01:47.740> gonna<00:01:47.920> hold<00:01:48.190> it<00:01:48.310> on<00:01:48.400> an<00:01:48.520> angle

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
you're just gonna hold it on an angle

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.540 
you're just gonna hold it on an angle
like<00:01:48.850> this<00:01:49.530> drop<00:01:50.530> it<00:01:50.710> right<00:01:50.740> into<00:01:51.009> your<00:01:51.190> towel

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.499 

position<00:01:54.550> it<00:01:54.640> in<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:54.850> bottom<00:01:55.149> of<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.300> keg

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
position it in the bottom of the keg

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.690 
position it in the bottom of the keg
slip<00:01:55.750> so<00:01:55.899> it's<00:01:55.990> flat<00:01:56.229> like<00:01:56.289> that<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:57.429> then<00:01:57.580> you

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
slip so it's flat like that and then you

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.020 
slip so it's flat like that and then you
would<00:01:57.789> simply<00:01:58.210> just<00:01:58.240> take<00:01:58.600> one<00:01:58.840> at<00:01:58.960> a<00:01:59.020> time<00:02:00.030> put

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
would simply just take one at a time put

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.749 
would simply just take one at a time put
it<00:02:01.149> in<00:02:01.270> place

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
it in place

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.160 
it in place
and<00:02:03.759> then<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.179> second<00:02:04.600> half<00:02:06.600> just<00:02:07.600> to<00:02:07.810> make

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
and then the second half just to make

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.830 
and then the second half just to make
sure<00:02:08.200> it's<00:02:08.530> flat<00:02:09.030> you're<00:02:10.030> all<00:02:10.119> set<00:02:10.360> now<00:02:10.780> you

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
sure it's flat you're all set now you

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.780 
sure it's flat you're all set now you
have<00:02:11.050> it<00:02:11.200> that's<00:02:11.319> the<00:02:11.440> Pico<00:02:11.770> false<00:02:12.040> bottom<00:02:12.460> we

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
have it that's the Pico false bottom we

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.070 
have it that's the Pico false bottom we
have<00:02:12.910> about<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.210> two<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:13.630> a<00:02:13.690> half<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:14.050> three

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080
