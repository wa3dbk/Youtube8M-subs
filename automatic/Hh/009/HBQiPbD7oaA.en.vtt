00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.180 
the problem this is going to be great
the<00:02:11.840> way<00:02:11.959> that<00:02:12.110> we<00:02:12.200> programmed<00:02:12.620> these<00:02:12.769> robots

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
the way that we programmed these robots

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.250 
the way that we programmed these robots
is<00:02:13.430> using<00:02:13.880> a<00:02:13.940> system<00:02:14.330> called<00:02:14.360> behavior<00:02:15.050> based

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
is using a system called behavior based

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.500 
is using a system called behavior based
robotics<00:02:15.769> and<00:02:15.980> we<00:02:16.610> use<00:02:16.819> behavior<00:02:17.299> based

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
robotics and we use behavior based

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.750 
robotics and we use behavior based
programming<00:02:18.140> because<00:02:18.530> it's<00:02:19.160> very<00:02:19.430> responsive

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
programming because it's very responsive

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.360 
programming because it's very responsive
to<00:02:20.239> what's<00:02:20.840> in<00:02:21.019> the<00:02:21.110> world<00:02:21.319> timing<00:02:22.280> is

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
to what's in the world timing is

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.840 
to what's in the world timing is
everything

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
everything

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.460 
everything
we're<00:02:23.030> farmers<00:02:23.480> we're<00:02:23.930> at<00:02:24.019> the<00:02:24.110> mercy<00:02:24.230> of

we're farmers we're at the mercy of
Mother<00:02:24.860> Nature<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.640> so<00:02:25.910> when<00:02:26.150> it's<00:02:26.269> time<00:02:26.360> to
