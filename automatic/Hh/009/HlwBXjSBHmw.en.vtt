that we need some of that and we need a

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.610 
that we need some of that and we need a
redstone<00:00:52.289> comparator<00:00:54.079> because<00:00:55.079> what<00:00:55.469> we're

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
redstone comparator because what we're

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.500 
redstone comparator because what we're
gonna<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.890> discussing<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.730> test<00:00:57.210> for

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
gonna be discussing is the test for

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.040 
gonna be discussing is the test for
comment<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.320> think<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.670> nice<00:01:00.059> command<00:01:00.570> because

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
comment I think a nice command because

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.880 
comment I think a nice command because
what<00:01:01.199> else<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.500> may<00:01:01.620> means<00:01:02.210> comment<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.390> like

what else it may means comment I like
comments<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.010> YouTube<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.240> not<00:01:06.360> what<00:01:06.479> I

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
comments on YouTube this is not what I

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.010 
comments on YouTube this is not what I
mean<00:01:06.890> so<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.100> uh<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.850> test<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.330> comment

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
mean so on uh the test for comment

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.609 
mean so on uh the test for comment
command<00:01:10.530> basically<00:01:11.010> does<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.850> tests<00:01:12.240> for

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
command basically does is it tests for

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.420 
command basically does is it tests for
entities<00:01:14.420> at<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.509> specific<00:01:16.080> place<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.710> we<00:01:17.220> can

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
entities at a specific place and we can

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.880 
entities at a specific place and we can
make<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.119> search<00:01:18.979> that<00:01:20.450> coordinates<00:01:21.890> that

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
make it search that coordinates that

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.550 
make it search that coordinates that
specific<00:01:23.520> place<00:01:23.790> we<00:01:24.450> can<00:01:24.570> even<00:01:24.720> set<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.080> radius

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
specific place we can even set a radius

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.780 
specific place we can even set a radius
around<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.130> space<00:01:26.490> like<00:01:27.170> around<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.350> block

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
around that space like around that block

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.340 
around that space like around that block
repeat<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.060> person<00:01:30.420> gets<00:01:30.570> within<00:01:31.110> five

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
repeat if a person gets within five

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.630 
repeat if a person gets within five
blocks<00:01:31.560> from<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.310> specific<00:01:32.909> comment

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
blocks from that specific comment

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.109 
blocks from that specific comment
we<00:01:35.640> want<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.939> give<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.439> true<00:01:39.020> value<00:01:40.939> so<00:01:41.939> like

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
we want to give it true value so like

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.639 
we want to give it true value so like
the<00:01:42.930> comment<00:01:43.259> blog<00:01:43.409> actually<00:01:43.649> has<00:01:44.430> an<00:01:44.670> output

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
the comment blog actually has an output

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.740 
the comment blog actually has an output
so<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:46.680> want<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.070> type<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.250> no<00:01:47.700> not<00:01:47.759> caps<00:01:48.119> test

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
so we want to type in no not caps test

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.010 
so we want to type in no not caps test

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.210 

you<00:02:42.330> see<00:02:42.540> that's<00:02:43.530> what<00:02:43.770> I<00:02:43.800> mean

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
you see that's what I mean

you see that's what I mean
but<00:02:44.550> well<00:02:46.820> well<00:02:47.820> at<00:02:47.970> least<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.420> can<00:02:48.570> see<00:02:48.750> that

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
but well well at least you can see that

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.010 
but well well at least you can see that
test<00:02:49.860> for<00:02:50.100> everything<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:51.330> we<00:02:51.390> did<00:02:51.660> not<00:02:51.780> enter

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
test for everything and we did not enter

00:02:52.020 --> 00:03:00.990 
test for everything and we did not enter
a<00:02:52.200> radius<00:02:53.660> let's<00:02:54.660> do

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.040 

you<00:03:01.570> see<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:01.900> stopped<00:03:02.230> doing<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:02.710> and<00:03:03.210> now<00:03:04.240> it

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
you see it stopped doing that and now it

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.190 
you see it stopped doing that and now it
did<00:03:05.320> it<00:03:05.410> again<00:03:05.700> that's<00:03:06.700> what<00:03:06.910> I<00:03:06.940> mean<00:03:07.200> that's

here<00:04:40.050> but<00:04:41.050> I've<00:04:41.650> experienced<00:04:42.370> that<00:04:42.550> this<00:04:42.880> one

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
here but I've experienced that this one

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.659 
here but I've experienced that this one
works<00:04:43.300> and<00:04:43.690> with<00:04:43.900> the<00:04:44.020> brackets<00:04:44.440> snap<00:04:44.800> they

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
works and with the brackets snap they

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:51.379 
works and with the brackets snap they
won't<00:04:45.880> work

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:05:11.120 

first<00:04:51.930> in<00:04:52.259> the<00:04:52.469> same

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.760 

so<00:05:12.130> now<00:05:12.510> as<00:05:13.510> soon<00:05:13.690> as<00:05:13.780> we<00:05:13.900> get<00:05:14.050> in<00:05:14.260> there<00:05:14.470> and<00:05:14.650> as

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
so now as soon as we get in there and as

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:15.990 
so now as soon as we get in there and as
you<00:05:14.860> can<00:05:14.979> see<00:05:15.040> there's<00:05:15.430> the<00:05:15.550> proof<00:05:15.790> because

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
you can see there's the proof because

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.719 
you can see there's the proof because
I've<00:05:16.240> just<00:05:16.510> set<00:05:16.720> this<00:05:16.870> up<00:05:17.080> you<00:05:17.889> know<00:05:18.430> that

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
I've just set this up you know that

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.850 
I've just set this up you know that
there<00:05:18.940> is<00:05:19.090> no<00:05:19.300> connection<00:05:19.690> between<00:05:19.900> that

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
there is no connection between that

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.170 
there is no connection between that
sport<00:05:21.639> in<00:05:21.760> there<00:05:21.970> and<00:05:22.240> this<00:05:23.199> thing<00:05:23.650> so<00:05:24.180> we

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
sport in there and this thing so we

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.140 
sport in there and this thing so we
closed<00:05:25.540> this<00:05:25.979> nobody<00:05:26.979> could<00:05:27.220> ever<00:05:27.310> see<00:05:27.580> that

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
closed this nobody could ever see that

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:39.909 
closed this nobody could ever see that
what<00:05:28.600> were<00:05:28.720> they<00:05:28.870> walk<00:05:29.050> in<00:05:29.290> oh<00:05:30.750> I've<00:05:31.750> got<00:05:31.960> about

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:43.059 

now<00:05:40.909> it's<00:05:41.120> testing<00:05:41.659> and<00:05:41.900> now<00:05:42.169> we<00:05:42.229> can<00:05:42.620> get<00:05:42.800> such

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:43.069 
now it's testing and now we can get such

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:44.589 
now it's testing and now we can get such
a<00:05:43.099> business<00:05:43.400> no<00:05:44.030> one<00:05:44.180> can<00:05:44.330> see<00:05:44.479> the
