00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
might be a test question it was a test

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.890 
might be a test question it was a test
question<00:03:13.319> why<00:03:13.469> of<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.829> school<00:03:14.480> so<00:03:15.480> you<00:03:15.569> take

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
question why of the school so you take

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.080 
question why of the school so you take
in<00:03:16.139> the<00:03:16.500> a.m.<00:03:17.010> okay<00:03:17.819> for<00:03:18.180> diuretics<00:03:20.090> there's

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
in the a.m. okay for diuretics there's

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.699 
in the a.m. okay for diuretics there's
going<00:03:21.239> to<00:03:21.299> be<00:03:21.389> an<00:03:21.569> increased<00:03:22.290> risk<00:03:22.859> for

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
going to be an increased risk for

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.899 
going to be an increased risk for
orthostatic<00:03:25.709> hypotension<00:03:27.019> we<00:03:28.019> call<00:03:28.229> syncope

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:28.909 
orthostatic hypotension we call syncope

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.610 
orthostatic hypotension we call syncope
just<00:03:29.909> a<00:03:30.030> fainting<00:03:30.419> spell<00:03:30.479> when<00:03:31.109> they<00:03:31.290> change

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
just a fainting spell when they change

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.699 
just a fainting spell when they change
positions<00:03:32.159> too<00:03:32.459> quickly<00:03:32.900> so<00:03:33.900> that<00:03:34.409> is<00:03:34.680> a

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
positions too quickly so that is a

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.000 
positions too quickly so that is a
safety<00:03:35.280> concern<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.299> fall<00:03:36.569> precaution<00:03:37.290> in

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
safety concern and a fall precaution in

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.309 
safety concern and a fall precaution in
the<00:03:38.250> hospital<00:03:38.760> so<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:39.659> might<00:03:39.810> be<00:03:39.989> something

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
the hospital so that might be something

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.140 
the hospital so that might be something
you<00:03:40.500> might<00:03:40.530> want<00:03:40.889> to<00:03:40.949> add<00:03:41.129> in<00:03:41.489> on<00:03:41.790> your<00:03:41.970> plan<00:03:42.120> of

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
you might want to add in on your plan of

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.719 
you might want to add in on your plan of
care<00:03:42.479> for<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.959> patient<00:03:43.349> they<00:03:44.099> are<00:03:44.129> on<00:03:44.430> all

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:44.729 
care for the patient they are on all

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:47.360 
care for the patient they are on all
precautions<00:03:45.680> so<00:03:46.680> they're<00:03:47.129> going<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.310> be

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
precautions so they're going to be

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.309 
precautions so they're going to be
getting<00:03:47.579> up<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:47.849> go<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.329> potty<00:03:48.599> a<00:03:48.959> lot

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
getting up to go to the potty a lot

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.939 
getting up to go to the potty a lot
because<00:03:50.280> we<00:03:50.489> gave<00:03:50.669> it<00:03:50.819> in<00:03:50.909> the<00:03:51.030> a.m.<00:03:51.799> so<00:03:52.799> there

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
because we gave it in the a.m. so there

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:56.330 
because we gave it in the a.m. so there
might<00:03:53.069> be<00:03:53.099> an<00:03:53.310> increased<00:03:53.759> risk<00:03:53.970> for<00:03:54.180> hype<00:03:55.340> what

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
might be an increased risk for hype what

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.899 
might be an increased risk for hype what
is<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.519> sick<00:03:56.790> of<00:03:56.939> you<00:03:57.030> okay<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:58.680> obviously<00:03:59.459> I

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
is it sick of you okay and obviously I

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:01.969 
is it sick of you okay and obviously I
didn't<00:04:00.299> know<00:04:00.359> what<00:04:00.449> the<00:04:00.540> last<00:04:00.659> one<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:01.409> put<00:04:01.650> so

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:01.979 
didn't know what the last one to put so

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.399 
didn't know what the last one to put so
cigarettes<00:04:02.639> don't<00:04:02.909> do<00:04:03.120> cigarettes<00:04:03.569> and

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
cigarettes don't do cigarettes and

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.439 
cigarettes don't do cigarettes and
obviously<00:04:04.909> smoking<00:04:05.909> is<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.060> contraindication

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
obviously smoking is a contraindication

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:09.410 
obviously smoking is a contraindication
and<00:04:07.199> a<00:04:07.799> risk<00:04:08.009> factor<00:04:08.189> for<00:04:08.459> nearly

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
and a risk factor for nearly

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.309 
and a risk factor for nearly
everything<00:04:09.780> in<00:04:10.050> the<00:04:10.200> hospital<00:04:10.709> or<00:04:11.040> everything

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
everything in the hospital or everything

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.599 
everything in the hospital or everything
in<00:04:13.319> terms<00:04:13.560> of<00:04:13.680> diagnosis<00:04:14.310> is<00:04:14.489> so<00:04:16.340> so<00:04:17.340> there's

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
in terms of diagnosis is so so there's

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.030 
in terms of diagnosis is so so there's
diuretics<00:04:18.269> for<00:04:18.510> you<00:04:18.630> that's<00:04:19.470> what<00:04:19.769> you<00:04:19.919> have

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
diuretics for you that's what you have

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.970 
diuretics for you that's what you have
to<00:04:20.160> do<00:04:20.310> when<00:04:20.549> you<00:04:20.639> give<00:04:20.790> their<00:04:21.000> emetics<00:04:21.980> well

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
to do when you give their emetics well

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.730 
to do when you give their emetics well
that<00:04:23.130> helps<00:04:23.400> a<00:04:23.430> little<00:04:23.550> bit
