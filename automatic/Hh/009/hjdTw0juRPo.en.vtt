that<00:00:40.140> most<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.430> flour<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:42.120> mixed<00:00:42.450> in

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
that most of the flour is mixed in

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.160 
that most of the flour is mixed in
together

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
together

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.470 
together
you<00:00:43.440> don't<00:00:43.649> want<00:00:43.829> white<00:00:44.430> lumps<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.879> flour<00:00:45.059> to

up<00:00:45.570> opinions<00:00:46.020> at<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> end

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
up opinions at the end

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.430 
up opinions at the end
so<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.719> dough<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:48.989> going<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.200> be<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> bit

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
so this dough is going to be a bit

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.410 
so this dough is going to be a bit
stiffer<00:00:49.829> than<00:00:50.070> normal<00:00:50.670> cookie<00:00:50.969> dough<00:00:51.120> don't

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
stiffer than normal cookie dough don't

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.660 
stiffer than normal cookie dough don't
be<00:00:51.510> alarmed<00:00:51.660> it's<00:00:51.899> fine<00:00:52.110> at<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.379> point<00:00:52.739> put

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
be alarmed it's fine at this point put

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.389 
be alarmed it's fine at this point put
in<00:00:53.820> our<00:00:53.969> one<00:00:54.539> egg<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.020> then<00:00:55.559> just<00:00:55.829> mix<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.250> so

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
in our one egg and then just mix it so

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.590 
in our one egg and then just mix it so
it's<00:00:56.520> all<00:00:56.670> fully<00:00:57.090> incorporated<00:00:57.690> together<00:00:59.600> so

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
it's all fully incorporated together so

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.830 
it's all fully incorporated together so
the<00:01:00.690> eggs<00:01:00.870> going<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.170> act<00:01:01.350> as<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.710> binding<00:01:02.609> agent

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
the eggs going to act as a binding agent

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.649 
the eggs going to act as a binding agent
for<00:01:04.250> your<00:01:05.250> flour<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.850> your<00:01:05.909> Nutella<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.510> it

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
for your flour and your Nutella and it

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.700 
for your flour and your Nutella and it
will<00:01:06.780> go<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.229> lot<00:01:07.650> harder<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.460> mix<00:01:09.320> so<00:01:10.320> all<00:01:10.560> your

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
will go a lot harder to mix so all your

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.010 
will go a lot harder to mix so all your
flour<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.310> fully<00:01:11.729> incorporated<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.840> can't

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
flour is fully incorporated you can't

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.050
