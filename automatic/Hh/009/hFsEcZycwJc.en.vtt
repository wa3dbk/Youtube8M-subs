00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
 good I am a person who goes from 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.350
 getting your hair combed to make 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.210
 a video and today has come to talk about my 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.600
 complicated love-hate relationship with him 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.600
 already today 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.199
 good so you do not know, I 'm the 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.199
 representation of relationships 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.150
 homosexuals between two men who 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.840
 does within an anime or a manga and 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.220
 those Japanese things of geeks and those 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.329
 things although I would be surprised if there 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.560
 someone who did not know I'm talking 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.750
 right now because most of my 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.790
 followers are yours is the estate a 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.800
 stop today as I like and today guys 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.180
 that it gets if they are ship or it came out 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.129
 well I do not understand why because to me 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.469
 I've never liked it and today it's a bit 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.350
 incongruous but life does not matter 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.300
 of mysterious total that as of causes 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.100
 alien to me I public very simple 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.170
 they are always asking me are you a ship 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.239
 or are you I think it's the passive guy and 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.219
 I got the active kid super safe and 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.539
 super macho and such and it is me 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.269
 asking that I am a kobe that I am 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.609
 Yes, I do like the one today 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.260
 what is my favorite key and when I say 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.569
 that I do not like the already today by the people 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.309
 like he got his neck a little and 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:07.470
 now is a good time to make a 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.720
 video of the topic because suddenly I do not know 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.000
 why the stars of the 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.200
 universe and they have thrown their light on me or 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.479
 some weird thing 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.640
 and I 've started to see things and today I do not 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.799
 blame me I'm very badly influenced by 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.090
 my friends and friends reasons for the 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.700
 which has never liked me and today as a 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.350
 see first in most of the more 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.479
 famous and best known always 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.100
 follows the same structure one that and one 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.569
 A very clear division is made 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.700
 between two roles and that's something that to me 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.079
 I do not like anything I am I am please 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.120
 that relations between homosexuals 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.730
 have to be cataloged 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.370
 a system in which one is the one that leads 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.540
 the pants the one that orders things and 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.850
 Another one is the one who has to obey 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.740
 left as well as compare it to the system 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.690
 traditional relationship a hundred years ago 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.310
 years between a man and a woman and for 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.690
 we have talked so much and so much the same 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.190
 so much nonsense in the end we are going to finish 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.110
 doing the same thing in this way the 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.030
 division between ucsm has always 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.410
 seemed like real bullshit and it 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.850
 takes this to the extremes this already today 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.290
 that I have never liked otherwise 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.630
 the story always seems a bit silly 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.120
 that is to say a ship that is very shy and 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.270
 such and such and a seme that goes to sac a por 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.980
 him and the look that screams and screams or a 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.230
 design this can not be because both 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.250
 we are men and that is very bad and such and 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.510
 which and those things that you like so much 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.940
 the Japanese because the Japanese are 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.530
 very yours and they like very strange things and 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.790
 one of the two the relationship has to 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.320
 suffer and have to scream that I do not 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.640
 like while actually enjoys 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.750
 a bitch that does not take away either 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.760
 on our site I have come to see 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.170
 couples in reality in which one is 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.120
 has cataloged as that and another as 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.510
 they acted to me like that in reality they had 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.510
 inside 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.170
 happy to do what I want 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.760
 I find it wonderful but honestly 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.349
 to me like it gives me a little bit of 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.640
 total repelus that way we have 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.840
 a series that are always the same 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.150
 they always follow the same structure 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.090
 always what is just as stupid 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.680
 he always looks the same as chulito and 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.720
 always that division between ok I got that 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.040
 I do not like anything and it seems very 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.870
 stupid really is not stupid and 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.250
 raining and today I suffer because I suffer 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.480
 because they all deserve assholes and they 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.430
 screams and paul is that is that I am everything 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.689
 assholes and have a great time many 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.280
 you will tell me that is that you have not seen such 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:05.260
 anime in which you animate different 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.430
 well then the best in one of millions 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.590
 in different see surely follow 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.389
 being just as asshole to the best 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.069
 both are super than the average thing but 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:14.379
 I still have points of 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.669
 subnormal milestone deep and apart I do not 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.349
 I am romantic I do not like 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:19.569
 romantic things in the fairy pies and 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.400
 and today it comprises 99% of cake 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.950
 fairies so as you will understand by that 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.510
 part does not attract me either, what happens 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.330
 is that I've already seen many typical animes 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.880
 how you fell atsuko and I romantic and 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.190
 etcetera but do not try I'm 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.630
 seeing not that you are and that's like I'm 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.180
 I like it a little more because, but because 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.130
 usa that is cookie then came a 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.689
 part of my life where I think 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:46.409
 nice because it's 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:46.409
 that is adorable 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.330
 but still I suffer seeing it 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.730
 I'm seeing the same as cook and I hope what 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.950
 I suffer because they are equally imbeciles 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.340
 all and is on the other hand the the 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.319
 ping and the funk service say is like 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.730
 free which is the one taking now that is 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.650
 that of the fags swimming high a series 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.450
 about fagots swimming the argument not 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.940
 has more are fags in swimsuit 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.590
 recording and that sums up the first 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.790
 the second season will go up all 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.740
 the seasons that come out in life 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.780
 because they are hawks swimming 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:19.590
 and he's already alone this time they do not 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:23.100
 nothing or do nothing because not really 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.480
 they are gay but yes because it is material for 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.220
 fan service because for the author 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.980
 say so that the fury and see it 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:33.210
 childish law of hate and weekly never 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:35.940
 do it because I like swimming 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.830
 It's not funny because I also suffer 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.890
 because I'm 99 percent of the time 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.420
 holding back my desire to scream queer 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.620
 and that's why he had a very bad time very badly 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.850
 bad because there is one thing that hooks you 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.080
 like the soap operas that you saw 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.400
 small because he has them like three 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.730
 placed the delegations hooked 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.750
 but you love me, you hook up in surf 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.210
 because a love-hate relationship is 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.190
 suffers for the last one because they seem to me 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.480
 all very close together and very ladybirds are 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.760
 more ladybugs are very pastel or if you 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.940
 they look at things pasteur osa gives me a lot of disgust 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.410
 is 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.730
 but I do not have a good time 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.340
 new ladybugs swimmers of cold 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.840
 because nagisa is a beautiful sight 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.360
 very pretty 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.660
 I think it's a lot worth it, maybe this 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.190
 be the most idiotic video made in the two 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.570
 years and a half I've been in spanish queens 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.190
 but I really wanted to talk about 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.510
 issue because I have an internal conflict 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.610
 very big with the theme of him already today 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.860
 because I see it but I suffer seeing it but 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:30.270
 I keep seeing and a very strange thing in my 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.860
 life and I needed to tell it and I do not know to 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.139
 that you tell me what you think of 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.790
 subject topic amelia today that as you live it 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.190
 because you like which one you would like to see 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.479
 favorites and you recommend some not the 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.160
 opinion about my case that is in 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.630
 especially for all that you can 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.490
 tell me - from down here in the 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.380
 comments that will be very useful for 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.060
 palliate my suffering good and you're 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.070
 that has been all that has been video 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.330
 talking about america where the 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.220
 people in two truths the ones that grind me 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.570
 like more than people in 3b of three 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.280
 Sometimes I do not like it I like people 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.139
 in doses and nothing I hope you have 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.180
 liked the video no matter how stupid 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.500
 I will talk about her today surely 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.479
 because I'm running out of topics 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.460
 conversation this topic and the topics 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.930
