00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:17.160
 boatswain 22 represents hello 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.780
 today we were lucky to take 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.550
 interview 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.190
 on my from the developers of the game assassin's 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.380
 creed by ubisoft and i have to 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.190
 speak English drive you can 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.190
 see subtitles 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.510
 well then let's go straight to the questions 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:38.050
 what new can we see in the assassin 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.060
 creed 4 in assassin's creed 4 many new 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.800
 game features are fully improved by 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.840
 compared with the previous parts but 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.250
 the main innovation is huge 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.140
 open world of the Caribbean 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.120
 you can fully control the whole 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.739
 ship and it will be an absolute novelty 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:59.410
 for players the world is completely open 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:00.820
 start the game and so well I do fool 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.680
 several missions to complete before 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.640
 than can not explore the world and because 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.220
 the beginning of the game he is not even 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.470
 assassin he starts as a pirate but with 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.970
 This he does not even have a ship but the final 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.970
 account you can follow the open world 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.320
 really interesting i can't wait 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.320
 release 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.520
 is it really interesting everyone 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:32.470
 just coming up with a new plot for 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:35.020
 assassin's creed yes we think it is 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.480
 sing is a novelty of this never 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.070
 not yet created before convenient 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.600
 gameplay cities and we have this 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.140
 big under but just the main 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.820
 the action takes place in the sea that's what 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.820
 what we have created is complete mixing 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.120
 this one can take a mission at sea and then 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.900
 return to the land and again go to sea and 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.900
 it's in one mission 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.780
 so we think that the feeling of the game 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.780
 will be completely different 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.200
 how do you think gamers will react to 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.380
 moving the main part of the game is drier and 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.380
 on the sea 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.450
 Well, I really think that the players 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.860
 it will like this setting raises 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.750
 world exploration to a new level 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.610
 people will like to look for hidden 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.890
 all fellow chests or gothic 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.209
 animals but to distant islands to people 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:36.430
 generally like to follow the territory 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:38.350
 I collected items for me personally 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.670
 loved the sea battles they 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.670
 just breathtaking 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.140
 sea ​​battles have been improved 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.470
 this time will manage the ship 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.910
 much easier who is in charge of 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.540
 assassin's musical accompaniment 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:03:02.560
 creed I myself do not know for sure ask 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:03.670
 the team can say something about 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.140
 main character 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.140
 games assassin's creed 4 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.580
 as I said, and the main character's name is 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.680
 edward keneway and he is not an assassin 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.080
 from the very beginning he will seek for himself 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:27.500
 reasons joining fraternity and he 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:29.120
 to make a choice on the way Fedor 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.190
 deeply a character outside he can 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.650
 look rude to pirates 03 it turns out 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.790
 even sweet we gave him a deeper 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.170
 thought out personality compared to 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.519
 previous characters that is in 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.090
 certain moments you give a choice 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.700
 players will mostly missions with 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.230
 linear 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:52.640
 as players worry about the amount on it 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.379
 edward play his life story 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.549
 tied up how the cake lived in the rest 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.549
 you can play as you want 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.370
 and mary fingers 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.019

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:13.810
 planning to release not sure I understood 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:17.229
 question whether you plan to release new 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:20.789
 assassin's pieces creed on you have 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.789
 in view of the new games before 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.289
 as for the plans for the future of the game, we 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:28.710
 must first know the public reaction to 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.710
 new idea 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:38.979
 so he says package only 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:39.760
 setting the black flag as you think 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:45.820
 can 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:47.410

 more it plays a big role 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:07.759
 so you could wish our viewers i 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.919

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.630
 research creative start the game you 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.490

 related to the history of piracy for example 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.270

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.919
