00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 the damn nerds need to be 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.740
 informed by that now maximum brings you 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.590
 all the news from the world of 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.420
 technology and videogames 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.490
 magnetic 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.900
 minecraft episode 1 of all the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.609
 licenses that are currently in the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.680
 market if there is one that could not 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.840
 imagine as a game focused on the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.850
 story and in the narrative besides 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.430
 tetris is minecraft but it seems that mo 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.199
 yan try the game they want to show us 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.960
 that we are wrong and that if the 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.790
 ego could film them is also 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.550
 that's why the developer study of 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.230
 Mega Pixel Success announced that a 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.300
 agreement with the company that has 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.610
 redefined the concept of adventures 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.000
 graphics to work in a game 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.100
 episodic called minecraft story mode 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.020
 that will be released during the year that 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.780
 it comes in pc consoles and devices 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.300
 mobile according to moyano story mode 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.940
 will explore the history of minecraft but 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.980
 without establishing an official canon and it will be 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.079
 one of the many interpretations of the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.910
 logic of the title based on the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.100
 player's choices we're not 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.840
 creating an official story for steve 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.329
 or explaining the world of minecraft 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.609
 in detail said the study in the ad 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:14.399
 it will simply be a fun game and 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:16.770
 we hope they are right the power of 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.649
 the mind les bold lost both arms 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.359
 40 years ago in an electrical accident and 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.640
 that event changed his life but the 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:25.709
 Technology has advanced since this week 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.479
 your future will be completely different 

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:29.759
 since it has become the first 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.649
 person with the ability to control a 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.200
 pair of robotic limbs with the 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.880
 mind thanks to neuronal surgery and 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.849
 the work of researchers in 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.069
 robotic college johns hopkins 

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:42.840
 boat controls its two new arms with 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:45.869
 freedom and you're ready to go 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.149
 to your home and try it in everyday life 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.860
 albertch and the surgeon who carried out 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.739
 the operation explained that the device 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.270
 uses algorithms that recognize certain 

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:55.739
 patterns corresponding to the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.959
 contraction of the muscles the 

00:01:55.739 --> 00:02:00.239
 communication between them and the breadth and 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:02.310
 often and then move that 

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:05.220
 information on the movement of the prosthesis 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.420
 to be able to emulate a real limb 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.550
 takes control 'even though they were 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.709
 announced with great fanfare and 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.569
 jeans stigmas were not the revolution 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.220
 of gaming I started that many expected 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.650
 especially because one of the 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.690
 most important arguments the control of 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.130
 val never arrived after several 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.170
 prototypes that were shown in 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.560
 closed events the company promised 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.510
 an important presence in the gdc of the 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.670
 next year to develop in March and 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.650
 according to certain leaks it seems that 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.630
 Val is still working on improving the 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.300
 control concept and we went through the 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.860
 2 trackpads with touch screen at 4 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.870
 Conventional buttons with a crosshead 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.239
 which in turn was replaced by a 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.130
 analog lever but according to a 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.170
 new plan it seems that the directionals 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.350
 classics will be accommodated of some 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.880
 way over the left trackpad vall 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.549
 knows that with the amount of game of 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.260
 platforms and action in two dimensions 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.540
 you need that control option and that's why 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.330
 seems to be looking for a place 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.370
 to the classic crosshead in March we will return 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.940
 to see what it's about for more 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.049
 information visit every day 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.090
 www.mcdonalds.com and from Monday to Friday to 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.540
 the 19 in fucking nerds by golt eric 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.180
 rock where what you listen to 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.799
 the misfits will inherit the earth and 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:23.689
 for that they need to be informed 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.689
 damn yustos in fort the ex no
