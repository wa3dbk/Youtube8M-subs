00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
creamy consistency it should look

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.830 
creamy consistency it should look
something<00:02:24.760> like<00:02:24.910> this

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.300 

the<00:02:31.840> dyes<00:02:32.050> come<00:02:32.350> in<00:02:32.470> different<00:02:32.590> colors<00:02:33.070> you

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
the dyes come in different colors you

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.970 
the dyes come in different colors you
can<00:02:33.340> get<00:02:33.700> black<00:02:34.390> blue<00:02:34.960> black<00:02:35.230> I<00:02:35.410> think<00:02:35.680> and

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
can get black blue black I think and

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.650 
can get black blue black I think and
dark<00:02:36.370> brown<00:02:36.610> I<00:02:36.850> prefer<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.210> use<00:02:37.330> dark<00:02:37.600> brown

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
dark brown I prefer to use dark brown

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.750 
dark brown I prefer to use dark brown
and<00:02:38.110> I<00:02:38.650> will<00:02:38.800> generally<00:02:39.220> start<00:02:39.520> with<00:02:39.550> my

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
and I will generally start with my

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.660 
and I will generally start with my
eyebrows<00:02:40.240> first<00:02:40.540> oh<00:02:40.960> well<00:02:41.470> because<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:42.160> dye

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
eyebrows first oh well because the dye

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.900 
eyebrows first oh well because the dye
does<00:02:43.120> continue<00:02:43.960> to<00:02:43.990> darken<00:02:44.770> once<00:02:45.730> you've

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
does continue to darken once you've

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.120 
does continue to darken once you've
mixed<00:02:46.120> it<00:02:46.420> together<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:47.260> I'll<00:02:47.470> use<00:02:47.770> it<00:02:47.800> on<00:02:47.980> my

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
mixed it together so I'll use it on my

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.830 
mixed it together so I'll use it on my
eyebrows<00:02:48.580> first<00:02:48.970> because<00:02:49.240> I<00:02:49.300> don't<00:02:49.360> want<00:02:49.750> my

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
eyebrows first because I don't want my

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.470 
eyebrows first because I don't want my
eyebrows<00:02:50.170> to<00:02:50.320> be<00:02:50.410> too<00:02:50.710> dark<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.480> then

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
eyebrows to be too dark and then

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.690 
eyebrows to be too dark and then
secondly<00:02:53.170> I<00:02:53.230> will<00:02:53.620> do<00:02:53.740> my<00:02:53.980> eyelashes<00:02:54.550> because

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
secondly I will do my eyelashes because

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.150 
secondly I will do my eyelashes because
I<00:02:55.060> prefer<00:02:55.390> my<00:02:55.630> hours<00:02:55.990> just<00:02:56.110> to<00:02:56.380> keep<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:56.950> black
