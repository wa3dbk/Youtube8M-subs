now<00:00:00.210> the<00:00:00.269> frame<00:00:00.630> that<00:00:00.810> we've<00:00:00.930> created<00:00:01.230> needs<00:00:02.010> a

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
now the frame that we've created needs a

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.970 
now the frame that we've created needs a
way<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.340> stand<00:00:02.820> up<00:00:03.060> onto<00:00:03.720> the<00:00:04.380> base<00:00:04.620> of<00:00:04.890> our

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
way to stand up onto the base of our

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.030 
way to stand up onto the base of our
stage<00:00:05.339> so<00:00:06.180> I'm<00:00:06.270> going<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.420> show<00:00:06.600> you<00:00:06.690> how<00:00:06.870> to

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 
stage so I'm going to show you how to

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.270 
stage so I'm going to show you how to
make<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.719> make<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.750> wooden<00:00:10.170> sticks<00:00:10.559> go<00:00:10.860> inside

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
make a make the wooden sticks go inside

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.339 
make a make the wooden sticks go inside
the<00:00:11.639> corrugated<00:00:12.059> paper<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.840> that<00:00:13.080> will

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
the corrugated paper and that will

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.640 
the corrugated paper and that will
create<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.920> stand<00:00:14.639> in<00:00:15.330> order<00:00:15.660> for<00:00:16.020> us<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.350> stick

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
create a stand in order for us to stick

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.300 
create a stand in order for us to stick
inside<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.640> base<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.090> stage<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:18.770> if<00:00:19.770> we

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
inside the base of the stage so if we

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.029 
inside the base of the stage so if we
cut<00:00:20.699> our<00:00:20.850> strips<00:00:20.970> correctly<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.740> lines

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
cut our strips correctly the the lines

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.650 
cut our strips correctly the the lines
of<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.460> corrugated<00:00:23.910> paper<00:00:24.150> should<00:00:24.600> be

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
of the corrugated paper should be

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.189 
of the corrugated paper should be
running<00:00:25.140> along<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.010> length<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.000> strip<00:00:27.330> so

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
running along the length of the strip so

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.569 
running along the length of the strip so
I<00:00:28.260> have<00:00:28.590> room<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.609> take<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.390> thin<00:00:31.309> skewer<00:00:32.309> and

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
I have room to take a thin skewer and

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.049 
I have room to take a thin skewer and
put<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.210> inside<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.280> opening<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
put it inside the the opening of the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.049 
put it inside the the opening of the
corrugated<00:00:36.360> paper<00:00:37.250> what<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.280> first<00:00:38.550> want<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.879> do

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
corrugated paper what I first want to do

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.610 
corrugated paper what I first want to do
is<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.360> don't<00:00:39.420> want<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.750> use<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.079> full<00:00:40.350> length

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
is I don't want to use the full length

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.340 
is I don't want to use the full length
of<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.640> stick<00:00:42.120> it's<00:00:42.360> not<00:00:42.540> necessary<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.260> I'm

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
of the stick it's not necessary so I'm

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.250 
of the stick it's not necessary so I'm
going<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.710> cut<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:43.980> piece<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.989> I'm<00:00:45.989> going<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.170> be

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
going to cut a piece and I'm going to be

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.220 
going to cut a piece and I'm going to be
left<00:00:46.500> with<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> piece<00:00:46.950> probably<00:00:47.520> about<00:00:48.230> five

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
left with a piece probably about five

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.779 
left with a piece probably about five
inches<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.579> good<00:00:50.730> size<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:52.219> I<00:00:53.219> cut<00:00:53.520> two

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
inches is a good size and I cut two

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.060 
inches is a good size and I cut two
sticks<00:00:54.180> like<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:57.289> and<00:00:58.289> then<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.469> go<00:00:58.620> ahead<00:00:58.739> and

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
sticks like that and then I go ahead and

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:07.730 
sticks like that and then I go ahead and
stick<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.520> inside<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.030> corrugated<00:01:00.780> paper<00:01:06.740> if

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
stick it inside the corrugated paper if

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.109 
stick it inside the corrugated paper if
you<00:01:07.920> have<00:01:08.010> trouble<00:01:08.310> getting<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.820> if<00:01:09.090> you

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
you have trouble getting it in if you

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.969 
you have trouble getting it in if you
didn't<00:01:09.420> use<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.630> thick<00:01:10.020> enough<00:01:10.260> corrugated

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
didn't use a thick enough corrugated

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.000 
didn't use a thick enough corrugated
paper<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.460> can<00:01:11.640> twist<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:13.200> stick<00:01:13.530> back<00:01:13.770> and

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
paper you can twist the stick back and

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.460 
paper you can twist the stick back and
forth<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.490> it'll<00:01:14.729> slide<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.270> or<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.320> just

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
forth and it'll slide in or you can just

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.550 
forth and it'll slide in or you can just
press<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.950> down<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> hard<00:01:17.970> surface

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
press it down on to a hard surface

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.520 
press it down on to a hard surface
because<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:21.090> stick<00:01:21.840> should<00:01:22.170> fit<00:01:22.500> right

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
because the the stick should fit right

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.490 
because the the stick should fit right
into<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.450> run<00:01:24.450> along<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.869> lines<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
into the run along the lines of the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.810 
into the run along the lines of the
corrugated<00:01:25.740> paper<00:01:25.950> you've<00:01:26.340> enough<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.670> worry

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
corrugated paper you've enough to worry

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.410 
corrugated paper you've enough to worry
about<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.920> pushing<00:01:28.920> itself<00:01:29.189> out<00:01:29.520> or<00:01:29.759> tearing

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
about it pushing itself out or tearing

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.630 
about it pushing itself out or tearing
the<00:01:30.540> frame<00:01:32.540> so<00:01:33.540> we<00:01:33.630> put<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.070> high<00:01:35.070> enough<00:01:35.340> so

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
the frame so we put it in high enough so

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.730 
the frame so we put it in high enough so
that<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:36.000> creates<00:01:36.390> it'll<00:01:36.930> be<00:01:37.020> sturdy<00:01:37.409> it'll

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
that it creates it'll be sturdy it'll

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.539 
that it creates it'll be sturdy it'll
create<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.070> nice<00:01:38.220> base<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:41.159> should<00:01:41.400> have

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
create a nice base and we should have

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.179 
create a nice base and we should have
enough<00:01:41.790> left<00:01:42.060> out<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:43.110> be<00:01:43.229> able<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.500> stick<00:01:43.799> into

enough left out to be able to stick into

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.359 
enough left out to be able to stick into
the<00:01:44.399> base<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:45.000> stage<00:01:45.829> it's<00:01:46.829> important

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
the base of the stage it's important

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.399 
the base of the stage it's important
that<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.210> part<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.899> stick<00:01:49.170> that's

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
that the part of the stick that's

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.590 
that the part of the stick that's
sticking<00:01:49.649> out<00:01:49.860> should<00:01:50.340> be<00:01:50.490> both<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.479> them

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
sticking out should be both of them

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.560 
sticking out should be both of them
should<00:01:51.810> be<00:01:51.840> even<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.950> frame<00:01:53.570> stands

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
should be even so that the frame stands
