00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello to all you are back on apple style and after seeing the video 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.649
 unboxing now let's take a look at the first features 

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:13.149
 of the ekland and above all to the first impressions that this device 

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:14.309
 if he gave 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.810
 then it is the interface is very similar to the reform in fact mountain mount 

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:22.999
 the same operating system is therefore very fast and very simple 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:24.220
 to use 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.490
 ne hammer meanwhile I have already installed several applications, some are native 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.540
 for water well some are taken from hyfoama 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.030
 and for the uninitiated the phone applications can work on ipad 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.030
 weight of I make an example come to the fly 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.780
 here it is 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.710
 we can practically experience them in real size as it would be alone 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.560
 iPhone screen or we can click on this 2x button 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.650
 to zoom to fit them in full screen 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.230
 this thing not only on some applications is very good 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.850
 and instead they are high 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.100
 especially those that contain a lot of text make the image look a lot 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.290
 grainy r not very pleasant to see 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.530
 instead, as far as the basic applications were concerned, they were all 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.380
 completely redesigned well prada and to adapt to its new interface 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.740
 easy erection someone this is the calendar can be organized by month 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.460
 week day 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.820
 and it is very well done 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.679
 all applications that open in a way 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:32.090
 very fast 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.610
 this is strong 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.260
 we are going to open a website 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.189
 in particular caf conf workers. org also the site 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.280
 made by me and we can see that the pinch-to-zoom 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.680
 it is true there are 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.660
 page rendering 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.660
 It's absolutely fast 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.920
 has a fluidity 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.640
 very very good 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.260
 here it is 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.650
 obviously on this device the flash sites and not seen but this one 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.970
 is a problem that 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.149
 users of aifon and epodi itaca already know very well 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.309
 then the application which for many will be very interesting 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:18.439
 it's called facebook sa pc lets you read books 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.539
 directly on the panda delay screen 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:22.729
 here it is 

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:26.489
 the book page I try to work hard to make you see better 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.729
 and here we have a very very nice chance to see 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:31.559
 to browse the page 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:32.969
 directly 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.969
 as if it were a real book 

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:42.279
 very nice this thing I am not a great reader but I appreciate it 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:49.049
 images is another application made very very well and remembers you photo in 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:49.869
 how much 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:54.299
 there was display on album events places and also many 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:56.779
 to be and to have 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:59.779
 the speed 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.769
 that is this cute effect to keep your fingers away for 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.119
 check 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:12.369
 to what's on the album 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:15.389
 the photos can be seen 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:20.119
 horizontally and vertically here too the zoom of the very fast 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:25.359
 and this was it 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.129
 photo application 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.430
 the hunchback also works very well the video loads when it is available 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.229
 in hd 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:35.819
 and the quality is very very good 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.819
 let's see if I can show myself 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.819
 something 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.059
 claudio baraldi clown fish integral 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:55.059
 heidi is very very very much 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:02.769
 some 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.279
 funny videos 

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:07.689
 we leave them for later 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:11.879
 then hotmail is another application that works really well there we have it 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.329
 chance to see 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.819
 Inboxes send emails all at an incredible speed 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:21.819
 I think even faster than the computer 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.999
 I'll show you 

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:26.460
 the keyboard 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.040
 that vertically and of this size quite compact 

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:32.580
 horizontal indexes 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.029
 I can tell you that 

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:37.370
 after 5 minutes of use I already felt at ease 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.749
 in that 

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:42.360
 it's very similar to the official apple keyboard 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.979
 the size of the keys is also not very different 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.180
 wanting to write with ipad can also be used on the same keyboard 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.180
 apple bluetooth 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.860
 for those who own it otherwise it costs 69 euros in any apple stor 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.550
 this was a small introductory look at the functions 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.919
 basic features of the ipad 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.599
