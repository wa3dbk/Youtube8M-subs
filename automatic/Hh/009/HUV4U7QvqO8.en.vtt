00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.670
 Brazilian football is very fragile. 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.609
 so that's why we end up 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.359
 discussing all of the adequacy of the 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.140
 calendar 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.480
 facing our fragility as 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.699
 administration as the business management that 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.320
 management from outside and also from within 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.540
 We have to find a 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.820
 out that we see fit with 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.649
 an exit that will solve our 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.450
 problems will not solve all 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.190
 problems solve some problems I 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.410
 I'm in favor of us 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.510
 we would benefit from what 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.210
 losses, always respecting the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.379
 peculiarities and the diversities that the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.110
 our country brings with it is for that that 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.390
 we have this possible suitability 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.050
 there are several reasons why 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.340
 windows 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.850
 the question of the transfer of athletes 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.400
 collective holidays or the possibility of 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.820
 of you having a pre season really 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.549
 is satisfactory for example gives a 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.590
 championship four weeks three weeks 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.650
 and we always have a calendar 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.650
 international in the middle of the year has canopy 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.909
 America's Cup has confederations have 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.970
 world Cup 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.060
 in the case of Brazil to be no adjustment 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.409
 which the great difficulty is that with 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.780
 competitions have to be 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.329
 parallel to club competitions with 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.450
 club competitions need to be 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.390
 stop after the competition 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.430
 selection and returns because it gives an idea of 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.649
 continuity is not suitable for in 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.600
 terms of attractiveness and is not good for 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.670
 business I was always in favor today I 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.619
 I can think about the negatives with 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.110
 the public the difficulty of voting and what 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.630
 the interest of so many clubs and 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.149
 and especially the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.380
 globe that the holder of the most 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.000
 I do not see how the clubs will 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.640
 get 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.080
 rationalize their brands without inserting 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.430
 national competition the main 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.770
 brazil's competition 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.420
 in this international context the clubs 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.640
 Brazilians want to be top clubs 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.480
 clubs that are at the heart of the 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.520
 global 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.870
 We speak principal são paulo 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.580
 Flemish corinthians 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.640
 the big Brazilian clubs need 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.730
 playing with European clubs if they do not 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.820
 compliance with the European calendar 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.920
 will be sent in to practice will do this 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.810
 How are we going to work in July? 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.620
 if the competition is on fire and 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.600
 July 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.510
 how are we going to play in malaysia or 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.100
 in Australia was good with a signal in that 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.940
 moment I say what I'm in pre 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.880
 season 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.989
 we are at full steam ending 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.120
 suddenly a competition like the 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.220
 liberators in June and finished 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.650
 Brazilian at full steam then I 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.959
 I think so we do not change the 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.790
 championship for the European model as 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.360
 Let's do to internationalize the 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.980
 brand 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.530
 I presented it here today for example. 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.300
 as the first grown in terms of 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.910
 right to market 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.860
 is the fastest growing region 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.570
 to prevent and of course that this is 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.730
 directed to the clubs we have to 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.959
 think if we will not change the calendar 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.440
 if it will continue from January to 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.239
 December in how to boost the return 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.880
 competitions in the international market 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.430
 important the following is to play the way 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.260
 that much playing in this scenario of 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.269
 world football now I have concern 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.430
 because there is the interest of flamengo 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.010
 team of several clubs and federations 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.140
 changes of the calendar 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.540
 do not worry is that this calendar 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.180
 that is from January to December. 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.700
 people change now and platini take over 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.530
 example 2015 fifa starts working 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.840
 in this project plan and he has already 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:47.049
 interview saying that this idea of ​​him 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.049
 is it good is good to have your feet on the ground
