qualities like okay so we're just like
in<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.560> back<00:02:17.740> roads<00:02:17.980> nine<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.580> couple<00:02:18.940> of

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
in the back roads nine a couple of

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.610 
in the back roads nine a couple of
little<00:02:19.270> bumps<00:02:19.450> here<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:19.840> there<00:02:19.960> it's<00:02:20.260> not<00:02:20.320> too

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
little bumps here and there it's not too

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.990 
little bumps here and there it's not too
bad<00:02:20.830> now<00:02:21.070> roughest<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:21.580> back<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:21.880> wasn't

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
good torquey engine as I was saying it's

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.089

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.020 

that's<00:03:01.070> not<00:03:01.250> too<00:03:01.400> bad

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.540 

60<00:03:07.930> miles<00:03:08.110> driver<00:03:08.560> then<00:03:08.980> take<00:03:09.190> too<00:03:09.340> long<00:03:09.490> to

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
60 miles driver then take too long to

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.130 
60 miles driver then take too long to
get<00:03:09.819> there

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.490 

this<00:03:12.830> obviously<00:03:13.190> goes<00:03:13.430> without<00:03:13.700> saying

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
this obviously goes without saying

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.809 
this obviously goes without saying
compared<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:15.620> a<00:03:15.650> normal<00:03:15.920> car<00:03:16.280> like<00:03:16.459> a<00:03:16.490> Monday

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
compared to a normal car like a Monday

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.270 
compared to a normal car like a Monday
or<00:03:16.970> a<00:03:17.120> focus<00:03:17.630> it's<00:03:18.230> not<00:03:18.380> going<00:03:18.530> to<00:03:18.590> pull<00:03:18.800> half

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
or a focus it's not going to pull half

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.650 
or a focus it's not going to pull half
as<00:03:19.459> hard<00:03:19.670> because<00:03:20.000> obviously<00:03:20.180> it's<00:03:20.450> a<00:03:20.480> big

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
as hard because obviously it's a big

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.520 
as hard because obviously it's a big
heavy<00:03:20.840> pickup<00:03:21.230> job<00:03:21.470> but

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
heavy pickup job but

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.260 
heavy pickup job but

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
you know pulling karna is quite good you

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.970 
you know pulling karna is quite good you
can<00:03:24.420> always<00:03:24.690> choose<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:24.930> have<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.290> 3.2<00:03:25.950> liter

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
can always choose to have the 3.2 liter

and turbo diesel as well which would

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.090 
and turbo diesel as well which would
obviously<00:03:27.870> become<00:03:28.170> popular<00:03:28.500> target<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:28.920> lot
