00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.960
 sau 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.990

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.410

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.330
 artillery principle developers have long and 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.679
 a long time ago you knew that you were not 18 at all 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.260
 Historical as Fri-Sau 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.020

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.110
 which used to be the priest is no longer 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.660
 Historical I am artillery as speaks 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.600
 wargaming and therefore we will now have 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.680
 here is this new tanchik you 18 hm7 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:56.239
 the former t18 what do we have to do 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.739
 how not to cry about the king of the list 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.859
 t18 because he was just king 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.460
 seriously at his level he was just 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.770
 mega apn them Tajik especially in 2012 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.380
 For years, he just tore at each other 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.380
 uncomprehending beginners and schoolchildren 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.330
 who tried to play on the little ones 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.090
 tanchiki and whom she just van joking 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.630
 and took away but let's talk about 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.420
 current t18 hm7 which is artillery and 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.880
 let 's sort it out tth little by little first 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.750
 punch and he will have 38 millimeters 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.360
 average damage per shot 175 dpm 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.509
 we will be 1166 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.430
 damage module 100 recharge time 9 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.140
 seconds with one hundred percent crew 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.680
 rate of fire seven shells per minute 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.110
 firing accuracy of 0.65 guys here in 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.820
