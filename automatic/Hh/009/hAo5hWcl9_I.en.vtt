00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
I'd show the stunt plane it's pretty

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.620 
I'd show the stunt plane it's pretty
awesome<00:00:14.309> it's<00:00:14.849> actually<00:00:15.150> pretty<00:00:15.330> difficult

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
close

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.220 
close
so<00:00:35.550> yeah<00:00:35.670> different<00:00:36.480> thing<00:00:36.630> about<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.990> planes

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
so yeah different thing about the planes

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.100 
so yeah different thing about the planes
in<00:00:37.440> GTA<00:00:37.800> 5<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.820> fact<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.810> planes

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
in GTA 5 is the fact that the planes

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.830 
in GTA 5 is the fact that the planes
actually<00:00:40.830> like<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:41.670> feel<00:00:41.700> them<00:00:42.150> hit<00:00:42.510> by

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
actually like you can feel them hit by

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.200 
actually like you can feel them hit by
you<00:00:43.620> know<00:00:43.770> pockets<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.580> air<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.880> things<00:00:45.090> like

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
you know pockets of air and things like

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.020 
you know pockets of air and things like
that<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.960> you'll<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.950> kind<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.520> flying<00:00:47.700> along

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
that so you'll be kind of flying along

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.400 
that so you'll be kind of flying along
and<00:00:48.180> then<00:00:48.270> you'll<00:00:48.390> suddenly<00:00:48.540> blow<00:00:48.870> you're

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
and then you'll suddenly blow you're

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.000 
and then you'll suddenly blow you're
suddenly<00:00:49.620> like<00:00:50.180> it<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.420> you're<00:00:51.780> just

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
suddenly like it like that you're just

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.470 
suddenly like it like that you're just
your<00:00:53.010> plane<00:00:53.220> will<00:00:53.370> move<00:00:53.580> and<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.300> basically

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
your plane will move and it basically

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.290 
your plane will move and it basically
means<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.770> fly<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.040> a<00:00:56.160> straight<00:00:56.220> line<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.790> near

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
means to fly in a straight line is near

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.880 
means to fly in a straight line is near
impossible<00:00:57.330> I'm<00:00:57.989> not<00:00:58.140> controlling<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.710> right

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
impossible I'm not controlling it right

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.830 
impossible I'm not controlling it right
now<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.790> the<00:00:59.910> plane<00:01:00.090> doing<00:01:00.330> it<00:01:00.420> by<00:01:00.540> itself

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
now this is the plane doing it by itself

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.960 
now this is the plane doing it by itself
because<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.620> Cross<00:01:01.860> pre<00:01:02.100> breezes<00:01:02.850> and

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
because of the Cross pre breezes and

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.450 
because of the Cross pre breezes and
things<00:01:03.180> like<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.360> so<00:01:04.020> yeah<00:01:04.949> something<00:01:05.369> to

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
things like that so yeah something to

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.370 
things like that so yeah something to
keep<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.700> mind<00:01:05.760> when<00:01:06.150> you're<00:01:06.270> flying<00:01:06.450> if

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
keep in mind when you're flying if

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.450 
keep in mind when you're flying if
you're<00:01:07.680> wondering<00:01:07.860> what<00:01:08.160> the<00:01:08.250> flight

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
you're wondering what the flight

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.219 
you're wondering what the flight
controls<00:01:08.820> felt<00:01:09.030> like<00:01:09.180> they<00:01:09.720> feel<00:01:09.930> pretty

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
controls felt like they feel pretty

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.260 
controls felt like they feel pretty
weird<00:01:10.860> actually<00:01:11.190> and<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:12.000> kind<00:01:12.060> of

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
weird actually and it's kind of

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.749 
weird actually and it's kind of
unpredictable<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:13.050> fly<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.500> mean<00:01:14.399> I'm<00:01:14.490> sure<00:01:14.520> you

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
unpredictable to fly I mean I'm sure you

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.249 
unpredictable to fly I mean I'm sure you
kind<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.090> get<00:01:15.210> used<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.570> after<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.840> while<00:01:15.869> but

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
kind of get used to it after a while but

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.710 
kind of get used to it after a while but
for<00:01:16.800> the<00:01:16.860> first<00:01:17.100> 10<00:01:17.430> minutes<00:01:17.610> or<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.030> it's<00:01:18.390> kind

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
for the first 10 minutes or so it's kind

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.359 
for the first 10 minutes or so it's kind
of<00:01:18.840> weird<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.200> me<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.619> I'm<00:01:19.830> not<00:01:20.009> quite<00:01:20.160> used<00:01:20.280> to

of weird to me and I'm not quite used to
it<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.610> let<00:01:21.149> its<00:01:21.330> power<00:01:21.570> station<00:01:22.280> resuming<00:01:23.280> its

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
it I let its power station resuming its

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.610 
it I let its power station resuming its
power<00:01:23.580> station

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.240
