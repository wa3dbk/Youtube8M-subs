 mouse zauberlehrling indulged the figure 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.859
 then I remember even before that 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.730

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:33.510

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.649
 by disney so as a gift and some 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.000
 of course, people can have community 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.850
 we make big money with it 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.070
 Of course, they also did the end effect 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.730
 and there this character is not kidding 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.320
 friends over 90 euro tasted 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.840
 unpacked just so there is then 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.690
 only a small piece of paper was at that 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.390
 you were on the e3 and that has the of 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.370
 the figure is the number of he has 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.860
 how many figures and sometime came 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.150

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.790
 I have animals of course I have animal 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.380
 on the ground because yes 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.000
 mickey mouse is seen as such 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.070
 Sign of his leather need 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.750
 us all fool friends and 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.790
 i think it's a pity that disney 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.610
 because not so many more figures 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.180
 rausgebracht because his girlfriend 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.240
 mickey mouse donald duck pluto goofy 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.180
 minniemouse daisy and what I what I 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.500
 because it would come to mind now 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.710
 but actually the figurehead of 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.170
 disney and yes there I find a bit 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.960
 pity that with the out of the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.640
 zauberlehrling only the some a figure 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.350
 but gives up front 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.000
 Nevertheless, I have them now 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.259
 brought and now I will do it once 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.570
 unpack and then we'll see 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.570
 together we have the looks like that 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.630
 then we have the map once 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:09.610
 yes, yes 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:11.500
 and then we have the fia here 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.590
 It looks like this is mickey mouse 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.330
 zauberlehrlings figur I would have ten 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.400
 still to broom such a mop 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.620
 again desired in the broadcast 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.890
 then it was or in the game there are also 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.080
 into the play of it and me but so find 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.110
 I'm definitely cool on 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.850
 any case not bad and made 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.709
 Mickey Mouse Magic apprentice figure was too 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.380
 when you started the story this one 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.239
 Micky Mouse was also introduced at home 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.920
 to be seen 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.930
 and there you already have 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.140
 can think that behind 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.720
 this figure will appear again yes 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:51.220
 friends that was the little unboxing of 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.920
 mickey mouse and so he looks can 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.410
 unfortunately only in the toolbox 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.860
 play there are up here is 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:03.250
 namely down here is just there 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.500
 always only in the torburg game was yes 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.440
 I think it's a pity that there is no world 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.940
 was when I bought the figure 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.980
 and at the checkout I thought so 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.940
 the chain determines micky mouse wonder house 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.970
 he is always on superrtl and so on 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.890
 during this time, so many happen 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.780
 Adventures in front of the customers do not even 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.880
 such a few adventures in the game 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.670
 that's what a little world does that 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.989
 weather served but now we have to 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.370

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.110
 yes, we'll see something in the future 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.120

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.280
