point all right so you put a wee bit of

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.380 
point all right so you put a wee bit of
competition<00:03:12.900> into<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.530> all<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.800> time<00:03:14.040> no<00:03:14.880> we

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
competition into it all the time no we

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.479 
competition into it all the time no we
would<00:03:15.570> usually<00:03:15.750> do<00:03:16.050> this<00:03:16.230> but<00:03:16.920> for<00:03:16.950> in<00:03:17.370> the

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
would usually do this but for in the

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.240 
would usually do this but for in the
middle<00:03:17.810> two<00:03:18.810> balls<00:03:19.110> gone<00:03:19.380> at<00:03:19.560> once<00:03:19.590> all<00:03:20.130> right

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
middle two balls gone at once all right

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.400 
middle two balls gone at once all right
so<00:03:20.790> there's<00:03:20.940> plenty<00:03:21.060> of<00:03:21.239> traffic<00:03:21.510> many

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
so there's plenty of traffic many

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.360 
so there's plenty of traffic many
collisions<00:03:22.950> many<00:03:23.250> contact<00:03:23.820> all<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.030> time
