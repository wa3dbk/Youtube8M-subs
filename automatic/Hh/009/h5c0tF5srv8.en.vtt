00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.039 
to lose so here it is and I kind of just
it<00:03:24.060> was<00:03:24.239> actually<00:03:24.569> a<00:03:24.599> blessing<00:03:24.750> in<00:03:25.019> disguise

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
it was actually a blessing in disguise

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.000 
it was actually a blessing in disguise
because<00:03:25.500> I<00:03:25.709> developed<00:03:26.389> like<00:03:27.389> I<00:03:27.859> basically<00:03:28.859> got

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
because I developed like I basically got

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.059 
because I developed like I basically got
to<00:03:29.160> just<00:03:29.340> be<00:03:29.519> me<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:30.090> then<00:03:30.840> just<00:03:30.900> like<00:03:31.319> develop

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
to just be me and then just like develop

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.500 
to just be me and then just like develop
myself<00:03:32.940> as<00:03:33.329> a<00:03:33.780> as<00:03:34.260> an<00:03:34.889> entertainer<00:03:35.370> in<00:03:36.060> front

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
myself as a as an entertainer in front

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.460 
myself as a as an entertainer in front
of<00:03:36.769> everyone<00:03:37.769> and<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.220> was<00:03:38.959> terrifying<00:03:39.959> but<00:03:40.260> be

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
of everyone and it was terrifying but be

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.839 
of everyone and it was terrifying but be
probably<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.400> best<00:03:41.639> case<00:03:43.459> obviously<00:03:44.459> you<00:03:44.790> and

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
probably the best case obviously you and

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.220 
probably the best case obviously you and
AJ<00:03:45.180> started<00:03:45.449> out<00:03:45.629> together<00:03:45.780> in<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.079> same

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
AJ started out together in the same

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.740 
AJ started out together in the same
season<00:03:46.530> of<00:03:46.620> NXT<00:03:46.739> do<00:03:47.699> you<00:03:47.790> think<00:03:48.209> that<00:03:48.419> sort<00:03:48.660> of

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
season of NXT do you think that sort of

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.150 
season of NXT do you think that sort of
history<00:03:49.079> had<00:03:49.169> added<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.739> chemistry<00:03:50.099> you

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
history had added to the chemistry you

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.619 
history had added to the chemistry you
guys<00:03:50.370> have<00:03:50.549> had<00:03:50.730> in<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.000> ring<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.389> some<00:03:51.569> of

guys have had in the ring and some of

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.330 
guys have had in the ring and some of
that<00:03:51.690> intertwined<00:03:52.199> drama<00:03:52.530> that's<00:03:53.010> gone<00:03:53.310> on

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
that intertwined drama that's gone on

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.050 
that intertwined drama that's gone on
between<00:03:53.609> you<00:03:53.879> two

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
between you two
