00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
that is insane in could arguably be

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.819 
that is insane in could arguably be
turned<00:03:50.840> into<00:03:51.049> something<00:03:51.290> so<00:03:51.470> it's<00:03:51.590> like<00:03:51.709> it

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
turned into something so it's like it

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.039 
turned into something so it's like it
has<00:03:51.919> the<00:03:52.040> effect<00:03:52.280> of<00:03:52.430> crowd<00:03:52.669> control<00:03:52.909> but<00:03:53.810> it

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
has the effect of crowd control but it

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:55.780 
has the effect of crowd control but it
has<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.409> damage<00:03:54.560> of<00:03:54.799> final<00:03:55.099> round<00:03:55.280> so<00:03:55.609> it's

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
has the damage of final round so it's

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.909

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
if you found out you like this one you

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:47.980 
if you found out you like this one you
may<00:05:46.219> enjoy<00:05:46.400> the<00:05:46.699> time<00:05:46.849> on<00:05:47.060> target<00:05:47.270> and<00:05:47.630> other

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
may enjoy the time on target and other

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.390 
may enjoy the time on target and other
ones<00:05:48.139> but<00:05:48.289> this<00:05:48.440> is<00:05:48.560> definitely<00:05:48.800> the<00:05:49.219> better

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
ones but this is definitely the better

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.820 
ones but this is definitely the better
of<00:05:49.699> the<00:05:49.940> three<00:05:50.300> praedyth<00:05:51.139> is<00:05:51.380> more<00:05:51.590> close

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
of the three praedyth is more close

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.230 
of the three praedyth is more close
quarters<00:05:52.250> you<00:05:52.340> get<00:05:52.460> a<00:05:52.490> lot<00:05:52.669> of<00:05:52.699> burst<00:05:52.909> in<00:05:53.120> and

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
quarters you get a lot of burst in and

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.969 
quarters you get a lot of burst in and
you<00:05:53.360> can<00:05:53.449> kill<00:05:53.630> multiple<00:05:53.840> people<00:05:54.289> that's<00:05:54.770> one

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
you can kill multiple people that's one

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:56.379 
you can kill multiple people that's one
that<00:05:55.069> you'd<00:05:55.190> probably<00:05:55.460> prefer<00:05:55.759> on<00:05:56.090> something

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
that you'd probably prefer on something

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.180 
that you'd probably prefer on something
like<00:05:56.509> Delphi<00:05:56.930> this<00:05:57.380> one's<00:05:57.650> going<00:05:57.770> to<00:05:57.800> be<00:05:57.919> great

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
like Delphi this one's going to be great

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.399 
like Delphi this one's going to be great
in<00:05:58.340> almost<00:05:58.580> any<00:05:58.849> situation<00:05:59.029> if<00:05:59.779> you<00:06:00.110> can<00:06:00.229> land

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:00.409 
in almost any situation if you can land

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:01.689 
in almost any situation if you can land
those<00:06:00.529> precision<00:06:00.919> shots<00:06:01.130> it<00:06:01.279> can<00:06:01.370> actually<00:06:01.520> be

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:01.699 
those precision shots it can actually be

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:03.640 
those precision shots it can actually be
reliable<00:06:02.270> in<00:06:02.479> close<00:06:02.750> quarters<00:06:03.139> but<00:06:03.259> again<00:06:03.529> you

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
reliable in close quarters but again you

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.959 
reliable in close quarters but again you
need<00:06:03.860> to<00:06:04.039> land<00:06:04.219> those<00:06:04.370> precision<00:06:04.789> shots

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:04.969 
need to land those precision shots

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:06.219 
need to land those precision shots
