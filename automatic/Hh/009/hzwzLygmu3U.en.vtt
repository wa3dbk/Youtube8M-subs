during<00:00:00.570> festival<00:00:01.050> time<00:00:01.079> the<00:00:01.500> fireworks<00:00:02.040> give

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
during festival time the fireworks give

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.760 
during festival time the fireworks give
a<00:00:02.310> sense<00:00:02.580> of<00:00:02.730> celebration<00:00:03.020> they<00:00:04.020> are<00:00:04.110> red<00:00:04.350> blue

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
a sense of celebration they are red blue

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.179 
a sense of celebration they are red blue
green<00:00:05.180> sparkles<00:00:06.180> light<00:00:06.690> of<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:06.990> night<00:00:07.140> but<00:00:08.010> do

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
green sparkles light of the night but do

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.799 
green sparkles light of the night but do
you<00:00:08.280> know<00:00:08.429> how<00:00:08.639> these<00:00:08.820> different<00:00:09.300> colors<00:00:09.630> are

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
you know how these different colors are

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.049 
you know how these different colors are
obtained<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.099> because<00:00:11.400> fireworks

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
obtained this is because fireworks

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.079 
obtained this is because fireworks
contain<00:00:12.540> metal<00:00:12.990> salts<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.679> each<00:00:14.190> metal<00:00:14.639> salt

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
contain metal salts and each metal salt
