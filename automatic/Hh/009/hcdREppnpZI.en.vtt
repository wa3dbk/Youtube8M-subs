00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.699
 so that perpignan continue to watch 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.590
 to the top of the ranking 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:07.210
 it was imperative that these Catalans 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.019
 already re defeated twice this 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.460
 home season 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.930
 well it was absolutely necessary 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.820
 victory against Bayonnais who 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.019
 showed ambitious in this beginning of 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.820
 meet Bayonnais in confidence 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.140
 after their success against toulouse 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.449
 we've been playing for only four minutes 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.220
 lovobalavu in blue with colors 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.259
 bayonnaises is stopped on the line of 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.539
 22 meters Mr. Péchambert gives a 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.169
 advantage in 7 in favor of this team 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.089
 Bayonne 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.009
 mathieu belays then alert his half 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.559
 candlelight of Stephen Brett 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.180
 in the 22 meter candle captured by 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.840
 joffrey michel you hear the blow of 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.820
 whistle of the referee 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.519
 we will come back then to this 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.109
 penalty and stephen brett who replaced 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:43.059
 in this exercise shots on goal bustos 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.649
 moyano let him on the bench open the 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.730
 mark and it's bayonne in perpignan which 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.469
 leads 3 to 0 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.059
 the Catalan reaction intervenes very 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.800
 quickly three minutes from 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.690
 game after this first thomas penalty 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.879
 loulou here who offer themselves a tumbled in 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.499
 the Bayonne defense is joe rokocoko 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.879
 who finally takes over nicolas durand 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:00.100
 has followed well it will alert you all 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.839
 but worth everything is plated without a balloon 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.640
 there too, mister péchambert intervenes 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.239
 and offers james hook the opportunity 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.980
 equalize 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.810
 the Welsh opener and scorer is missing 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.000
 not three everywhere between these two teams 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.440
 then arrives the 32nd minute in this 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.570
 encounter is the most beautiful action of the 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.950
 2040 game match and madness to 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.230
 four corners of the pitch 7 goals with 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.910
 lovobalavu that alert here marvin 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.560
 o'connor back inside we find 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.420
 supporters with olive in bayonne plays 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.520
 a super nice rugby we advance on each 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.740
 impacts the Bayonne defense the 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.360
 Catalan defense and limit to 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.920
 and here marvin o'connor can not seem to 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.020
 seize this balloon unlike 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.760
 david marty turn over in favor of 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.750
 catalans and sofiane guitoune who then 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.580
 counter attack 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.620
 he first escapes two 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.420
 defenders accelerates maneuver 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.190
 perfectly his last defender but 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.750
 fuster also plays well blow it 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.300
 requires sofiane guitoune looked up 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.740
 perfect pass to the foot for his three 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.290
 center quarters is not going to succeed in getting 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.590
 grab this balloon the action is going to be 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.359
 stopped since he 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.659
 well the three quarters center is worth everything 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:58.369
 blames magnificent test action 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.539
 other high schools en route to 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.850
 this Catalan team 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.770
 james hook just before break finds 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.840
 an opportunity to offer three poles ahead 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.100
 to his team this balloon flies into the 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.080
 tunes there is a lot of wind to loved giral 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.489
 and the balloon flirts with the pole it's me 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.560
 touches even sofiane guitoune him 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.959
 perfectly followed the action and flattens 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.849
 this test on the nose and beard of the 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.739
 defense bayonnaise blow of the spell for 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.629
 this bayonne team who really 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.150
 had resisted for 40 minutes and that 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.010
 on the mermaid sees this balloon hitting the 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.470
 post and sofiane guitoune always good 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.880
 placed impeccable here register this first 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.239
 slow motion test sofiane 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.040
 guitoune 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.650
 he is on the left in the axis of the poles 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.630
 we see he does not leave the eye this 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.280
 balloon it is he who will be the first to 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.230
 able to take advantage of this rebound a little 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.780
 little capricious and therefore allow his 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.780
 team to lead to half time 10 to 3 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.150
 the wind blows with victory 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.560
 maybe back to loved giral when 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.240
 bayonne on his side sees his dreams of 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.010
 victory fly away at the return of 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.200
 cloakrooms in effect perpignan adds a 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.210
 new penalty speeds up by tom 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.640
 ecochard the scrum half-substitute of 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.380
 nicolas durand or thomas ecochard here 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.330
 crossed the line at it flattens 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.580
 Mr. Péchambert asks for the video 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.470
 idled a forward and committed by the 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.460
 young half of mêlée bayonnais the test does not 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.460
 can be validated 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.440
 part discount only for 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.090
 Catalans since on the following scrum 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.680
 two minutes later and well it's here 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.630
 narrative myth barely came into play that 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.110
 escapes from the town hall theater plati 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.580
 in the end reward finally huge 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.500
 efforts made throughout the evening 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.209
 by this Catalan team by this 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.650
 perpignan team trained by marc 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.870
 delpoux x who sees his men leading 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.670
 20-3 but who also sees his team 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.470
 relax bayonne then take advantage of it 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.510
 play the last minutes in this 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.020
 meet the match is folded 23 to 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.370
 perpignan 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.989
 it's about victory will not be 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.940
 Bayonne but the Bayonnais are going all 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.830
 give nothing to let go in the last 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.180
 Seconds bastien here fuster ago in 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.250
 end that comes to concretize and 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.840
 reward good work the good 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.280
 benefit once again from this 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.930
 Bayonnaise team who unfortunately 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.940
 needs to become again 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.550
 bow and bow on a score 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.100
 very heavy 20 to 8 final wins so 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.450
 for the Catalans ninth defeat in 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.950
 nine away matches for 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.120
 Basque who never dropped anything but 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.610
 who leave on the defensive bonus 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.200
 yet deserved in view of the meeting 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.180
 relief on the other hand Catalan side 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.140
 perpignan ends a series of five 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.120
 defeats in top 14 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.230
 a nice Christmas present of course with a 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.579
 little delay but who launches 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.579
 perfectly this year 2014
