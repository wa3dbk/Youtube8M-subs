00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.519
 hey dear friends and welcome to 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.849
 a new round / we play the 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.570
 arena arena for such a bad word 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.670
 I have not in a long time 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.850
 the cards played are called arena 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.779
 because it's an arena and I would 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.510
 Say you knew it was clear if you could do it 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.840
 not seen I did not finish 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.760
 seen 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.320
 next please and you can be her 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.820
 decisive so I assume you 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.170
 can raushauen here great money or 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.590
 you can also super cool the lava 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.100
 hew 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.210
 at least that's how it looks for me 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.329
 he supersedes the lava or super good 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.620
 rauszuhauen 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.200
 why are they both looking at me ? 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.660
 you nevertheless times each exactly the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.620
 sugar is gone clean sweet guest at the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.590

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.879
 really nice way you just fly you 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.710
 away jasper has gone away too 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.940
 not by who needs 50 again 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.260
 but this should now be at the percent 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.309
 one sugar right away or this one 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.540
 should be 1 nr 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.710
 that's how it can be bad at night that was good 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.909
 this player gremmel so the other 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.140
 is not to be underestimated 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.939
 then you can give people a relative 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.070
 Pulling away well with the out look 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.729

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.420
 just like the gambler I am now 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.549
 has hewn out by hand but 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.549
 Only when you fly for the first time 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.200
 I've done well on ex clean 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.060
 the install a porter i grab 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.320
 me briefly once I have a brief against 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.210
 hollfeld because he is in steelport actually 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.720

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.270

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.500
 you are saving just below 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.640
 have been this close 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.640
 the lava fell out of the train 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:02:03.119
 well, here's the teleport again 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:06.570
 know archery bow where is he yes 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.590
 I can see that but do it first 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.330
 It is nice the day before he did it 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.099
 flying away no no no 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.090
 this now in the can seems very 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.250
 I'm sorry to jump that well 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.760
 I met that now 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.319
 met 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.690
 Now I'm probably there again 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.760
 the meetings in the air yes yes for the first time 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.760
 away no , the cluster bomb is thrown 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.580
 Let's go 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.340
 or do you still want somehow ? 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:40.980
 mentally prepare for it if so yes 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:44.040
 completely rid it starts to go so then wait 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.580
 i will go the bow every time 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.010
 heavy 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:52.310
 I take the stone sword ok then can 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.310
 get started 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:00.799
 you fly out now we have bye 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.269
 such not on the edge because player 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.670
 kreml or rising it will be 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.299
 makes it so difficult when I'm here 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:13.819
 it does not turn on it 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:15.260
 I think like that one is finally no 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.280
 make taker takko when you display 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.319
 and charged 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:26.719
 the installer board does not even have 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:28.669
 bring and happen 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:30.290
 this is a sign almost any 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:32.290
 but I'll take a look here 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.090
 a team player 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:39.939
 euro but the movie portals somehow 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.939
 bit sorry brought 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:49.040
 good now comes a whole on 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:52.129
 should the bun I have you in the 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:58.180
 lava in the lava in the lava the lava in 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:58.180
 thank the lava in the lava 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.959
 it eliminates 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:07.759
 No but I found the card own 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.319
 I think one finds a classic arena anyway 

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:11.150
 can cut it out relatively well and it 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:15.699
 There is a lot of action I would do 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.699
 say what you say card 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.259
 well then I want to say what that then of 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.030
 this follow smash or from this round 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:27.500
 Smash you can also give me the opinion too 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.240
 Write the card in the comments 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.099
 but I would this first time 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.330
 say thank you for over 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:33.770
 hope you see this one too 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:38.750
 liked again and would say 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:40.960
 until the next time ciao people do not 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.960
 shy
