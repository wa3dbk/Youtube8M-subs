00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.570 

got<00:00:00.390> a<00:00:00.420> new<00:00:00.570> transmission<00:00:01.040> quite<00:00:02.040> badly<00:00:02.250> needs

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
got a new transmission quite badly needs

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.570 
got a new transmission quite badly needs
to<00:00:02.700> be<00:00:02.790> cleaned<00:00:03.240> so<00:00:03.449> I'm<00:00:03.629> gonna<00:00:03.980> get<00:00:04.980> her<00:00:05.100> on<00:00:05.279> it

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
to be cleaned so I'm gonna get her on it

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.270 
to be cleaned so I'm gonna get her on it
with<00:00:05.700> some<00:00:05.940> engine<00:00:06.390> degreaser<00:00:07.160> this<00:00:08.160> will

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
with some engine degreaser this will

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.959 
with some engine degreaser this will
clean<00:00:08.519> up<00:00:08.580> pretty<00:00:08.760> nicely<00:00:10.580> that's<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.790> lot

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
clean up pretty nicely that's a lot

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.999 
clean up pretty nicely that's a lot
cleaner<00:00:12.269> now<00:00:12.509> it's<00:00:13.410> certainly<00:00:13.500> not<00:00:13.769> perfect

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
cleaner now it's certainly not perfect

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.480 
cleaner now it's certainly not perfect
but<00:00:14.519> it's<00:00:15.240> even<00:00:15.389> better<00:00:15.509> than<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:15.960> was<00:00:16.020> before

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
but it's even better than it was before

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.439 
but it's even better than it was before
let's<00:00:17.490> get<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.910> putting<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.359> in<00:00:18.570> now<00:00:20.449> your

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
let's get to putting this in now your

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.300 
let's get to putting this in now your
transmissions<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.619> went<00:00:22.830> in<00:00:22.980> pretty

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
transmissions in that went in pretty

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.269 
transmissions in that went in pretty
uneventful<00:00:23.699> II<00:00:24.090> just<00:00:24.750> need<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.990> get<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.410> motor

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
uneventful II just need to get the motor

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.540 
uneventful II just need to get the motor
finish<00:00:26.789> bolting<00:00:27.119> up<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.330> motor<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:28.460> fill<00:00:29.460> the

finish bolting up the motor and fill the
transmission<00:00:30.000> with<00:00:30.119> oil<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.720> take<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.260> seal

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
transmission with oil and take the seal

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.639 
transmission with oil and take the seal
for<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.650> test-drive<00:00:33.079> here's<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> magnetic

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
for a test-drive here's the magnetic

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.160 
for a test-drive here's the magnetic
drain<00:00:34.920> plug<00:00:35.250> for<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.700> old<00:00:36.300> transmission<00:00:36.989> a

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
drain plug for the old transmission a

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.799 
drain plug for the old transmission a
little<00:00:37.410> bit<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.620> filings<00:00:38.070> on<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.370> one

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
little bit of filings on this one

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.119 
little bit of filings on this one
probably<00:00:40.070> almost<00:00:41.070> 1/8<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.489> an<00:00:41.610> inch<00:00:41.670> thick<00:00:43.129> I'm

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
probably almost 1/8 of an inch thick I'm

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.350 
probably almost 1/8 of an inch thick I'm
not<00:00:44.340> sure<00:00:44.520> if<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.700> new<00:00:44.820> transmission

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
not sure if the new transmission

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.060 
not sure if the new transmission
actually<00:00:45.600> has<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> magnetic<00:00:46.289> plug<00:00:46.710> they<00:00:46.920> took

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
actually has a magnetic plug they took

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.440 
actually has a magnetic plug they took
it<00:00:47.190> out<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.460> doesn't<00:00:47.670> feel<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.910> magnetic<00:00:48.329> at

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
it out that doesn't feel a magnetic at

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.240 
it out that doesn't feel a magnetic at
all<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.780> might<00:00:48.960> just<00:00:48.989> swap<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.590> one<00:00:49.770> in

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.939 

time<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.550> oil<00:00:53.820> now<00:00:57.379> little<00:00:58.379> secret<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.800> can

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
time for oil now little secret you can

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.660 
time for oil now little secret you can
put<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.340> through<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.699> clutch<00:01:01.670> clutch

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
put it in through this clutch clutch

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.850 
put it in through this clutch clutch
actuator<00:01:03.239> hole<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:04.019> hole<00:01:04.110> by<00:01:04.589> should<00:01:04.739> goes

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
actuator hole this hole by should goes

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.490 
actuator hole this hole by should goes
right<00:01:05.010> into<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.689> transmission<00:01:06.689> case<00:01:07.049> there's

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
right into the transmission case there's

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.899 
right into the transmission case there's
a<00:01:07.530> lot<00:01:07.590> easier<00:01:07.860> than<00:01:07.979> using<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.340> other<00:01:08.460> fill

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
a lot easier than using the other fill

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:17.390 
a lot easier than using the other fill
hole<00:01:09.119> which<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.479> around<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.650> back<00:01:10.680> there<00:01:16.400> and

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
hole which is around the back there and

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:37.280 
hole which is around the back there and
this<00:01:17.549> transmission<00:01:18.180> takes<00:01:19.220> 2.4<00:01:20.220> liters

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:55.050 

last<00:01:38.290> thing<00:01:38.440> to<00:01:38.500> do<00:01:38.680> is<00:01:38.800> put<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.420> wires<00:01:40.420> on<00:01:54.060> now

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
last thing to do is put the wires on now

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.520 
last thing to do is put the wires on now
don't<00:01:55.390> you<00:01:55.450> miss<00:01:55.600> connecting<00:01:56.050> up<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.260> engine

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
don't you miss connecting up the engine

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.730 
don't you miss connecting up the engine
were<00:01:56.650> that<00:01:56.800> easy<00:01:56.979> okay<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.840> is<00:02:01.990> all<00:02:02.140> back<00:02:02.530> in

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
were that easy okay this is all back in

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.859 
were that easy okay this is all back in
now<00:02:02.920> I<00:02:02.950> think<00:02:03.340> we're<00:02:03.460> ready<00:02:03.550> to<00:02:03.790> plug<00:02:04.630> in<00:02:04.780> the

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
now I think we're ready to plug in the

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:46.850 
now I think we're ready to plug in the
main<00:02:04.990> power<00:02:05.290> and<00:02:05.619> test<00:02:05.920> this<00:02:06.040> thing<00:02:06.190> out

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:03:16.820 

feels<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:47.950> little<00:02:48.189> bit<00:02:49.560> shaky

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:27.230 

I<00:03:24.620> just<00:03:25.620> got<00:03:25.770> back<00:03:25.950> from<00:03:26.130> a<00:03:26.220> test<00:03:26.490> drive<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:27.120> it

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
I just got back from a test drive and it

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.390 
I just got back from a test drive and it
seems<00:03:27.630> to<00:03:27.690> work<00:03:27.780> very<00:03:28.080> well<00:03:28.140> I'm<00:03:28.980> not<00:03:29.190> sure

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
seems to work very well I'm not sure

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.640 
seems to work very well I'm not sure
what<00:03:29.580> that<00:03:29.610> noise<00:03:30.480> was<00:03:30.780> earlier<00:03:31.440> when<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:31.620> was

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
what that noise was earlier when I was

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.150 
what that noise was earlier when I was
testing<00:03:32.340> it<00:03:32.780> but<00:03:33.780> doesn't<00:03:34.080> seem<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.470> appear<00:03:34.980> on

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
testing it but doesn't seem to appear on

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.930 
testing it but doesn't seem to appear on
when<00:03:35.580> on<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.330> road<00:03:36.510> I<00:03:37.040> know<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.250> shifting<00:03:38.790> was

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
when on the road I know the shifting was

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.000 
when on the road I know the shifting was
much<00:03:39.150> much<00:03:39.330> easier<00:03:39.390> I'm<00:03:40.350> not<00:03:40.560> sure<00:03:40.710> if<00:03:40.800> it<00:03:40.890> was

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
much much easier I'm not sure if it was

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.950 
much much easier I'm not sure if it was
the<00:03:41.280> new<00:03:42.110> Pennzoil<00:03:43.110> synchromesh<00:03:44.570> gearbox<00:03:45.570> oil

the new Pennzoil synchromesh gearbox oil

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.560 
the new Pennzoil synchromesh gearbox oil
that<00:03:46.350> someone<00:03:47.190> on<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.430> team<00:03:47.670> Swift<00:03:48.030> forums

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
that someone on the team Swift forums

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.510 
that someone on the team Swift forums
recommended<00:03:49.170> or<00:03:49.410> just<00:03:49.740> the<00:03:49.890> new<00:03:49.920> transmission

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
recommended or just the new transmission

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.720 
recommended or just the new transmission
but<00:03:50.700> it's<00:03:51.270> much<00:03:51.420> much<00:03:51.570> better<00:03:51.720> than<00:03:51.960> before

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
but it's much much better than before

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.340 
but it's much much better than before
ever<00:03:53.730> since<00:03:53.970> I<00:03:54.120> got<00:03:54.150> this<00:03:54.540> car<00:03:54.840> I<00:03:54.870> noticed<00:03:55.260> a

ever since I got this car I noticed a

ever since I got this car I noticed a
slight<00:03:55.500> clunking<00:03:56.220> noise<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.640> I'm<00:03:56.700> wondering

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
slight clunking noise and I'm wondering

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.600 
slight clunking noise and I'm wondering
if<00:03:57.090> this<00:03:57.800> pin<00:03:58.800> coming<00:03:59.130> up<00:03:59.190> might<00:03:59.340> have<00:03:59.459> been

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
if this pin coming up might have been

causing<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:00.720> all<00:04:00.780> along<00:04:01.020> I<00:04:01.410> was<00:04:01.950> in<00:04:02.040> asleep<00:04:02.340> I

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
causing it all along I was in asleep I

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.250 
causing it all along I was in asleep I
was<00:04:02.640> thinking<00:04:03.000> back<00:04:03.209> then<00:04:03.480> that<00:04:03.600> it<00:04:03.690> was<00:04:03.750> just

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
was thinking back then that it was just

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.620 
was thinking back then that it was just
the<00:04:04.380> wheel<00:04:04.530> bearings<00:04:04.980> but<00:04:05.220> now<00:04:06.120> I<00:04:06.150> don't<00:04:06.420> think

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
the wheel bearings but now I don't think

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.000 
the wheel bearings but now I don't think
so<00:04:08.810> anyway<00:04:09.810> at<00:04:09.930> least<00:04:09.959> a<00:04:10.230> car<00:04:10.500> is<00:04:10.680> working
