series for Quake live last time we
looked<00:00:09.040> at<00:00:09.220> half<00:00:09.490> beat<00:00:09.760> for<00:00:09.940> vql<00:00:10.360> this<00:00:10.719> time

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:10.990 
looked at half beat for vql this time

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.080 
looked at half beat for vql this time
we're<00:00:11.200> going<00:00:11.320> to<00:00:11.380> be<00:00:11.469> looking<00:00:11.620> at<00:00:11.920> pql<00:00:12.490> for

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.090 
we're going to be looking at pql for

hopping<00:00:16.000> so<00:00:16.630> let's<00:00:16.900> get<00:00:17.080> ourselves<00:00:17.200> in<00:00:17.680> to

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160

game immediately we're going to be

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.470 
game immediately we're going to be
noticing<00:00:20.140> on<00:00:20.349> our<00:00:20.619> speedometer<00:00:21.310> that<00:00:21.480> 320

base<00:00:23.080> movement<00:00:23.380> speed<00:00:23.500> exactly<00:00:24.400> what<00:00:24.550> we<00:00:24.670> were

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
base movement speed exactly what we were

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.320 
base movement speed exactly what we were
getting<00:00:24.940> on<00:00:25.619> vql<00:00:26.619> but<00:00:27.190> when<00:00:27.640> we<00:00:27.820> immediately

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
getting on vql but when we immediately

getting on vql but when we immediately
going<00:00:28.420> to<00:00:28.510> notice<00:00:28.779> when<00:00:28.930> we<00:00:28.990> do<00:00:29.289> just<00:00:29.619> the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859 
going to notice when we do just the

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.859 
going to notice when we do just the
ground<00:00:30.310> acceleration<00:00:31.000> to<00:00:31.150> what<00:00:31.300> we<00:00:31.420> did<00:00:31.600> as<00:00:31.810> we

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
ground acceleration to what we did as we

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.049 
ground acceleration to what we did as we
were<00:00:32.290> testing<00:00:32.860> for<00:00:33.160> the<00:00:33.400> circle<00:00:33.879> jump

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
were testing for the circle jump

were testing for the circle jump
originally<00:00:34.480> is<00:00:34.600> that<00:00:34.780> we're<00:00:35.440> actually

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
originally is that we're actually

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.210 
originally is that we're actually
getting<00:00:35.860> well<00:00:36.400> over<00:00:36.430> 400<00:00:37.149> EPS<00:00:38.110> and<00:00:38.410> with

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
getting well over 400 EPS and with

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.590 
getting well over 400 EPS and with
relative<00:00:39.670> ease<00:00:39.790> that's<00:00:40.180> just<00:00:40.329> by<00:00:40.420> pressing

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
relative ease that's just by pressing

500<00:00:47.920> ups<00:00:48.309> without<00:00:48.550> a<00:00:48.579> problem<00:00:48.910> which<00:00:49.030> means

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
500 ups without a problem which means

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.590 
500 ups without a problem which means
more<00:00:50.320> ground<00:00:50.710> acceleration<00:00:51.399> means<00:00:51.879> we're

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
more ground acceleration means we're

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.240 
more ground acceleration means we're
going<00:00:52.690> to<00:00:52.750> have<00:00:52.930> more<00:00:53.140> overall<00:00:53.500> ups<00:00:53.950> by<00:00:54.190> the

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
going to have more overall ups by the

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.360 
going to have more overall ups by the
time<00:00:54.520> we<00:00:54.700> finish<00:00:55.059> our<00:00:55.300> circle<00:00:55.960> jump<00:00:56.370> so

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
time we finish our circle jump so

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.490 
time we finish our circle jump so
normally<00:00:58.000> on<00:00:58.210> vql<00:00:58.750> you're<00:00:58.930> looking<00:00:59.200> for<00:00:59.379> about

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
normally on vql you're looking for about

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.430 
normally on vql you're looking for about
500<00:01:00.070> ups<00:01:00.399> in<00:01:00.870> pql<00:01:01.870> you're<00:01:02.140> going<00:01:02.320> to<00:01:02.379> be

500 ups in pql you're going to be

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.619 
500 ups in pql you're going to be
looking<00:01:02.590> for<00:01:02.890> about<00:01:02.980> 600<00:01:03.879> if<00:01:04.089> you<00:01:04.239> can<00:01:04.420> get

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
looking for about 600 if you can get

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.710 
looking for about 600 if you can get
around<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.110> 600<00:01:05.590> mark<00:01:05.770> or<00:01:06.180> 570<00:01:07.180> plus<00:01:07.450> then

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
around the 600 mark or 570 plus then

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.300 
around the 600 mark or 570 plus then
you're<00:01:08.229> actually<00:01:08.380> getting<00:01:08.649> a<00:01:08.860> really<00:01:09.130> good

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
you're actually getting a really good

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.219 
you're actually getting a really good
start<00:01:09.580> to<00:01:09.670> your<00:01:09.700> run<00:01:09.940> immediately<00:01:10.630> so<00:01:11.080> let's

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
start to your run immediately so let's

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.389 
start to your run immediately so let's
see<00:01:11.500> how<00:01:12.130> it<00:01:12.490> differs<00:01:12.910> and<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:14.590> vql<00:01:15.220> you're

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
see how it differs and in vql you're

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:16.529 
see how it differs and in vql you're
going<00:01:15.550> to<00:01:15.610> say<00:01:15.970> that<00:01:16.119> we're<00:01:16.240> going<00:01:16.330> to<00:01:16.420> be

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
going to say that we're going to be

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:19.559 
going to say that we're going to be
going<00:01:16.690> at<00:01:16.929> this<00:01:17.140> direction<00:01:17.649> and<00:01:18.149> vql<00:01:19.149> you're

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:19.569 
going at this direction and vql you're

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:21.779 
going at this direction and vql you're
generally<00:01:20.229> going<00:01:20.380> to<00:01:20.440> be<00:01:20.590> doing<00:01:21.369> a<00:01:21.520> jump<00:01:21.729> like

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
generally going to be doing a jump like

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.660 
generally going to be doing a jump like
this<00:01:22.050> you'll<00:01:23.050> be<00:01:23.080> looking<00:01:23.530> around<00:01:23.649> this<00:01:24.130> angle

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
this you'll be looking around this angle

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.100 
this you'll be looking around this angle
before<00:01:24.849> you're<00:01:25.209> turning<00:01:25.479> around<00:01:25.569> and<00:01:25.840> ending

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
before you're turning around and ending

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.710 
before you're turning around and ending
up<00:01:26.200> over<00:01:26.380> there<00:01:26.560> in<00:01:26.740> pql<00:01:27.729> you<00:01:28.060> probably<00:01:28.509> want

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
up over there in pql you probably want

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.300 
up over there in pql you probably want
to<00:01:28.750> be<00:01:28.840> turning<00:01:29.170> around<00:01:29.259> like<00:01:29.590> that<00:01:29.830> so<00:01:30.099> that

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
to be turning around like that so that

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.219 
to be turning around like that so that
you're<00:01:30.429> getting<00:01:30.550> more<00:01:30.849> time<00:01:31.090> on<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.509> floor<00:01:31.660> to

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
you're getting more time on the floor to

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.440 
you're getting more time on the floor to
use<00:01:32.470> that<00:01:32.770> ground<00:01:33.069> acceleration<00:01:33.729> there<00:01:34.330> you

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
use that ground acceleration there you

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.260 
use that ground acceleration there you
go<00:01:34.660> there's<00:01:34.840> a<00:01:34.899> circle<00:01:35.289> drive<00:01:35.440> about<00:01:35.619> 580<00:01:36.280> 580

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
go there's a circle drive about 580 580

go there's a circle drive about 580 580
UPS<00:01:38.259> don't<00:01:39.009> worry<00:01:39.160> towards<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.729> end<00:01:39.880> there

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
UPS don't worry towards the end there

UPS don't worry towards the end there
are<00:01:40.149> going<00:01:40.450> to<00:01:40.509> be<00:01:40.599> some<00:01:40.840> slo-moes<00:01:41.440> of<00:01:41.740> some<00:01:42.220> of

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
are going to be some slo-moes of some of

are going to be some slo-moes of some of
the<00:01:42.369> jumps<00:01:42.550> that<00:01:42.729> are<00:01:42.849> done<00:01:43.030> here<00:01:43.179> so<00:01:43.390> that<00:01:43.539> you

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
the jumps that are done here so that you

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.350 
the jumps that are done here so that you
guys<00:01:43.840> can<00:01:44.259> catch<00:01:44.830> a<00:01:45.099> little<00:01:45.369> slower<00:01:45.759> how<00:01:46.300> the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
guys can catch a little slower how the

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.190 
guys can catch a little slower how the
acceleration<00:01:47.140> was<00:01:47.440> acquired<00:01:47.920> on<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.429> floor

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
acceleration was acquired on the floor

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
acceleration was acquired on the floor
it's<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.259> little<00:01:50.440> bit<00:01:50.530> of<00:01:50.590> a<00:01:50.619> long<00:01:50.800> video<00:01:50.920> today

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
it's a little bit of a long video today

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.620 
it's a little bit of a long video today
so<00:01:51.250> I'm<00:01:51.489> going<00:01:51.580> to<00:01:51.640> be<00:01:51.729> moving<00:01:51.880> straight<00:01:52.300> over

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
so I'm going to be moving straight over

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.580 
so I'm going to be moving straight over
now<00:01:52.780> onto<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:53.979> strafe<00:01:54.580> differences<00:01:55.179> and

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
now onto the strafe differences and

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.160 
now onto the strafe differences and
because<00:01:56.610> hopefully<00:01:57.610> you<00:01:57.970> guys<00:01:58.149> know<00:01:58.840> how<00:01:59.110> to

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
because hopefully you guys know how to

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.139 
because hopefully you guys know how to
get<00:01:59.470> the<00:01:59.590> circle<00:01:59.890> jump<00:02:00.039> going<00:02:00.280> on<00:02:00.399> vql<00:02:00.940> the

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
get the circle jump going on vql the

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.719 
get the circle jump going on vql the
transferable<00:02:01.750> skills<00:02:02.050> there<00:02:02.289> are<00:02:02.429> it's<00:02:03.429> very

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
transferable skills there are it's very

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.460 
transferable skills there are it's very
similar<00:02:04.149> you<00:02:04.270> just<00:02:04.509> got<00:02:04.660> to<00:02:04.720> do<00:02:04.840> a<00:02:04.869> little<00:02:05.200> bit

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
similar you just got to do a little bit

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.469 
similar you just got to do a little bit
more<00:02:05.649> movement<00:02:06.250> on<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.910> floor<00:02:07.149> before<00:02:07.300> you

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
more movement on the floor before you

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.660 
more movement on the floor before you
actually<00:02:07.810> jump<00:02:07.989> itself<00:02:08.349> the<00:02:08.860> strafe<00:02:09.190> itself

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
actually jump itself the strafe itself

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.370 
actually jump itself the strafe itself
well<00:02:09.970> you're<00:02:10.479> not<00:02:10.599> going<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:10.840> be<00:02:10.899> doing<00:02:11.050> any

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
well you're not going to be doing any

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.589 
well you're not going to be doing any
half<00:02:11.709> beat<00:02:12.010> because<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:12.790> does<00:02:13.000> not<00:02:13.180> work<00:02:13.420> on

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
half beat because it does not work on

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.410 
half beat because it does not work on
these<00:02:13.750> physics<00:02:14.140> at<00:02:14.290> all<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:15.030> instead<00:02:16.030> you'd

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
these physics at all and instead you'd

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.510 
these physics at all and instead you'd
probably<00:02:16.659> end<00:02:16.870> up<00:02:17.200> do<00:02:17.349> some<00:02:17.590> kind<00:02:17.829> of<00:02:17.920> strange

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
probably end up do some kind of strange

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.570 
probably end up do some kind of strange
helping<00:02:18.880> if<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.090> were<00:02:19.210> to<00:02:19.330> try<00:02:19.570> but

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
helping if you were to try but

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.280 
helping if you were to try but
ultimately<00:02:21.580> with<00:02:22.450> strafe<00:02:22.720> jumping<00:02:23.050> you're

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
ultimately with strafe jumping you're

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.650 
ultimately with strafe jumping you're
going<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.500> be<00:02:23.590> accelerating<00:02:24.400> faster<00:02:24.820> so<00:02:25.570> you

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
going to be accelerating faster so you

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.050 
going to be accelerating faster so you
can<00:02:25.780> get<00:02:25.930> higher<00:02:26.230> speeds<00:02:26.710> and<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.820> means

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
can get higher speeds and that means

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.550 
can get higher speeds and that means
that<00:02:28.390> when<00:02:28.600> you<00:02:28.750> are<00:02:28.870> if<00:02:28.990> you<00:02:29.110> are<00:02:29.140> going<00:02:29.470> this

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
that when you are if you are going this

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.200 
that when you are if you are going this
direction<00:02:29.740> you'll<00:02:30.610> find<00:02:30.850> yourself

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
direction you'll find yourself

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.990 
direction you'll find yourself
stretching<00:02:31.900> out<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.320> lot<00:02:32.590> faster<00:02:33.160> on<00:02:33.190> pql<00:02:33.790> than

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
stretching out a lot faster on pql than

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.680 
stretching out a lot faster on pql than
you<00:02:34.090> would<00:02:34.270> on<00:02:34.420> vql<00:02:35.350> as<00:02:35.820> we<00:02:36.820> move<00:02:37.180> forward<00:02:37.390> so

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
you would on vql as we move forward so

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.100 
you would on vql as we move forward so
let's<00:02:38.350> say<00:02:38.500> that<00:02:39.420> already<00:02:40.420> you<00:02:40.720> could<00:02:40.870> tell

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
let's say that already you could tell

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.780 
let's say that already you could tell
it's<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.530> very<00:02:41.560> short<00:02:41.830> distance<00:02:42.160> but<00:02:42.640> you're

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
it's a very short distance but you're

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.370 
it's a very short distance but you're
going<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:43.000> be<00:02:43.060> moving<00:02:43.390> your<00:02:43.510> mouse<00:02:43.750> left<00:02:44.170> and

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
going to be moving your mouse left and

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.730 
going to be moving your mouse left and
right<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.770> lot<00:02:44.980> further<00:02:45.600> on<00:02:46.600> this<00:02:47.140> isn't<00:02:47.440> really

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
right a lot further on this isn't really

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.490 
right a lot further on this isn't really
that<00:02:47.890> much<00:02:48.220> of<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.460> useful<00:02:48.700> skill<00:02:49.000> on<00:02:49.390> pql<00:02:50.050> what

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
that much of a useful skill on pql what

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.050 
that much of a useful skill on pql what
you<00:02:50.620> really<00:02:51.070> want<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.400> be<00:02:51.490> getting<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.850> half

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
you really want to be getting the half

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.800 
you really want to be getting the half
is<00:02:52.390> bunny<00:02:52.690> hopping<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:53.260> lot<00:02:53.800> of<00:02:53.890> people<00:02:54.810> they

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
is bunny hopping a lot of people they

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.620 
is bunny hopping a lot of people they
join<00:02:56.140> a<00:02:56.170> race<00:02:56.530> server<00:02:56.860> or<00:02:57.220> even<00:02:57.820> a<00:02:57.940> clan<00:02:58.480> arena

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
join a race server or even a clan arena

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.410 
join a race server or even a clan arena
PQR<00:02:59.470> server<00:02:59.740> and<00:03:00.160> they'd<00:03:00.730> seem<00:03:01.000> kind<00:03:01.330> of

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
PQR server and they'd seem kind of

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.150 
PQR server and they'd seem kind of
mystified<00:03:01.900> by<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.380> jumps<00:03:02.740> that<00:03:02.770> are<00:03:02.980> being

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
mystified by the jumps that are being

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.100 
mystified by the jumps that are being
done<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.850> that's<00:03:04.180> because<00:03:04.570> they<00:03:04.690> tend<00:03:04.960> to<00:03:05.020> be

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
done and that's because they tend to be

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.560 
done and that's because they tend to be
using<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.620> four<00:03:05.860> button<00:03:06.220> way<00:03:06.460> too<00:03:06.520> much<00:03:06.850> this

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
using the four button way too much this

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.130 
using the four button way too much this
is<00:03:08.010> just<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.100> simple<00:03:09.460> example<00:03:09.580> of<00:03:10.270> how<00:03:10.450> to<00:03:10.510> get

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
is just a simple example of how to get

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.740 
is just a simple example of how to get

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
got to make sure that your mouse

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.310 
got to make sure that your mouse
movements<00:03:40.870> are<00:03:40.990> smooth

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
movements are smooth

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.660 
movements are smooth
you're<00:03:41.440> not<00:03:41.560> taking<00:03:41.980> too<00:03:42.160> sharp<00:03:42.430> tests

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
you're not taking too sharp tests

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.890 
you're not taking too sharp tests
because<00:03:42.970> if<00:03:43.060> you<00:03:43.150> do<00:03:43.300> should<00:03:43.450> harm<00:03:43.630> and<00:03:43.750> shoot

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
too sharply then you notice that you're

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.730 
too sharply then you notice that you're
going<00:03:45.760> to<00:03:45.820> be<00:03:45.880> losing<00:03:46.090> a<00:03:46.420> lot<00:03:47.110> of<00:03:47.230> speed<00:03:47.440> very

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
going to be losing a lot of speed very

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.640 
going to be losing a lot of speed very
quickly<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:49.690> then<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.050> faster<00:03:50.470> you<00:03:50.620> are

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
quickly and then the faster you are

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.770 
quickly and then the faster you are
going<00:03:51.190> at<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:51.430> smoother<00:03:51.940> you<00:03:52.090> want<00:03:52.270> that<00:03:52.480> turn

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
going at the smoother you want that turn

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.050 
going at the smoother you want that turn
to<00:03:52.959> be<00:03:53.140> in<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:54.100> end<00:03:54.220> so<00:03:54.400> that<00:03:54.520> you<00:03:54.640> can<00:03:54.820> keep

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
to be in the end so that you can keep

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.370 
to be in the end so that you can keep
getting<00:03:55.470> accelerations<00:03:57.150> and<00:03:58.170> that<00:03:59.170> is

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
getting accelerations and that is

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.500 
getting accelerations and that is
actually<00:03:59.800> more<00:03:59.980> or<00:04:00.130> less<00:04:00.280> it<00:04:00.520> for<00:04:01.000> this

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
actually more or less it for this

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.630 
actually more or less it for this
