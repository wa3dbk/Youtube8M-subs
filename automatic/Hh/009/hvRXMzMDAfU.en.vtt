00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.220
 those here where it is low 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.230
 handmade cobos fascinates me this is 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.150
 a ritual so that we feed them better 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.219
 Exactly tell them why this is not a 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.900
 simple juice but you have a machine 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.240
 special that to his thought in signed 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.570
 exactly what we want is that these 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.960
 juices in daily healthy rituals and 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.539
 that function using novo 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.250
 now it's called so it's not just 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.110
 when you make a divestment plan 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.720
 but you include it as a ritual 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:37.160
 healthy and what we do is that these 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.160
 juices are made with a person 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:44.520
 in this machine is full 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.570
 I have fruits and vegetables here 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.989
 grind and kayak and in some bags and this 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.650
 is a hydraulic press that tightens the 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.650
 routine 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.020
 so that the enzymes remain intact and 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.460
 the nutrients and this lasts 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.229
 of three days here come 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:07.119
 when we produce and where and when 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.760
 until when do I recommend using these 100 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.320
 natural and has an extra benefit to the 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.940
 cube that we bought in the corner 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.310
 exact the juice and we train in the 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.159
 final when he was not like that he 's 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.259
 going we destroy as properties of the 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.180
 protein cell the mind and the 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.340
 walls the cell walls of the 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.610
 fruits and vegetables when it is an extractor 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.650
 common breaks that thing all then 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.570

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.010
 to serve as fiber instead here is going to 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.680
