00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
there you go that's pretty much all the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.680 
there you go that's pretty much all the
tweak<00:01:34.460> does<00:01:34.640> there's<00:01:34.940> no<00:01:35.090> settings<00:01:35.510> to

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
tweak does there's no settings to

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.390 
tweak does there's no settings to
configure<00:01:35.780> you<00:01:36.380> basically<00:01:36.710> just<00:01:36.799> install<00:01:37.370> it

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
configure you basically just install it

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.850 
configure you basically just install it
and<00:01:37.700> it<00:01:37.820> works<00:01:38.170> pretty<00:01:39.170> straightforward

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
and it works pretty straightforward

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.039 
and it works pretty straightforward
pretty<00:01:40.070> simple<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:40.670> again<00:01:41.510> I<00:01:41.540> do<00:01:41.630> like<00:01:41.900> it

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
pretty simple and again I do like it

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.510 
pretty simple and again I do like it
just<00:01:42.229> because<00:01:42.440> it<00:01:42.560> makes<00:01:42.590> my<00:01:42.920> device<00:01:43.159> a<00:01:43.190> little

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
just because it makes my device a little

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.250 
just because it makes my device a little
bit<00:01:43.610> more<00:01:43.700> simple<00:01:43.940> and<00:01:44.270> that's<00:01:44.540> my<00:01:44.720> goal<00:01:44.990> but

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
bit more simple and that's my goal but

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.930 
bit more simple and that's my goal but
anyways<00:01:45.590> I<00:01:45.619> hope<00:01:45.680> you<00:01:45.830> guys<00:01:45.979> enjoyed<00:01:46.460> this
