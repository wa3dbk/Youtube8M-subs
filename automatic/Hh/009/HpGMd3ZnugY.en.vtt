the morning because i feel like it can

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.740 
the morning because i feel like it can
be<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> little<00:01:11.130> intense<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.820> use<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.150> morning

be a little intense to use it morning
and<00:01:12.960> night<00:01:13.049> especially<00:01:13.380> since<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.920> use

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
and night especially since I use

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.850 
and night especially since I use
chemical<00:01:14.610> exfoliants<00:01:15.360> also<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.500> just<00:01:16.710> use

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
chemical exfoliants also so I just use

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.830 
chemical exfoliants also so I just use

checks<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.320> balances<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.159> think<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.549> is

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
checks and balances and I think this is

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.999 
checks and balances and I think this is
the<00:01:20.790> most<00:01:20.820> amazing<00:01:21.390> cleanser<00:01:21.930> with<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
the most amazing cleanser with the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.340 
the most amazing cleanser with the
clarisonic<00:01:23.640> because<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.450> foamy<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.110> it

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
clarisonic because it is so foamy and it

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.160 
clarisonic because it is so foamy and it
just<00:01:25.530> makes<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.860> feel<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.939> clean<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:28.110> I

it<00:03:25.959> apart<00:03:26.140> basically<00:03:26.890> if<00:03:27.070> you<00:03:27.220> watch<00:03:27.400> my

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.660 
guess I should address that i do use a
lot<00:03:33.850> of<00:03:34.440> active<00:03:35.440> ingredients<00:03:35.650> on<00:03:36.220> my<00:03:36.370> skin

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
built up to it over time so I'm not

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.580 
built up to it over time so I'm not

products and slap them on your face on

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.030 
products and slap them on your face on
the<00:04:52.900> first<00:04:53.080> day<00:04:53.200> because<00:04:53.560> it's<00:04:53.710> not<00:04:53.800> going<00:04:53.950> to

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.190 
the first day because it's not going to
work<00:04:54.160> I<00:04:54.400> started<00:04:55.150> with<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.360> benzoyl<00:04:55.720> peroxide

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
work I started with the benzoyl peroxide

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.540 
work I started with the benzoyl peroxide
that<00:04:56.410> was<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:56.560> first<00:04:56.770> thing<00:04:56.860> that<00:04:56.950> I<00:04:57.100> use<00:04:57.370> I

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
that was the first thing that I use I

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.280 
that was the first thing that I use I
use<00:04:57.580> that<00:04:57.730> for<00:04:58.030> about<00:04:58.090> six<00:04:58.450> weeks<00:04:58.540> just<00:04:58.960> this

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
use that for about six weeks just this

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.340 
use that for about six weeks just this
and<00:04:59.530> then<00:04:59.680> just<00:05:00.100> other<00:05:00.310> gentle<00:05:00.820> products<00:05:01.350> then

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
and then just other gentle products then

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.620 
and then just other gentle products then
I<00:05:02.380> added<00:05:02.590> the<00:05:02.770> aaha<00:05:03.220> I<00:05:03.460> use<00:05:03.910> that<00:05:04.180> for<00:05:04.540> about

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
I added the aaha I use that for about

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.770 
I added the aaha I use that for about
six<00:05:05.110> weeks<00:05:05.230> four<00:05:05.620> to<00:05:05.710> six<00:05:05.919> weeks<00:05:06.450> made<00:05:07.450> sure<00:05:07.660> my

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
six weeks four to six weeks made sure my

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.630 
six weeks four to six weeks made sure my
skin<00:05:08.020> was<00:05:08.140> used<00:05:08.380> to<00:05:08.530> it<00:05:08.680> then<00:05:09.130> I<00:05:09.190> started<00:05:09.430> using

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
skin was used to it then I started using

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.219 
skin was used to it then I started using
the<00:05:09.790> retinol<00:05:10.120> on<00:05:10.240> top<00:05:10.419> of<00:05:10.600> it<00:05:10.720> and<00:05:10.750> I<00:05:10.870> started

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
the retinol on top of it and I started

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:14.070 
the retinol on top of it and I started
using<00:05:11.350> the<00:05:11.530> retinol<00:05:12.360> every<00:05:13.360> three<00:05:13.660> days<00:05:13.810> at

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
using the retinol every three days at

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.900 
using the retinol every three days at
first<00:05:14.350> then<00:05:14.590> every<00:05:14.860> two<00:05:15.040> days<00:05:15.190> then<00:05:15.580> every

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
first then every two days then every

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.840 
first then every two days then every
other<00:05:15.940> day<00:05:16.360> and<00:05:16.720> then<00:05:17.500> now<00:05:18.400> I<00:05:18.430> use<00:05:18.639> it<00:05:18.760> every

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
other day and then now I use it every

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.240 
other day and then now I use it every
night<00:05:19.150> it's<00:05:19.450> also<00:05:19.660> really<00:05:20.050> recommended<00:05:20.770> to

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
night it's also really recommended to

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.370 
night it's also really recommended to
use<00:05:21.490> retinol<00:05:21.880> and<00:05:22.000> HHA<00:05:22.450> to<00:05:22.510> gather<00:05:22.780> the<00:05:23.020> reason

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
use retinol and HHA to gather the reason

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.530 
use retinol and HHA to gather the reason
is<00:05:23.500> because<00:05:23.680> retina<00:05:24.580> improves<00:05:25.090> your<00:05:25.210> cell

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
is because retina improves your cell

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.270 
is because retina improves your cell
turnover<00:05:25.870> which<00:05:26.140> means<00:05:26.380> it<00:05:26.500> makes<00:05:26.710> new<00:05:26.979> cells

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
turnover which means it makes new cells

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.100 
turnover which means it makes new cells
but<00:05:27.520> if<00:05:27.669> you<00:05:27.820> don't<00:05:28.030> exfoliate<00:05:28.330> those<00:05:28.840> cells

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
but if you don't exfoliate those cells

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.840 
but if you don't exfoliate those cells
it<00:05:29.620> just<00:05:29.770> kind<00:05:29.950> of<00:05:29.979> build<00:05:30.250> up<00:05:30.400> and<00:05:30.610> the<00:05:30.669> top

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
it just kind of build up and the top

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.360 
it just kind of build up and the top
layer<00:05:31.060> of<00:05:31.090> your<00:05:31.180> skin<00:05:31.300> gets<00:05:31.720> really<00:05:31.780> thick<00:05:32.370> but

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
layer of your skin gets really thick but

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.820 
layer of your skin gets really thick but
none<00:05:33.520> of<00:05:33.610> those<00:05:33.669> shells<00:05:34.030> are<00:05:34.300> shedding<00:05:35.169> so<00:05:35.560> use

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
none of those shells are shedding so use

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.700 
none of those shells are shedding so use
things<00:05:36.130> like<00:05:36.190> aaha<00:05:36.910> to<00:05:37.570> help<00:05:37.780> increase<00:05:38.080> you

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
things like aaha to help increase you

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.440 
things like aaha to help increase you
know<00:05:38.830> your<00:05:39.010> skin<00:05:39.310> actually<00:05:39.580> coming<00:05:40.030> off<00:05:40.210> and

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
know your skin actually coming off and

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.570 
know your skin actually coming off and
that<00:05:40.660> sounds<00:05:40.930> really<00:05:41.080> gross<00:05:41.260> but<00:05:41.530> it<00:05:41.830> makes

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
that sounds really gross but it makes

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.570 
that sounds really gross but it makes
that<00:05:42.789> skin<00:05:43.120> exfoliate<00:05:44.160> so<00:05:45.160> these<00:05:45.340> together

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
that skin exfoliate so these together

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.490 
that skin exfoliate so these together
you're<00:05:46.270> getting<00:05:46.479> new<00:05:46.720> cells<00:05:47.110> and<00:05:47.470> you're

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
you're getting new cells and you're

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.990 
you're getting new cells and you're
getting<00:05:47.710> rid<00:05:47.979> of<00:05:48.039> the<00:05:48.100> old<00:05:48.160> cells<00:05:48.550> all<00:05:48.760> at<00:05:48.910> the

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
getting rid of the old cells all at the

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.610 
getting rid of the old cells all at the
same<00:05:49.150> time<00:05:49.419> so<00:05:49.660> that's<00:05:49.870> why<00:05:50.020> it's<00:05:50.050> usually

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
same time so that's why it's usually

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.529 
same time so that's why it's usually
recommended<00:05:51.130> to<00:05:51.340> use<00:05:51.550> both<00:05:52.270> of<00:05:52.300> these

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:52.539 
recommended to use both of these

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:54.330 
recommended to use both of these
products<00:05:52.990> at<00:05:53.080> the<00:05:53.320> same<00:05:53.470> time<00:05:53.680> but<00:05:54.010> you<00:05:54.160> have

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
products at the same time but you have

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.180 
products at the same time but you have
to<00:05:54.520> gradually<00:05:54.850> filled<00:05:55.630> up<00:05:55.780> to<00:05:55.930> them<00:05:56.080> I<00:05:56.260> really

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
to gradually filled up to them I really

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.440 
to gradually filled up to them I really
need<00:05:57.220> to<00:05:57.400> drive<00:05:57.580> that<00:05:57.700> point<00:05:57.910> home<00:05:58.030> so<00:05:58.300> I<00:05:58.330> don't

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
need to drive that point home so I don't

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.430 
need to drive that point home so I don't
want<00:05:58.570> somebody<00:05:58.780> to<00:05:58.840> think<00:05:58.990> you<00:05:59.050> can<00:05:59.169> just<00:05:59.320> go

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
want somebody to think you can just go

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.690 
want somebody to think you can just go
