00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
cost-effective green solution for

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.590 
cost-effective green solution for
starters<00:00:15.089> we'll<00:00:15.420> take<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.809> cover<00:00:16.080> off<00:00:16.199> and

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
starters we'll take the cover off and

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.150 
starters we'll take the cover off and
then<00:00:18.600> we'll<00:00:18.750> take<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.960> balance<00:00:19.199> cover<00:00:19.680> off<00:00:19.890> as

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
then we'll take the balance cover off as

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.000 
then we'll take the balance cover off as
well<00:00:20.660> for<00:00:21.660> convenience<00:00:22.199> purposes<00:00:22.410> I've

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
well for convenience purposes I've

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.429 
well for convenience purposes I've
already<00:00:23.310> installed<00:00:23.699> these<00:00:23.970> LED<00:00:24.420> strips<00:00:24.810> but

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
already installed these LED strips but

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.560 
already installed these LED strips but
all<00:00:25.560> you'll<00:00:25.740> have<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:25.980> do<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.640> take<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.210> strip

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
all you'll have to do is take this strip

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.300 
all you'll have to do is take this strip
and<00:00:27.779> peel<00:00:28.140> off<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:28.500> piece<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.189> adhesive

right<00:00:29.849> here<00:00:30.769> next<00:00:31.769> we're<00:00:32.160> going<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.430> find<00:00:32.700> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
right here next we're going to find the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.330 
right here next we're going to find the
positive<00:00:33.090> wire<00:00:33.630> see<00:00:34.440> where<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.710> leads<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.250> the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
positive wire see where it leads to the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.400 
positive wire see where it leads to the
switch<00:00:35.670> see<00:00:36.420> where<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.630> comes<00:00:36.870> out<00:00:37.079> and

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
switch see where it comes out and

halfway between the switch and the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.540 
halfway between the switch and the
ballast<00:00:39.960> like<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.620> cut<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.040> with<00:00:41.280> wire

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
ballast like to cut that with wire

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:50.090 
ballast like to cut that with wire
cutters<00:00:47.030> if<00:00:48.030> you're<00:00:48.539> not<00:00:48.690> sure<00:00:48.930> which<00:00:49.200> wire<00:00:49.559> to

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
cutters if you're not sure which wire to

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.380 
cutters if you're not sure which wire to
choose<00:00:50.629> you<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.780> always<00:00:51.960> meter<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:53.270> next<00:00:54.270> I'm

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
choose you can always meter it next I'm

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.790 
choose you can always meter it next I'm
going<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.600> strip<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.050> end<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.410> wire

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.680 

and<00:01:00.800> what<00:01:01.310> may<00:01:01.460> also<00:01:01.730> have<00:01:02.030> to<00:01:02.150> do<00:01:02.300> it<00:01:02.480> on<00:01:02.660> your

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
and what may also have to do it on your

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.200 
and what may also have to do it on your
LED<00:01:03.530> strips<00:01:03.950> these<00:01:04.280> have<00:01:04.460> already<00:01:04.610> been<00:01:04.910> done

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
LED strips these have already been done

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.530 
LED strips these have already been done
as<00:01:05.510> you<00:01:05.750> can<00:01:05.930> see<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:07.340> next<00:01:07.670> step<00:01:07.880> is<00:01:08.120> to<00:01:08.360> take

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
as you can see the next step is to take

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.960 
as you can see the next step is to take
the<00:01:08.720> two<00:01:08.930> positive<00:01:09.770> wires<00:01:10.040> from<00:01:10.340> your<00:01:10.430> LED

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
the two positive wires from your LED

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.670 
the two positive wires from your LED
strips<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:11.690> bring<00:01:12.680> them<00:01:12.890> together<00:01:14.410> with<00:01:15.410> the

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
strips and bring them together with the

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
strips and bring them together with the
wire<00:01:16.430> we<00:01:16.700> just<00:01:16.970> stripped<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:17.770> then<00:01:18.770> cap<00:01:19.400> them

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
wire we just stripped and then cap them

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.910 
wire we just stripped and then cap them
with<00:01:20.180> a<00:01:20.450> wire<00:01:21.320> nut<00:01:21.590> or<00:01:22.310> a<00:01:22.340> butt<00:01:22.610> connector

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
with a wire nut or a butt connector

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.690 
with a wire nut or a butt connector
we'll<00:01:24.920> be<00:01:25.040> cutting<00:01:25.250> this<00:01:25.460> white<00:01:25.730> wire<00:01:26.500> okay

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
we'll be cutting this white wire okay

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:35.290 
we'll be cutting this white wire okay
then<00:01:28.700> we'll<00:01:28.940> strip<00:01:29.330> it<00:01:33.670> then<00:01:34.670> we'll<00:01:35.000> take<00:01:35.150> the

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
then we'll strip it then we'll take the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.990 
then we'll strip it then we'll take the
two<00:01:35.479> negative<00:01:35.930> wires<00:01:36.170> from<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:36.890> LED<00:01:37.460> strips

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
two negative wires from the LED strips

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.120 
two negative wires from the LED strips
and<00:01:38.570> attach<00:01:38.900> them<00:01:40.840> once<00:01:41.840> again<00:01:42.200> putting<00:01:42.740> on<00:01:42.890> a

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
and attach them once again putting on a

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.850 
and attach them once again putting on a
wire<00:01:43.430> nut<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:44.570> you<00:01:44.660> can't<00:01:44.900> take<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.320> ballast

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
wire nut and you can't take the ballast

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.980 
wire nut and you can't take the ballast
out<00:01:46.040> but<00:01:46.670> for<00:01:46.820> this<00:01:46.910> particular<00:01:47.150> video<00:01:47.660> we're

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
out but for this particular video we're

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.680 
out but for this particular video we're
gonna<00:01:48.080> leave<00:01:48.350> it<00:01:48.470> in<00:01:48.560> either<00:01:48.830> way<00:01:49.010> is<00:01:49.190> fine

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
gonna leave it in either way is fine

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.480 
gonna leave it in either way is fine
next<00:01:50.690> I'm<00:01:50.869> tucking<00:01:51.500> all<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.950> wires<00:01:52.130> together

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
next I'm tucking all the wires together

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.580 
next I'm tucking all the wires together
so<00:01:52.970> they<00:01:53.090> fit<00:01:53.330> underneath<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:54.380> ballast<00:01:54.740> cover

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
so they fit underneath the ballast cover

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.410 
so they fit underneath the ballast cover
now<00:01:57.590> I'm<00:01:57.770> putting<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.100> light<00:01:58.490> cover<00:01:58.820> right

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
now I'm putting the light cover right

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.460 
now I'm putting the light cover right
back<00:01:59.630> over<00:01:59.990> top<00:02:01.509> our<00:02:02.509> next<00:02:02.780> step<00:02:02.960> is<00:02:03.140> to<00:02:03.289> check

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
back over top our next step is to check

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.540 
back over top our next step is to check
the<00:02:03.530> light

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:16.630 

and<00:02:07.550> it<00:02:08.000> works

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.450
