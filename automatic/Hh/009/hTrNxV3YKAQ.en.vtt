00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.059 
good because that means that it's not
going<00:04:12.510> to<00:04:12.689> be<00:04:13.049> staticky<00:04:13.500> or<00:04:13.560> whatever<00:04:13.860> that's

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
going to be staticky or whatever that's

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.559 
going to be staticky or whatever that's

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
that it would be saggy but it sounds
