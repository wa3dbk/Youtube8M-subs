might get a compression test on it and I

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.129 
might get a compression test on it and I
toilet<00:04:39.120> crap<00:04:39.330> off<00:04:39.479> down<00:04:39.630> there<00:04:39.750> I<00:04:39.810> look<00:04:39.960> down

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
into the the intakes or whatever you

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.950 
into the the intakes or whatever you
want<00:04:43.680> to<00:04:43.740> call<00:04:43.830> them<00:04:44.040> and<00:04:44.280> this<00:04:45.270> piston<00:04:45.900> is

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
want to call them and this piston is

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.060 
want to call them and this piston is
finding<00:04:46.229> that<00:04:46.260> piston<00:04:46.710> spine

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
finding that piston spine

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.600 
finding that piston spine
this<00:04:47.400> one<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.669> skirts<00:04:47.940> broke<00:04:48.180> on<00:04:48.360> it<00:04:49.550> so<00:04:50.550> you

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
this one the skirts broke on it so you

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.140 
this one the skirts broke on it so you
definitely<00:04:50.850> need<00:04:51.120> to<00:04:51.210> put<00:04:51.330> a<00:04:52.610> new<00:04:53.610> piston<00:04:54.030> in

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
definitely need to put a new piston in

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:00.770 
definitely need to put a new piston in
it

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.330 

but<00:05:01.350> I<00:05:01.380> guess<00:05:01.500> you're<00:05:01.680> still<00:05:01.830> interested<00:05:02.040> in
