00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.430
 for the realization of this exercise it 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.530
 they need three balloons and tall cones 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.640
 three goalkeepers and one 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.640
 Goalkeeping coach 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.039
 we will place a cone two meters from the 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.169
 goal line and the other six or seven 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.310
 meters that indicates the initial position of 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.020
 the support goalkeepers 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.300
 the main goalkeeper starts with 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.970
 speed to the first cone where you perform 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.830
 lock in your own space at the same time a 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.170
 mate makes a pass to the coach 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.000
 of goalkeepers who in turn perform a 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.160
 control and trip for lateral deviation 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.080
 after this action receives a flat pass 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.080
 to organize a beating partner 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.180
 for the third speed task of 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.670
 displacement we introduce more 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.320
 variables and in this case the goalkeeper must 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.330
 intervene on balloons that are in 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.980
 movement and they are the ones that mark the 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.980
 speed and direction of displacement 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.140
 by increasing the uncertainty about what 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.350
 type of displacement we should do 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.060
 increases the difficulty of execution in 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.280
 this case we have shortened the distances 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.289
 and goalies work relatively 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.880
 comfortable but you can expand more the 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:38.710
 space between the execution points 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.920
 to force increase the speed of the 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.920
 displacement 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.939
 again we must emphasize 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.700
 pay more attention to displacement 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.649
 that the final intervention but not for 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.210
 they should neglect to make 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.700
 correct way all actions 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.110
 Exercise techniques saying not worth 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.110
 I believe that better interior 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.569
 inside
