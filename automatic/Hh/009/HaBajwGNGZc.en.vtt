00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:08.310
 good guys I'm here again have 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:12.600
 It lasts a few hours and you 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:17.540
 you remember to make this yogurt the yogurt 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:21.570
 with bacteria or the yogurt virus 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.560
 pouring milk and well here you have 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.109
 the proof 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:31.630
 here's the well-kept yogurt I think 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:36.040
 that I'm going to have to show from this 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:39.670
 way because if you do not record and do the 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.379
 two things I will not be able 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.680
 there's the yogurt for a little while 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.570
 because otherwise I can not remove the rubber and 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.730
 If I can not remove the rubber, you are not going to 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.880
 to be able to see good now I go back to 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:56.840
 take the camera and you are going to see this 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.840
 I remove the 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:05.520
 the plastic and effectively what it was 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.520
 only milk is already made yogurt 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.060
 that is not liquid or anything because it is already 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.200
 fact 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.210
 the yogurt 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:19.500
 it smells like yogurt 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.500
 expressly as natural yogurt 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:28.460
 Well now what I'm going to do is 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:32.200
 I can choose here from this part of the 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.430
 yogurt a one small part is for 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.690
 throw them out and go back to making yogurt but 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.340
 this time like yogurt a little more 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.340
 liquid to see if I can 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.299
 you see 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.380
 and it is so very creamy 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.050
 experteer 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.900
 in this site 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.750
 another part of the yogurt this 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.800
 here 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.110
 and a third spoonful of this yogurt 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.810
 Y 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.620
 if you can forgive that you do not focus well 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.620
 because two things 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.500
 good 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.500
 Well now what I'm going to do is model 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.910
 good musicians have to go now by 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.810
 the senses 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.830
 Milky 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.880
 I'm going to add 250 milk again 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.880
 I have it for nothing 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.250
 and continue with stirring 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.730
 well I will do this and now 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.270
 5 the next step 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.270
 one moment 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.070
 let's have a little more milk 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.470
 now all that only unfairly in 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.760
 the half liter of milk would be two glasses 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.420
 of water more or less 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.420
 to 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.410
 to make a little more yogurt 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.930
 It is not such 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.020
 well at this time, it's going to be 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.020
 little bit of paper 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.120
 for 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:18.880
 for that to be done again 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.880
 a yogurt but it is no longer 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.920
 as thick as is the case this will be 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.920
 a little more liquid a yogurt drunk 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.150
 with the same bacteria that have been 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:35.020
 caught from the part above all from above 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.830
 Well, it's going to be done again 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.830
 other 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:46.330
 and this has to wait less time 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:49.669
 so the first one as you've seen 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.189
 stable leave now prepared and good 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:55.759
 other things to tell you that it also 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:58.339
 include and you can buy this because it's 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:02.119
 this good you see there is a placemat 

00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:03.620
 one visitor, my mother, what is this, then? 

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:07.100
 this is 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:10.699
 like jam but of mango there is 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.860
 other flavors but this is the one of the 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.409
 mango 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:18.099
 and nothing because this is the yogurt and 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:19.689
 as it has so many properties this yogurt 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:22.370
 So rich 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:24.919
 Well, the only thing I'm going to do is 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:28.780
 ready to eat and start eating it 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:31.370
 so guys do not have another mystery 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:36.139
 good if you have a little mystery do not 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:38.570
 I will teach what is this yogurt for 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:41.330
 catch another spoon wait and see I'm going to 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:45.240
 take the camera to reform it 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:51.800
 is that this yogurt if you go around 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.800
 It's not very funny because it 's very beige 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:59.879
 how is this yogurt is like very 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.700
 creamy 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:04.530
 jujuy 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.689
 which I'm going to put a video of 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.149
 internet for you to see 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:11.629
 because it's a slightly odd place or not 

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:11.629
 is it so 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.229
 if you do it as it is 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:22.110
 difficult to catch it are not as if 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:22.110
 I had there is to take the yogurt 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.430

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:42.210
 I like very very funny 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:44.460

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.890
 this type of yogurt and didactic
