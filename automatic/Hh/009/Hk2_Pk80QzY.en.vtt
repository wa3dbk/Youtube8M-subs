00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.460
 welcome to another video friends today jay 

00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:06.140
 pokemon lice me today 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.910
 I bring a video here to the channel 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.120
 quite special since today 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.650
 we bring another top 5 to the channel in the top 5 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.480
 of today we will talk about the 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.820
 5 pokemon that we hate the most 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.530
 find us in the rival team does not 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.020
 it's happened that they're fighting either 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.550
 on the nintendo 3ds by points or are 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.710
 fighting in what would be pokemon 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.750
 sold-out and true candle pokemon in the 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.580
 team of the rival and their head hurts 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.590
 from the simple fact of seeing it because they know 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.970
 who hate it they know that that pokemon is 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.730
 hateful and that there is going to be a problem 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.339
 pretty big if this has happened to you I know 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.140
 that this top is for you equally 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:41.179
 do not forget that this cap is my opinion 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.170
 completely personal but what if 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:44.329
 you have a completely 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.949
 different and they have 5 pokemon that they hate 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.839
 Pretty or any pokemon that you 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.190
 is someone put wrong here in the 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.739
 comments that I would be pretty 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.389
 grateful also before beginning 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.949
 do not forget to destroy that button of me 

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:57.739
 like and hopefully I do not support and achieve 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.399
 reach 500 likes for this video 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.959
 but good 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.749
 starting directly with the post 

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:05.449
 number 5 we have nothing more and nothing less 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:06.690
 What a sorry friend are mega viles over 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.850
 less for me is a 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.160
 giant head is a bit in the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.840
 which I hate to find myself in the fighting in 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.060
 special Japanese hands because it is 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.550
 a pokemon which is almost always 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.260
 usually carries defensive and apart as the 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.360
 Pokemon have pretty good skill 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.970
 with which it only has two 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.610
 weaknesses that that psychic already flying 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.710
 if we do not have something of this kind of 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.770
 our team really do away with this 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.750
 Pokemon is going to be a real odyssey and 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.020
 that this pokemon resists a lot and has 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.060
 thousand and one ways to recover life what 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.800
 they would support an offensive variant because 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.140
 it would be easier to kill him but in 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.560
 a defensive variant that is like more 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.270
 you see this pokemon is just hateful 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.790
 I detest him a lot in number 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.800
 5 at least I have mega lives now 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.380
 let's go directly to the post 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.600
 number 4 in which I have a pokemon on 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.000
 which is just as hateful but still a 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.250
 little bit more because the pokemon is the same 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.080
 it only has two weaknesses 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.420
 Pokemon resists quite well because 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.580
 almost always is usually defensive and 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.860
 is nothing more and nothing less than cliff that 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.380
 which is a bit in which neither 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.600
 I stand too much for that very fact 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.180
 it has two weaknesses it is always 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.550
 take defensive and apart usually gets 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.370
 ego control tends to paralyze you 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.460
 usually put in what would be called friends 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.650
 the attack substitute with dirty play 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.840
 is this pokemon plays pretty pretty 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.060
 quite with what would be luck and 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.580
 apart if you get confused paralyzes you 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.320
 He has a substitute has a joker 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.320
 always have priority with these 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.940
 attacks the pokemon is very resistant 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.040
 really hate this pokemon is not 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.800
 to hate this pokemon is impossible since 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.020
 it's one of the most odious things and I know that 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.110
 a lot of people hate a lot 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.270
 this pokemon and I understand it I understand 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.790
 this pokemon with this special set 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.080
 What I just told you is death 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.630
 for friends 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.420
 cliff and very very hated in the post 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.790
 number 4 but there is something more hateful 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.710
 that clerc and at least for me if there is and 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.440
 would be in the number 3 position would have nothing 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.600
 more and nothing less than to grow already because 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.220
 this hatred against growing already pretty 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.470
 simple is a little bit in which you have some 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.510
 defenses that you look at them if you stay on 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.950
 that seriously this pokemon can have 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.530
 so many defenses 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.110
 if friends the pokemon has 120 of 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.080
 base statistics in each of the 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.760
 defenses and has enough hp so the 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.190
 Pokemon has good resistances 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.980
 too many good resistances has 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.170
 way of recovering life pretty much 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.690
 recover 50% of life with a 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.150
 movement that has and almost always what 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.450
 They usually bring with toxic jagged helmet 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.760
 defensive physical with lunar light this 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.379
 Pokemon is going to give you trouble 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.019
 make detect everything you will want to do 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.209
 throw the console away from you because it 's 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.220
 a pokémon which you look at and you know 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.290
 there are going to be problems and you hate it 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.019
 quite so in this position in the 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.329
 put number 3 would have nothing more and nothing 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.430
 less to grow and to be one of the 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.410
 masters of the creators of the creators of 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.440
 the best pokemon that make the store 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.569
 which I hate quite so in the 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.000
 put number 3 we have nothing more and 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.519
 nothing less than growing up there is something worse 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.620
 to grow and when to do this yes 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.019
 yes, there is a bit with which 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.210
 apart from doing this you may end up 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.910
 a single attack I'm talking about nothing 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.370
 more and nothing less than his and as friends 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.190
 this water type pokemon which by 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.140
 true only has two weaknesses 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.300
 so imagine what truly 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.640
 difficult that is to finish with this pokemon 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.560
 only with two weaknesses with the 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.990
 typical set that usually takes always 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.560
 of crocus which is usually put peace 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.560
 mental 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.990
 scald rest and sleepwalker full 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.480
 physical defense has I think that if I do not 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.630
 I mistake 110 or something for that defense 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.670
 physics this pokemon resists 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.380
 exaggeratedly too much is a pokémon 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.730
 which is very resistant after 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.100
 begins to increase the attack with peace 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.540
 mental and peace of mind special defense 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.700
 so they can no longer attack it by the 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.190
 physical side or by the special side 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.810
 then the one who has just a single attack 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.580
 because it also has a lot of attack 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.430
 special and worst of all is that the 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.050
 pokemon is not even slow has like 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.240
 I mentioned only two weaknesses 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.910
 making the pokemon simply 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.780
 horrible to face him and the worst of 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.930
 everything is that if you are taking it away 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:28.050
 enough life you know that sleep the 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.330
 recover everything and there was what you could 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.040
 do because your son is going to finish you 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.910
 complete another pokemon that is almost 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.520
 exactly the same is this mega slow 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.440
 but honestly I have more hatred of 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.540
 his son because I've seen him more times like this 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.330
 that personally but I know megas 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.220
 achievement is much better because it has more 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.710
 physical defense and it's exactly the same 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.320
 work as I have seen more as well as 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.390
 I detest it even more but it's almost what 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.370
 same but good you already talk about ya 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.800
 we talk about pokemon which we hate 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.620
 because they are very resistant because they play 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.590
 with strategies too hateful because 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.860
 they are very very store because they are also 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.439
 pokemon which you 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.539
 may end up in a single attack and when 

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:12.030
 you try to finish you know that 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:14.430
 they recover everything but then we saw 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.009
 all these pokemon what the heck could 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:20.039
 be in the position number 1 the worst 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:22.289
 pokemon that can exist in particular to 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:24.389
 Japanese hands would be worth the use of several 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:26.639
 pokemon from here of this count with sets 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:28.680
 different but nevertheless the one that I'm going to 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:30.240
 count now with a strategy in 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.360
 that are usually used by 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.189
 Japanese is the worst thing that can exist 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.710
 Friends is to order nothing more and nothing 

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:40.319
 less than chang and imagine a chance and 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.029
 with so much hp that has so good 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:44.279
 Special defense you have with ore 

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:48.300
 evolutive to resist exaggeratedly 

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:50.520
 well with reduction imagine yourself with 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.500
 reduction that begins to lower the 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.330
 statistics so I'll tell you the one that 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.430
 begins to increase the evasion and you for more 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.409
 that you attack him you can not hit him 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.050
 you can recover almost all of life from 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:03.330
 a single wish has an incredibly hp 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:06.569
 big this pokemon is simply 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.610
 impossible to finish him is almost almost 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:10.740
 impossible to finish with this pokemon 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.820
 because it is most odious, equally 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.040
 can put a toxic 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.410
 and if you do not touch it because they already have 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.570
 reductions on this pokemon is 

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:21.030
 impossible to stop it if you know that I 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:23.880
 better I'm going to play digimon because I 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:25.440
 I can not wait with chelsea 

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.740
 I really liked this top that 

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.120
 it really reminds us of every pokemon and 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:33.090
 everything that we have done here in the 

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.680
 channel and I just hate them more and more 

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.000
 not being able to see likewise I hope that you 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.370
 I liked it enough 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.070
 destroy that button I like to comment 

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:43.110
 this video put me the 5 pokemon or the 4
