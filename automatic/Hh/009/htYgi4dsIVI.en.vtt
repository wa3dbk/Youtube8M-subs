hair<00:00:20.380> clip<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:25.180> for<00:00:25.420> the<00:00:25.510> first<00:00:25.810> step<00:00:26.170> you're

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
hair clip so for the first step you're

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.609 
hair clip so for the first step you're
going<00:00:26.710> to<00:00:27.060> measure<00:00:28.060> a<00:00:28.240> piece<00:00:28.630> of<00:00:28.780> salt<00:00:29.050> to<00:00:29.380> fit

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
going to measure a piece of salt to fit

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.680 
going to measure a piece of salt to fit
about<00:00:29.860> the<00:00:30.160> same<00:00:30.490> length<00:00:30.820> as<00:00:31.000> the<00:00:31.210> hair<00:00:31.480> clip

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:31.690 
about the same length as the hair clip

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.600 
about the same length as the hair clip
that<00:00:31.869> you're<00:00:31.960> going<00:00:32.140> to<00:00:32.169> use<00:00:32.349> so<00:00:32.980> this<00:00:33.430> should

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
that you're going to use so this should

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:43.969 
that you're going to use so this should
be<00:00:33.730> about<00:00:33.850> one<00:00:34.300> inch<00:00:34.480> by<00:00:34.720> three<00:00:35.140> inches<00:00:35.440> long

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:43.979 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:46.860 

so<00:00:44.979> then<00:00:45.220> the<00:00:45.580> next<00:00:45.820> part<00:00:45.970> is<00:00:46.239> really<00:00:46.510> fun

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
so then the next part is really fun

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.689 
so then the next part is really fun
because<00:00:47.110> you<00:00:47.379> get<00:00:47.500> to<00:00:47.680> just<00:00:47.920> pick<00:00:48.220> and<00:00:48.400> choose

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
because you get to just pick and choose

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.579 
because you get to just pick and choose
any<00:00:49.059> of<00:00:49.300> the<00:00:49.449> Jets<00:00:49.750> that<00:00:49.839> you<00:00:50.019> want<00:00:50.290> and

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
any of the Jets that you want and

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:52.979 
any of the Jets that you want and
arrange<00:00:50.920> them<00:00:51.190> my<00:00:51.909> recommendation<00:00:52.780> is<00:00:52.960> that

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
arrange them my recommendation is that

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.770 
arrange them my recommendation is that
you<00:00:53.229> do<00:00:53.500> odd<00:00:53.769> numbers<00:00:54.280> and<00:00:54.549> odd<00:00:54.760> sizes<00:00:55.330> because

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
you do odd numbers and odd sizes because

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.320 
you do odd numbers and odd sizes because
if<00:00:55.900> you<00:00:55.989> go<00:00:56.170> for<00:00:56.769> symmetrical<00:00:57.699> with<00:00:57.850> hearts

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
if you go for symmetrical with hearts

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.149 
if you go for symmetrical with hearts
you're<00:00:58.750> just<00:00:58.930> not<00:00:59.110> going<00:00:59.229> to<00:00:59.290> find<00:00:59.500> it<00:00:59.650> so<00:00:59.890> mix

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
you're just not going to find it so mix

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.240 
you're just not going to find it so mix
and<00:01:00.370> match<00:01:00.519> the<00:01:00.820> sizes<00:01:01.360> colors<00:01:02.199> and<00:01:02.250> shapes

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
and match the sizes colors and shapes

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.789 
and match the sizes colors and shapes
essentials<00:01:03.940> that<00:01:04.030> you<00:01:04.089> use<00:01:04.390> and<00:01:04.900> you'll<00:01:05.530> find

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
essentials that you use and you'll find

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.109 
essentials that you use and you'll find
they'll<00:01:05.920> be<00:01:06.100> a<00:01:06.130> lot<00:01:06.280> easier<00:01:06.490> to<00:01:06.760> come<00:01:06.909> up<00:01:06.970> with

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
they'll be a lot easier to come up with

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.440 
they'll be a lot easier to come up with
interesting<00:01:07.990> formation<00:01:08.740> now<00:01:09.549> that<00:01:09.760> I<00:01:09.790> have<00:01:10.060> a

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
interesting formation now that I have a

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.230 
interesting formation now that I have a
base<00:01:11.130> organization<00:01:12.130> with<00:01:12.340> my<00:01:12.460> rhinestones<00:01:13.000> on

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
the felt I'm gonna glue it down using

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.060 
the felt I'm gonna glue it down using
the<00:01:15.340> e6000<00:01:16.230> now<00:01:17.230> I'm<00:01:17.530> just<00:01:17.710> gonna<00:01:17.830> add<00:01:18.040> a

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.580 
the e6000 now I'm just gonna add a
second<00:01:18.610> layer<00:01:18.820> of<00:01:18.850> rhinestones<00:01:19.750> and<00:01:20.020> hearts
