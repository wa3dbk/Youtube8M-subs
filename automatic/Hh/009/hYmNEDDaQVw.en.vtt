 this mid-season and just finished at the limit was pumped a 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.920
 little worried about a color I was not going very well for the races 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.049

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.030
 this sport car south of the territory 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.250
 briefly 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.190
 if the different generations 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.680
 the four friends 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.470
 but there was a grandfather 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.730
 we do not get and his lucian brother acquiesced 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.560
 just like a wall 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.250
 the big pilots 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.080
 but the time 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.930
 all are participate in the 24 hours of mans le mans allowed 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.930
 the number of entries from the first 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.980
 where is the wool is there earned in four years of the term and it's true 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.529
 that in the family has always been the 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.589
 it's always been a fan 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:17.289
 to make them race car 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:20.679
 my dad a little bit over there tap 3 access to 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.359
 at competitions because there have been too many accidents 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.909
 no in my family for my grandpa to kick his share that 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:31.229
 now i think it's different it's a lot more if it's a lot 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:33.079
 more security so it's something else
