00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 nowadays they are turbo engines 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.029
 warp and woof in my 80s 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.560
 there was something else you didn't have there 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.090
 so much in a formula 1 the what came 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.219
 more turbo bodies 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.960
 maybe brands like sleeping and serving 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.179
 some were a door tree or the rest 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.550
 not much so now these two cars 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.670
 two new to models from peugeot and 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.140
 Citroen both a turbo engine 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.310
 parts of psa chance their 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.930
 I still don't both have the same 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.070
 engine maybe it has too 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.510
 make that one 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.460
 transverse motor is the other 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.240
 lengthwise we will go there shortly 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.949
 look 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.290
 Peugeot call this car those 5 and or 5 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.690
 turbo injection to it is the cinnamon one 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.610
 mouthful injection wasp in those days too 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.980
 still fairly special not so common 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.149
 that now you recognize him of course right away 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.770
 on these wheels are bicoloured 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.950
 sides that have black undersides 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.079
 and the turbo images on the c-pillar 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.410
 Under the hood is a 2.2 liter 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.850
 engine is not the same as in the katie 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.710
 who also knew it with this 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.600
 engine is actually derived from 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.579
 the old cross to motor 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.710
 equipped with a turbo and intercooler 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.680
 good for 160 hp 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.750
 in 1986 they have been a facelift and 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.689
 you get 180 hp 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.810
 so if you wanted that it was possible 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:17.790
 title and baptized this car that gti 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.840
 and then with the addition turbo de ze gt 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.430
 turbo 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.530
 You can also have it with one that specially it 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.240
 euro wheels there are enough turbo plates 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.920
 the side because I am special about it 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.560
 this time a little between model that 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.939
 he came just before the facelift of the cx 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.470
 the phase 2 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.670
 so he still has the metal bumpers 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.409
 but they are sprayed in 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.909
 body color 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.750
 the engine is actually the same sentence the 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.130
 gti 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.360
 so two and half liter four-cylinder 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.670
 engine with of course a turbo 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.799
 good for 165 hp I had standard 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.270
 engine 150 so the power gain is not 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.610
 so very very big of course a lot 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.079
 more couple and you will notice that 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.670
 During the queue he just asked for something 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.329
 has more pulling power than the engine 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.329
 without turbo 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.030
 the physical and cx that we then have a unique 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.740
 driving experience the white van compares with 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.360
 other cars you just can't 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.160
 compare 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.350
 there is already suspension through that information 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.540
 ecb has speed bumps over the road 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.280
 and just do not smooth 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.680
 control this car has that so-called 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.540
 that rafi power steering the steering wheel 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.950
 pull yourself with the utrecht even if you 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.260
 is parked quietly in the late 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.910
 mosbach that is immediately straight again 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.530
 well which I can find it irritating 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.600
 it is somewhat difficult to teach the 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.000
 steering also in turns with enormous 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.560
 modern it applies to the braking system 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.480
 it also works on the hydropneumatic 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.519
 suspension system and brake pedal 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.470
 just touch it and rental 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.480
 no very nice feelings again 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.970
 a lot of braking power but you are already 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.709
 just trying to learn that really well too 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.710
 dose on just to be shock-free 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.350
 stop 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.000
 what the engine company some more ccs and 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.160
 more horsepower but then they will not come 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.200
 totally out of it looks like you 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.790
 turbo not like you know or you will hear him 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.560
 does not connect at all with the 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.480
 background 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.150
 yes really the power comes out now 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.230
 this car but as a more comfortable drive 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.440
 rather sentences 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.400
 unparalleled car and sporting the 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.400
 diameter at 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.650
 you sit and out of that c i stepped you come 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.629
 this peugeot 505 then it is already one 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.859
 totally different experience though 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.659
 when the engine stops for this one 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.889
 boats really just feel much more powerful 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.170
 You should also hear the gas here as well 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:39.760
 gives the turbo got a little whistle 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.530
 you just nice a lot of power a beautiful 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.030
 smooth engine 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.680
 it also applies to the handling of that 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.189
 if we just drive that is normal 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.319
 delicious 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:50.379
 that's really that old-fashioned French 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.909
 comfort was especially talking about 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.370
 he is a bit more solid than one 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:55.480
 standard 505 where suspension and damping and 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.980
 yet it just remains a tasty one 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.269
 comfortable car of course too 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.359
 deal with that chair and they are 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.829
 nice and soft so it's just completely 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:05.139
 tuned to the 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.669
 enjoy and yes do your own temple 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:09.040
 of the steering the chassis like this 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:12.280
 had just been a modern car 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.469
 in 2014 you would n't say he did 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.060
 very outdated what things are there 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:17.680
 just really good and that 's it 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.539
 also characteristic of deep shows from the 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.039
 seventies, eighties 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.380
 they really put a mark on it 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.860
 other brands 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.860
 honest ozo ' 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.370
 and 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.810
 these apparently two cars that are whole 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.160
 sitting close together a bit like that 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.440
 bit the same power both one 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.910
 turbo engine comfortable french cars 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.080
 yet they are very different 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.060
 of nature 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.230
 the Peugeot and rear wheel drive them 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.330
 then with 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.530
 yes a bit more with the motor back and in 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.750
 lemon 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.830
 indeed the lemon really is a whole 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.600
 comfortable 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.580
 French limousine then it is because 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.900
 every great thiessen spring system from 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.250
 that car that makes it really extreme 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.080
 is comfortable 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.180
 you just want some more driving dynamics 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.810
 little more power and fine steering and the 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.820
 car 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.900
 yes that would go deeper show show 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.960
 my personal choice 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.970
 I would take that person well 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.830
 the lemon cx is now coming to see though 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.930
 a very fantastic car very beautiful 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.160
 design 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.200
 but good the voters for the 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.200
 driving characteristics of the peugeot 505
