00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.309
 My name is previous, Mendez, I am 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.520
 good animator is one of the things that 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.830
 I do it invites me to industries or the 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.260
 crazy to hold a workshop that 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.740
 call cheering the school in this workshop 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.200
 we make an articulated character so that 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.760
 children take away a notion of how 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.550
 they can make a character with 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.640
 joints like the game to do 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.890
 this doll we're going to need a toothpick 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.420
 in this case it is this is an instrument 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.370
 with which I work but with a 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.010
 stick we can solve two 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.089
 wires that can be wires from 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.089
 those that come in the bread 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.100
 It's Vaseline that is not going to put 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.769
 in the hand so that we do not get stuck 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.629
 material and the main material is the 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.059
 crazy plasta in this case is the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.129
 super fast plasticine we're 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.739
 using this material for the time 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.780
 which is too short to make the doll 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.070
 which is like 50 minutes 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.930
 then the plasticine that we are 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.759
 entering here is super fast because 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.380
 gives us allows us that the children already 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.290
 bring this figurine finished 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.920
 ok the first thing we're going to do 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.980
 is the wire structure that is what 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.110
 that is going to give mobility to the doll 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.840
 there are two areas that we put them in 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.760
 cross shape and simply the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.760
 we know each other 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.120
 like about eight or ten laps 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.120
 so that we have something to do 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.370
 here we start to see how it is 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.310
 forming the character the trunk the 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.899
 legs 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.850
 and two thanks these wires are very 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.979
 softly actually to make a 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.140
 most complex animation figure are 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.909
 wires of another type but here on paper 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.189
 now we are not employing so that the 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.920
 children do not complicate doing the 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.860
 crooked and we are talking 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.590
 the next step we are going to mix the 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.380
 local square in this case and open the 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.689
 package 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.200
 and he divides it in two the white plasticine 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.120
 and the plastic in blue 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.510
 I put some Vaseline on the 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.510
 hands 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.080
 so that it does not stick to me and then 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.270
 start mixing 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.670
 two of the halves 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.150
 I make the holes where they go after 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.150
 In the eyes 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.970
 I make the depths of my ears 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.230
 It is already beginning to harden this 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.450
 material then anything that you 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.290
 I want to add, I'll add it later 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.290
 that is already hard 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.040
 What you can take advantage estarle 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.400
 still a little bit of texture in I still 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.569
 allows you to give it a little texture as if 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.969
 outside hair 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:12.219
 Well, the plasticine was mixed 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:12.219
 it has to be an even blue color 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.930
 we have to hurry because this is very fast 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.510
 then the time it takes 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.880
 harden is like 7 to 10 minutes 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.980
 but good if you give me the time to do 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.650
 what I want to do we already have the 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.500
 clay 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.010
 we put the wire structure inside 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.010
 of the plasticine 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.049
 and we are giving it the shape that we are going to 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.590
 want of our character in this case 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.640
 I'm going to do like a wolf guy 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:46.350
 we have given ourselves the shape of the snout 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.350
 I'm taking his ears 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.120
 after not leaving what has been 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:07.709
 her breasts 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.709
 the lower back 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.299
 let's say that 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.000
 the way and is now helped me helped me 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:18.609
 with this 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.290
 with this is a tool that I with 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.950
 which I work but I tell you with a 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.540
 stick can be supplemented and with 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.380
 this I can give you the detail I do not know 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.380
 what is the nose 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.990
 we do not make the hairline that has all the 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.890
 canines under the nose and we train him 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.890
 what is the mouth 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.210
 in this case it will be a wolf name 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.320
 a half photo ro 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.320
 I will not put a tooth 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.790
 ok I'm already starting to model what 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.020
 it is one of his arms 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.600
 I'm already doing it here as the 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.599
 muscle 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.029
 and I already did 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:17.979
 the basis of what will be the hand in 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:20.829
 this case I do want you to have several 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:24.809
 separate fingers this is what is done 

00:05:20.829 --> 00:05:24.809
 well once the hand is done 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.280
 Well, the two arms are now 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.320
 we go with the leg the principle is the 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.180
 same 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.180
 the wire is wrapped 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:55.060
 already with the help of the tool we give 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.060
 like the shape of the legs 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.700
 we give it as it is the texture 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.080
 of the full 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:08.990
 Well, here it is already in the character 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:13.280
 this takes me as a packet and a half 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:14.750
 of what is the plastic and the fields 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.060
 well I tell you they can be anyone the 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.840
 scope they have in their home like 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.969
 they go see so they know they have this 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.159
 what else was all that was invested or 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:28.600
 be that in cost to make this figurine 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:31.639
 it would come out as in about 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.620
 from 25 to 30 pesos, let's say 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.240
 and after this material you what 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:39.560
 can paint with any kind of 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:44.860
 paint with down with the clinician with 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.860
 same colors with vinyl 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.960
 and they would have a doll where they have 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.330
 certain articulation 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.169
 that would allow them to do some 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.169
 type of animation 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.270
 already when we have our doll 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:01.940
 articulate 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.010
 It depends on the movement we are going to 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:07.100
 give in this case I'm just going to 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:09.710
 raise his arms then we 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.990
 we fix to the surface on which 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.210
 be so that it does not move 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.510
 in this article because I could go 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:19.440
 giving the movement that I want 

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.440
 it is step by step 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.830
 how has the wire structure is 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.849
 the wire keeps it in the 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:32.050
 position 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:32.050
 and it does not come back 

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:42.080
 let's say it was a sequence 

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:44.180
 animated if they had taken pictures of 

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.160
 each of the movements at the time of 

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.690
 run these photographs you see the 

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.470
 movement of the arms that is us 

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.470
 with people
