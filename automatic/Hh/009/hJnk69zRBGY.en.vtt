00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.300
 I HAVE TO FULFILL MY DREAMS HIP-HOP LIFE I HAVE 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.100

 I HAVE TO FULFILL MY DREAMS HIP-HOP LIFE I HAVE 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.600
 TODAY I LIFTED UP AND I ASKED A QUESTION 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.400
 WHAT IS THE REASON TO BE AN ARTIST AND WITHOUT DUDAAAAA 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.200
 I HAVE REALIZED THAT FEELINGS DO NOT HIDE 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.800
 MUCH LESS THAN WHEN WE ARE THE CURE 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.900
 WE DELIVER MEDICINE WITH MUSIC 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.700
 WHAT YOU KNOW AND NOW NOW YOUR LISTENING 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.700
 WHY I KEEP IT AND NOW YOU ENJOY IT 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.400
 WHY LIFE CONTINUES AND I CONTINUE IN THE FIGHT 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.200
 I CAN NOT DENY IT BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT BE CORRECT 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.200
 THAT I ALSO DREAM OF ARRIVING BY FLYING TO HEAVEN 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.800
 WHY I WANT TO BE LIKE THE EAGLE IN THE WIND 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.200
 AND NEXT TO YOURSELF, TO TRAVEL THE WHOLE WORLD 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.500

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.200

 I HAVE TO FULFILL MY DREAMS HIP-HOP LIFE I HAVE

 THIS IS THE REASON AND THE FLUID THAT I HAVE 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.300
 YOU KNOW THAT ALTHOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT I SUPPORT IT NOW 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.000
 WILLING, AWAKE, ALERT TO DO WHAT BOTH EFFORT 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.300
 HE WANTED TO RECEIVE SINCE A LONG TIME 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.700
 CONTEMPLO, ANHELO, REFLEJO, BREAKING THE WALLS 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.300
 JUMPING THE CHARCOS ACHIEVING A SHIELD 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.000
 DRAWING THE BAD ROADS LEAVING APUROS 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.500
 THINKING ABOUT MATTERS THAT HAVE TO SEE 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.900
 WITH PRESENT PAST AND FUTURE ARTIST FORMED OF GOOD PRINCIPLES 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.500
 TALENT IS SAFE TASTE OF YOUR FEELINGS 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.200
 THAT TODAY RETURNS MORE SINCERE 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.000

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.900
