00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:19.270
 In what or crown is now a limited time but I do not have a muffler 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:23.520
 It seems that a muffler is attached 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:30.420
 As saying Tsu not be shopping on the net 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:36.079
 Masu but let's say ok because your payday came because payday came east 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.079
 Quite Kedomo you have at the time of my 500-yen coin 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.730
 Now this 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:46.700
 I put 500 yen in a sleepy owl, but it is good 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.690

 I think I'm going to travel 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.070
 The other one 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:02.700
 Jan' here is another season things 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.700
 Is it not Christmas at the second end of the shop 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.869
 I don't want Christmas tree so much 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:17.000
 Somehow 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:17.000
 The ones that feel the season season was bought by say Do not want to room 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:25.710
 Mobile 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.630
 It seems like a school that crushes from the ceiling of the room 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.930
 that is 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:35.190
 Christmas Tree Version Cute 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.560
 Umberly 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.460
 I wonder if Kachotto or little 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.830
 Such feeling is very cute 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:47.300
 You mean it hangs from the ceiling 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.800
 The material was paper 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.800
 I do not think that felt 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.710
 right 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.710
 Hard-to-work 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:04.230
 I saw all my hair when I saw it now, but this was 3 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.010
 This cormorant 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.280
 Follow 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.280
 I'm really good in other words Ichimaru 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.450
 Follow 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.530
 This is this 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.530
 Correct 2 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.400
 A fan came 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.790
 The problem is how to attach it to the ceiling 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.010
 In this house 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:43.030
 It's there is no thing called stepladder 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.940
 I need two desks but 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.200
 It to the pile 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.200
 I wonder if reach Once 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.520
 wh 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:59.380
 me 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.380
 How did it look like 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.840
 Preservation 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:09.000
 It became like this 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.000
 It's cute but something is missing 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.280
 More have been 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.700
 Yes 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.380
 That's why I installed the beer safely 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.470
 I think 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.350
 I still feel something is missing 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.000
 First of all, the atmosphere far from Christmas 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.389
 I think I came out 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.939
 Not say that 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.939
 It was a story that has come very Zach 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.480
 Hmm 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.480
 Elves 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.170
