 Why is this game a milestone to me? 

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:54.809
 it is a landmark that is the milestones because he 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:59.190
 It's an amazing mix incredible mix 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.859
 really and best of style games 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:07.110
 of construction games like 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:09.030
 online strategy games in 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.159

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.310
 mix in is still I 'm not 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.799
 summarizing here then let's go there is hollow 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.289
 name of this game that game is called art 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:25.320
 in fiji is 1 mm the rbd developed and 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.299
 developer from there and then let's 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.869
 to think that this company was the one 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.539
 created the idea of lahej today and there is 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.000
 long time is already a concept is of game 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:39.840
 then the game was released in Korea 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.570
 South on January 15 , 2003, ie in the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.270
 last year and also had a beta 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.140
 closed in China and there are also 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.549
 currently exists the version uses also 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.320
 look how cool 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:58.829
 cage is described as the mm rpg sandbox o 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.990
 that would be an emmy rpg sandbox not 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.539
 imagine just how cool 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.060
 usually in any game you have there 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.039
 their centers is not any game is 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.819
 usually any games you have your 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.039
 done 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.790
 the programmer created that center there and 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.980
 it's that way and that's not it 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.849
 Now, look how cool it was for what you wanted. 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.430
 innovate 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.709
 Look at the difference, folks, this really 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.840
 unbelievable 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:28.859
 only in hot air is the only game is 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.980
 with quality so you can create 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:33.450
 example cities you join your material 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.120
 and speaking, I'm going to build my house 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.409
 here then beauty you go there and build 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.230
 your house 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:42.599
 wherever you want there is also a 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.579
 island that I do not know much about writing 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.879
 about this because the game is for me 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:50.040
 relatively new game is this island 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.379
 you can master this example you can 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.900
 use a clan and start setting up your 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.909
 winter that was and maybe it's mna 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.189
 whole but there a constant war 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.030
 You really have to be 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:01.650
 truth 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.180
 And hey, cool, what can you do? 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.980
 do with your home after you 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.319
 build your house we look at what 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.310
 you can customize the ports 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:16.590
 windows and furniture inside the house that 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:19.709
 It's a very cool thing too, but you 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.569
 You must be asking me, but it's what 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.769
 I have to do in this game is to blame. 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.659
 kill the bugs 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.389
 What do I have to do, then I'll go? 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:30.780
 speak some very interesting things 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:33.419
 You can make this game you are up to 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.959
 funny you do not have an example 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:40.400
 there you are to create a garden then you 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:43.739
 You can go there and do your garden and receive 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.519
 You can go there to do your garden and then 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.199
 collection 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.689
 but look how cool your neighbor can 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:50.519
 There flea and clothes garden too so it is 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:52.109
 are very interesting things that you 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.379
 can you make an example you can be a 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.280
 pirate you can also go after the 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.759
 pirates 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.290
 just look how cool then how are you going 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:04.049
 Ask but how am I going to do this? 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.299
 building a boat you go there singles 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.280
 The place in the sea and speak not here I go 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.530
 start building a boat next to your 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.959
 class begins the construction of the boat and 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.209
 when you finish you have a boat 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.669
 to be able to do what you want 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.549
 Another cool thing is the breeding of animals. 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.170
 that allows sheep cattle that can be 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.720
 caution 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.270
 and then sold as resources the 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.270
 building can also be destroyed by 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.040
 other players look at how cool 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.080
 including castles or if you succeeded 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.590
 his game standard was able to build 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.540
 a castle reigns only for you 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.310
 in this case it can be destroyed by 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.840
 someone who does not like you more logically 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.780
 Is this person having to have lots of money? 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.210
 to build guns and guns is not 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.920
 more if you have big enemies or 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.530
 if it was a castle of his clan 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.290
 then it may be that sometimes it happens 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.590
 you have some some more problems 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.960
 this is relevant and this also makes the 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.420
 fun civil ric longer has the 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.220
 world totally in the third person, right? 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.920
 style there that we already know the 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.930
 gta and also assassin's creed 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.550
 It's more or less in that style now. 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.460
 You must be asking. 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.860
 or is it all possible even 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:19.850
 will not it become a kind of mess 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.560
 1 killing the other one is destroying the house 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.990
 from the other and everything else 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.690
 the creators since they also thought 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.480
 in that then in the cheese there is the 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.130
 court there people who think you are 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.740
 you commit a crime 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.410
 people go there and play you and if that 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:39.350
 well judged you are stuck are you going to 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:42.710
 chain and gets the ball on your foot, right? 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:45.770
 but if you have the mothers I met a 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:48.860
 It 's as heavy for you as you can. 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.540
 Join this galley and light soldier then 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.170
 It's also cool, you can run away from 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.800
 and if the fugitive after justice 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.830
 huh 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:02.200
 so it's a thing too, it's never me 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:06.190
 I saw in games so mainly games 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:08.080
 pg o mpe o as school mascots then 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.060
 another thing that is very interesting are 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.890
 the graphics is how you are 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.860
 sales in large countries that are 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:17.740
 really high quality 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.500
 they took great pleasure in doing 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.330
 This game I 'm sure and with 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.930
 sure he will always have in the bank 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:29.140
 because there are always new villages 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:32.620
 has always reigned in absolved classes 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:35.410
 different and it's a very crazy thing
