finally<00:03:15.900> we're<00:03:16.530> going<00:03:16.739> to<00:03:16.830> employ<00:03:17.070> the

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
finally we're going to employ the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.160 
finally we're going to employ the
DeltaWing<00:03:17.700> compression<00:03:18.269> system<00:03:18.630> the

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
DeltaWing compression system the

DeltaWing compression system the
DeltaWing<00:03:19.590> compression<00:03:20.130> system<00:03:20.489> is<00:03:20.610> this

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
DeltaWing compression system is this

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.970 
DeltaWing compression system is this
triangle-shaped<00:03:21.540> compression<00:03:22.140> that<00:03:22.590> exists

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
triangle-shaped compression that exists

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.410 
triangle-shaped compression that exists
in<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.160> lower<00:03:23.340> half<00:03:23.580> of<00:03:23.640> our<00:03:23.910> packs<00:03:24.150> and

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
in the lower half of our packs and

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.390 
in the lower half of our packs and
you'll<00:03:24.900> see<00:03:25.080> by<00:03:25.290> wrenching<00:03:26.010> in<00:03:26.100> on<00:03:26.250> this

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
you'll see by wrenching in on this

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.630 
you'll see by wrenching in on this
system<00:03:26.940> I'm<00:03:27.600> able<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:27.930> pull<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.560> load<00:03:28.799> in<00:03:29.100> to

system I'm able to pull the load in to

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.640 
system I'm able to pull the load in to
the<00:03:29.730> iliac<00:03:30.060> crest<00:03:30.330> shelf<00:03:30.600> waist<00:03:30.810> belt<00:03:31.080> and<00:03:31.200> the

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
lumbar pad back behind Luke's back we've

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.100 
lumbar pad back behind Luke's back we've
got<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.410> nice<00:03:34.680> seamless<00:03:35.430> contact<00:03:36.239> from<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.930> top

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
got a nice seamless contact from the top

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.900 
got a nice seamless contact from the top
of<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.290> shoulder<00:03:37.620> straps<00:03:37.920> all<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.670> way<00:03:38.760> down

the back panel into the hip belt I think

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
the back panel into the hip belt I think
we've<00:03:41.459> done<00:03:41.580> a<00:03:41.640> pretty<00:03:41.820> good<00:03:41.940> job<00:03:42.060> of
