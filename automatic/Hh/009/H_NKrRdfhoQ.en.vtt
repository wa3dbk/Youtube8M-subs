00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
wind screen and we see that I've just

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.400 
wind screen and we see that I've just
taken<00:01:48.970> it<00:01:49.210> off<00:01:49.390> so<00:01:50.110> we've<00:01:50.320> got<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.710> light<00:01:50.920> now

there is coming stake through the
windscreen<00:01:57.160> and<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:59.350> really<00:01:59.590> because<00:01:59.890> I<00:02:00.060> the

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
windscreen and just really because I the

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.520 
windscreen and just really because I the
redhead<00:02:01.420> wasn't<00:02:01.720> strong<00:02:01.990> enough<00:02:02.050> i<00:02:02.410> was

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
redhead wasn't strong enough i was

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.660 
redhead wasn't strong enough i was
losing<00:02:02.740> quite<00:02:03.340> a<00:02:03.400> lot<00:02:03.640> of<00:02:03.790> light<00:02:04.000> and<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:06.070> as

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
losing quite a lot of light and so as

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.030 
losing quite a lot of light and so as
you<00:02:06.880> can<00:02:07.030> see<00:02:07.390> let's<00:02:07.720> say<00:02:07.990> that<00:02:08.350> was<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.590> shot

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
you can see let's say that was the shot

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.520 
you can see let's say that was the shot
there<00:02:09.399> this<00:02:10.270> is<00:02:10.420> quite<00:02:10.720> nice<00:02:10.960> and<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:14.110> can<00:02:14.290> see

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
there this is quite nice and you can see

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.650 
there this is quite nice and you can see
what<00:02:14.710> that<00:02:14.800> light<00:02:15.040> is<00:02:15.100> doing<00:02:15.670> just<00:02:15.820> on<00:02:16.480> the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
what that light is doing just on the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.110 
what that light is doing just on the
side<00:02:16.870> of<00:02:16.930> my<00:02:17.110> neck<00:02:17.290> there<00:02:17.800> I<00:02:18.040> could<00:02:18.550> tweak<00:02:18.820> it<00:02:19.060> a

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
side of my neck there I could tweak it a

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.970 
side of my neck there I could tweak it a
little<00:02:19.330> bit<00:02:19.570> just<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.990> make<00:02:20.050> more<00:02:20.500> of<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:20.890> you

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
little bit just to make more of it you

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.830 
little bit just to make more of it you
can<00:02:21.160> just<00:02:21.190> see<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:21.610> on<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.940> back<00:02:22.120> of<00:02:22.150> my<00:02:22.360> head

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
can just see it on the back of my head

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.740 
can just see it on the back of my head
and<00:02:23.170> if<00:02:23.860> I<00:02:23.980> put<00:02:24.160> my<00:02:24.310> hand<00:02:24.610> up<00:02:24.970> that<00:02:25.300> gives<00:02:25.570> you

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
and if I put my hand up that gives you

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.930 
and if I put my hand up that gives you
an<00:02:25.870> idea<00:02:25.990> of<00:02:26.380> what<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.830> light<00:02:27.010> on<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.460> back<00:02:27.670> is

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
an idea of what the light on the back is

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.380 
an idea of what the light on the back is
doing<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:29.040> it's<00:02:30.040> basically<00:02:30.490> just<00:02:30.580> creating

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
doing and it's basically just creating

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
doing and it's basically just creating
that<00:02:31.600> sort<00:02:31.960> of<00:02:32.050> nice<00:02:32.890> glow<00:02:33.850> on<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.930> back<00:02:35.380> of

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
that sort of nice glow on the back of

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.090 
that sort of nice glow on the back of
the<00:02:35.680> net<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:37.750> can<00:02:37.900> just<00:02:38.080> see<00:02:38.320> it<00:02:38.350> there<00:02:38.650> now<00:02:38.920> on

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
the net you can just see it there now on

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.960 
the net you can just see it there now on
the<00:02:39.250> back<00:02:39.460> of<00:02:39.490> my<00:02:39.820> neck<00:02:39.880> there<00:02:41.459> if<00:02:42.459> I<00:02:42.610> turn<00:02:42.940> this

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
the back of my neck there if I turn this

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.660 
the back of my neck there if I turn this
way<00:02:43.510> I<00:02:43.780> think<00:02:44.110> you<00:02:44.230> can<00:02:44.440> probably<00:02:45.190> again

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
way I think you can probably again

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.370 
way I think you can probably again
so<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.660> just<00:02:46.750> gives<00:02:47.290> a<00:02:47.590> little<00:02:47.620> bit<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:49.380> this

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
so it just gives a little bit and this

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.410 
so it just gives a little bit and this
makes<00:02:50.650> it<00:02:50.800> sort<00:02:51.010> of<00:02:51.100> stand<00:02:51.490> out<00:02:51.730> so<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.120> doesn't

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
makes it sort of stand out so it doesn't

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:59.040 
makes it sort of stand out so it doesn't
sort<00:02:52.570> of<00:02:52.690> disappear<00:02:53.670> oh<00:02:57.209> yeah<00:02:58.209> that's<00:02:58.600> so<00:02:58.870> it's

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
sort of disappear oh yeah that's so it's

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.110 
sort of disappear oh yeah that's so it's
just<00:02:59.170> painting<00:02:59.770> with<00:02:59.950> light<00:02:59.980> just<00:03:00.520> bring<00:03:00.850> in

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
just painting with light just bring in

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.600 
just painting with light just bring in
that<00:03:01.330> area<00:03:01.630> there<00:03:02.020> I<00:03:02.050> think<00:03:02.440> there's<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.800> bit<00:03:03.580> of

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
that area there I think there's a bit of

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.270 
that area there I think there's a bit of
light<00:03:03.970> there<00:03:04.270> so<00:03:04.570> as<00:03:04.660> I<00:03:04.780> move<00:03:05.050> around<00:03:05.280> it

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
light there so as I move around it

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.780 
light there so as I move around it
actually<00:03:06.400> works<00:03:06.940> quite<00:03:07.330> well<00:03:08.070> we<00:03:09.070> round<00:03:09.459> as<00:03:09.670> if

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
actually works quite well we round as if

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.310 
actually works quite well we round as if
I<00:03:09.940> was<00:03:10.060> shuffling<00:03:10.480> around<00:03:10.630> in<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.080> glove

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
I was shuffling around in the glove

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:18.030 
I was shuffling around in the glove
compartment<00:03:11.489> and<00:03:15.000> yeah<00:03:16.350> that<00:03:17.350> works<00:03:17.650> quite

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
compartment and yeah that works quite

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.410 
compartment and yeah that works quite
well<00:03:18.070> quite<00:03:18.670> happy<00:03:19.090> with<00:03:19.120> that<00:03:19.620> okay<00:03:20.620> so

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
well quite happy with that okay so

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.820 
well quite happy with that okay so
that's<00:03:22.420> that<00:03:22.750> I<00:03:22.989> think<00:03:23.230> we're<00:03:23.440> about<00:03:23.590> done

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
that's that I think we're about done

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.380 
that's that I think we're about done
that<00:03:24.459> I<00:03:25.080> might<00:03:26.080> do<00:03:26.410> another<00:03:26.680> set<00:03:27.670> up<00:03:27.940> as<00:03:28.180> well

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
that I might do another set up as well

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.380 
that I might do another set up as well
