 leave the temple of time I told you 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.289
 I was going to do a selection process 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.450
 a kind of casting to choose a 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.340
 new member of the temple of time 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.960
 first of all it seems that you have the background 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.640
 a little changed because good was 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.550

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.050

 jeep not all together by follow us 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.690
 We were watching little by little 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.699
 knowing a little bit and one this were 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.079
 some of the gifts not for example 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:42.359
 this happened to this because of X carries this 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.530
 of my namesake in July I study brothers 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:46.679
 skynews 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.210
 I'm there seen from me there's a lot of 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:50.069
 things that the acquisition a lot 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.749
 illusion but already those of bottles in the 

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:53.280
 special video of lamadrid que squire 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:56.100
 agreement in this video and I'm going to talk about 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.899
 that casting that I was going to do so that one 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.760
 of you can participate with me in 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.469
 the temple time and have a series 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.719
 own for you about a game of 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.489
 zelda here on the channel first is to get there 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.300
 a little bit of the requirements that they make 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.580
 lack 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.020
 the things that take into account at the time 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.660
 to select one of you from 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.720
 agreement and also I usually comment that the 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:19.170
 game or games you will be able to do 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.600
 memories if you know chosen so it goes 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.700
 there two of the requirements first thing and 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.430
 more important is that you have a channel in 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.900
 youtube because it 's ' one of youtube 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.450
 but you can contact me 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.460
 directly of course and second 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.430
 It has to be a Youtube channel with 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.550
 videos ie stable agreements the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.100
 gameplays discuss it with you so that I 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.200
 will allow to see what work or how 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.050
 you work with the videos as you record 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.000
 how do you comment how do you express yourself as 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.490
 you speak is a series of aspects 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.040
 that will help me choose myself 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.110
 honor simply to be part of the 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.970
 channel you have an image and a 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.040
 right sound is to say I'm not worth 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.290
 have a microphone integrated with the 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.920
 xx computer and a lot of background noise that 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.260
 you hear it wrong to be heard weird or a 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.840
 poor image although the image is a bit 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.030
 less important because neither 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.010
 in high definition and in high quality 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.959
 nothing of that but if a minimum for 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.569
 show if it is heard correctly 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.550
 there is also more or less how it is 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.160
 your playing ability could you triumph 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.050
 of cell or that if three already the company 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.760
 when I count cells it's always better 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.099
 but not because it's the kiss but 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.370
 simply with youtube fences and with 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.800
 videos are commenting playing a 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.620
 good sound image and 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.049
 image and sound 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.090
 because you have more opportunity to 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.670
 participate in the temple of time that 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.840
 basically it's going to be the most 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.549
 important the most selling accounts 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.099
 of who I 'm going to allow more or less 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.769
 see your projection or your future here in the 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.230
 channel of time temple another side 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.030
 every success is going to be age is 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.190
 to say is not the same as I go 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.000
 to reach someone 12 years of 10 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.010
 years obviously not going to do just 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.750
 well or not going to be able to do it 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.690
 also as someone who has more 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.400
 experience and have more more maturity 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:17.069
 responsibility a person of 16 17 18 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.010
 9 20 years up is to say that 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.560
 basically repeat that you have a minimum 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.079
 16 years old if you want to participate you can 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.680
 have if you want 15 years 14 13 efe and 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:31.440
 participate too but that's what it is 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.310
 minus 16 let's say that the one of maturity the 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.590
 responsibilities 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.599
 it will not serve the same as with an age 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.870
 far more superior than if you can have 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:42.760
 15 years and be more responsible and with more 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.489
 maturity that someone of 20 can be 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.140
 perfectly but that you have to 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.700
 show your in your videos of your channel 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.410
 of youtube that's why that first aspect is 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.599
 very important because if with your channel 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.910
 youtube more than prove as mature and 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.220
 of responsible you are with your channel with 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.750
 youtube in general now some things that 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.750
 I will not keep in mind is the 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.450
 where you come from may already be 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.920
 from Spain or from Latin America where 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.540
 be argentina mexico uruguay where 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.700
 that if you want to leave to have the 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.890
 you can see them and gomes with the 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.470
 previous requirements participate and I 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.570
 you can see if you can enter or not 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.300
 obviously like now it's spanish 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.039
 is more than enough so yes 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.110
 after the Spanish because simply 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:28.110
 participate and sometimes have luck 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.590
 look at the video 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:43.080
 but today it would not be seen this the 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.090
 games available for which you can 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.889
 make a series will be to the center fling 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:52.319
 paramÃ©s breaker of ages and now deceased 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.779
 the game boy with once he has been 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:58.169
 selected that is mean weekly has 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:05:00.900
 seen your channel and chose you 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.029
 I have you can choose between one of 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.340
 these three bodies or the center of 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:07.480
 lincoln - we or any of us 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.990
 both now and with the rope 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:14.830
 another little thing like that if you have any ideas in 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.990
 plan to record another game as it can be 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.760
 the inof time again what of some 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.460
 different way somehow more 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.490
 special because you can set a table and that 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.110
 idea I will value it and if I see that it can 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.600
 be some idea because it will make clear you 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.550
 you want so basically that's what the 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.470
 requirements to participate in this 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.180

 experience in my way of speaking and of 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.380
