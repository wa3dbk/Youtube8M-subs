days old or a little bit dirty because

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.370 
days old or a little bit dirty because
it<00:03:05.060> will<00:03:05.269> hold<00:03:05.510> better

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.010 

when<00:03:12.160> you<00:03:12.280> get<00:03:12.490> to<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.760> first<00:03:13.060> front<00:03:13.540> pieces

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
when you get to the first front pieces

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.690 
when you get to the first front pieces
of<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.350> hair<00:03:14.500> you<00:03:14.740> want<00:03:14.920> to<00:03:15.100> make<00:03:15.250> sure<00:03:15.280> that

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
of the hair you want to make sure that

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.270 
of the hair you want to make sure that
you<00:03:15.970> concentrate<00:03:16.390> on<00:03:16.630> these<00:03:16.930> a<00:03:17.080> lot<00:03:17.350> more<00:03:17.590> so

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
you concentrate on these a lot more so

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.010

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
make sure you hold them bit tighter

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.260 
make sure you hold them bit tighter
because<00:03:20.830> they<00:03:21.010> are<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.190> bits<00:03:21.340> that<00:03:21.580> frame<00:03:21.850> the

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
because they are the bits that frame the

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.700

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
to make sure that you take random

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.990 
to make sure that you take random
sections<00:03:32.500> again<00:03:32.770> you<00:03:33.130> could<00:03:33.310> have<00:03:33.490> long<00:03:33.730> bits

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
sections again you could have long bits

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.510 
sections again you could have long bits
or<00:03:34.270> you<00:03:34.420> could<00:03:34.600> have<00:03:34.780> small<00:03:35.170> bits<00:03:35.410> but<00:03:36.100> this<00:03:36.370> is

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
or you could have small bits but this is

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.520 
or you could have small bits but this is
going<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.820> be<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:37.030> bit<00:03:37.180> that<00:03:37.330> you<00:03:37.570> really<00:03:37.960> mess

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
going to be the bit that you really mess

up at the front so don't worry too much

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.040 
up at the front so don't worry too much
about<00:03:40.930> that<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:43.150> now<00:03:43.360> I'm<00:03:43.450> going<00:03:43.660> to<00:03:43.780> do<00:03:43.930> the

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
about that and now I'm going to do the

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.930 
about that and now I'm going to do the
same<00:03:44.290> thing<00:03:44.560> on<00:03:44.710> the<00:03:44.860> other<00:03:44.890> side<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:45.610> I<00:03:45.730> will

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
same thing on the other side and I will

00:03:45.940 --> 00:04:06.520 
same thing on the other side and I will
be<00:03:46.060> back<00:03:46.270> in<00:03:46.540> just<00:03:46.750> a<00:03:46.990> second

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.899 

when<00:04:07.530> you've<00:04:07.680> finished<00:04:07.920> pop<00:04:08.370> some<00:04:08.579> hairspray

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
when you've finished pop some hairspray

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.789 
when you've finished pop some hairspray
and<00:04:09.180> if<00:04:09.299> you<00:04:09.420> feel<00:04:09.719> and<00:04:09.989> then<00:04:10.109> the<00:04:10.349> next<00:04:10.650> step

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
and if you feel and then the next step

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.349 
and if you feel and then the next step
is<00:04:10.859> to<00:04:11.219> run<00:04:11.370> your<00:04:11.549> fingers<00:04:11.969> through<00:04:12.000> your<00:04:12.209> hair

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
is to run your fingers through your hair

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.690 
is to run your fingers through your hair
pulling<00:04:13.109> the<00:04:13.200> hair<00:04:13.409> upwards<00:04:13.829> will<00:04:14.370> create

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
pulling the hair upwards will create

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.430 
pulling the hair upwards will create
more<00:04:14.849> volume<00:04:15.090> and<00:04:15.569> make<00:04:15.750> it<00:04:15.959> really<00:04:16.410> really

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
more volume and make it really really

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.319 
more volume and make it really really
messy<00:04:16.949> which<00:04:17.100> is<00:04:17.220> exactly<00:04:17.699> what<00:04:17.910> we<00:04:18.000> want<00:04:18.180> to

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
messy which is exactly what we want to

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.710
