I'll just take out the ones that are
already<00:03:08.070> peeled<00:03:08.520> one<00:03:15.740> in<00:03:16.740> three<00:03:17.070> seconds

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
already peeled one in three seconds

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.420 
already peeled one in three seconds
sometimes<00:03:18.300> it<00:03:18.480> takes<00:03:18.660> three<00:03:19.080> six<00:03:19.500> ten<00:03:19.920> seconds

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
sometimes it takes three six ten seconds

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.910 
sometimes it takes three six ten seconds
but<00:03:21.000> that's<00:03:21.090> pretty<00:03:21.390> quick<00:03:21.720> once<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.500> finish

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
but that's pretty quick once you finish
