00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:08.550
 Aiko-chan March How is it? 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:12.840
 Actually that iphone 5 then iphone 4 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.470
 It and iphone 5 s a little bit about how it works 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.660
 Ne 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:20.279
 I would like to than 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:24.689
 Well first hit here is iphone 5 here it is iphone 5 s 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.050
 The power is not turned on now, but let's examine the difference of the start for a while 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.050
 Right? 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.689
 Have 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.640
 Yes 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.450
 5 s It is early 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:49.020
 I continued to go to the pie 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.020
 I think that I will start this way together 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:02.920
 It looks like this 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:03.850
 Basically what is different from Suning Hm , cpu is much faster than this 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.970
 I guess it is 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:11.420
 When the speed of computing is fast from 1.5 times the 5 and I have become fast as 2 times 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.940
 And it 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.520
 That graphic performance 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.420
 Well high 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:23.159
 It's like that but this is 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:26.250
 You know such and think in It is a stage normal usage 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:31.050
 iphone 5 is such a high 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:35.780
 I'm not saying that I 'm not like you 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.780
 I can not experience it by trying it now 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.420
 I think it will not change at all 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.760
 Basically yeah people who use iphone 5 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.100
 If that 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.939
 Almost together 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:04.930
 It is almost the same as a natural enemy to use normally 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:10.860
 Toka can see where the trunk what Kachotto heavy 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:16.740
 As long as you have a large number of applications launched and such a scene 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.130
 That Anmarine may not feel like it's good to be defeated 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.470
 Ne 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.400
 Yes 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:27.610
 And just this is a this is iphone 5 but if this is 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.790
 iphone 4 type 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.879
 Neko Iphone 4 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:38.329
 I was using iphone 4 before 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:38.329
 Iphone 4 is a face glass too but it's a chest glass 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.370
 Are met 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.970
 Hey, when I ran stuck to this Hano bicycle 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.550
 and ended up with crunchy gone go in blown away out from iphone holder 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.940
 I will 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.530
 But hey it is a country such as this blame glass 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.480
 Has entered 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.190
 8 years 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.970
 The first history is equipped iphone 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.240
 Well Hey Hey I'd become 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:11.130
 Hey hey still ios is this 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.940
 How old would you be back then I was nostalgic and the time of pure youtube 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.520
 I app 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.030
 There was this time 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.030
 Thickness 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.880
 Thickness yeah 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.980
 5 s is slightly thinner- 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.580
 2 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:31.970
 The size of the screen is quite obvious 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:35.110
 After all, So In still differences in the size of the screen 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.110
 This one 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:49.120
 The goodness of response is obvious at first sight compared to this 4 type 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:52.980
 I'd screen large changes to the I motif is because it is along the width guess I think that there is no 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.500
 Well that model change a to from this book type 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.500
 5 s to kneaded by those who have no idea 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.960
 That very 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.960
 That 's good, how is that weight? 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.780
 Weight is also light for cats 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:23.230
 ano ang
