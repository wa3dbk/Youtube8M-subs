 routines he already learned everything but still 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.130

 that a pirouette 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.080

 this great a little more smile the 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.490
 next cool and I was thinking that it 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.600
 can make some changes to the routine 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.600
 since it is somewhat old-fashioned 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.939
 i 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:07.509
 outdated I would not say this maybe 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.640
 traditional but that's what we want 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.830
 ok we chose the words what I wanted 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.720
 to say is that we make it bolder more 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.459
 intense and aggressive 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.670
 you want to make it more chic and chic and boom 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.670
 bum 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.960
 If that's not what I wanted, I hope it does not 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.540
 I do not want to see that again 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.810
 it was a thought keep your mind 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.160
 open believe me I know what I'm doing 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.500
 there's no way we lose that 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.450
 competition I can not believe that 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.310
 let's lose that competition 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.709
 but the important thing is that we participate 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.010
 is what is required to get the 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:47.099
 credit someone signs this 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.930
 and it's great to have a trophy that 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.120
 will prove to your mom that the lessons of 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.900
 singing were not in vain 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.900
 I'm going to save it 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.740
 and at least we classify for 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.510
 regional the next let's do 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:05.269
 most popular dance moves 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.269
 he does not know the charleston and the indian 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.420
 and if we do other dance moves 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.650
 with a new index fix happy people 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.280
 pípi like that 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.060
 and my heart beats like that 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.750
 I vote to do it well there's no 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.020
 vote because I'm the captain and that's not 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:34.810
 is to do a cappella true soon yi 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.810
 tang in santiago for the chaco 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.720
 it gives me the reason 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:45.250
 Alice, how important is that for you? 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.019
 I make suggestions I want you to win insurance 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.180
 it's not because you're a famous star 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.690
 pop and you think you know more than the 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.900
 captain of the club I did not say that but let's go 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.980

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.980
 more scenarios than you
