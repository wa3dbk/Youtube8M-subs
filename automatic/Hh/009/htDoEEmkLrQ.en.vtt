00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
to make it easier to load is hands on

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.030 
to make it easier to load is hands on
enough<00:01:46.579> edge<00:01:46.759> because<00:01:47.149> this<00:01:47.450> uh<00:01:47.920> what's<00:01:48.920> that

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
enough edge because this uh what's that

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.539 
enough edge because this uh what's that
a<00:01:49.159> puppy<00:01:49.610> tell<00:01:49.850> it<00:01:50.390> goes<00:01:50.570> up<00:01:51.040> it's<00:01:52.040> not<00:01:52.490> a

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
hopper it's just a 45 degree elbow to

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.459 
hopper it's just a 45 degree elbow to
make<00:01:57.259> it<00:01:57.380> easier<00:01:57.680> to<00:01:57.740> load<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.100> dots<00:01:58.310> it

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
make it easier to load the dots it

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:05.319 
make it easier to load the dots it
followed<00:02:00.469> by<00:02:00.710> an<00:02:00.890> end<00:02:01.130> cap<00:02:01.310> here<00:02:02.140> so<00:02:03.159> yeah<00:02:04.299> so<00:02:05.299> i

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
followed by an end cap here so yeah so i

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.749 
followed by an end cap here so yeah so i
can<00:02:05.630> put<00:02:06.229> put<00:02:06.590> on<00:02:06.680> a<00:02:06.710> barrel<00:02:07.189> of<00:02:07.219> any<00:02:07.490> length
