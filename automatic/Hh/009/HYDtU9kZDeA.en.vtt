00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.790 

make<00:02:21.110> an<00:02:21.230> image<00:02:23.890> widget<00:02:24.890> I<00:02:25.370> thought<00:02:26.209> of<00:02:26.800> its

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
make an image widget I thought of its

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.780 
make an image widget I thought of its
lock<00:02:27.980> screen<00:02:28.250> widgets<00:02:28.550> here<00:02:29.440> out<00:02:30.440> there<00:02:30.800> and

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
lock screen widgets here out there and

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:41.940 
lock screen widgets here out there and
when<00:02:32.600> you<00:02:32.780> push<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.230> bottom<00:02:33.530> it<00:02:34.220> sucks

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.300 

so<00:02:42.819> on<00:02:44.010> in<00:02:45.010> my<00:02:45.160> opinion<00:02:45.370> I<00:02:45.640> think<00:02:45.670> it's<00:02:46.060> the

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
so on in my opinion I think it's the

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.180 
so on in my opinion I think it's the
data<00:02:48.330> 4.0<00:02:49.330> launcher<00:02:49.959> ice<00:02:50.470> cream<00:02:50.739> sandwich<00:02:51.069> i

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
data 4.0 launcher ice cream sandwich i

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.360 
data 4.0 launcher ice cream sandwich i
think<00:02:51.400> it's<00:02:51.840> it's<00:02:52.840> good<00:02:53.319> but<00:02:53.890> i<00:02:53.950> think<00:02:54.280> it

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
think it's it's good but i think it

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.360 
think it's it's good but i think it
there's<00:02:54.580> better<00:02:54.849> launchers<00:02:55.269> maybe<00:02:55.720> logic<00:02:56.110> pro

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
there's better launchers maybe logic pro

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.830 
there's better launchers maybe logic pro

maybes idea i installed the spb shell

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.970 
maybes idea i installed the spb shell
here<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:04.750> see<00:03:04.930> what<00:03:05.080> it<00:03:05.140> looks<00:03:05.290> like<00:03:06.599> it<00:03:07.599> looks

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
here you see what it looks like it looks

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.970 
here you see what it looks like it looks
pretty<00:03:09.450> similar<00:03:10.450> to<00:03:10.660> that<00:03:10.900> one<00:03:11.080> but<00:03:11.680> i<00:03:11.709> think

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
pretty similar to that one but i think

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.470 
pretty similar to that one but i think
it's<00:03:12.129> it's<00:03:13.060> not<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.470> experience<00:03:14.470> it's<00:03:14.650> smoother

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
it's it's not a experience it's smoother

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.430 
it's it's not a experience it's smoother
it's<00:03:16.480> good<00:03:17.349> looking<00:03:17.709> at<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.630> surface<00:03:19.630> all<00:03:20.380> the

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
just hung up to this I think it's not

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.600 
just hung up to this I think it's not
experienced<00:03:40.030> its<00:03:40.650> is<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:41.709> taste<00:03:42.040> of<00:03:42.160> course<00:03:42.400> but

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
experienced its is a taste of course but

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.949 
experienced its is a taste of course but
I<00:03:44.910> think<00:03:45.910> it's<00:03:46.030> not<00:03:46.150> a<00:03:46.180> thing<00:03:46.359> if<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.630> can<00:03:46.780> tell

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
I think it's not a thing if you can tell

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.809 
I think it's not a thing if you can tell
another<00:03:47.730> another<00:03:48.730> launcher<00:03:49.799> and<00:03:50.799> it<00:03:50.980> you<00:03:51.519> can
