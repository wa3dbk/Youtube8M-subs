 which is even the title of this video 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.640
 here has nothing to do with the title of this 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.710
 video and I guarantee you are super curious 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.670

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.420
 both the guys who play professional 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.670

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.339
 end of it he will elect the best team 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.130
 and if the best championship team goes to 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.260
 another country is to represent brazil 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.479
 and this year was no different had already 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.310

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.700
 and what is going to happen 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.709
 first time here in Brazil is I do not know 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.799
 if they have already progressed on the site because 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.540
 I received this news the day before it is 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.489
 in your schedule that they will like it today 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.140
 but it should probably already be there in the 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.200
 their website explaining how 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.020
 it works 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.370
 This championship is very very 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.590
 Nice, I was very happy to 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.380
 know that everyone's opportunity 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.590
 participate and who knows 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.840
 together with his clan is to win twenty 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.060
 three thousand reais each 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.610
 It's a lot of money, it's a lot of money. 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.100

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.330
 competitive scenario make a game that he 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.560
 be enough because after all I 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.060
 I think that's what the game needs 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.060
 needs to have a competitive landscape is 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.740
 very strong for the game and move on 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.780
 also catch this picture play and 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.030
 compete that I think is very 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.190
 fun and very cool, that's right people 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.350
