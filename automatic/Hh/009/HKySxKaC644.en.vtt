3<00:00:48.840> need<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.500> little<00:00:49.770> help<00:00:50.070> with<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.340> tonal

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
3 need a little help with the tonal

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.959 
3 need a little help with the tonal
quality<00:00:51.860> so<00:00:52.860> they<00:00:52.980> have<00:00:53.100> one<00:00:53.280> built<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.730> which

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
quality so they have one built in which

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.720 
quality so they have one built in which
is<00:00:54.149> readily<00:00:54.449> accessible<00:00:55.370> and<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.489> first

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
is readily accessible and the first

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.760 
is readily accessible and the first
thing<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:56.969> do<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.840> set<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.079> tone<00:00:58.350> control

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
thing to do is to set the tone control

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.549 
thing to do is to set the tone control
to<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.070> center<00:00:59.430> click<00:00:59.609> position<00:01:00.050> set<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.199> EQ

to the center click position set the EQ

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.770 
to the center click position set the EQ
on<00:01:01.800> your<00:01:01.949> external<00:01:02.219> amplifier<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:03.449> make<00:01:03.629> the
