00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
 i 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.110
 Y 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.180
 we will explain how to try 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.750
 counteract the departure of the ball in a 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.510
 in a 231 first we will explain if your 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.430
 team plays 231 as try to overcome 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.609
 not to put in difficulty a rival who 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.670
 play at 231 start them what they 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:28.520
 interesting is to be able to divide your tip with 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.260
 its two central and therefore therefore its 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.590
 intention is probably to get 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.930
 drive and fix your tip to carry 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.640
 on the other side and overcome over here then 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.920
 the free space they will find it 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.900
 over here our intention as is 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.000
 tradition is to try difficulty in those 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.890
 open spaces then what will finish what 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.190
 what we will end up doing is that when 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.290
 this one has fixed to a central and we know 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.140
 this is going to play somewhere else to do 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.790
 jump to this from here quickly to 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.399
 have the 2 against 2 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.160
 here in here behind initial problems 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:04.309
 because you'll leave it free to the 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.040
 lateral or the band that we have released to 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.960
 jump to the local another central and then 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.820
 because they could get to play with him 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.220
 because you're free space if you 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.890
 we do well because we will finish jumping 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.740
 to our center with one of their bands 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.720
 and the other center will take a mark worth 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.030
 Therefore, as soon as he receives, he can not 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.980
 play with this one because it will have the mark or 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.170
 lest he play he will have difficulty and 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.510
 Well, it is thrown with the tip because 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.290
 had we will have someone caught in 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.670
 change if we play a 321 and 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.230
 we play against an opponent that played 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.540
 3-1 since what I propose is start 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.970
 place the tip for example 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.030
 covering the exit between the central and the 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.729
 band to a pivot make us jump out of the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.729
 same way and put our other 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.590
 pivot with the center midfielder with 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.920
 side bands with central bands with 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.630
 point and from here then or what 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.250
 we put this way so that it does not 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.009
 can leave in any way or we can 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.200
 get to place one of the two a 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.640
 farther away inviting you to 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.060
 play with the left center in this 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.890
 case and now they play so fast 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.830
 discourage this pass line and come to 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.680
 for him and this one here will come to cover 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.170
 baseline of central with central 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.209
 he will decide according to how he sees it if he come to 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.519
 do two against one or if you're 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.230
 just in line of pass to avoid 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.810
 On the one hand, they can play with it 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.579
 and that if I get too close and this one 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.920
 they are in a position to play, maybe maybe 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.019
 they finished surpassing and they will happen to me here 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.120
 so according to how they see it 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.519
 the tip he will decide if to come to two 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.709
 against one and you can recover or if you are 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.209
 in between and prevent us from 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.310
 leave by the end what interests us 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.310
 is to avoid rival's spaces 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.999
