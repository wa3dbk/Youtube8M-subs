00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.480
 Snails are often unwanted visitors 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.009
 in your garden you have house snails and 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.530
 slugs and in particular the latter 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.240
 group can become quite a scourge 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.250
 there are a few things that you do 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.810
 in your garden can do something about those snails 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.190
 prevent more 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.440
 for example in the spring and 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.470
 tillage so you kill a part 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.000
 of the snails and also some eggs thereof 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.070
 you can make your garden so pathetic 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.530
 possible because how warm your garden 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.070
 how do you transform that soil into the snails 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.050
 have 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.790
 of course also the other way how moist you are 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.780
 always the closer it is overgrown 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.030
 the more 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.680
 snails you'll have you can think too 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.220
 then the snails did not serve plants 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.100
 like it 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.040
 so no breasts go very garden or whole 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.260
 strongly scented plants such as chives 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.010
 plant your garden because there are snails 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.260
 Also not well it will but your garden 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.630
 and he is as it is and on one 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.820
 then you have that snail 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.280
 then of course you want to get rid of it 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.219
 well are a lot of methods 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:12.149
 one of them is beer in a can 

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:14.549
 and you put that in a container that digs 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.340
 then a small piece 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.740
 I love the beer and it 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.959
 okay so not quite drowning now 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.530
 friendly yes it is a nice one 

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:28.649
 that then can still choose and goals 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.469
 then after having been in use 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.770
 the snails literally from your garden 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:36.060
 picking in a container and somewhere else 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.490
 turn off nature 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.289
 ok it's a little more but it is 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.740
 a very sweet and friendly one 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.149
 way if you want to prevent snails in 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.849
 pots then you can for example also 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.069
 work with eggshells or with 

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:52.469
 shells are both very sharp 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:54.299
 snail not fine at all and you will what 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.579
 no more parts in your garden 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.490
 counted just dry surfaces you 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.279
 actually encounter no snails then 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:07.600
 another very funny tire so buyer 

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:12.730
 strip copper tape that is a type of tape 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.260
 that slice so around the pot under the 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.569
 topside 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.610
 as soon as a snail arrives then it gets 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.950
 a kind of very small mini shock 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.989
 and goes back to me with this piece 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.970
 do n't bother you either 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.950
 furthermore you can also ensure that the 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.569
 natural enemies just subside 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.739
 your garden can think of and 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.780
 shrews 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.120
 hedgehogs and especially the birds and those 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.130
 really love snails so you have snails 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.260
 in your garden you can also choose to 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.260
 for example, some bird houses obdam
