00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.019
 that's a citizen complaint and it happened yesterday at night it was 10 o'clock 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.339
 30 and two housewives were able to laundry from the neighborhood yard located 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.530
 in the street of insurgents and they found themselves when opening the stopcock 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.590
 with a surprise 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.590
 that came out of this key 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.590
 until it goes to the general bartola 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.470
 then I realized that a snake had fallen on the pile then 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.900
 they were not amanda together and I told him not to put his hand back because he just 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.470
 fall a snake 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.810
 so here I grabbed and told him let's see 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.579
 to tell my husband to take out the lamp to light what kind of 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.530
 snake axes then 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.590
 He took out the lamp and we saw that it was a lillo priest 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.740
 then it's water we use for the frets and 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.360
 to wash vegetables and 400 after 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.720
 7 initial to see what kind of water 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.740
 now we are 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.800
 we are occupying citizens 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.680
 this to see what p 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.920
 well that is efficient and why they do not charge it as drinking water because it is not 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.020
 fair
