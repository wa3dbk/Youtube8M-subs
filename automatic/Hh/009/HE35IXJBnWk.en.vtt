00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.719
 with you another proof 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.040
 amazing ability of our vision 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.199
 perceive the world not as we are 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.630
 used to seeing him i want to show you 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.670
 the illusion with which you can easily 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.970
 deceive our vision with you using 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.490
 the usual piece of paper in the description of the video you 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.730
 find a link to the pattern download 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.850

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.300
