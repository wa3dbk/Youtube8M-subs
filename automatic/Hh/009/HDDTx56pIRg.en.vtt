00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.770
 I'll show you a little bit today . 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:10.170
 supermarket here in london 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.830
 you can see if it is a large market 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.480
 marry a large network calls 101 and 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.130
 so this is where it is open 24 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.740
 hours 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.260
 he used in training to show for 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.199
 You a little like the supermarkets 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.099
 here in London and how it works 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.560
 mainly as it is according to price 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.250
 in fact it does not have much difference that 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.070
 on the Brazilian market 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.890
 basically same year same way 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.910
 the evaluation of the optimum of farmers is that 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:49.260
 fruit vegetables as equipment 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:53.430
 that one up ahead has one more 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.820
 instant the instant they put the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.620
 soldiers who are winning 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.199
 that is to say with validity and that 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.769
 Winning today I'm selling for 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.930
 half the price of 50% to export to that 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.320
 do we can take advantage of this 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.320
 Portuguese 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:31.290
 so today it is cheaper than 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:34.400
 never in a sp 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:43.250
 the client can take advantage of the promotion 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:52.290
 but all are dated today 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:54.270
 is already an option of the customer in the 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.880
 first world countries 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.329
 they feel much consumption as 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.280
 you have more better for him 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.420
 better for the population that generates more 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.380
 job 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.610
 before they talk about everything to take with you 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.780
 bring more products 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.709
 for example here I am here is a is a 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.629
 immobile 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:21.000
 but if you buy 22 paulo 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:24.180
 you have a discount if you bring more 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.420
 always has the esteem of promotion for 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.910
 encourage you will buy buy mother 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.230
 forever more until something else 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.819
 interesting there is a very 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.209
 great 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:40.590
 the first world against others 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:42.920
 countries like Brazil is that most of the 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.010
 prices here in this market for example 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:50.819
 are below five pounds and many many 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:54.510
 of them is the low of 1 paulo tried type 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:57.150
 thus 40% and 50% of the products markets 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.590
 down from a paulo 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:06.750
 or start here 76 in st speaks who 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.900
 He knows how to win cents and ninety-two. 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.900
 cents 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:21.450
 here already at 99 87 cents 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:23.790
 eighty-nine cents or many 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.160
 points below a center of fire of a 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.240
 on palms 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:32.100
 if you compare this to those with 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.610
 prices of laws eg several 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.900
 Brazilian markets you will find 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.790
 Japanese down many products below 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.240
 real in no way 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.510
 There is a great difference of power between 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.790
 purchase of the pound da 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.670
 real purchase 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.820
 if you give a thousand books for example 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.860
 one to one in English and violent and one thousand 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.720
 for Brazilian shopping 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.280
 logically with this weight that are 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:04.050
 seeing here 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.959
 English will buy many more products 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:11.100
 What will Brazil buy there? 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:13.500
 difference of a first world country 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.560
 where I am a citizen has access to 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.850
 prices up to those rules for products 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:25.020
 of basic consumption and where still in Brazil 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.090
 this happens are very accessible 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.830
 I got most of my money 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:36.470
 protected from 8 10.15 pa to the 760 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:38.700
 sure that none of 50 cents 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.760
 The big difference is that the big 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.820
 difference showing this 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:48.870
 the Brazilian could tell us how it is 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:52.080
 it works because it is that is your 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.770
 salary have your salary you can 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.130
 purchase 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.110
 and when you have no relation to your 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:03.120
 salary 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:04.260
 the family that, for example, is 5 90 per 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.870
 hour 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.130
 You're the only one I told you that 44 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.720
 week hours 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:17.070
 This is the case where Brazil receives it and the 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:21.780
 those 41 40 pounds plus or minus a month 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:27.420
 the study of expression came here to do 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:28.680
 that he must survive without much 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.260
 difficulty 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.990
 I'm talking about the minimum wage but neither 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.210
 everybody thinks of me here 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.700
 the majority is more than a minimum wage 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.910
 only our skilled workforce 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:45.570
 unskilled labor force and 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.880
 yet few people think that 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:52.320
 the average salary that normal is 1500 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:54.420
 and EUR 2 000 per month and a product 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.730
 with the price and the times you have seen 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.700
 who knows the prices can imagine 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:04.490
 with how much people can buy with 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.490
 salary that has 1500 euros per month
