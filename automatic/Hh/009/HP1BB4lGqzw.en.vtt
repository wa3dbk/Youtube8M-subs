00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.930
 good afternoon dear friends with you 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:12.219
 tourist play clan platoon with plans 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.840
 17 ours I am on the tank t-44 card we have live 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.789
 oks 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.970
 from the stage we will see a huge pile of cords in 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.550
 both teams considered very hard 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.259
 Now we need to decide what to do. 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.890
 down by rail we are likely 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:29.259
 let's not go the fact is that there follows 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.119
 walk in case the setup 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.970
 very tired for example on each side 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.880
 5 stitch if you do not go ti5 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.590
 Allied stacks may blunt faces for 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.090
 two minutes literally 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.010
 and nothing is done 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.080
 just the opponent of the floor will abruptly get 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.640
 big advantage therefore in such 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.970
 cases of course should go through 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.640
 the forest here is not entirely desirable 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.620
 so as you understand these yarns too 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.510
 how many enemy will be there 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.820
 it is not clear it can be for example five 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.800
 or six it will come and we will just 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.250
 stand against them do not have their chances 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.070
 to kill 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.809
 it's not like what we want to see in 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.570
 this battle by our platoon we want all the same 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.550
 drag the fight and not stand it idle 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.500
 so we play through the city for now 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.770
 notice where I go without a position 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.480
 not quite obvious of course but very 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.930
 useful and at the beginning of the battle if you play 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.430
 to be standard 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.740
 about here, but there are a lot of options 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.150
 become another house 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.450
 the meaning of this first can be done here 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.450
 So 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.690
 for the first who came it themselves 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.780
 you understand it is dangerous there is a small risk that 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.540
 they will kill you so much you need here 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.980
 play carefully 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.620
 the second moment of this position I will show a little 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.870
 later the leopard killed our firefly 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.770
 teddy bear barrels they were catch just one 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.570
 art technically speaking 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.580
 the second point these positions are that i 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.940
 I can shoot the traps that go to 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.760
 city 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.850
 I quickly came here first I here 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.990
 I look into the hole between the houses 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.390
 here of course a small sector of fire 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.170
 and uncomfortable tambler such that not all 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.850
 fired upon 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.630
 you can actually drive there 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.300
 the edge to get out of here 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:16.240
 but still regularly someone here 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.270
 you can catch now waiting and looking not 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.020
 understand anyone here put on it 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.810
 a couple 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.350
 freebie shot its after all 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.350
 second shot 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.580
 He and so long as it is still going on, I 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.490
 tell you more toxic moment 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.180
 ecstatic setting what to do on and 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.290
 screed problem with stage very hard 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.569
 ride through it like i say 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.080
 guess what you get there a bunch of theory all you 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.350
 stand i can run away okay i'm t-44 i 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.840
 quickly turned back and dumped and 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:53.400
 test diamond and side ride 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.080
 neatly I'll come down 44 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.120
 I see that there is a crowd of strands 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.310
 nothing shines I can leave a platoon 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.790
 you know they are slower tanks 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.700
 they just lose most of their time fighting 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.660
 in vain for riding back and forth in the city that 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.330
 do on and screed 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.430
 can not go to fight, too tyazhem 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.480
 a lot of us certainly will tricks but 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.730
 it was easy frags 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.080
 you less armor less hp us simpler 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.550
 kill accordingly what is it not 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.640
 just get out on these same ones immediately 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.660
 the coffin so here you see I 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.180
 standing on the side 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.760
 Our t69 also did about the same 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.489
 Well, so little firing from 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.100
 at the beginning of the fight in such acetate scary 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.980
 roles like this a little bit to try 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.480
 shoot the enemy to not get 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.269
 too big with superiority 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.590
 what about our such impact 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:44.000
 just shoot and now here I am 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.799
 I am going to change the flank of our t69 catches 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.690
 it 's still a leopard 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.900
 Arta swears we get honest 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.700
 Speaking a little bit , we won't 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.859
 chasing actually for the firefly 6 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.650
 get a splash risk to spend time 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:00.269
 To be honest, 670 damage was dealt. 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.920
 can see from above i doubt that 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.390
 this art shoots more you just 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.579
 really doubters chased after 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:10.290
 leopards usual inflicted so themselves 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:12.420
 understand the meaning of doing this but then I 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.160
 changed the clang here and since I noticed 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.930
 that the enemy has a low undercut 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.510
 a lot of ours are fine here and they even 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.970
 don't die too so i decided 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.250
 fast here come here to the enemy 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.080
 back and quickly sell to the flank 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.970
 to win the fight 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.740
 I thought it was easier to do than 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.680
 the city since the city is in the first floors 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.500
 ok drove quite a lot of them there 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.389
 no less than in fact and secondly 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.550
 I saw the battlefield there first and I stood there 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:44.569
 drying insisted on a hill in the bushes and 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.849
 it created a little difficulty 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:50.840
 bypassing through a target line for example 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:52.789
 even through line b this maneuver is my 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.030
 surroundings in the city could end 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:58.159
 getting candy with 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.919
 unexpected and with each bush knight 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:02.690
 but also walk a little twitch you play 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.419
 the swing is actually tower art art is unlikely 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.840
 Does it shoot me down? I'm afraid that 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.440
 issue 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.569
 seeing how t69 butted she could 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.360
 go down to the water drive for example 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:16.419
 square and 4 or for example f4 during this time 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.310
 I, too, throw my splat 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:21.760
 There is simply I was afraid therefore did such 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:25.150
 cheats movement 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.640
 here we see here flank we break 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.860
 participation was really small here I am 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.770
 a little late 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:35.620
 it is limited but here as 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.900
 says guess the other side of the map 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.820
 you can see what is happening but 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.380
 less anyway sped t69 anyway 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:46.120
 I killed the Chinese by going around and now I see 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.480
 that the city merges now on you 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:53.320
 make the speediest on the way i will charge 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:58.360
 arch and then go kill the forest and heavy 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:06:03.130
 the city is not like that 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:06.160
 some kind of kill my Russian 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:08.500
 the impact on will be very large but I took off 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.480
 this is how it seemed to me 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.450
 interesting precisely tactical 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.720
 component of what I talked about 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:18.730
 what to do in the beginning nye stitches in such 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.610
 You think it 's hard on this map 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.950
 here's a careful and side slicing like 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.910
 talked about changing flank as you can 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:29.080
 see at the moment of choice change flank 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.960
 for example there was still a moment about which 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.640
 I thought it was possible to go in the center 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.710
 diagonal cards when everything is already 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.990
 resorbed their city and right there 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.720
 fishing line could be for these houses and too 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.460
 kill for example words but why such 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.330
 done because we are here a little bit 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.300
 considered tact 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.540
 and someone could not find it could be 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.920
 what did su sitting there still on the knoll 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.780
 so this is also a moment thought and 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.660
 didn't go 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:07:00.320
 so I choose fairly stable 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:03.500
 Now we see that our and vein screeds fight 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.120
 suited to its end we are here 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.070
 did the most important thing that could be 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.790
 make we survived and now we are calm 

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:13.250
 just roll these 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:15.199
 as they say the beginning of the battle debut it 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.240
 and 100 rubles quickly and taking a position for 

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:18.500
 causing free damage such positions 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.020
 from on almost any card 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.820
 if she showed you one of them of course 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:26.270
 ideal but in principle can serve 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:28.510
 this goal on the knife, which is more accurate 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.770
 there ask you to play collect what to go 

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:32.330
 the middle of the battle is some more 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.220
 decisive action for example hooray change 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.560
 flank unexpectedly some sort of passage 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:40.270
 somewhere killing someone who walks 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:42.639
 small group and the end of the battle is already 

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:44.600
 realization of our speed advantage 

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:47.120
 maneuverability ability to play 

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:51.080
 team finishes punched tyazhy 

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:52.850
 enemy who long fought long 

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:56.740
 Our honey and example provided this 

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.740
 the city is now just and finish off 

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.250
 Thank you for the attention of a successful bl
