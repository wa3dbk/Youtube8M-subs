at<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.399> stitching<00:00:50.789> right<00:00:51.420> here<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:53.010> there

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
at the stitching right here that there

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.510 
at the stitching right here that there
is<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:54.000> thin<00:00:54.600> layer<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.870> ostrich<00:00:55.469> skin<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.039> it's

is a thin layer of ostrich skin and it's

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.459 
is a thin layer of ostrich skin and it's
actually<00:00:56.760> wrapped<00:00:57.329> around<00:00:57.539> some<00:00:58.109> synthetic

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
actually wrapped around some synthetic

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.560 
actually wrapped around some synthetic
living<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.430> think<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.850> outside<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.449> this

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
living so I think the outside of this

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.100 
living so I think the outside of this
ears<00:01:01.309> authentic<00:01:02.309> ostrich<00:01:03.000> skin<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.750> its

ears authentic ostrich skin and its

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.050 
ears authentic ostrich skin and its
really<00:01:04.350> really<00:01:04.589> thin<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.400> doesn't<00:01:05.700> cost<00:01:05.850> a

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
really really thin so it doesn't cost a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.940 
really really thin so it doesn't cost a
lot<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.270> money<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.900> inside<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.740> is

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
lot of money and the inside of it is

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.190
