I have you decided what this train is
going<00:00:54.940> to<00:00:55.089> look<00:00:55.300> like<00:00:55.539> yet<00:00:55.870> so<00:00:56.489> we'll

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
going to look like yet so we'll

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.369 
going to look like yet so we'll
experiment<00:00:58.089> around<00:00:58.179> maybe<00:00:58.780> a<00:00:58.899> couple<00:00:59.289> of

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
experiment around maybe a couple of

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.549 
experiment around maybe a couple of
these<00:00:59.559> in<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.190> bag<00:01:00.429> some<00:01:01.210> trailers<00:01:01.870> I'll<00:01:02.229> put

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
these in the bag some trailers I'll put

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.530 
these in the bag some trailers I'll put
a<00:01:02.589> couple<00:01:02.769> of<00:01:02.979> those<00:01:03.100> up<00:01:03.159> here<00:01:03.639> just<00:01:04.269> to<00:01:04.390> kind

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
a couple of those up here just to kind

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.510 
a couple of those up here just to kind
of<00:01:04.659> show<00:01:04.720> basically<00:01:05.590> is<00:01:06.070> what<00:01:06.280> you're<00:01:06.310> trying

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
of show basically is what you're trying

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.810 
of show basically is what you're trying

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
to do meat vegetable starch so basically

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.030 
to do meat vegetable starch so basically
the<00:01:10.090> meat<00:01:10.360> is<00:01:10.509> like<00:01:10.659> the<00:01:10.810> focal<00:01:11.290> point<00:01:11.560> what

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
the meat is like the focal point what

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.620 
the meat is like the focal point what
you're<00:01:12.219> trying<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:12.549> do<00:01:12.790> and<00:01:13.060> then<00:01:13.509> the

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
you're trying to do and then the

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.600 
you're trying to do and then the
vegetable<00:01:14.170> would<00:01:14.320> be<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:14.740> filler<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.310> plant

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
vegetable would be the filler the plant

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.130 
vegetable would be the filler the plant
that<00:01:15.729> kind<00:01:15.939> of<00:01:16.030> covers<00:01:16.360> up<00:01:16.479> a<00:01:16.600> lot<00:01:16.630> of<00:01:16.810> space

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
that kind of covers up a lot of space

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.020 
that kind of covers up a lot of space
and<00:01:17.439> then<00:01:17.799> finally<00:01:18.280> you<00:01:18.460> would<00:01:18.549> have<00:01:18.790> the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
and then finally you would have the

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.240 
and then finally you would have the
starch<00:01:19.360> and<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.780> potato<00:01:20.140> or<00:01:20.439> whatever<00:01:21.100> will

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
starch and the potato or whatever will

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.370 
starch and the potato or whatever will
be<00:01:21.310> on<00:01:21.399> the<00:01:21.520> side<00:01:21.759> to<00:01:21.969> kind<00:01:22.090> of<00:01:22.240> hang<00:01:22.719> over<00:01:23.200> the

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
be on the side to kind of hang over the

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.399 
be on the side to kind of hang over the
side<00:01:23.680> in<00:01:24.039> this<00:01:24.280> pot<00:01:24.520> we've<00:01:25.000> got<00:01:25.299> our<00:01:25.539> meat<00:01:26.200> or

side in this pot we've got our meat or
our<00:01:26.560> focal<00:01:27.070> point<00:01:27.280> it's<00:01:27.520> going<00:01:27.670> to<00:01:27.759> be<00:01:27.880> a<00:01:28.090> bell

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
our focal point it's going to be a bell

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.240 
our focal point it's going to be a bell
pepper<00:01:28.869> plant<00:01:29.229> it's<00:01:29.439> going<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:29.649> come<00:01:29.860> up<00:01:30.039> and

grow and be the focal point it'll be the

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.959 
grow and be the focal point it'll be the
tallest<00:01:32.409> plant<00:01:32.799> in<00:01:32.979> here<00:01:33.189> and<00:01:33.399> on<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.759> side

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
maybe have this as our focal points that

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.850 
maybe have this as our focal points that
is<00:02:32.780> meanie

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
is meanie

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.420

squash right there on the side and I got

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.290 
squash right there on the side and I got
a<00:02:54.530> little<00:02:54.770> bit<00:02:54.890> more<00:02:54.920> space<00:02:55.340> in<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.700> back<00:02:55.730> here

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300

tuck this chili pepper in on the side

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.420 
tuck this chili pepper in on the side
here<00:03:03.290> so<00:03:03.440> it's<00:03:03.650> going<00:03:03.770> to<00:03:03.830> fit<00:03:04.040> in<00:03:04.160> with<00:03:04.340> the

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
here so it's going to fit in with the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.220 
here so it's going to fit in with the
penthouse<00:03:04.880> so<00:03:05.390> we<00:03:05.480> still<00:03:05.690> have<00:03:05.840> our<00:03:05.870> three

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
penthouse so we still have our three

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.930 
penthouse so we still have our three
elements<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:06.710> centerpiece<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.370> focal<00:03:07.730> point

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
elements the centerpiece the focal point

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.790 
elements the centerpiece the focal point
the<00:03:08.180> spreaders<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.020> then<00:03:09.410> we<00:03:09.530> have<00:03:09.650> the

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
the spreaders and then we have the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.590 
the spreaders and then we have the
trailer<00:03:10.070> coming<00:03:10.430> out<00:03:10.520> the<00:03:10.670> side<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.180> if<00:03:11.510> you

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
trailer coming out the side and if you

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.880

the<00:03:14.990> time<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:15.380> plant<00:03:15.709> a<00:03:15.860> container<00:03:16.280> that's

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
the time to plant a container that's

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.550 
the time to plant a container that's
something<00:03:17.240> edible<00:03:17.540> to<00:03:17.810> it<00:03:17.959> because<00:03:18.320> it<00:03:18.470> just

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
something edible to it because it just

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.320 
something edible to it because it just
makes<00:03:18.770> it<00:03:18.890> more<00:03:19.040> useful<00:03:19.340> for<00:03:19.670> you<00:03:19.730> now<00:03:20.150> let's
