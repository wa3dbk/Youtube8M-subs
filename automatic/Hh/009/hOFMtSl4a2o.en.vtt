00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
awesome i think as as smart as they be

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.780 
awesome i think as as smart as they be
and<00:04:52.120> I<00:04:52.180> feel<00:04:52.540> like<00:04:52.720> he's<00:04:53.530> playing<00:04:54.040> against<00:04:54.670> a

and I feel like he's playing against a

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.500 
and I feel like he's playing against a
group<00:04:55.180> of<00:04:55.420> life<00:04:55.900> retarded<00:04:56.650> kids<00:04:56.950> that<00:04:57.850> don't
