00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.670
 The nature of formaldehyde acetaldehyde, which is particularly important among people up to this point 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:11.719
 Explained 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:15.469
 From here you are not limited to that formaldehyde acetaldehyde 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:20.670
 Aldehydes common to all aldehydes 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:24.480
 Speaking about this will continue to the explanation in something is to win was common to all 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:29.790
 This aldehyde is as I explained at the beginning. 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.830
 I think I will be participating further If first class alcohol is oxidized in the first place 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:36.870
 But it is the translation to become aldehyde 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.590
 The fact that I made to the carboxylic acid and say whether there a day is what in is further participation 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.660
 Is it 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.920
 The nature of the aldehyde by say 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:51.190
 In other words, you can participate further 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:55.300
 Furthermore, if you change your language , how can you be involved? 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:01:00.519
 If you say it like that, it means that you give back the other party 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.650
 It is possible that in other words Well the place of is detailed thing is I oxidation-reduction reaction around here 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.059
 so 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:11.240
 It is a detail description of say, but is short oxidation of whether it was in the first place mean 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.690
 In a word, it means that you are deprived of electrons , which was the correct taste of being oxidized 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.470
 So 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:20.300
 When aldehyde is deprived of electrons, it changes to carboxylic acid 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:25.250
 That means you are deprived of electrons If you change the way you give electrons to the other party 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:28.970
 That's why I can say that because I say that I will reduce that 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.710
 Aldehyde has the property of giving electrons to the other party 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:36.840
 In reducing and say what I mean this thing 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:40.140
 The user is why I say that this it is the property of reducing the opponent reducing of high reducing 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:45.270
 Nature of electrons give in to the opponent's 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:50.369
 In saying this with a reducing this is not made to the common nature to people all there of 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.700
 Because it has this common clean and reducing ability , it should be because now it is explained from now on 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.329
 Two hands to do 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.329
 I would like to explain what these two reactions are by pressing 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:06.549
 So It is a reaction that causes Gayueni the aldehyde has a reducing 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:10.149
 There are two, but the first one is the reaction called the Fering reaction. 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.660
 The Ferring reaction is what is called like this a ring station and 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.190
 Say 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.840
 It called the wind that Fehling's reaction to use of this looks blue liquid 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.980
 However, it is a feature of this feeling liquid 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:27.349
 It's a bit mixed and complex, but it's important if you don't understand it 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:31.640
 Dont of which are in the Fehling solution that contains the Sumido ion to say cu 2 + 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:37.430
 It is all right if you understand this thing The cu 2+ is contained in the Fering liquid 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.860
 Cat of co2 + The'm turns blue in aqueous solution and say whether broke off what color to say you are 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.550
 is not it 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.100
 We 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:48.180
 The color of this co2 + is blue, so it is a blue liquid 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.460
 It has such color because it contains this co2 + 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:56.010
 In here now 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:59.910
 We need to add the aldehyde, so we need to add the aldehyde and actually heat it 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:03.390
 If you do so, changes will occur and what changes will occur 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:08.040
 The solution is I'm turns red area will each 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.990
 Well, as I showed you live here, it becomes red, and why is this copper ion 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.480
 It will change gradually 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.090
 To the body 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.360
 Well yeah 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:20.580
 What kind of substance does it change as copper ion changes 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:27.300
 cu say copper oxide parentheses city of 2 o make the change to such material co2 the 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:30.629
 At this time, the color changes from blue to red because this is red, which is cu 2 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.080
 For you see you this see you plus 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:37.300
 In other words the number 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:41.800
 Is 1 and it is changing from +1 to +1 . That means that this oxygen is -2 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:46.600
 So there is a couple of c because it is zero along with it, so plus 1 is 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:49.720
 Now cu 2 + is in the fact that it is not seen from the fact that you say two and 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.069
 changed to see you ++ 1 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.510
 It is change by having people added in this 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:04:00.950
 It is because there is a reason why it changed like this. 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:05.719
 Earlier it is because welcome lead to sex is the reason You're In other words there should be concerned there is a welcome of 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:11.329
 As I explained, it has the property of giving electrons to the partner, that is, aldehyde 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:12.090
 It is good that electron is good minus electron is released from this day 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.390
 In that day 2 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:19.139
 This is what Cu 2+ receives 4 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:23.639
 When in Then was standing on the + receives a -1 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:27.210
 It will be +1 + I will reduce the external reason I will receive a negative tradition 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.480
 So it turns into such a substance called co2 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.340
 The 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:36.090
 The four roles change from blue to color because it changes to a red substance 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.890
 It is not referred to in the wind that Well these were countered Fehling's reaction So from this that 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.240
 This is aldehyde 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:43.440
 Although it has a reducing because it is reducing therefore that I cause this Fehling's reaction 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.470
 Can understand 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:51.640
 Always even aldehyde is this is a common You're what aldehyde 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:56.230
 Because you have a reinjection well then you cause the Fehling's reaction if the aldehyde 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.190
 It is in fact in can cause if this Fehling's reaction anyway substance with a reducing 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.240
 Be able to 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:06.370
 Even if the aldehyde does not come out, it is a reducible substance here 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.460
 This will be the fact that take the Fehling's reaction as long addition Well the typical 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.720
 Hiro in are an example 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.840
 Because there is more aldehyde in the welcome, I will be explaining here 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.840
 Ne 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:25.470
 So aldehyde also this another one of the reaction the reaction caused by welcome resistance and reaction silver mirror 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:29.400
 It is the reaction that I say The silver mirror is the reaction that this is made though this is 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:34.900
 Also including a near I ammoniacal silver nitrate water skimmer is 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:40.660
 And an aqueous solution of nitric acid silver This is based on in ag is in this ne This Is 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:43.870
 + In I silver nitrate So that is the silver ion contains the AG plus gold ion 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:48.310
 Well, I will add the aldehyde here too 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.210
 If you do so, the same thing will happen, and the same thing is in the pool and it is reducible to Hiro 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:54.550
 Because there is 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.889
 In It is the tradition electrons from the aldehyde is released this silver ions 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.379
 received 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:06:02.840
 When the say when it receives at will that take and what if there + is you receive a negative 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:08.810
 So that means that + disappears 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:11.120
 You You're better not read the state was the sound state ordinary atomic state of this silver become a single lawmaker 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:14.880
 It is to be changed to 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:20.670
 It is why the precipitation of lawmakers by say in here now 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.780
 Is written, the is galaxy treatment in sticking it is to just perform and the surface in this test tube 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:26.760
 Here the mass of 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.450
 Such an element that money is made is shown in this figure, but like this 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.080
 To 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:35.789
 I reaction this is I'm a silver mirror reaction called lawmakers to precipitate 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.419
 Electrons to the electronic counterpart to the people in this also there is a reducible to it is still aldehyde 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:41.159
 give 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:46.229
 It is a reaction that occurs because there is an integer, so this silver ion is ammoniacal from Hiro 

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:48.620
 Reaction that God was saying, Well become members to receive the electrons in the silver nitrate aqueous solution ne silver mirror reaction 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:48.620
 That's why
