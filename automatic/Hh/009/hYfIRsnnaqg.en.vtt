00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.660
 youtube safe inspiration in this video 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.309
 I show you how to make this cute 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.590
 small box can do it yourself 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.660
 with a coupon in it that is 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.460
 really easy and is one 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.480
 nice gift maybe paper is 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.960
 to copy this 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.320
 you need a bit of ribbon 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.630
 a little piece of paper where he has something 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.630
 can write on it and outside should 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.710
 the coupon is on it and a blank one 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.510
 so matchbox first 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.899
 the strings box of 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.899
 Inside 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.770
 I now have the box from the inside 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.210
 taped out with washington and here 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.670
 I do not have it all around 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.270
 Tied out with a letter 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.820
 and here can now be 16 and from 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:21.350
 I stick to the bottom of this box 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.350
 Now this little fabric tie down 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.890
 I 'm just doing it the right way 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.170
 so imagine here below, 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.939
 I can pull on that and I stick 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.259
 now with logitech or you can do that 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.250
 of course with something else 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.250
 then stick well 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.090
 Of course, now only the 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.090
 box are glued from the outside nicely 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.020
 to and already is the small coupon 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.360
 I finished already here 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.470
 I live on the outside logitech 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.650
 had a few layers on top of each other 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.790
 because this white one has that 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.560
 a little thrown by 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.170
 that's why I have only a few here 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.530
 layers draufmacht and then another 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.670
 Last, this one with the beautiful 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.590
 Dragonflies and here is the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.940
 writing life and love and so on and 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.340
 here take care of the little one 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.810
 pull a piece and you have it here 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.250
 the coupon and inside that the 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.910
 box really nice too 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.459
 become 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.709
 Of course you can do that in a great many 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.410
 make different colors that 's just 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:19.050
 one possibility this color combination 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.130
 will be black orange white that is 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.200
 maybe even more for adults 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.630
 suitable one can of course the whole 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.690
 also in the beautiful bunch do in all 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.670
 possible bright colors and that 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.470
 then actually fits for everyone you can 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.440
 each such a nice little coupon 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.269
 giving is easy for me personally 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.280
 more beautiful than having your card 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.340
 give it away because somehow it's something 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.090
 especially it is still such a small one 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.250
 Surprise effect by that way 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.900
 a small box is and I think 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.560
 it is very nice it is very simple 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.480
 made also super cheap so cheaper 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.010
 as a postcard or something to buy 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.590
 just a little old strings 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.180
 Glue box and with this 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.130
 small ribbon here so you can do it 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.390
 can pull out that I think gives the 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.190
 all the same a bit 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.769
 special touch that there is one more 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.269
 is and can be on it 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.100
 the course hang you if 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.530
 for example, to one 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.730
 would like to make bouquet with dranhängen 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.440
 sometimes you give flowers like that 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.120
 given away and then in a few 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.160
 small slides or if you have one too 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.530
 one can want to make a gift of money 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.780
 then just do not do the bill around 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.440
 then the whole thing goes to the flowers 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.750
 dranhängen 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.980
 or otherwise present or wherever 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.410
 or to a band as you would like it 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.450
 Of course, you can also nest more than one 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.640
 make of it and then such a chain 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.080
 do with it, and in each box up 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.450
 a little surprise or any 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.740
 little nice message reintun so will 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.290
 in boxes there really is 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.880
 many ways like peter callus that 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.620
 imitate or maybe you have like that 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.120

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.460
 how it might be easy 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.620
 can copy 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.420
