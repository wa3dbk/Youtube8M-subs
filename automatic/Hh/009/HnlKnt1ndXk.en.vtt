00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello youtube with you bruise and girls 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.450
 love superhero games 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.529
 not all of them are good many even 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.389
 very bad 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.030
 and created only in order to cut down 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.710
 money from users number certainly 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.529
 deserves good games 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.020
 is it worth making games and superheroes 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.330
 TV series movies on comics continue 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.369
 dominate the movie market but the show doesn't 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.949
 lagging behind them covering up for fans 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.289
 time between films every year 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.660
 gives us new superhero shows this 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.130
 very cool game industry does not lag behind 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.620
 for almost every movie 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.079
 produced game but for TV series 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.510
 nothing comes out in my opinion it's sad 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.640
 the fans enjoyed playing with you 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.820
 games with your favorite characters 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.710
 if you agree to like 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.079
 episodic stories rule the series 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.329
 created to do on them 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.600
 games recall at least the walking dead 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.440
 and the game of thrones TV series comes out and means 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.770
 can go out 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.879
 games by chapter by episode endlessly 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.070
 walking 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.290
 and the game is no less geeky and themes than 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.409
 super hero and the same wolf among us 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.939
 created by comic book means the system can 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.280
 work out super heroes 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.260
 for example incidental investigation 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.000
 the best detective in the world of batman 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.100
 some mystical story in 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.090
 gotham with appearances in every episode 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.159
 new villain i already want to play it 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.070
 It is for the episodic game series 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.689
 go best because the film 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.119
 this game can not be released 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.490
 the picture has only one plot and formally 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.680
 the game should follow him player just 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.229
 once again the same story goes 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.840
 interesting and on the series turns out more 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.820
 diverse story shorter like me 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.780
 contact l tails and ask them 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.390
 batman game 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.360
 I hope everyone remembers and most importantly looks 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.000
 series arrow he started in 2012 and 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.409
 is the first in the new era 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.170
 superhero serials that started 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.060
 after him about the positive feedback from 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.399
 critics and fans think not 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.579
 talk series really good oliver 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.310
 quin works quietly covertly in the dark so 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.770
 what about an arrow would be nice 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.670
 stealth by type splinter cell or metal 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.190
 gear solid 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.650
 while there may well be a city and 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.900
 boevka like in games 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.760
 by batman arkham now you just need 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.879
 contact rocksteady studios and 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.280
 ask them to tackle another one 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.079
 tv series flash is also cool by the way it 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.730
 the adventure would have been nice to 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.079
 any mobile toy 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.000
 temp wound system 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.159
 although in fairness when in 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.629
 lately a decent game was coming out 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:35.480
 on mobile device 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.099
 they are all the same not creative so 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.010
 the best option would possibly be 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.569
 third person arcade toy or can 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.299
 be even give users the opportunity 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.000
 be flush through kinect on eksbox 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.480
 and the faster you move the faster he 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.659
 running 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.930
 I would play like that and you still have 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:56.690
 agents of the shield are not all his series successful but 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.299
 spin-off avengers also became iconic 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.879
 as one of the early TV shows this time 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.620
 according to the comics marvel could easily 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:07.220
 be a good shooter from the first 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.810
 persons with missions in the Far Edge player could 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.060
 would be a new account agent 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.189
 be trained to perform tasks 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.400
 fight hydra users love 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:19.250
 save the world but or a topic with a shield came up 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.290
 It would be for the same telltale games for all 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.389
 the decisions you make as 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.840
 agents influenced the outcome of one global 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:29.329
 stories move on and remember 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.489
 series goth someone like someone 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.010
 No, but the atmosphere of the series does not hold 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.530
 Of course there is no superhero in him yet 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.599
 there are villains and you can make a game by 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.489
 stylistics and concepts resembling 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.680
 some eloy noir 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.819
 Commissioner Gordon is a great hero and he 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.409
 can fight corruption and 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.780
 Rosy's crime story is bad 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:50.510
 swan by gotham open system 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.510
 space to solve riddles well damn 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.030
 such setting disappears soon 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.229
 Supergirl series all female super 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.379
 the hero is becoming increasingly popular 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:02.870
 quite by the way deservedly clear that 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:05.720
 supergirl game will be like all 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.790
 that already came out earlier on superman this 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.229
 By the way, not bad after all for a superman for a long time 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.500
 nothing came out 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:14.810
 and the games for their time were decent 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.780
 but marvel also plans many more 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.789
 TV series on Netflix defenders come out 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.609
 as well as separate series for each of 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.979
 heroes dirt 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.860
 evil hatches and jessica johns and iron 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:28.169
 fist it is clear that for each character game 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.449
 do silly most likely they will lose in 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.639
 quality but you can also make another 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:34.740
 toy fields up to put everyone together under 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.650
 crazy plot will be fun 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.719
 multiplayer on to operatively with everything 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.849
 the increasing popularity of superheroes 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:44.340
 I would really like to developers 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:46.050
 took the time and effort of this particular 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.810
 topics and would have done something 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.840
 meaningful with love they are just not that 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.960
 the incentive that will deprive the players of their money and 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.270
 a couple of hours of uniform gameplay time 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.250
 would you like to go computer 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.080
 games for some superhero 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.759
 TV series write your opinion in 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.620
 comments and put the Huskies and 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.169
 subscribe to secret channel key 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.969
 syn-ake in the name of good bye and top with you 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.199
 It was jelly to love girls who 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:12.199
 know what to play
