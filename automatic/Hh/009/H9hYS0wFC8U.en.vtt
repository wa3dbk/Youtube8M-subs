00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
you guys have been suggesting that i put

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.380 
you guys have been suggesting that i put
win<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.530> right<00:01:07.560> back<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:08.670> threw<00:01:09.270> in

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
win it right back and I just threw in

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.330 
win it right back and I just threw in
this<00:01:09.540> clip<00:01:09.780> here<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.140> explain<00:01:10.560> why<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.860> have<00:01:11.189> him

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
this clip here to explain why I have him

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.460 
this clip here to explain why I have him
at<00:01:11.490> centre-back<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.780> because<00:01:12.900> most

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
at centre-back and that is because most

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.249 
at centre-back and that is because most
of<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.549> opposing<00:01:15.210> team's<00:01:15.540> most<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.140> their

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
of the opposing team's most of their

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.980 
of the opposing team's most of their
attacking<00:01:16.729> comes<00:01:17.729> from<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.479> center<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
attacking comes from the center of the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.660 
attacking comes from the center of the
pitch<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:19.830> that's<00:01:19.950> why<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.159> keep<00:01:20.369> them<00:01:20.549> in

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
pitch and so that's why I keep them in

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.609 
pitch and so that's why I keep them in
the<00:01:20.790> center<00:01:21.090> because<00:01:21.270> they<00:01:22.080> always<00:01:22.320> play

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
the center because they always play

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.789 
the center because they always play
those<00:01:22.860> over<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.369> top<00:01:23.580> through<00:01:24.180> balls<00:01:24.420> and

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
those over the top through balls and

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.010 
those over the top through balls and
when<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.610> only<00:01:26.850> person<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.570> think<00:01:27.869> in

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
when is the only person that I think in

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.210 
when is the only person that I think in
the<00:01:28.140> whole<00:01:28.320> game<00:01:28.590> that's<00:01:28.829> going<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.040> be<00:01:29.130> able

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
the whole game that's going to be able

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.429 
the whole game that's going to be able
to<00:01:29.400> catch<00:01:29.610> them<00:01:29.880> at<00:01:30.060> centre-back<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.840> that's

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
to catch them at centre-back so that's

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.870 
to catch them at centre-back so that's
why<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.619> have<00:01:31.740> him<00:01:31.860> at<00:01:31.950> centre-back<00:01:32.430> also

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
why I have him at centre-back also

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.730 
why I have him at centre-back also
because<00:01:33.329> i<00:01:33.360> have<00:01:33.540> doily<00:01:33.960> at<00:01:34.079> right-back<00:01:34.320> and

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
because i have doily at right-back and

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.850 
because i have doily at right-back and
he's<00:01:34.890> just<00:01:35.750> key<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.930> watford<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.560> also<00:01:37.829> a

silva<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:46.650> mean<00:02:47.250> pretty<00:02:47.580> pretty<00:02:48.150> big

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390
