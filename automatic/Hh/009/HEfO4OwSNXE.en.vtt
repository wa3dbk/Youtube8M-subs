00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.139
 tonight's game might remind some of you back to it 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:07.860
 wk of bit 82 in spain a long time ago in addition to a victory in the 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.969
 opening round 2010 in a difficult victory against el salvador was enough 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.270
 a draw against hungary to make it to the next round it became one 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.810
 the ring the later murdered that the step of pools and the Soviet Union 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.670
 one of the top hungarians at the time was laszlo fazekas 35 still grandma 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.560
 strong always with the national team and antwerp fixed cupboards are between 62 and 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.379
 still lives in brasschaat and then this week on the edge of the forest and dives 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.379
 it the past 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.870
 Who 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.500
 but yeah 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.500
 h 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.370
 hahaha 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.370
 haha 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.980
 very well 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.540
 a very difficult game, but almost one hour in the lead 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.090
 first half 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.120
 and then make sense in the second half 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.380
 replaced their brother Theo Bos 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.740
 cullum amsterdam 10 left the center line and our who benno l later 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.100
 through the room 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.100
 repaired crows apple devices 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.270
 a little further is better but because the costs for the idea came a lot here 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.390
 inside and a benefit the same left side 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.210
 and now when someone's creditors around and idea of ​​a ballet music was alone 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.219
 by the and i was 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:11.509
 meant for weeks can live there as long as you are a lot smart 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:16.039
 bankers we quickly came close and the sixteen meter and just that this less 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:19.039
 tasks 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:22.779
 fabregas 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.489
 so there is nothing to worry about 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.629
 then has received a yellow card 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.299
 take a vvd 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.169
 buy meat to 10 kilometers 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:35.759
 but not expensive 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:38.769
 Normally today to Boonman the matter and has settled 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.549
 and then a player draws those men 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.810
 and that the eighties years after that ran one of the best years for the 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.340
 Belgian footballs and that cannot be a coincidence because the dunes are all over 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.379
 good Belgian players 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.090
 Four important things for twists and turns 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.769
 That is a very good reason that only three innings of countries are allowed to play 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:07.559
 think that the second Dutch values ​​and norms 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.849
 thicker than just three drafts 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.569
 The Swedish took three entire projects 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.679
 and what's the turn then plays obvious hammad that then play the province 

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:22.749
 Kurdistan then you better match Danny bloodstream skiing and leave on and on 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:23.939
 shaun of the church 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.109
 so there were experts then 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.129
 are cancun than they themselves discuss the movement of goods 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:34.229
 they were a top competition in europe 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.169
 3 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:43.079
 I become a fan and I was allowed to be the official 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.649
 land on the turn 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:51.759
 We play football Mr. Indie Rockers from then how your relationship with the 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:55.219
 chairman despite the national bank 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:59.090
 and so i am here in antwerp the rebit comment 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.489
 at my age is almost three years 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.999
 for the fixed cast 

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:06.449
 that's what the newspaper writes 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:09.199
 in the right corner 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.569
 in the fifties the forefront received the hand 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.849
 the different shades of gray 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.870
 the true love between humans and animals 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.979
 by making a larger stadium with 16 so the people around 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:25.539
 so i was a bit familiar with many domains and where i am here 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.009
 koran a long time team where i play you so sometimes i know sixteen this man 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.710
 for a competition 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.680
 so it took some getting used to 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.680
 what i expected 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:44.039
 maybe it sounds 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:48.099
 put 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.360
 into the new year 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.360

 and for years it has gone to andenne kidane 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:09.089
 and then play better than against each other at those 190,000 converts 

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:10.419
 this year 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:11.629
 the toothbrush 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:14.839
 it a young team and then good atmosphere 

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:17.839
 mark hurd here footballer jan des bouvrie his dreams 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.270
 if you are a little farmer running there then you are a conifer 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.919
 and then after that the market and then many people who turn low to one 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.919
 unal people chanted for so long 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.199
 the wall street 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.619
