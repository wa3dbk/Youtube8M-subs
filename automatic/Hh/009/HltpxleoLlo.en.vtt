00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
just be more layers of oversight to make

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.180 
just be more layers of oversight to make
sure<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:42.059> there<00:00:42.899> aren't<00:00:43.110> as<00:00:43.350> many<00:00:43.379> screw-ups

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
sure that there aren't as many screw-ups

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.499 
I didn't Obama went from saying okay no
more<00:01:52.829> CIA<00:01:53.189> control<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.149> would<00:01:54.299> have<00:01:54.390> given

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
more CIA control and I would have given

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.910 
more CIA control and I would have given
him<00:01:54.630> credit<00:01:54.899> at<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.049> time<00:01:55.259> if<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.530> knew<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.860> he

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
him credit at the time if I knew that he

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.889 
him credit at the time if I knew that he
said<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.280> he<00:01:57.060> went<00:01:57.240> from<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:58.820> okay<00:01:59.899> the

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
said that he went from that to okay the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.380 
said that he went from that to okay the
CIA<00:02:01.290> can<00:02:01.799> share<00:02:02.189> control<00:02:02.840> with<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> Pentagon

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
CIA can share control with the Pentagon

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.779 
CIA can share control with the Pentagon
so<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.719> was<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.930> slight<00:02:07.409> like<00:02:07.799> okay<00:02:08.160> everybody's

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
so it was a slight like okay everybody's

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.969 
so it was a slight like okay everybody's
against<00:02:09.149> me<00:02:09.209> in<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.810> establishment<00:02:10.379> I<00:02:10.739> guess

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
against me in the establishment I guess

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.220 
against me in the establishment I guess
I<00:02:11.129> have<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.520> find<00:02:11.819> some<00:02:12.629> sort<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:13.020> middle

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230

ground<00:02:13.470> I<00:02:13.709> mean

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
ground I mean

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.440 
ground I mean
I really<00:02:14.190> shouldn't<00:02:14.459> have<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.819> compromise<00:02:14.970> on

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
I really shouldn't have to compromise on

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.270 
I really shouldn't have to compromise on
this<00:02:15.569> issue<00:02:15.630> my<00:02:16.260> original<00:02:16.620> position<00:02:16.740> was<00:02:17.130> the

this issue my original position was the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.070 
this issue my original position was the
compromise<00:02:17.640> but<00:02:18.209> now<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.360> guess<00:02:18.660> I'll<00:02:18.840> I'll

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
compromise but now I guess I'll I'll

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.260 
compromise but now I guess I'll I'll
compromise<00:02:19.650> more<00:02:20.130> I<00:02:20.400> love<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.819> next<00:02:21.090> line

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
best will do is maybe we'll share will

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.280 
best will do is maybe we'll share will
do<00:03:42.780> CIA<00:03:43.500> and<00:03:43.950> Pentagon<00:03:44.310> working<00:03:44.790> together<00:03:45.290> but

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
do CIA and Pentagon working together but

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.920 
do CIA and Pentagon working together but
here's<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.650> most<00:03:46.769> ominous<00:03:47.010> part<00:03:47.519> quote<00:03:47.930> the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
here's the most ominous part quote the

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.770 
here's the most ominous part quote the
same<00:03:49.230> factor<00:03:49.980> that<00:03:50.340> caused<00:03:50.670> Obama<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.510> want<00:03:51.660> to

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
same factor that caused Obama to want to

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.780 
same factor that caused Obama to want to
take<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.109> drone<00:03:52.350> program<00:03:52.560> away<00:03:53.100> from<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.459> CIA

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
take the drone program away from the CIA

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.240 
take the drone program away from the CIA
maybe<00:03:54.660> part<00:03:55.049> of<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.260> reason<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.680> agency<00:03:55.829> is

you got to get out of the CIA's hands
too<00:06:42.490> they<00:06:42.670> tell<00:06:42.880> me<00:06:42.970> I<00:06:43.000> can't<00:06:43.420> okay<00:06:43.630> let's

too they tell me I can't okay let's
share<00:06:44.080> it<00:06:44.110> and<00:06:44.520> the<00:06:45.520> indication<00:06:46.090> and<00:06:46.450> the

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:47.020 
share it and the indication and the

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.720 
share it and the indication and the
implication<00:06:47.770> I<00:06:47.860> should<00:06:48.010> say<00:06:48.220> in<00:06:48.460> the<00:06:48.490> article

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:48.730 
implication I should say in the article

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.810 
implication I should say in the article
is<00:06:49.120> that's<00:06:49.870> not<00:06:49.990> really<00:06:50.230> gonna<00:06:50.320> happen<00:06:50.500> either

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:50.820 
is that's not really gonna happen either

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.400 
is that's not really gonna happen either
because<00:06:51.820> those<00:06:52.030> agencies<00:06:52.870> the<00:06:52.990> CIA<00:06:53.230> and<00:06:53.380> the

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:53.410 
because those agencies the CIA and the

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:54.990 
because those agencies the CIA and the
Pentagon<00:06:53.470> hate<00:06:54.040> each<00:06:54.160> other<00:06:54.370> they<00:06:54.760> hate<00:06:54.970> each

Pentagon hate each other they hate each

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.420 
Pentagon hate each other they hate each
other

so<00:06:57.430> here<00:06:57.640> we<00:06:57.730> are<00:06:57.760> right<00:06:58.030> back<00:06:58.180> at<00:06:58.330> square<00:06:58.450> one

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550 
so here we are right back at square one

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.570 
so here we are right back at square one
we<00:07:00.550> set<00:07:00.910> up<00:07:00.940> this<00:07:01.240> monstrosity<00:07:02.080> of<00:07:02.860> a<00:07:03.010> system

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
we set up this monstrosity of a system

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.820 
we set up this monstrosity of a system
and<00:07:03.850> now<00:07:04.480> we<00:07:04.540> can't<00:07:04.930> even<00:07:05.020> like<00:07:05.350> minorly

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:05.830 
and now we can't even like minorly

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.490 
and now we can't even like minorly
change<00:07:06.220> it<00:07:06.430> to<00:07:06.550> make<00:07:06.700> it<00:07:06.850> somewhat<00:07:07.240> better

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:07.500 
change it to make it somewhat better

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.800 
change it to make it somewhat better
can't<00:07:08.500> even<00:07:08.680> do<00:07:08.770> that
