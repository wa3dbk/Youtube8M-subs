cold water and what this does is it

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.599 
cold water and what this does is it
helps<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.109> circulate<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.920> blood<00:00:28.949> through<00:00:29.460> the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
helps to circulate the blood through the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.429 
helps to circulate the blood through the
muscles<00:00:30.029> when<00:00:30.240> we<00:00:30.359> have<00:00:30.539> hot<00:00:30.869> water<00:00:30.900> on<00:00:31.320> our

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
muscles when we have hot water on our

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.150 
muscles when we have hot water on our
skin<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.430> blood<00:00:32.759> goes<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.920> surface<00:00:34.920> to

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
skin the blood goes to the surface to

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.990 
skin the blood goes to the surface to
help<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:36.030> know<00:00:36.180> cool<00:00:37.079> us<00:00:37.230> off<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.829> then<00:00:38.670> once

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
we have the cold water on us the blood

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.610 
we have the cold water on us the blood
flow<00:00:41.760> goes<00:00:42.030> more<00:00:42.329> towards<00:00:42.690> our<00:00:42.840> core<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.469> as

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
flow goes more towards our core and as

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.220 
flow goes more towards our core and as
we<00:00:43.770> go<00:00:43.980> back<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.430> forth<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:45.059> really<00:00:45.660> helps<00:00:46.140> to

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
we go back and forth it really helps to

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.440 
we go back and forth it really helps to
circulate<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.950> blood<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.460> get<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.059> moving

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
circulate that blood and get it moving

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.060 
circulate that blood and get it moving
one<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.559> things<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.860> really<00:00:50.250> helps<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.940> a

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
one of the things that really helps is a

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.920 
one of the things that really helps is a
removable<00:00:53.070> nozzle<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.699> your<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.390> your<00:00:54.449> shower

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
removable nozzle on your on your shower

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.040 
removable nozzle on your on your shower
head<00:00:55.110> just<00:00:55.980> like<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.570> because<00:00:57.570> one<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
head just like this because one of the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.959 
head just like this because one of the
things<00:00:58.109> you'll<00:00:58.440> find<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.520> second

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
things you'll find is that the second

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.340 
things you'll find is that the second
you<00:01:00.059> switch<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.359> cold<00:01:00.750> water<00:01:01.050> obviously

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
you switch to cold water obviously

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.939 
you switch to cold water obviously
that's<00:01:02.629> something<00:01:03.629> that's<00:01:04.619> pretty

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
that's something that's pretty

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.580 
that's something that's pretty
uncomfortable<00:01:05.519> but<00:01:06.299> with<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.750> removable

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
uncomfortable but with the removable

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.890 
uncomfortable but with the removable
nozzle<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.760> can<00:01:08.909> actually<00:01:09.060> focus<00:01:09.510> on

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
nozzle that you can actually focus on

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.260 
nozzle that you can actually focus on
certain<00:01:10.200> areas<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:10.950> focus<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.549> your<00:01:11.610> arms

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.560 
fixed nozzle it's going to be you know
full<00:01:19.380> body<00:01:19.590> coverage<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.369> if<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.060> want<00:01:21.330> that

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
that's fine but it's it's a it's pretty

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.740 
that's fine but it's it's a it's pretty
brutal<00:01:25.110> if<00:01:25.500> you're<00:01:25.740> not<00:01:25.890> used<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.570> so<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
brutal if you're not used to it so the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.740 
brutal if you're not used to it so the
way<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.439> want<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.799> time<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:30.119> contrast

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
way that you want to time the contrast

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.770 
way that you want to time the contrast
between<00:01:31.470> hot<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.159> cold<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:33.090> really<00:01:33.420> helps<00:01:33.720> to

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
between hot and cold it really helps to

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.850 
between hot and cold it really helps to
have<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.930> timer<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.500> have<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.829> a

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
have a timer if you have like a

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.920 
have a timer if you have like a
waterproof<00:01:35.430> stopwatch<00:01:36.000> or<00:01:36.270> something<00:01:36.720> it's

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
waterproof stopwatch or something it's

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.069 
waterproof stopwatch or something it's
it's<00:01:37.619> great<00:01:37.920> just<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.280> set<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.869> can

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
it's great just to set it and so you can

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.359 
it's great just to set it and so you can
kind<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.380> go<00:01:40.530> go<00:01:40.979> back<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.369> forth<00:01:43.130> since<00:01:44.130> this

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
kind of go go back and forth since this

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.130 
kind of go go back and forth since this
is<00:01:44.610> going<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.850> be<00:01:45.030> since<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.720> hots<00:01:45.899> going<00:01:46.079> to

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
is going to be since the hots going to

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.749 
is going to be since the hots going to
be<00:01:46.229> great<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:47.040> cold<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.460> going<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.670> be

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
be great and the cold is going to be

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.580 
be great and the cold is going to be
cold<00:01:47.939> start<00:01:48.750> with<00:01:48.899> doing<00:01:49.140> something<00:01:49.439> like<00:01:49.530> a

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
cold start with doing something like a

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.740 
cold start with doing something like a
two<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.040> one<00:01:50.070> or<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.549> three<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:51.060> one<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.509> for

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
two to one or a three to one so for

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.010 
two to one or a three to one so for
instance<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:52.320> would<00:01:52.439> be<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.780> would<00:01:54.899> have

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
instance you would be you you would have
