00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
when it comes out you buy it and then

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.690 
when it comes out you buy it and then
within<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.660> year<00:03:07.050> whatever<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:08.040> opened<00:03:08.489> or

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
didn't open just doubles in price but

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.120 
didn't open just doubles in price but
