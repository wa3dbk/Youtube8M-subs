00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.620
 minute welcome back to the 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.779
 Experiment video 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.620
 now it's about the revier over the rum 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.820
 see here and so what I only now 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.190
 noticed that the lockscreen 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.549
 does not run very smoothly and sees it 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.010
 here 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.449
 the h is a little easy but im 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.250
 basic principle is running relatively well 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.289
 carpenter screen left and down 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.730
 we also see the surface right away 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.279
 it works very well 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:36.480
 there are many backgrounds 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.390
 xperia changed two special greens 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.430
 europe the live wallpaper and such are 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.440
 everyone stayed 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:48.210
 backgrounds from the normal s2 and yes so 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.920
 let's go to the widgets we have 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.399
 also sees many of the xperia here 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.739
 you can really many so here 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.940
 you can build really nice pages 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:07.920
 and extras now we can own here 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:11.939
 add tops or something and apps can 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.799
 Also add on our pages MSC 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.720
 we have the whole pages on it 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:21.240
 it's the cbm and sales klopp has over 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.360
 yes the place we pre-installed 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.009
 do not have to do any fashion jobs when we go to 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.110
 For example, we can go to the wm 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.560
 make backup of round-off gate in 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.049
 dayton do everything 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.390
 and yes, we can go to download good 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.369
 and we can do a lot 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.540
 as I said here is the us manager what 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.670
 still time we can stuff 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.340
 shut down 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.340
 in the settings we have here 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.490
 xperia launcher so the xperia 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:59.000
 Surface is all based on 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:59.000
 4.1 point 2 is also very good 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.580
 for him 1100 as already mentioned in the 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.850
 again, how to install it 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.070
 Based on the floor space of the 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.420
 galaxy s2 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.430
 So you can see it from here 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.520
 preinstalled apps also own 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.720
 files and iron krams here we can 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.960
 there again on our memory 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:26.420
 access 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:28.980
 sony the rom we have here x times 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.500
 like a half gigawatt free and then 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.570
 fits the whole yes if we together 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.930
 you can also make new pages 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:40.050
 add or delete 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:46.050
 we can also do this for example here 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:49.650
 now as a home screen and make the 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:53.490
 status bar is on like the galaxy s2 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.100
 Stockumer so to speak just 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.590
 a little icon change and beautiful 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:03.300
 things have been unclear 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.040
 runs very smoothly here until data mostly 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.769
 whole mobile restart here see what 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.269
 also from the menu and now have 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.320
 also this rotary symbol sees that 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.320
 Of course, very chic 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.590
 Bodmers very minimal we can do that 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.870
 surface so see the screen and 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.360
 fast all the high quality old stuff 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.360
 Snare like that 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:34.560
 Now the galaxy takes a little longer 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.390
 now symbol has been added 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.560
 Now you can get the xperia here 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:43.520
 see the surface and the experience at 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.959
 Of course, you goose them out very nicely 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.500
 Alright that was my little review about 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.450
 the rum 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.010
