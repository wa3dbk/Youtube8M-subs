00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
this little thing down there's actually

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.690 
this little thing down there's actually
a<00:02:10.170> thing<00:02:10.349> on<00:02:10.500> here<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.709> says<00:02:10.860> top<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.430> bottom

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.260 
a thing on here it says top and bottom
so<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:11.970> can<00:02:12.209> actually<00:02:12.360> remember<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:12.930> for

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
so you can actually remember that for

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.140 
so you can actually remember that for
easily<00:02:15.570> make<00:02:16.570> sure<00:02:16.810> don't<00:02:17.020> bend<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.860> pins<00:02:18.190> on

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
easily make sure don't bend the pins on

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.500 
easily make sure don't bend the pins on
the<00:02:20.430> light<00:02:21.430> bulb<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:21.820> make<00:02:22.030> sure<00:02:22.150> this<00:02:22.270> is<00:02:22.330> in

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
the light bulb and make sure this is in

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.690 
the light bulb and make sure this is in
there<00:02:22.660> nice<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:22.870> snug<00:02:23.140> because<00:02:23.650> I<00:02:23.890> it's

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
there nice and snug because I it's

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.480 
there nice and snug because I it's
actually<00:02:25.860> preventing<00:02:26.860> water<00:02:27.070> from<00:02:27.340> getting

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
actually preventing water from getting

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.230 
actually preventing water from getting
into<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.120> headlight<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.750> damaging<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.290> and

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
into the headlight and damaging it and

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.900 
into the headlight and damaging it and
then<00:02:31.240> all<00:02:31.360> we<00:02:31.480> have<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.660> do<00:02:31.870> is<00:02:32.460> we<00:02:33.460> plug<00:02:33.730> in

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
then all we have to do is we plug in

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.990 
then all we have to do is we plug in
this<00:02:34.170> wire<00:02:35.170> here<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:38.400> that's<00:02:39.400> how<00:02:39.520> you<00:02:39.640> change

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
this wire here and that's how you change

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.900 
this wire here and that's how you change
the<00:02:40.420> light<00:02:41.200> bulb<00:02:41.440> on<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:42.090> 2004<00:02:43.090> Honda<00:02:43.480> CRV
