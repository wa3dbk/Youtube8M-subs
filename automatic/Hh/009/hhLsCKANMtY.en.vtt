00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.740 
too hard compared to regular Halo games
at<00:07:18.650> least<00:07:18.800> but<00:07:19.550> that<00:07:19.700> does<00:07:19.940> add<00:07:20.150> some<00:07:20.540> to<00:07:20.720> the

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:20.750 
at least but that does add some to the

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.690 
at least but that does add some to the
playtime<00:07:21.260> of<00:07:21.680> what<00:07:21.950> is<00:07:22.070> otherwise<00:07:22.250> a<00:07:22.460> pretty

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:22.700 
playtime of what is otherwise a pretty

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.120 
playtime of what is otherwise a pretty
short<00:07:23.030> game<00:07:23.500> another<00:07:24.500> thing<00:07:24.740> I<00:07:24.830> should<00:07:24.860> point

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:25.130 
short game another thing I should point

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.890 
short game another thing I should point
out<00:07:25.280> is<00:07:25.340> that<00:07:25.550> the<00:07:25.850> game<00:07:26.000> on<00:07:26.180> Windows<00:07:26.480> Phone<00:07:26.660> or

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:26.900 
out is that the game on Windows Phone or

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.620 
out is that the game on Windows Phone or

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:29.630 
Windows 8 uses cloud saves and it

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.300 
Windows 8 uses cloud saves and it
supports<00:07:29.990> play<00:07:30.230> pause<00:07:30.470> resume<00:07:30.710> which<00:07:31.070> means

automatically transfers between both

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.650 
automatically transfers between both
versions<00:07:36.170> it's<00:07:36.830> really<00:07:37.070> neat<00:07:37.300> you<00:07:38.300> can<00:07:38.330> just

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:38.660

versions so you don't have to do the
same<00:07:54.970> task<00:07:55.180> twice<00:07:55.450> but<00:07:56.350> you<00:07:56.440> do<00:07:56.560> have<00:07:56.710> to<00:07:56.830> buy
