Janos Jesus Blin sheep

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.539 
Janos Jesus Blin sheep
thus<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.690> principle<00:02:43.290> was<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:44.010> backseat

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
thus the principle was that the backseat

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.000 
thus the principle was that the backseat
passengers<00:02:45.239> faced<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.810> rear<00:02:46.019> so<00:02:46.709> it<00:02:46.860> was

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
passengers faced the rear so it was

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.559 
passengers faced the rear so it was
logical<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.730> put<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.269> engine<00:02:48.840> in<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.349> middle

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
logical to put the engine in the middle

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.390 
logical to put the engine in the middle
because<00:02:51.569> in<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.810> front<00:02:52.140> or<00:02:52.349> back<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:53.099> would

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
because in the front or back it would

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.039 
because in the front or back it would
block<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.940> view<00:02:56.269> so<00:02:57.269> it<00:02:57.390> was<00:02:57.569> in<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.810> middle

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
block the view so it was in the middle
