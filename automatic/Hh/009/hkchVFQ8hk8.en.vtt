00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.150
 developers 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.099
 but out of all , studio gainax stood out 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.699
 which is also a developer 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.610
 games 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.070
 ultimate spider-man released 2005 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.610
 she was also the best at the moment of everything 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.219
 output 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.149

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.600
 The tablet is not a piece of history wonderful 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.850
 runs off with a piece of tablet 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.070
 the rest scattered on alternative 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.350
 the universe of their marvel set and 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.840
 the developers stopped at 4 main 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.330
 each universe has its own web thrower 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.549
 classic this is familiar to all of us 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.439

 happens during the great depression 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.340
 based on this we play for 4 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.350
 characters 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.479
 the game for each one is different not 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.920
 only stylistically but gameplay 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.829
 thanks to unique abilities 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.659
 each one and thunderstorm classic 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.710
 spider-man visually looks like 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.750
 animated comics 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.090
 the protagonist himself is the most 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.400
 agile of all ultimate spider-man 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.280
 endowed with a black suit all there and 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.710

 your time working on this universe 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.329
 with long combos he chooses 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.750
 the scale of rage becomes just a machine 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.340
 to destroy everything about spiderman 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.400
 2099 has the ability to slow down 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.710
 time and just very stylish 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.900
 spider-man noir will be the weakest of 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.670
 all he does not attack covered ok always 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.280
 remain to the topic of the gameplay for 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.410
 He is the stealth but still nice visually 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.110

 there is a first person view 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.350
 it appears script behavior or during 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.360
 fight time with the main boss all levels 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.590

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.130
 just staggering 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.130

 Russian 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.330
 liked it and so with every boss 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:37.580
 everyone needs to find an individual approach 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.889
 for victory over him all the main bad guys 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.599

 enhance their abilities 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:45.889
 and our task is to pick up but it is not 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.139
 just because there are enemies on Putin 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:51.979
 and lower rank despite the fact that 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:54.680
 the game came out in 2010 it is still 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:58.340
 relevant advise everyone to play if you 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.569
 and random missed postscript even 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.000
 don't try to run 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:04.340
