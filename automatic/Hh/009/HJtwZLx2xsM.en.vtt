while ago and I have this random little

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.190 
while ago and I have this random little
sneaker<00:00:10.980> thing<00:00:11.940> right<00:00:12.150> here<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.570> store

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
sneaker thing right here and I store

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.959

shoes in this little corner and I found

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.150 
shoes in this little corner and I found
them<00:00:15.120> below<00:00:15.450> that<00:00:15.750> box<00:00:15.990> right<00:00:16.199> there<00:00:16.320> so<00:00:17.130> I

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
them below that box right there so I

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.710 
them below that box right there so I
thought<00:00:17.369> I'd<00:00:17.520> do<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.640> review<00:00:18.090> because<00:00:18.510> i'm

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
thought I'd do a review because i'm

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.880 
thought I'd do a review because i'm
actually<00:00:18.810> going<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.140> make<00:00:19.260> these<00:00:19.410> my<00:00:19.590> new<00:00:19.740> be

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
actually going to make these my new be

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.320 
actually going to make these my new be
teased<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.480> had<00:00:21.480> my<00:00:21.619> unfuse<00:00:22.619> as<00:00:23.250> my<00:00:23.670> beaters<00:00:24.060> and

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
teased I had my unfuse as my beaters and

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.259 
teased I had my unfuse as my beaters and
they're<00:00:24.480> getting<00:00:25.430> really<00:00:26.430> really<00:00:26.609> really<00:00:26.970> bad

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
they're getting really really really bad

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.050 
they're getting really really really bad
so<00:00:27.779> i<00:00:28.160> guess<00:00:29.160> i'll<00:00:29.310> just<00:00:29.340> make<00:00:29.580> these<00:00:29.760> my<00:00:29.939> new
