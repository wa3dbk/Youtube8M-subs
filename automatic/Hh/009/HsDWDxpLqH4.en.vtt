00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
of a showcase of the performance is

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.730 
of a showcase of the performance is
excellent<00:00:21.480> as<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.689> can<00:00:21.840> see<00:00:21.960> here<00:00:22.140> we<00:00:22.710> have

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
excellent as you can see here we have

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.349 
excellent as you can see here we have
this<00:00:22.980> game<00:00:23.250> better<00:00:23.519> feel<00:00:23.760> for<00:00:23.939> running<00:00:24.269> an

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
this game better feel for running an

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.320 
this game better feel for running an
ultra<00:00:24.750> put<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.320> maxed<00:00:26.039> out<00:00:26.130> as<00:00:26.250> well<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:27.090> I'm

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
ultra put a maxed out as well so I'm

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.970 
ultra put a maxed out as well so I'm
gonna<00:00:27.449> just<00:00:27.599> open<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.470> settings<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.830> can

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
gonna just open the settings so you can

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.679 
gonna just open the settings so you can
see<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.820> everything<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.390> set<00:00:30.509> at<00:00:30.630> Ultra

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
see that so everything is set at Ultra

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.380 
see that so everything is set at Ultra
the<00:00:31.259> Alpha<00:00:31.470> preset<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:31.980> we'll<00:00:32.850> just<00:00:32.970> run

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
the Alpha preset and we'll just run

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.790 
the Alpha preset and we'll just run
around<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.780> just<00:00:33.960> show<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.260> how<00:00:34.380> well<00:00:34.710> it

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
around and just show you how well it

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.319 
around and just show you how well it
handles<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.160> game<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.120> first

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
handles the game so this is the first

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.330 
handles the game so this is the first
mobile<00:00:36.809> graphics<00:00:36.930> card<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.379> we<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:38.070> seen

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
mobile graphics card that we have seen

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.490 
mobile graphics card that we have seen
the<00:00:38.489> way<00:00:38.550> we<00:00:38.670> can<00:00:38.820> handle<00:00:39.230> full<00:00:40.230> ultra

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
the way we can handle full ultra

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.069 
the way we can handle full ultra
settings<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.920> bf4<00:00:41.149> with<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.300> up<00:00:42.570> as<00:00:42.719> well<00:00:42.899> and

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
settings in bf4 with a up as well and

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.520 
settings in bf4 with a up as well and
just<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.320> consistent<00:00:43.860> FPS<00:00:44.309> over<00:00:44.520> 60<00:00:45.320> in<00:00:46.320> fact

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
just a consistent FPS over 60 in fact

00:00:46.530 --> 00:01:26.390 
just a consistent FPS over 60 in fact
reaching<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.860> range<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.309> 100<00:00:47.699> in<00:00:47.820> some<00:00:48.000> apps

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:36.940 

nah

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.929 

so<00:01:37.950> there<00:01:38.100> should<00:01:38.220> be<00:01:38.250> impressive<00:01:38.700> or<00:01:38.820> better

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
so there should be impressive or better

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.440 
so there should be impressive or better
before<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:40.140> move<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.890> next<00:01:41.070> key<00:01:41.450> so

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
before we move on to the next key so

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.179 
before we move on to the next key so
here<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:42.780> have<00:01:42.810> watchdogs<00:01:43.470> one<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.950> most

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
here we have watchdogs one of the most

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.460 
here we have watchdogs one of the most
