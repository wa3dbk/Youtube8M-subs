original this is David Morris and he's

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.130 
original this is David Morris and he's
just<00:00:21.610> holding<00:00:21.790> some<00:00:22.510> kind<00:00:22.540> of<00:00:22.840> tracking

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
just holding some kind of tracking

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.740 
just holding some kind of tracking
device<00:00:23.560> in<00:00:23.740> his<00:00:23.770> fingers<00:00:24.250> for<00:00:25.240> this<00:00:25.330> shot<00:00:25.600> I

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
device in his fingers for this shot I

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.540 
device in his fingers for this shot I
just<00:00:25.990> took<00:00:26.140> a<00:00:26.200> still<00:00:26.590> image<00:00:26.800> of<00:00:27.100> a<00:00:27.160> Reese's

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
just took a still image of a Reese's

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.779 
just took a still image of a Reese's
piece<00:00:28.110> cut<00:00:29.110> it<00:00:29.230> out<00:00:29.350> and<00:00:29.619> as<00:00:30.369> you<00:00:30.520> can<00:00:30.610> see<00:00:30.760> I

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
piece cut it out and as you can see I

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.390 
piece cut it out and as you can see I
added<00:00:31.000> some<00:00:31.539> skin<00:00:32.110> texture<00:00:32.650> for<00:00:32.860> his<00:00:32.980> fingers

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
added some skin texture for his fingers

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.940 
added some skin texture for his fingers
on<00:00:33.610> the<00:00:33.700> top<00:00:33.910> and<00:00:34.150> the<00:00:34.210> bottom<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.590> reason<00:00:35.829> is

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
on the top and the bottom the reason is

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.670 
on the top and the bottom the reason is
I<00:00:36.040> wanted<00:00:36.280> to<00:00:36.370> put<00:00:36.550> some<00:00:36.700> shadow<00:00:37.030> in<00:00:37.630> there<00:00:38.500> and

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
I wanted to put some shadow in there and

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.990 
I wanted to put some shadow in there and
make<00:00:38.800> it<00:00:38.950> look<00:00:39.040> like<00:00:39.280> his<00:00:39.399> fingers<00:00:39.790> are<00:00:39.910> really

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
make it look like his fingers are really

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.850 
make it look like his fingers are really
pressing<00:00:40.570> into<00:00:40.780> the<00:00:40.810> candy<00:00:41.290> instead<00:00:41.530> of<00:00:41.710> just

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
pressing into the candy instead of just

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.920 
pressing into the candy instead of just
floating<00:00:42.280> on<00:00:42.399> top<00:00:42.670> of<00:00:42.850> it<00:00:43.000> so<00:00:43.570> it<00:00:43.660> helped

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
floating on top of it so it helped

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.810 
floating on top of it so it helped
having<00:00:44.260> that<00:00:44.410> texture<00:00:45.220> be<00:00:45.370> a<00:00:45.399> part<00:00:45.670> of<00:00:45.730> the

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
having that texture be a part of the

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.210 
having that texture be a part of the
image<00:00:45.970> and<00:00:46.360> then<00:00:47.140> here<00:00:47.350> I<00:00:47.380> start<00:00:47.649> tracking<00:00:47.890> in

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
image and then here I start tracking in

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.500 
image and then here I start tracking in
that<00:00:48.340> image<00:00:48.520> right<00:00:48.790> over<00:00:49.059> what<00:00:49.210> he's<00:00:49.329> actually

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
that image right over what he's actually

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.069 
that image right over what he's actually
holding<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.920> tried<00:00:51.850> using<00:00:52.360> an<00:00:52.510> automatic

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
holding I tried using an automatic

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.709 
holding I tried using an automatic
tracker<00:00:53.559> but<00:00:54.010> especially<00:00:54.460> with<00:00:54.850> SD<00:00:55.300> footage

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
tracker but especially with SD footage

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.160 
tracker but especially with SD footage
it<00:00:56.110> doesn't<00:00:56.860> track<00:00:57.250> it<00:00:57.489> perfectly<00:00:58.090> so<00:00:58.540> I

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
it doesn't track it perfectly so I

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.410 
it doesn't track it perfectly so I
really<00:00:59.829> had<00:00:59.950> to<00:01:00.040> go<00:01:00.160> in<00:01:00.309> frame<00:01:00.610> by<00:01:00.760> frame<00:01:00.790> and

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
really had to go in frame by frame and

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.239 
really had to go in frame by frame and
get<00:01:02.200> every<00:01:02.500> little<00:01:02.649> movement<00:01:05.039> so<00:01:06.039> now<00:01:06.159> I'm

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:06.249 
get every little movement so now I'm

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:08.580 
get every little movement so now I'm
doing<00:01:06.399> some<00:01:06.670> color<00:01:06.909> correcting<00:01:07.469> getting<00:01:08.469> rid

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
doing some color correcting getting rid

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.770 
doing some color correcting getting rid
of<00:01:08.619> the<00:01:08.799> saturation<00:01:09.579> and<00:01:09.850> then<00:01:09.969> matching<00:01:10.659> the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
of the saturation and then matching the

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.319 
of the saturation and then matching the
amount<00:01:10.990> of<00:01:11.079> blur<00:01:11.350> on<00:01:11.590> his<00:01:11.770> fingers<00:01:12.329> matching

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
amount of blur on his fingers matching

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.440 
amount of blur on his fingers matching
the<00:01:13.450> grain<00:01:13.749> of<00:01:13.959> the<00:01:13.990> original<00:01:14.380> shot<00:01:14.619> and<00:01:15.450> then

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
the grain of the original shot and then

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.279 
the grain of the original shot and then
finally<00:01:16.840> adjusting<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.499> brightness<00:01:20.789> and

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
finally adjusting the brightness and

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.679 
finally adjusting the brightness and
here<00:01:23.289> it<00:01:23.350> is<00:01:23.439> tracked<00:01:23.829> and<00:01:24.450> just<00:01:25.450> right<00:01:25.659> over

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
here it is tracked and just right over

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:27.690 
here it is tracked and just right over
the<00:01:26.009> computer<00:01:27.009> chip<00:01:27.249> that<00:01:27.279> he's<00:01:27.520> actually

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
the computer chip that he's actually

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.499 
the computer chip that he's actually
holding<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:32.099> for<00:01:33.099> the<00:01:33.159> next<00:01:33.340> shot<00:01:33.609> this<00:01:34.329> is

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
holding and for the next shot this is

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.330 
holding and for the next shot this is
for<00:01:34.689> when<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:34.869> Reese's<00:01:35.439> Pieces<00:01:35.709> graphic

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
for when the Reese's Pieces graphic

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.910 
for when the Reese's Pieces graphic
comes<00:01:36.549> up<00:01:36.759> on<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:36.909> screen<00:01:37.119> I<00:01:38.049> created<00:01:38.770> the

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
comes up on the screen I created the

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.359 
comes up on the screen I created the
animated<00:01:39.399> graphics<00:01:39.789> first<00:01:39.999> and<00:01:40.329> after<00:01:40.599> fix

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
animated graphics first and after fix

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.159 
animated graphics first and after fix
and<00:01:42.369> then<00:01:42.490> with<00:01:42.729> a<00:01:42.759> CG<00:01:43.299> Reese's<00:01:43.630> piece<00:01:43.929> I

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:44.169 
and then with a CG Reese's piece I

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:47.819 
and then with a CG Reese's piece I
created<00:01:44.499> a<00:01:44.649> light<00:01:44.889> wave<00:01:45.689> just<00:01:46.689> a<00:01:46.810> 3d<00:01:47.169> oval<00:01:47.590> and

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
created a light wave just a 3d oval and

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:53.099 
created a light wave just a 3d oval and
rotated<00:01:48.399> it<00:01:49.529> and<00:01:51.539> then<00:01:52.539> once<00:01:52.719> that<00:01:52.810> was

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:53.109 
rotated it and then once that was

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:54.659 
rotated it and then once that was
created<00:01:53.469> I<00:01:53.529> essentially<00:01:53.889> did<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.219> same<00:01:54.429> thing

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:54.669 
created I essentially did the same thing

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:56.760 
created I essentially did the same thing
as<00:01:54.789> a<00:01:54.819> previous<00:01:55.270> shot<00:01:55.509> and<00:01:55.749> just<00:01:55.810> tracked<00:01:56.439> this

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
as a previous shot and just tracked this

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.010 
as a previous shot and just tracked this
new<00:01:56.979> graphic<00:01:57.489> over<00:01:57.969> this<00:01:58.149> screen<00:01:58.479> behind<00:01:58.630> him

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
new graphic over this screen behind him

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.609 
new graphic over this screen behind him
so<00:01:59.259> now<00:01:59.409> we<00:01:59.469> have<00:01:59.679> this<00:01:59.919> and<00:02:02.700> now<00:02:04.259> we<00:02:05.259> just<00:02:05.560> need

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
so now we have this and now we just need

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.319 
so now we have this and now we just need
to<00:02:05.799> have<00:02:05.979> this<00:02:06.159> guy<00:02:06.399> in<00:02:06.429> front<00:02:06.909> of<00:02:06.969> the<00:02:07.090> screen

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
to have this guy in front of the screen

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.590 
to have this guy in front of the screen
so<00:02:07.659> I<00:02:07.689> wrote<00:02:07.989> a<00:02:08.020> scope<00:02:08.349> Tim<00:02:08.670> just<00:02:09.670> tracing<00:02:10.479> his

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
so I wrote a scope Tim just tracing his

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.250 
so I wrote a scope Tim just tracing his
movement<00:02:11.020> and<00:02:11.140> put<00:02:12.100> him<00:02:12.310> over<00:02:12.490> the<00:02:12.730> new<00:02:12.850> screen

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.550 

and<00:02:16.260> for<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.160> first<00:02:17.370> helicopter<00:02:17.610> shot<00:02:18.560> here's

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
and for the first helicopter shot here's

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.560 
and for the first helicopter shot here's
the<00:02:19.710> original<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.340> all<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.610> did<00:02:21.000> was<00:02:21.180> add<00:02:21.390> the

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
the original and all I did was add the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.740 
the original and all I did was add the
stenciled<00:02:22.080> words<00:02:22.910> but<00:02:23.910> tracking<00:02:24.210> this<00:02:24.540> was<00:02:24.720> a

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
stenciled words but tracking this was a

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.630 
stenciled words but tracking this was a
pain<00:02:25.050> because<00:02:25.500> not<00:02:25.680> only<00:02:25.710> is<00:02:26.070> it<00:02:26.100> moving<00:02:26.520> up

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
pain because not only is it moving up

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.030 
pain because not only is it moving up
and<00:02:26.790> down<00:02:26.850> it's<00:02:27.360> moving<00:02:27.720> back<00:02:28.080> it's<00:02:28.470> rotating

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
and down it's moving back it's rotating

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.400 
and down it's moving back it's rotating
a<00:02:29.130> little<00:02:29.340> bit<00:02:29.520> so<00:02:30.450> this<00:02:30.600> perspective<00:02:30.960> is<00:02:31.380> just

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
a little bit so this perspective is just

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.190 
a little bit so this perspective is just
all<00:02:31.770> over<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.160> place<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:33.720> took<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:34.020> few

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
all over the place it took a few

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.900 
all over the place it took a few
attempts<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.920> for<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:37.980> final<00:02:38.220> helicopter

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
attempts and for the final helicopter

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.290 
attempts and for the final helicopter
shot<00:02:40.070> this<00:02:41.070> is<00:02:41.220> just<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.490> background<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:42.000> clouds

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
shot this is just a background of clouds

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.040 
shot this is just a background of clouds
and<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.780> helicopter<00:02:43.470> is<00:02:43.620> CG<00:02:44.130> I<00:02:45.090> found<00:02:45.570> a<00:02:45.690> CG

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
and the helicopter is CG I found a CG

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.690 
and the helicopter is CG I found a CG
model<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.680> same<00:02:46.890> helicopter<00:02:47.550> in<00:02:47.640> the

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
model of the same helicopter in the

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.140 
model of the same helicopter in the
previous<00:02:48.120> shot<00:02:48.470> sky<00:02:49.470> crane<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.160> just<00:02:51.000> found

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
previous shot sky crane and just found

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.150 
previous shot sky crane and just found
the<00:02:51.300> angle<00:02:51.690> that<00:02:51.840> I<00:02:51.870> needed<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.470> animated<00:02:53.070> it

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
the angle that I needed and animated it

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.730 
the angle that I needed and animated it
across<00:02:53.460> the<00:02:53.700> frame<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.300> for<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.350> massive

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
across the frame and for the massive

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.470 
across the frame and for the massive
amounts<00:02:56.100> of<00:02:56.160> Reese's<00:02:56.490> Pieces<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:57.000> used<00:02:57.360> a

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
amounts of Reese's Pieces I used a

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.380 
amounts of Reese's Pieces I used a
particle<00:02:57.960> generator<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.620> After<00:02:58.920> Effects<00:02:59.390> you

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
particle generator and After Effects you

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.620 
particle generator and After Effects you
can<00:03:00.540> set<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.900> shape<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.530> size<00:03:01.740> and<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.220> color

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
can set the shape the size and the color

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.250 
can set the shape the size and the color
in<00:03:03.630> this<00:03:03.810> case<00:03:04.020> orange<00:03:04.560> yellow<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:05.010> brown<00:03:05.220> and

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
in this case orange yellow and brown and

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.470 
in this case orange yellow and brown and
I<00:03:07.260> had<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.070> emit<00:03:08.370> particles<00:03:08.610> from<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.150> back<00:03:09.330> of

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
I had it emit particles from the back of

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.130 
I had it emit particles from the back of
the<00:03:09.540> helicopter<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:10.440> this<00:03:11.280> is<00:03:11.490> tricky

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
the helicopter and this is tricky

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.600 
the helicopter and this is tricky
adjusting<00:03:13.140> how<00:03:13.260> they<00:03:13.410> fall<00:03:13.710> and<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.160> gravity

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
adjusting how they fall and the gravity

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.210 
adjusting how they fall and the gravity
that<00:03:14.640> they<00:03:14.910> have<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.420> wind<00:03:15.630> resistance

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
that they have and the wind resistance

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.890 
that they have and the wind resistance
it<00:03:17.220> takes<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.490> while<00:03:17.610> to<00:03:17.790> get<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.090> but<00:03:18.300> I<00:03:18.510> think<00:03:18.840> I

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
it takes a while to get it but I think I

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.120 
it takes a while to get it but I think I
got<00:03:19.050> it<00:03:19.200> pretty<00:03:19.320> close<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:20.720> here's<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.840> final

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
got it pretty close and here's the final

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.160 
got it pretty close and here's the final
sequence

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.020 

this<00:03:28.830> is<00:03:29.010> what<00:03:29.130> I<00:03:29.160> need<00:03:29.400> your<00:03:29.550> money

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.350 

and<00:03:32.540> we're<00:03:32.720> gonna<00:03:32.840> use<00:03:33.110> this<00:03:33.440> as<00:03:33.860> bait<00:03:34.360> lay

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
and we're gonna use this as bait lay

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.720 
and we're gonna use this as bait lay
down<00:03:35.570> a<00:03:35.600> set<00:03:35.960> it<00:03:36.470> smells<00:03:36.710> real<00:03:37.360> bait

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
down a set it smells real bait

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.649 
down a set it smells real bait
to<00:03:39.879> be<00:03:40.000> fresh<00:03:40.690> untouched<00:03:41.440> by<00:03:41.860> human<00:03:42.370> hands

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
to be fresh untouched by human hands

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.300 
to be fresh untouched by human hands
around<00:03:43.659> here<00:03:44.170> they're<00:03:44.470> gonna<00:03:44.680> drop<00:03:45.069> on

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
around here they're gonna drop on

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.260 
around here they're gonna drop on
tonight

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
tonight

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.860 
tonight
during<00:03:48.270> job<00:03:48.510> zone<00:03:48.750> now<00:03:50.090> and<00:03:51.090> are<00:03:51.360> gonna<00:03:51.540> save

during job zone now and are gonna save

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.080 
during job zone now and are gonna save
me
