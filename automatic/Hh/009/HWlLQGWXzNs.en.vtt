00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.439

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.619

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:35.330
 Wore here for a long time and like butter de shit 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:39.949
 as you can see, we are only now times 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:42.230
 now credits fall here stirred 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:46.460
 and now we go the others 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:49.699
 ingredients and once 120 grams 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.510
 brown sugar if you can not have one 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:56.530
 you also take two eggs 2 normal 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.820
 tablespoon of milk 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.629
 I'll call my biomilch here again 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.870

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.940
 my 22 grams cacau weighed you 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.479
 I go to some warm water and 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.580
 lead this to a relatively tough mass 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.540
 and this is now my pastilla I 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.320
 was about 3 4 tablespoons that was 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:26.270
 Going water solves the market 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.920
 this suits her and all that 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.760
 reveals now first you abide me 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.760
 to let 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:38.130
 because I have here 120 km approximately one 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:42.650
 three quarters teaspoon baking powder 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.650
 mix in here now slowly 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.810
 I have here again a sheet muffin 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.150
 I have my shape here again 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.570
 village life and there I feel mine now 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.570
 pure mass 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.270
 Now we just pack everything at 180 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.960
 Degree 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.700
 You will see about 15 minutes here 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.690
 I have decided I have here 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.100
 150 grams of butter rhine given and on 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.020
 this good we now give powdered sugar 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.730
 I do not touch the butter cream now 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.660
 and not a little ridiculous of that 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:28.110
 sugar with the mother so we have there 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.030
 another one open already 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.020
 her mother 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.310
 this is my buttercream i have her 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.100
 then touched a little bit everything 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.930
 had with the hearing aid again 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.610
 the fork i worked on next 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.930
 again would have a bowl 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.990
 I just got that bowl from 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.430
 the four squares namely food 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.820
 Violet experience you see that 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.640
 granular my friend may have 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:55.310
 desired so not because namely 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:59.550
 my milk again and first one 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.470
 tablespoon and give the situation changes 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:06.290
 the color dissolves and now 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:09.750
 I lose everything clearly affirmed 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:13.590
 The granules dissolve and then leave 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.850
 we want to add everything to the mother now 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.310
 we only do it with the fork 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.310
 I should have used before 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:32.459
 Now you have a sack of hers 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:35.879
 here and I take about a reasonably 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:40.849
 and then give them in here should be everything 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:44.519
 and it would be me a cupcake equal 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:46.170
 you see something tough here because they are 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:51.510
 have moved something but it is 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:54.139
 not so bad and then we inject 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.139
 once 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.430
 this butter hood on top 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.239
 what then 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.040
 the whole thing looks like this 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:34.360
 and now we give up above 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:36.970
 once a white sugar pearl as a decoration 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:43.530
 On top of that it was already there 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:47.830
 are my super delicious chocolate biscuit 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:51.000
 with a meanwhile Jerusalem hood 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.000
 and a white sugar
