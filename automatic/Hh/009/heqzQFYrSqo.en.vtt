00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
filled in these 2015 model here you see

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.130 
filled in these 2015 model here you see
that<00:00:41.399> yeah<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.059> wheel<00:00:42.239> base<00:00:42.450> on<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> outback

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
that yeah the wheel base on the outback

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.350 
that yeah the wheel base on the outback
is<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> little<00:00:43.680> bit<00:00:43.829> longer<00:00:44.040> than<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.879> Forester

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
is a little bit longer than the Forester

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
meaning the front wheels and the back

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.100 
meaning the front wheels and the back
wheels<00:00:47.190> are<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> little<00:00:47.700> farther<00:00:47.910> apart<00:00:48.120> what

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
wheels are a little farther apart what

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.750 
wheels are a little farther apart what
that<00:00:49.260> does<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.530> creates<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.219> little<00:00:50.370> smoother

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
that does is creates a little smoother
