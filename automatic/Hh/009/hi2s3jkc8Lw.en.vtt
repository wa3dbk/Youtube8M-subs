00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.980

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:23.260
 small today we have Easter eggs dad 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.590
 completed and today we have such 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:33.090
 unusual easter eggs and according to the rank of the Internet 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:37.750
 no, although there is called pro 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.040
 purple man phone-guy and I tell you 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:46.060
 tell you this 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:52.870
 and can it appear or not so well 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:59.730
 as we see his picture is just 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:03.870
 comic won all human 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.110
 move the foxy cold and dude just 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:16.270
 comic 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:20.380
 the picture here is real in this world so 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:25.150
 see he is holding something like a phone 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:29.409
 and he he has a badge and now I tell you 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:34.180
 I will show a very very very rare screen 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:37.930
 which I tried to get almost a year 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:42.750
 I spent so much time on it 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:47.710
 assigned a real phone-guy in the office 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:52.060
 I'll be honest to find him 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:59.560
 his file or I failed but when i 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:01.320
 rummaged in the golden freddie file i found 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.080
 it was him 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:11.750
 it's just like to say 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:16.700
 texture Freddie is already a phone-guy 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:19.050
 the chance of his appearance somewhere now I will say 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.910
 even one percent no 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.970
 half a percent it's just go nuts he 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.380
 so rarely appears 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:37.410
 which is generally very creepy 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:41.670
 dude it happened to me as well when 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.970
 we friends played fight night freddie they 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.060
 stupidly raged about well, I wanted to wipe 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:53.220
 so that the sea is not their paolo 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:58.620
 as we see, it starts already jumping well 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:02.480
 starts coming out puppet bases on 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:06.269
 earth screen and this phone-guy appeared 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:11.340
 who does not believe you can check it yourself 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:19.230
 even photoshop which photoshop was 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:22.260
 come on i don't know well yourself with the very fault in 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.470
 his hands mikrofonchik but it's just 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:31.019

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:35.510
 texture phone-guy and so even them 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:40.230
 the arrangement is the same that angle freddie 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:44.700
 like the phone-guy, and he is the same 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:51.620
 lies and holds the microphone like this, as it were 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.620
