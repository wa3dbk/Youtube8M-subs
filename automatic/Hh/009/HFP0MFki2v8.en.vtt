the wall you were so close you could
have<00:02:53.230> touched<00:02:53.409> it<00:02:53.680> before<00:02:54.159> the<00:02:54.549> turn<00:02:54.930> that's

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
have touched it before the turn that's

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.110 
have touched it before the turn that's
not<00:02:56.260> so<00:02:56.500> hot<00:02:56.709> you<00:02:57.099> want<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.370> be<00:02:57.489> farther<00:02:58.030> away

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
not so hot you want to be farther away

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:06.220 
not so hot you want to be farther away
from<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.569> wall<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:58.989> get<00:02:59.560> a<00:02:59.590> big<00:02:59.950> full<00:03:00.280> stroke

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.080 

Tony<00:03:07.230> I<00:03:07.350> can<00:03:07.470> tell<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.650> not<00:03:07.800> rotating<00:03:08.430> much<00:03:08.850> in

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
Tony I can tell you not rotating much in

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.340 
Tony I can tell you not rotating much in
your<00:03:09.180> back<00:03:09.330> stroke<00:03:09.600> your<00:03:09.780> shoulders<00:03:10.170> aren't

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
your back stroke your shoulders aren't

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.100 
your back stroke your shoulders aren't
coming<00:03:10.650> out<00:03:11.090> too<00:03:12.090> close<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.630> wall<00:03:12.660> because

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
coming out too close to the wall because

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.290 
coming out too close to the wall because
you<00:03:13.230> bumped<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.800> hit<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.030> got<00:03:15.180> to

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
you bumped it and hit it so you got to

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.050 
you bumped it and hit it so you got to
take<00:03:15.420> care<00:03:15.480> of<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:16.070> rolling<00:03:17.070> over<00:03:17.280> farther

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
take care of that rolling over farther

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:34.420 
take care of that rolling over farther
from<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:18.450> wall<00:03:19.070> streamline<00:03:20.150> longer

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.920 

head<00:03:36.230> no<00:03:37.230> looking<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:37.890> there<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.690> didn't

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
head no looking and there and you didn't

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.920 
head no looking and there and you didn't
do<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.050> flip<00:03:40.230> turn<00:03:41.300> where<00:03:42.300> was<00:03:42.420> your<00:03:42.540> full<00:03:42.720> turn

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
do a flip turn where was your full turn

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.000 
do a flip turn where was your full turn
and<00:03:44.030> your<00:03:45.030> stream<00:03:45.630> line<00:03:45.989> for<00:03:46.319> backstroke<00:03:46.800> you

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
and your stream line for backstroke you

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.479 
and your stream line for backstroke you
looked<00:03:47.400> down<00:03:47.520> the<00:03:47.970> pool<00:03:48.180> on<00:03:48.420> your<00:03:48.599> streamline

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
looked down the pool on your streamline

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:56.420 
looked down the pool on your streamline
probably<00:03:50.489> rolled<00:03:50.880> over<00:03:51.300> too<00:03:51.480> far<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:55.430> roll

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
probably rolled over too far to roll

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.720 
probably rolled over too far to roll
your<00:03:56.610> head<00:03:56.730> put<00:03:56.940> your<00:03:57.090> head<00:03:57.209> back<00:03:57.360> in<00:03:57.420> back
