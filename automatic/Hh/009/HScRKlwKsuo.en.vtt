I<00:02:26.739> did<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.069> by<00:02:27.160> myself<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.760> I<00:02:28.030> do<00:02:28.209> wish<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:28.780> I

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
I did it by myself and I do wish that I

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.370 
I did it by myself and I do wish that I
did<00:02:29.200> do<00:02:29.349> it<00:02:29.470> with<00:02:29.680> another<00:02:30.190> person<00:02:30.610> because

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
did do it with another person because

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.440 
did do it with another person because
the<00:02:32.380> skins<00:02:32.709> are<00:02:32.890> really<00:02:33.220> sticky<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:33.790> as<00:02:34.239> soon

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
the skins are really sticky and as soon

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.059 
the skins are really sticky and as soon
as<00:02:34.599> I<00:02:34.630> touch<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.900> surface<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.530> real<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:35.709> have<00:02:35.920> to

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
as I touch a surface the real I have to

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.160 
as I touch a surface the real I have to
get<00:02:36.220> back<00:02:36.370> up<00:02:36.549> and<00:02:36.880> as<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:37.599> can<00:02:37.690> see<00:02:37.750> on<00:02:38.079> the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
get back up and as you can see on the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.259 
get back up and as you can see on the
first<00:02:38.349> plate<00:02:38.650> skin<00:02:39.010> I've<00:02:39.190> actually<00:02:39.430> well<00:02:40.060> you

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
first plate skin I've actually well you

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.089 
first plate skin I've actually well you
probably<00:02:40.450> can't<00:02:40.720> see<00:02:40.840> but<00:02:40.870> off<00:02:41.079> tipped<00:02:41.709> a<00:02:41.920> few

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
probably can't see but off tipped a few

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.180 
probably can't see but off tipped a few
areas<00:02:42.280> he<00:02:42.910> is<00:02:43.170> not<00:02:44.170> sticking<00:02:44.530> down<00:02:44.799> properly

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
areas he is not sticking down properly

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.640 
areas he is not sticking down properly
so<00:02:45.310> I'm<00:02:45.489> a<00:02:45.519> bit<00:02:45.730> disappointed<00:02:45.880> with<00:02:46.239> that<00:02:46.650> you

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
so I'm a bit disappointed with that you

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.170 
so I'm a bit disappointed with that you
get<00:02:47.860> smaller<00:02:48.250> pieces<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.970> cover<00:02:49.329> up<00:02:49.569> the<00:02:51.180> disk

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
get smaller pieces to cover up the disk

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.750 
get smaller pieces to cover up the disk
tray<00:02:52.599> and<00:02:52.870> also<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.230> eject<00:02:53.560> button<00:02:53.680> your<00:02:54.579> also

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
tray and also the eject button your also

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.850 
tray and also the eject button your also
had<00:02:54.879> a<00:02:54.910> piece<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.239> come<00:02:55.390> up<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.959> power<00:02:56.500> button

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
had a piece to come up the power button

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.770 
had a piece to come up the power button
but<00:02:57.129> I<00:02:57.160> decided<00:02:57.489> not<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:57.849> use<00:02:58.269> her<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:58.660> I<00:02:58.720> took

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
but I decided not to use her and I took

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.420 
but I decided not to use her and I took
it<00:02:59.019> off<00:02:59.110> and<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.410> bit<00:02:59.590> of<00:02:59.709> residue<00:03:00.130> was

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
it off and the bit of residue was

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.509 
it off and the bit of residue was
actually<00:03:00.760> left<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.769> I'm<00:03:02.769> kind<00:03:03.250> of<00:03:03.310> dreading

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
actually left and I'm kind of dreading

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.520 
actually left and I'm kind of dreading
taking<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.120> skin<00:03:04.420> off<00:03:04.450> because<00:03:05.049> I<00:03:05.139> feel<00:03:05.319> that

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
taking the skin off because I feel that

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.640 
taking the skin off because I feel that
there's<00:03:05.680> gonna<00:03:05.799> be<00:03:06.090> residue<00:03:07.200> all<00:03:08.200> over<00:03:08.260> the

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
there's gonna be residue all over the

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.039 
there's gonna be residue all over the
console<00:03:09.069> so<00:03:09.489> I<00:03:09.700> hope<00:03:10.030> that<00:03:10.450> there<00:03:10.600> isn't<00:03:10.870> but

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
console so I hope that there isn't but

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.460 
console so I hope that there isn't but
