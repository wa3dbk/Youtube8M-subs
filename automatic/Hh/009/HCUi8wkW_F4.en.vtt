lot<00:02:06.640> of<00:02:06.670> fish<00:02:06.910> over<00:02:07.240> on<00:02:07.360> that<00:02:07.479> corner<00:02:07.869> there's

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
lot of fish over on that corner there's

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.900 
lot of fish over on that corner there's
couple<00:02:08.259> of<00:02:08.350> swims<00:02:08.560> over<00:02:08.920> there<00:02:09.069> one's<00:02:09.670> called

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
couple of swims over there one's called

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.180 
couple of swims over there one's called
the<00:02:10.000> cage<00:02:10.270> yeah<00:02:10.600> one's<00:02:10.840> called<00:02:11.080> Dunkirk<00:02:11.590> but

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
the cage yeah one's called Dunkirk but

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.610 
the cage yeah one's called Dunkirk but
because<00:02:12.490> those<00:02:12.700> decoy<00:02:13.390> bucks<00:02:13.750> are<00:02:14.050> out<00:02:14.200> in

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
because those decoy bucks are out in

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.350 
because those decoy bucks are out in
front<00:02:14.890> of<00:02:15.040> those<00:02:15.100> swims<00:02:15.400> we<00:02:15.640> can't<00:02:15.910> fish<00:02:16.180> them

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
front of those swims we can't fish them

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.940 
front of those swims we can't fish them
there's<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:16.840> guy<00:02:16.959> that<00:02:16.990> shoots<00:02:17.319> on<00:02:17.590> here<00:02:17.830> or

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
there's a guy that shoots on here or

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.949 
there's a guy that shoots on here or
winter<00:02:18.430> takes<00:02:18.880> them<00:02:19.090> back<00:02:19.240> out<00:02:19.450> in<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.660> spring

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
winter takes them back out in the spring

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.780 
winter takes them back out in the spring
and<00:02:20.110> then<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.620> whole<00:02:20.860> lakes<00:02:21.100> open<00:02:21.520> again<00:02:21.760> but

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
and then the whole lakes open again but

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.150 
and then the whole lakes open again but
having<00:02:22.240> them<00:02:22.420> on<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.720> surface<00:02:22.980> means<00:02:23.980> that

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
having them on the surface means that

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.470 
having them on the surface means that
the<00:02:24.250> fish<00:02:24.400> lights<00:02:24.790> are<00:02:25.000> congregate

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
the fish lights are congregate

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.360 
the fish lights are congregate
underneath<00:02:25.990> them<00:02:26.260> fish<00:02:26.680> would<00:02:26.830> love<00:02:27.010> cover

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
underneath them fish would love cover

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.250 
underneath them fish would love cover
and<00:02:27.940> if<00:02:28.030> it's<00:02:28.180> just<00:02:28.390> something<00:02:28.780> like<00:02:28.930> that

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
and if it's just something like that

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.140 
and if it's just something like that
just<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.740> strip<00:02:30.130> of<00:02:30.250> Bucks<00:02:30.490> like<00:02:30.760> that

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
just a strip of Bucks like that

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.150 
just a strip of Bucks like that
there's<00:02:31.450> poles<00:02:31.720> underneath<00:02:32.230> them<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.740> the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
there's poles underneath them and the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.740 
there's poles underneath them and the
fish<00:02:33.370> will<00:02:33.520> be<00:02:33.670> all<00:02:33.819> around<00:02:33.970> them<00:02:34.390> so<00:02:34.599> what

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
fish will be all around them so what

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.750 
fish will be all around them so what
basically<00:02:35.050> did<00:02:35.380> was<00:02:35.890> cast<00:02:36.190> out<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.520> float

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
basically did was cast out the float

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.940 
basically did was cast out the float
from<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.060> front<00:02:37.270> of<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.450> swim<00:02:37.720> when<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.500> little

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
from the front of the swim when a little

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.589 
from the front of the swim when a little
bit<00:02:39.069> beyond<00:02:39.430> where<00:02:39.610> I<00:02:39.670> wanted<00:02:40.000> a<00:02:40.090> fish<00:02:40.330> and

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
bit beyond where I wanted a fish and

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.020 
bit beyond where I wanted a fish and
then<00:02:41.020> pulled<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.410> float<00:02:41.709> back<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.550> let<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:42.910> up

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
then pulled the float back and let it up

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.059 
then pulled the float back and let it up
so<00:02:43.300> it<00:02:43.390> was<00:02:43.450> roughly<00:02:43.870> level<00:02:44.170> with<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.800> edge<00:02:44.920> of

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
so it was roughly level with the edge of

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.460 
so it was roughly level with the edge of
the<00:02:45.190> ducks<00:02:45.430> because<00:02:46.030> if<00:02:46.209> I<00:02:46.300> fish<00:02:46.569> too<00:02:46.780> far<00:02:47.140> and

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
the ducks because if I fish too far and

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.650 
the ducks because if I fish too far and
then<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.250> fish<00:02:48.430> carts<00:02:48.790> right<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.270> goes<00:02:49.420> round

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
then the fish carts right and goes round

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.880 
then the fish carts right and goes round
one<00:02:49.870> of<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.020> poles<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.530> Ducks<00:02:50.739> are

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
one of the poles that the Ducks are

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.979 
one of the poles that the Ducks are
attached<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.459> I'm<00:02:51.670> gonna<00:02:52.209> lose<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:52.840> there's

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
attached to I'm gonna lose it so there's

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.750 
attached to I'm gonna lose it so there's
no<00:02:53.080> point<00:02:53.380> getting<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.680> bite<00:02:53.860> if<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.550> fish<00:02:54.730> is

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
no point getting a bite if the fish is

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.910 
no point getting a bite if the fish is
gonna<00:02:55.030> come<00:02:55.270> off<00:02:55.300> so<00:02:55.720> once<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.380> floats<00:02:56.620> up<00:02:56.800> on

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
gonna come off so once the floats up on

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.890 
gonna come off so once the floats up on
the<00:02:57.010> surface<00:02:57.489> I<00:02:57.730> leaked<00:02:58.300> it<00:02:58.420> around<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.780> other

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
the surface I leaked it around the other

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.260 
the surface I leaked it around the other
side<00:02:59.020> to<00:02:59.890> make<00:03:00.069> sure<00:03:00.099> that<00:03:00.550> it<00:03:00.700> was<00:03:00.880> living

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
side to make sure that it was living

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.060 
side to make sure that it was living
with<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.510> Ducks<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:01.990> not<00:03:02.110> so<00:03:02.320> far<00:03:02.590> out<00:03:02.830> and

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
with the Ducks and not so far out and

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.950 
with the Ducks and not so far out and
all<00:03:03.580> I<00:03:03.730> did<00:03:03.790> because<00:03:04.240> I<00:03:04.270> was<00:03:04.360> racing<00:03:04.570> against

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
all I did because I was racing against

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.900 
all I did because I was racing against
the<00:03:05.080> law<00:03:05.260> we<00:03:05.740> just<00:03:05.980> sprayed<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.310> little<00:03:06.580> bit<00:03:06.820> of

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
the law we just sprayed a little bit of

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.230 
the law we just sprayed a little bit of
bye

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
bye

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.020 
bye
all<00:03:07.690> around<00:03:08.080> that<00:03:08.320> float<00:03:08.620> from<00:03:09.490> the<00:03:09.640> back<00:03:09.850> of

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
all around that float from the back of

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.940 
all around that float from the back of
it<00:03:10.150> coming<00:03:10.510> up<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:11.140> it<00:03:11.260> so<00:03:11.440> basically<00:03:11.650> there's

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
it coming up to it so basically there's

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.040 
it coming up to it so basically there's
nobody<00:03:12.340> over<00:03:12.490> the<00:03:12.640> top<00:03:12.820> of<00:03:12.850> my<00:03:13.030> line<00:03:13.210> it's<00:03:13.870> all

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
nobody over the top of my line it's all

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.570 
nobody over the top of my line it's all
beyond<00:03:14.380> it<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:14.650> then<00:03:14.800> that<00:03:15.010> gives<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.370> fish

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
beyond it and then that gives the fish

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.660 
beyond it and then that gives the fish
an<00:03:15.940> opportunity<00:03:16.780> out<00:03:16.810> there<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:18.280> basically

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
an opportunity out there to basically

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.210 
an opportunity out there to basically
feed<00:03:19.030> where<00:03:19.390> there's<00:03:19.570> no<00:03:19.750> line<00:03:20.050> and<00:03:20.410> I've<00:03:21.040> way

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
feed where there's no line and I've way

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.220 
feed where there's no line and I've way
on<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.430> marker<00:03:21.790> float<00:03:22.030> in<00:03:22.270> and<00:03:22.510> then<00:03:22.900> put<00:03:23.110> it

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
on the marker float in and then put it

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.930 
on the marker float in and then put it
round<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.800> poles<00:03:24.040> at<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.370> back<00:03:24.520> of<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.730> swim

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
round the poles at the back of the swim

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.820 
round the poles at the back of the swim
which<00:03:25.120> were<00:03:25.240> a<00:03:25.270> Roebling<00:03:25.630> for<00:03:25.870> part<00:03:26.080> it<00:03:26.230> was<00:03:26.320> 24

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
which were a Roebling for part it was 24

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.920 
which were a Roebling for part it was 24
rod<00:03:27.070> links<00:03:27.460> and<00:03:27.970> then<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.210> fishing<00:03:28.570> rods<00:03:28.750> I've

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
rod links and then the fishing rods I've

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.240 
rod links and then the fishing rods I've
done<00:03:29.080> the<00:03:29.200> same<00:03:29.410> thing<00:03:29.620> so<00:03:29.740> I've<00:03:29.830> pulled<00:03:30.070> the

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
done the same thing so I've pulled the

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.100 
done the same thing so I've pulled the
flow<00:03:30.430> out<00:03:30.730> of<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:30.940> swim<00:03:31.210> so<00:03:31.690> I'm<00:03:31.780> not<00:03:31.900> casting

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
flow out of the swim so I'm not casting

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.570 
flow out of the swim so I'm not casting
anywhere<00:03:32.560> in<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.710> area<00:03:32.890> I<00:03:32.980> can't<00:03:33.190> get<00:03:33.370> wrapped

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
anywhere in the area I can't get wrapped

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.490 
anywhere in the area I can't get wrapped
up<00:03:33.730> round<00:03:34.000> it<00:03:34.270> and<00:03:34.540> then<00:03:34.870> at<00:03:34.990> the<00:03:35.080> front<00:03:35.200> of<00:03:35.380> the

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
up round it and then at the front of the

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.950 
up round it and then at the front of the
swim<00:03:35.740> of<00:03:36.370> whack<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.820> rods<00:03:37.030> out<00:03:37.240> they<00:03:37.630> hit<00:03:37.810> the

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
swim of whack the rods out they hit the

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.570 
swim of whack the rods out they hit the
clip<00:03:38.200> and<00:03:38.440> they're<00:03:38.560> dropping<00:03:38.890> in<00:03:38.980> exactly<00:03:39.400> the

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
clip and they're dropping in exactly the

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.310 
clip and they're dropping in exactly the
same<00:03:39.760> position<00:03:39.910> I've<00:03:40.330> just<00:03:40.570> splayed<00:03:40.930> I'm<00:03:41.170> out

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
same position I've just splayed I'm out

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.110 
same position I've just splayed I'm out
probably<00:03:41.980> a<00:03:42.040> rod<00:03:42.250> length<00:03:42.430> apart<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:43.000> begin

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
probably a rod length apart to begin

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.780 
probably a rod length apart to begin
with<00:03:43.480> I<00:03:43.720> did<00:03:44.170> want<00:03:44.380> a<00:03:44.410> spot<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.860> be<00:03:44.980> honest<00:03:45.280> but

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
with I did want a spot to be honest but

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.550 
with I did want a spot to be honest but
it<00:03:45.880> suits<00:03:46.180> over<00:03:46.570> there<00:03:46.690> to<00:03:46.870> walk<00:03:47.020> around<00:03:47.140> and

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
it suits over there to walk around and

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.530 
it suits over there to walk around and
just<00:03:47.680> spray<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.100> bite<00:03:48.250> around<00:03:48.460> they<00:03:49.390> let

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
just spray the bite around they let

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.940 
just spray the bite around they let
produce<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:49.960> fish<00:03:50.140> for<00:03:50.380> me<00:03:50.500> in<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.680> middle<00:03:50.860> of

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
produce the fish for me in the middle of

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.920 
produce the fish for me in the middle of
the<00:03:51.040> night<00:03:51.220> I<00:03:51.520> had<00:03:51.850> a<00:03:51.880> maverick<00:03:52.120> er<00:03:52.480> ansan<00:03:52.900> a

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
the night I had a maverick er ansan a

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.930 
the night I had a maverick er ansan a
rod<00:03:53.170> and<00:03:53.440> when<00:03:53.530> I<00:03:53.590> wound<00:03:53.830> in<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.700> hooklink

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
rod and when I wound in the hooklink

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.670 
rod and when I wound in the hooklink
looked<00:03:55.300> a<00:03:55.420> little<00:03:55.510> bit<00:03:55.750> twisted<00:03:56.050> and<00:03:56.350> I<00:03:56.380> wonder

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
looked a little bit twisted and I wonder

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.110 
looked a little bit twisted and I wonder
if<00:03:56.770> it<00:03:56.920> was<00:03:57.040> sitting<00:03:57.310> a<00:03:57.370> little<00:03:57.460> bit<00:03:57.610> funny

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
if it was sitting a little bit funny

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.120 
if it was sitting a little bit funny
so<00:03:58.690> when<00:03:59.260> I'm<00:03:59.350> putting<00:03:59.500> back<00:03:59.680> out<00:03:59.890> there<00:04:00.100> on

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
so when I'm putting back out there on

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.170 
so when I'm putting back out there on
gravis<00:04:00.430> you're<00:04:00.520> gonna<00:04:00.610> pay<00:04:00.820> more<00:04:01.030> attention

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
gravis you're gonna pay more attention

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.510 
gravis you're gonna pay more attention
when<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.810> cast<00:04:02.020> goes<00:04:02.290> out<00:04:02.560> make<00:04:03.160> sure<00:04:03.370> they're

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
when the cast goes out make sure they're

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.490 
when the cast goes out make sure they're
definitely<00:04:03.730> not<00:04:04.120> tangled<00:04:04.660> and<00:04:04.810> I<00:04:04.840> reckon<00:04:05.470> that

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
definitely not tangled and I reckon that

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.470 
definitely not tangled and I reckon that
area<00:04:06.010> will<00:04:06.130> definitely<00:04:06.670> produce<00:04:06.820> more<00:04:07.240> bites

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
area will definitely produce more bites

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.510 
area will definitely produce more bites
for<00:04:07.780> me<00:04:07.900> tonight<00:04:08.080> and<00:04:09.010> then<00:04:09.100> this<00:04:09.220> morning

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
for me tonight and then this morning

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.370 
for me tonight and then this morning
fish<00:04:09.970> started<00:04:10.330> showing<00:04:10.540> in<00:04:10.750> between<00:04:11.080> me<00:04:11.260> and

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
fish started showing in between me and

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.900 
fish started showing in between me and
Johnny<00:04:11.590> man<00:04:11.830> who's<00:04:12.040> just<00:04:12.100> a<00:04:12.280> bit<00:04:12.430> down<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:12.760> way

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
Johnny man who's just a bit down the way

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.450 
Johnny man who's just a bit down the way
their<00:04:13.210> fish<00:04:14.080> started<00:04:14.440> showing<00:04:14.590> just<00:04:15.010> out<00:04:15.220> here

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
their fish started showing just out here

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.670 
their fish started showing just out here
at<00:04:15.610> the<00:04:15.700> bottom<00:04:15.970> of<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.120> marginal<00:04:16.570> slope<00:04:16.870> the

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
at the bottom of the marginal slope the

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.410 
at the bottom of the marginal slope the
last<00:04:17.920> time<00:04:18.130> I<00:04:18.220> fish<00:04:18.430> this<00:04:18.580> lake<00:04:18.640> I<00:04:19.000> fished<00:04:19.239> this

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
last time I fish this lake I fished this

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.000 
last time I fish this lake I fished this
room<00:04:19.660> just<00:04:19.870> for<00:04:19.989> one<00:04:20.170> night<00:04:20.200> and<00:04:20.650> I<00:04:20.710> caught<00:04:20.890> the

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
room just for one night and I caught the

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.950 
room just for one night and I caught the
fish<00:04:21.160> there<00:04:21.460> so<00:04:22.030> that's<00:04:22.330> a<00:04:22.390> great<00:04:22.630> place<00:04:22.930> to

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
fish there so that's a great place to

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.350 
fish there so that's a great place to
put<00:04:23.290> a<00:04:23.320> few<00:04:23.530> bites<00:04:23.800> and<00:04:24.100> then<00:04:24.640> put<00:04:24.850> a<00:04:24.880> rod<00:04:25.090> there

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
put a few bites and then put a rod there

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.510 
put a few bites and then put a rod there
fish<00:04:25.690> start<00:04:25.960> showing<00:04:26.320> there<00:04:26.440> again<00:04:26.740> I<00:04:26.980> can<00:04:27.340> put

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
fish start showing there again I can put

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.220 
fish start showing there again I can put
rod<00:04:27.700> there<00:04:27.910> so<00:04:28.060> I've<00:04:28.150> actually<00:04:28.300> got<00:04:28.570> two<00:04:28.780> areas

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
rod there so I've actually got two areas

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.410 
rod there so I've actually got two areas
going<00:04:29.560> I've<00:04:29.680> got<00:04:29.710> one<00:04:30.070> that's<00:04:30.340> basically<00:04:31.270> out

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
going I've got one that's basically out

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.320 
going I've got one that's basically out
on<00:04:31.810> those<00:04:32.260> two<00:04:32.650> tall<00:04:33.010> trees<00:04:33.430> that<00:04:34.030> are<00:04:34.120> sort<00:04:34.270> of

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
on those two tall trees that are sort of

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.730 
on those two tall trees that are sort of
golden<00:04:34.690> colored<00:04:35.080> we've<00:04:35.260> got<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.500> Christmas

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
golden colored we've got the Christmas

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.610 
golden colored we've got the Christmas
trees<00:04:36.220> just<00:04:36.970> behind<00:04:37.270> them<00:04:37.540> that<00:04:38.230> that's<00:04:38.500> the

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
trees just behind them that that's the

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.140 
trees just behind them that that's the
middle<00:04:38.950> of<00:04:39.070> my<00:04:39.190> long<00:04:39.370> range<00:04:39.400> area

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
middle of my long range area

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.270 
middle of my long range area
like<00:04:40.420> I<00:04:40.450> say<00:04:40.720> 24<00:04:41.260> Rhett<00:04:41.470> so<00:04:41.710> just<00:04:41.950> under<00:04:42.220> a

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
like I say 24 Rhett so just under a

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.520 
like I say 24 Rhett so just under a
hundred<00:04:42.460> yards<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:43.480> the<00:04:43.600> other<00:04:43.750> one<00:04:43.990> I<00:04:44.230> don't

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
hundred yards and the other one I don't

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.750 
hundred yards and the other one I don't
need<00:04:44.680> to<00:04:44.770> wrap<00:04:44.950> it<00:04:44.980> round<00:04:45.250> cuz<00:04:45.520> it's<00:04:45.670> only

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
need to wrap it round cuz it's only

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.940 
need to wrap it round cuz it's only
about<00:04:45.910> 20<00:04:46.210> yards<00:04:46.510> just<00:04:46.900> at<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:47.590> bottom<00:04:47.800> of<00:04:47.890> the

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
about 20 yards just at the bottom of the

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.710 
about 20 yards just at the bottom of the
marginal<00:04:48.400> slope<00:04:48.670> and<00:04:49.240> I'll<00:04:49.360> just<00:04:49.540> keep

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
marginal slope and I'll just keep

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.900 
marginal slope and I'll just keep
working<00:04:49.780> both<00:04:50.410> areas<00:04:50.920> if<00:04:51.310> I<00:04:51.370> start<00:04:51.670> getting

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
working both areas if I start getting

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.730 
working both areas if I start getting
more<00:04:52.060> bites<00:04:52.240> on<00:04:52.510> the<00:04:52.540> right<00:04:52.840> then<00:04:53.470> I'll<00:04:53.590> put

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
more bites on the right then I'll put

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.530 
more bites on the right then I'll put
more<00:04:53.860> rods<00:04:54.130> on<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:54.310> right<00:04:54.550> if<00:04:55.030> more<00:04:55.330> bites

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
more rods on the right if more bites

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.420 
more rods on the right if more bites
come<00:04:55.840> out<00:04:56.140> on<00:04:56.380> that<00:04:56.530> long<00:04:56.710> range<00:04:56.890> spot<00:04:57.280> and

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
come out on that long range spot and

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.370 
come out on that long range spot and
that<00:04:57.550> doesn't<00:04:57.850> produce<00:04:57.970> then<00:04:58.780> I'll<00:04:58.900> swap<00:04:59.200> all

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
that doesn't produce then I'll swap all

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.950 
that doesn't produce then I'll swap all
rods<00:04:59.620> out<00:04:59.830> there<00:05:00.070> so<00:05:00.370> that's<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.210> be<00:05:01.360> coy<00:05:01.600> swim

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
rods out there so that's the be coy swim

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.480 
rods out there so that's the be coy swim
I'm<00:05:02.200> going<00:05:02.500> to<00:05:02.560> hand<00:05:02.710> you<00:05:02.830> over<00:05:02.890> to<00:05:03.130> John<00:05:03.370> and

I'm going to hand you over to John and

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.850 
I'm going to hand you over to John and
he's<00:05:03.610> going<00:05:03.790> to<00:05:03.850> talk<00:05:04.000> to<00:05:04.030> you<00:05:04.150> about<00:05:04.210> the<00:05:04.450> wall

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
he's going to talk to you about the wall

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.890 
he's going to talk to you about the wall
well<00:05:05.860> here<00:05:06.430> we<00:05:06.550> are<00:05:06.580> in<00:05:06.880> the<00:05:06.970> wall<00:05:07.150> swim<00:05:07.420> so

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
well here we are in the wall swim so

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.630 
well here we are in the wall swim so
named<00:05:08.140> because<00:05:08.380> there<00:05:08.710> is<00:05:08.800> a<00:05:08.830> wall<00:05:09.130> light<00:05:09.340> bar

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
named because there is a wall light bar

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.910 
named because there is a wall light bar
that<00:05:10.000> runs<00:05:10.420> out<00:05:10.690> from<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:10.990> side<00:05:11.230> it's

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920 
that runs out from the side it's

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.010 
that runs out from the side it's
approximately<00:05:12.460> 24<00:05:12.880> either<00:05:13.060> side<00:05:13.450> with<00:05:13.810> nine

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
approximately 24 either side with nine

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.690 
approximately 24 either side with nine
foot<00:05:14.230> of<00:05:14.350> water<00:05:14.530> on<00:05:14.770> top<00:05:15.010> and<00:05:15.250> if<00:05:15.370> you're<00:05:15.490> aware

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
foot of water on top and if you're aware

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.330 
foot of water on top and if you're aware
its<00:05:15.940> presence<00:05:16.330> and<00:05:16.870> obviously<00:05:17.200> you<00:05:17.410> can<00:05:17.590> angle

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
its presence and obviously you can angle

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.469 
its presence and obviously you can angle
over<00:05:18.490> it<00:05:18.729> accordingly

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
over it accordingly

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.119 
over it accordingly
hence<00:05:20.200> why<00:05:20.380> I've<00:05:20.530> got<00:05:20.680> my<00:05:20.800> tips

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:21.129 
hence why I've got my tips

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:23.249 
hence why I've got my tips
up<00:05:21.219> so<00:05:21.729> when<00:05:21.849> I'm<00:05:21.939> fishing<00:05:22.089> beyond<00:05:22.479> it<00:05:22.689> my<00:05:23.080> line

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
up so when I'm fishing beyond it my line

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:24.899 
up so when I'm fishing beyond it my line
is<00:05:23.409> less<00:05:23.589> likely<00:05:23.830> to<00:05:23.860> get<00:05:24.069> caught<00:05:24.279> on<00:05:24.520> the<00:05:24.639> top

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:24.909 
is less likely to get caught on the top

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:26.969 
is less likely to get caught on the top
of<00:05:25.059> it<00:05:25.209> down<00:05:25.689> to<00:05:25.929> the<00:05:26.020> right<00:05:26.169> I've<00:05:26.589> got<00:05:26.739> a<00:05:26.770> nice

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:51.219 
all the way across to make it easier for

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:53.009 
all the way across to make it easier for
myself<00:05:51.669> I<00:05:51.909> went<00:05:52.269> all<00:05:52.389> the<00:05:52.419> way<00:05:52.539> around<00:05:52.719> to<00:05:52.959> the

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:53.019 
myself I went all the way around to the

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:56.009 
myself I went all the way around to the
other<00:05:53.080> side<00:05:54.419> basically<00:05:55.419> when<00:05:55.599> you're<00:05:55.749> putting

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:56.019 
other side basically when you're putting

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:58.230 
other side basically when you're putting
your<00:05:56.349> marker<00:05:56.860> float<00:05:57.069> in<00:05:57.279> getting<00:05:57.879> it<00:05:57.939> to<00:05:58.059> rise

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
your marker float in getting it to rise

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.089 
your marker float in getting it to rise
up<00:05:58.539> the<00:05:58.809> marginal<00:05:59.319> shelf<00:05:59.559> as<00:05:59.740> opposed<00:06:00.039> to

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 
up the marginal shelf as opposed to

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:01.320 
up the marginal shelf as opposed to
pulling<00:06:00.279> down<00:06:00.580> it<00:06:00.729> gives<00:06:00.819> a<00:06:00.969> far<00:06:01.209> more

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
pulling down it gives a far more

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.379 
pulling down it gives a far more
accurate<00:06:01.509> indication<00:06:02.139> of<00:06:03.300> basically<00:06:04.300> the

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:04.389 
accurate indication of basically the

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:08.249 
accurate indication of basically the
level<00:06:04.719> of<00:06:04.809> the<00:06:04.869> shelf<00:06:06.059> but<00:06:07.059> what<00:06:07.300> I<00:06:07.330> found<00:06:07.629> at

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:08.259 
level of the shelf but what I found at

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:09.809 
level of the shelf but what I found at

I think with all the commotion but the

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:54.540 
I think with all the commotion but the
bait<00:06:53.529> going<00:06:53.829> in<00:06:53.979> at<00:06:54.069> the<00:06:54.129> start<00:06:54.339> of<00:06:54.490> the

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:54.550 
bait going in at the start of the

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.339 
bait going in at the start of the
session<00:06:54.729> it<00:06:55.269> might<00:06:55.449> make<00:06:55.599> the<00:06:55.749> carp<00:06:55.990> a<00:06:56.139> little

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:56.349 
session it might make the carp a little

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:59.579 
session it might make the carp a little
bit<00:06:56.499> cautious<00:06:57.429> but<00:06:58.089> also<00:06:58.300> curious<00:06:58.809> so<00:06:59.379> what

00:06:59.579 --> 00:06:59.589
