00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 Hi, people in my video today.

 We are going to talk about mine. 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.830
 readings for the month of june 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.400

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.170
 graphic novel and today I will tell you 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.939
 bit to you about how they went 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.949
 these readings in the last month we will 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.460
 start as usual with comics 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.219
 this month I read the amazing amazing 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.440
 lemon demon in the web era committee of this 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.540
 girl who was not steven johnson and 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.120
 you are acknowledging this trait she 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.670
 even ctex illustrator administrations 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.680
 cover his brother raul and it seems there 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.090
 that the world saw that is how it was so 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.620
 wonderful that she needed to be 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.050
 transformed into a book and I finally 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.329
 he and I loved memory tells the story 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.539
 of this character and annie mona that she is 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.280
 a cheetah or she can change from 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.719
 schedule any time and transform the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.219
 she wants she can turn 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.270
 any animal or in any human being 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:06.060
 So I decided to feel the glam site and 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.159
 hard that this other uncle is brunette and she 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.290
 is offered to him type 1 and you are a 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.299
 villain also likes badness let's go 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.100
 work together to everyone at 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.229
 Kingdom I think this is all you 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.240
 need to know if you go deep to know 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.299
 much before reading ends up losing a lot 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.030
 Grace then know that mona is about two 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.280
 villains facing many confusions in the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.200
 that mixes the medieval era with a 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.850
 bit of technology and is a universe 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.310
 very well created and the 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.590
 development of friendship between her and 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.780
 black heart is very interesting you 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.369
 Twists for them all the time even he 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.990
 being the villains of history 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.899
 Remember when I commented about 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.399
 hyper and I said art type was not thing 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.810
 most beautiful in the world but the history of 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.430
 drum that compensated 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.860
 here we have a wonderful story 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.299
 and a wonderful art and a framework that 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.079
 It sure was for me, it 's list of 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.330
 favorites 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.760
 talking about zebu 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.620
 I read here in my body and mind I read 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.680
 The books I already commented on them here 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.900
 on the channel that was the hiv and the site with 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.090
 verses of how the income listeners and my 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.470
 video last Tuesday I said one 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.660
 little on the two and made a comparative 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.979
 made a very crazy reflection and receives 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.540
 many positive comments on that 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.070
 video which was really cool 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.690
 so I will not talk about him much in that 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.460
 video here I'll leave the link to the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.780
 video here on oscar 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.610
 here for you too. 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.230
 Look if you want I can say that 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.210
 They are two very cute books. 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.770
 four stars for the two 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.630
 two have gay characters as 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.460
 protagonist and the development of a 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.010
 romance very very cute then 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.280
 You are in the mood to read novels. 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.830
 cute 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.240
 This is the indication for you speaking in 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.370
 cute romances, let's go to the 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.709
 Cement disappointment that was shop boys 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.630
 love outside the window 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.550
 I returned so much expectation in this book that 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.260
 She was going to get you guys like me. 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.030
 I broke my face in this book that 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.620
 tells the story of a girl who 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.330
 as she overcomes the love of her life 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.130
 She writes a letter to that love. 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.380
 place the envelope and store it in 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.420
 a box until one day she wakes up and 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.800
 all the letters were sent and not 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.870
 You know what to make of her life. 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.300
 very interesting premise was very 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.190
 badly used people I've been waiting for 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.050
 if you read this whole thing of the mystery of 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.550
 who sent the letters how she was going to deal 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.580
 with this crappy thing 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.470
 but the book no no flowers has nothing 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.269
 cards are sent to her. 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.400
 kaka for the cards she continues to live 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.370
 her life in the novels very much 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.019
 it was very difficult to finish 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.850
 this book for you to understand more or 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.769
 less the reading process usually 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.510
 rotten side says I was always marking the 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.580
 page that I am and commenting on 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.200
 respect of my reading until that 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.640
 So, I'll check it out for you. 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.769
 in some comments I made about this 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.269
 book here while violent he page 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:41.360
 84 think of this ilk a little boring 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:45.200
 page 122 childlike protagonist 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.850
 and then page 215 or cookbook 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.040
 however the description of food as 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.460
 this book that you have for the love of God 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.550
 now my favorite part page 200 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.560
 41 help a chapter 46 was 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.080
 entirely over rice cakes that 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.790
 the media on the face and scroll through the dialogues type 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.700
 Did you like the rice cookie? 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.410
 Yes, they're delicious, I can not take it anymore. 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.000
 this dialogue that does not lead anywhere 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.830
 none and so uncertain in the 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.720
 comments on this book is for going out 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.360
 From a lousy book, let's go to a book. 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.070
 great that it was hands and face of the pad in that 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.690
 I already commented briefly on that 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.250
 of this book in one of my official videos 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.530
 for these other days but now let's go 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.880
 Serious about it announced to account 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.860
 the story of a boy that his mother 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.020
 he has cancer and every day he has 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.270
 the same nightmare and wake up scared 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.470
 every day 6 nights until dying of 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.420
 fear of a nightmare that he just 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.280
 Having a book always tells you that you wake up in the 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.170
 worst part but it never tells you that it is 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.150
 this nightmare until one day instead 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.220
 this nightmare who appears black from 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.080
 Night is a monster knocking on the window. 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.540
 it's just above our coast 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.000
 midnight and 7 o'clock from the window and has a 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.310
 monster beating at his window he is 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.280
 a monster all over a monstrous tree 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.200
 type giant blitz and then this monster 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.270
 Do you want something from him and what does he want? 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.070
 have to read find out I did not know anymore 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.530
 This book has already been published in Portuguese 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.750
 he is called the monster if I do not 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.010
 I'm mistaken, he left the attic publisher I 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.470
 I find it very difficult to find 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.630
 Portuguese online I did not find more type 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.370
 there is then that hope 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.230
 But let's talk about this book that is 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.730
 a very complicated game because he is 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.710
 very strong then anything I 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.690
 Talking to you can really ruin the 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.330
 experience of reading this book but the 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.340
 that I can say is that I cried a lot 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.350
 I got so excited I got so close 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.270
 very much the character I was very 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.920
 intrigued the book in the middle this monster 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.960
 tells some fables to him some 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.210
 stories and I love books that have 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.560
 story within history knows and is the 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.110
 kind of book you close the last 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.990
 page and look up and think my 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.700
 God, this book has a lot of 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.800
 purity in this book is a very 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.140
 simple and at the same time is a book that 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.460
 says a lot it 's a book that teaches a lot 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.380
 so I will not talk about that anymore 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.770
 I do not want to ruin anything to anyone. 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.349
 the best recommendation is 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.030
 in law this book is very very good and there 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:54.650
 You ask Victor after a book. 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.110
 Great, how could you talk? 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.849
 about the book even better and I say yes 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.919
 I would succeed because after this book 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:01.580
 I got to read the sun is for everyone 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.099
 default 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.259
 We know the soap opera that was on my 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:07.819
 life for finally in this book of mine 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:09.650
 God, people like me regret not 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:10.819
 have read the book before in my life but 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.650
 I think it has been the 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:13.970
 Right time for this book I'm already going to 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.650
 some things 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.050
 I will not say much about this video 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.819
 because I do not have conditions because 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.470
 I just read it and have a lot of things in it. 

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:23.210
 I need to organize all the 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.009
 my anti ideas and I really want 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.810
 too make a video just for that book 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:28.819
 here to talk about everything I felt 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.889
 While I read this book I do not know if you 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:33.050
 You're understanding, but I think this is the 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:34.970
 best book I've ever read in my entire life. 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.620
 life of all the books I've read in 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.840
 story of my life the sun is for 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.270
 everyone was the best book I read that 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.370
 book dealt with me in a way that I 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.020
 I do not know how to explain to you, lonely people. 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.550
 Can you understand what I'm talking about? 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.500
 his book that was published in the 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.930
 60 but the story that's in here 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.210
 happens in the 30's or so 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:56.030
 in the other United States in the 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.440
 It is an extremely racist country all 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.630
 the United States were racist in that 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.940
 time but the other United States was 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.770
 dumb anyway and the book will tell the 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.509
