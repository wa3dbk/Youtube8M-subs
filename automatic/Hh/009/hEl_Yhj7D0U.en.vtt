00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
steam mops and all kinds of stuff so

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.539 
steam mops and all kinds of stuff so
take<00:01:08.289> advantage<00:01:08.320> of<00:01:08.860> that<00:01:08.979> since<00:01:09.280> if<00:01:09.430> we've

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
take advantage of that since if we've

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.100 
take advantage of that since if we've
got<00:01:09.700> seven<00:01:10.030> more<00:01:10.149> days<00:01:10.210> of<00:01:10.570> this

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
got seven more days of this

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.190 
got seven more days of this
so<00:01:12.980> a<00:01:13.250> couple<00:01:13.460> hours<00:01:13.700> looks<00:01:14.480> like<00:01:14.660> two<00:01:14.840> hours

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
so a couple hours looks like two hours

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.980 
so a couple hours looks like two hours
and<00:01:15.410> on<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:16.010> diesel<00:01:16.370> Jenny<00:01:16.580> and<00:01:16.940> we're<00:01:17.630> bulked

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
and on the diesel Jenny and we're bulked

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.620 
and on the diesel Jenny and we're bulked
I<00:01:18.340> may<00:01:19.340> even<00:01:19.520> get<00:01:19.700> to<00:01:19.850> float<00:01:20.090> by<00:01:20.300> the<00:01:20.360> end<00:01:20.540> of

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
I may even get to float by the end of

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.350 
I may even get to float by the end of
the<00:01:20.750> day<00:01:20.900> so<00:01:21.800> these<00:01:21.950> boxes<00:01:22.490> are<00:01:22.640> tilled<00:01:23.090> and
