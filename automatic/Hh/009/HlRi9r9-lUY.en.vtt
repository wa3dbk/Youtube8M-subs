 think you can't pray five times 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.070
 day because it is so much for me 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.200
 really anyone needs me 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.809
 prayed five times a day i'm committing 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:41.590
 good in this matter contains two things 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:44.890
 two statements two different problems first 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:48.070
 the problem is it is not crushed sweetly mansuryan 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.920
 the first problem is i can't pray 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:57.010
 five times a day I can't do it 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:59.019
 i don't believe you when i hear i can't 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.059
 I don’t believe you why 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.489
 because i believe you can i'm not here 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.680
 say i believe in good i said i believe 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.750
 all chapter there is a difference is true when i 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.909
 I say that I believe in Allah it means that 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.780
 I believe that Alla really exists 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.210
 i believe in him 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.100
 but when i say i believe allah it 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.540
 means that I believe what he said 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.840
 he said the most pure 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.850
 We give caliph logunov solidly in sana olan 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.740
 does not impose on man beyond it 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.780
 Allah does not place on 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.299
 human burden which he could not bear it 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.399
 that said hallo hallo does not impose on 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.320
 one person is unbearable 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.299
 a duty that is something beyond it 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.289
 Opportunities and you say you're not 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.899
 able to live 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.969
 perform duties then he laid on 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.710
 you so you say I can not 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.899
 praying five times a day is too 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.969
 a lot to me she says no you 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.009
 can it's like I have a choice 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.929
 try on you 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.600
 or believe Alan is possible if you 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.950
 you think you're lying say so maybe 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.200
 you are fooling yourself 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.270
 maybe you convince yourself you force yourself 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.009
 believe in it because you do not want 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.520
 pray five times a day no i can't 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.530
 the court 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.780
 I don't know what the problem really is 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.119
 however you may be shy before 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.310
 non-muslim people find 50 minutes on 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.230
 so long smoke cigarettes in the breaks 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.250
 between work they can take a break 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.990
 type find out where 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.550
 from the breaks between working and you don't 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.770
 can you pray five times a day 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.970
 prechist Allah in this part of the world and I 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.800
 I work in newyork 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.050
 I see praying Muslims in any 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.120
 terrain half past five i see guys 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.340
 reading namaz because it's time 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.530
 namaz or at university you open 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.180
 Xerox or library room 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.500
 you can see these handsome men 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.690
 who read namaz 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.940
 much attention everyone prays when it comes 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.070
 time they all go to pray we go 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.690
 right lims only exception if 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:47.380
 current goes cup match and so you can not 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.900
 continue well okay it's the first thing 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.000
 Alla told you that you can if 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.050
 Allah has laid upon you this time it is already 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.150
 fait accompli 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.910
 so you can so convince yourself 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.340
 herself and alla really make this second easier 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.260
 the food question is what really about you 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.270
 Do you need to take care of this? 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.489
 In fact, this is your question and this question 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.290
 Is this really what Alla needs in my 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.750
 small or not you forget that 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.270
 prayer is needed first of all not raid it 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.940
 first of all you need it not for Alan 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.130
 if all the people in the world are all living 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.260
 would pray a raid it would not make it 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.630
 richer it would not increase it 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.700
 kingdom since he and so was adygov see and 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.010
 exist because Allah is in nothing 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.230
 domination needs greatness and glory 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.269
 so belong to him on all sides and he 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.430
 doesn't need us that we need 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.799
 we need him so the question is 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.870
 do you feel the need finger itself 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.940
 do you realize this for the good of your life 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.340
 if it is not so if you feel that 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.030
 you don't need to ask for 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.130
 help 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.230
 turn to raids and obey him 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.620
 orders and this is the real problem with your 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.840
 faith 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.920
 if you have such a question means 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.350
 you are distant for a long time 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.299
 decide there came to you and said must 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.549
 feel bad because not 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:00.310
 pray for it not so let's not pray 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.110
 no prayers this is the other side of this 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.790
 the disease is the first species which 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.130
 can diagnose this ghana are you 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.350
 you feel it all the time and block it 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.570
 a gift of a diamond and if that gift in 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.350
 you disappear you think Allah does not need 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.989
 my prayer 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.810
 so good while i do blessing game and this 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:19.450
 The last part I want to talk about 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.880
 as long as I do good these kinds 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.130
 good deeds there are two kinds of good in 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.140
 you must remember well two kinds 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.120
 good in this world good manifested in 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.520
 ethical acts I am good to 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.980

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.530

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.990
 basic thing basic ethical actions i 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.540

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.000

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.870

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.310
 We had a great post and this is already good 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.140
 good deeds in religion good deeds in religion and 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.030
 good ethics matters according to 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.740
 human nature among muslims and 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.840
 non-muslims have long been like 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.150
 division and more often the differences between 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.280
 these two spheres of good deeds spend 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.770
 Muslims and we distinguish between 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.720
 these two things will give mans world you 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.580
 can you find people who are moral 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.770
 good they are kind to their families 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.570
 they care will note they are responsible in 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.490
 housework amazing neighbors 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.660
 honest at work good people only 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.580
 what beads lady 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.650
 i don't need religion to be 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.230
 good that's what they say and the other 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.110
 through people who pray do hajj 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.960
 give sunset wine childbirth wear clothes 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.120
 religious person and at the same time they 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.150
 tyrannize their family cheating colleagues 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.400
 business what they do those who comply 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.320
 moral principles and so what happens 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.300
 when we separate these two types of good 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.270
 moral provide with personal good 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.290
 decent behavior and religious 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:51.130
 the rules of the quran 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:53.980
 they have such an ayah, and here I take water 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.840
 righteousness good decency that you 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.060
 be righteous and good if you 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.890
 Well, you read it, but I see the combination 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.170
 two things is the union of moral 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.500
 principles when you keep your promise 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:07.480
 when you are patient and ben can be trusted and 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.230
 religious rules you read namaz not 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:13.090
 give for to 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:15.040
 so is the union of these two things if 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.110
 you think that you are in that position where you are 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.690
 found righteousness and either where 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.880
 ethical integrity or forget 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.340
 ball legio knowing the integrity of the new 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.260
 told us here and should combine in 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.420
 yourself these two things then you become that 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.020
 a man who is really good 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.300
 you yourself decided 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.910
 where is good for you but threw it away 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.650
 prescription of allah and we turn to low 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.080
 for leadership because we can't 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:42.520
 find it yourself and we ask allah to give 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.520
 him on insha alla water
