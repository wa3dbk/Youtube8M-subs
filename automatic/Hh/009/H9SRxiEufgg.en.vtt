00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.200
 here where is where the zombies will come 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.430

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.769
 little crazy zombies come 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.660
 because only the task is multiplied 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:50.310
 by 4 g by four if we are alone 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:50.310
 where you come now 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:59.469

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:49.569
 for us we are but well we 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:52.119

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:55.419
 to die alone I want to die that I do not 

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:58.269

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:01.089
