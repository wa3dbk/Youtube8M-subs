00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
 good I called me attention to 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.370
 talk about protected cultivation because 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.540
 we know that they are covered 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.590
 extremely complicated produces 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.280
 tomato and besides that a good one I am 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.950
 of those that I am looking for a crop 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.380
 that is generating because I 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.050
 normally planted lettuce the question 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.550
 of the lettuce is short each lettuce and 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.050
 is arrived at the lesson has cultivated 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:29.829
 just the corn beans coffee crowd 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.689
 true but right now with so much situation 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.040
 of pests and diseases gets 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.370
 diversified 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.750
 then I give you this already when it came 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.510
 with the guys the technicians and I 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.210
 they said the route proposal came out 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.420
 I say I 'm going too I 'm not left without 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.610
 Internet 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.950
 Well, that way 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.370
 we start if the times change when 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.370
 we started 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.550
 we thought we would not have done the 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.640
 campus and told me jaime you 've already 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.640
 raised 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.410
 I came when they were doing the 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.880
 campus was working on the 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.560
 tractor yes and it was exaggerated as a day 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.860
 the other part of the story that I do not 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.860
 like when 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.990
 the stones that came out in each hole in 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.700
 these holes have a meter of ono 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.100
 and the rule is that they go one meter and 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.040
 point because they can not go better anymore 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.830
 deep 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.360
 then more worried enough the 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.850
 boys were surrounding that these 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.500
 groups get better 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.500
 and another day I swear 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.960
 roy Ã¡lvaro to build 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:49.250
 that his part 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:51.520
 530 square meters 530 and tell me in 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:57.390
 length by width 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.390
 11 meters point and something for 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:05.540
 11 by 50 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.540
 and we have plants here 1,380 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.190
 this is very loaded 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.100
 look at the truth that I did not even imagine that 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.990
 you were 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.360
 that is for me it is exciting and here 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:24.569
 they are every day 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.359
 July 13 that day we sow 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.590
 appears what this one told me 4 for 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.450
 produce 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.569
 we are targeting about 30,000 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.790
 pounds 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.790
 preferably more are we talking 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.120
 for the 1.380 is for nothing 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.450
 I have a period of about four or five 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.450
 months 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.590
 and today we are going to a cortecito has been 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.060
 cleaning 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.360
 and it is assumed that from now on 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.810
 We will be harvesting on Mondays and 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:03.010
 every Monday and every Thursday 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.520
 we talk about two per week favorite 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.560
 obviously we will not take them out because 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.560
 it's just the extreme region 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.680
 that ladder you go 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.150
 that ladder I keep there, the one that 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.320
 it served for all the construction and they are 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.760
 memories is not that it also serves me 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.230
 anything that breaks down here 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.720
 Accidents are the order of the day 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.700
 true if a plastic slackened 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.530
 anything died changed and complaint 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.870
 boyfriend is inside and is inside because 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.260
 is wetting us and you knew how 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.980
 produce tomatoes thus rolled in this 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.500
 way that I think is very special 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.260
 I had done this before the first time 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.049
 that does it like about ten years yes yes 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.739
 tomato to open field did not have a friend 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.780
 that was good for this but already after 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.660
 the lawyer already when he takes a place 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.849
 in a school he was already retiring and said 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.459
 I just do not do it anymore I retired from this 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.410
 question and then after seeing that louis 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.190
 the technician here has a greenhouse 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.160
 this 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.140
 and you know and I loved the idea because 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.840
 here we are not dealing with pests with 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:14.140
 diseases or nothing clear only that 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.320
 I always and diseases like one 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.620
 bring them but you the applications 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:24.280
 for flat or for new pests not for 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:27.090
 diseases if it says two applications of 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.090
 a product that 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.630
 yes we can see 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.520
 the thermometer still but 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.520
 the temperature now allows 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.999
 it's so high 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.180
 this favorite thermometer are not me 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:47.889
 marking relative humidity 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.970
 means that the relative humidity of 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:54.240
 above 90 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.800
 then and here 19.5 degrees means 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.380
 that the plant is just beginning to 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.380
 breakfast yes because the optimal range for 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.060
 that the plant is eating is between 25 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.750
 and 30 degrees of temperature 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.280
 and about 65 to 75 relative humidity 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.980
 then when the staff have the 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.009
 conditions has the optimal climate and already 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:17.270
 she survives perfectly with 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:17.270
 and in case we go up 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.849
 look at the truth truth is that you climb a lot 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:27.819
 the temperature will not happen very difficult and 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:30.039
 it's a pretty climate it 's pretty cool 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:32.380
 and somewhere else is what 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:34.330
 they usually do is to put 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.610
 coolers says I do not really know I 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.460
 but the truth is that the calculations agree 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.410
 and here there are no needs or rather if 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.050
 what we do have maybe curtain on hand 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.870
 from outside to regulate the temperature and 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.880
 now type 3 in the afternoon under those 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.610
 curtains so that the temperature better 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.380
 and people want to be otherwise 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.790
 so that you do not lower the temperature of 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.320
 grace 2 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.870
 the whitefly is one of the 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:04.490
 diseases makes common in tomato that 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:07.690
 does not have here but more now more than the 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.690
 whitefly paratrioza 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:15.120
 if the para trias is a pretty little bug 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.560
 harmful truth but here not for this 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.890
 mesh that this mesh has a 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:23.100
 perfect hair removal and does not allow 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:25.880
 no insect passes or is here damage by 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.880
 plagues and diseases 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.240
 and this is his first first crop 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.690
 first time and here we start to build 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.229
 in March in more first days of 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:39.419
 slaughterhouse 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:39.419
 and when the constructions end 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:48.570
 no then yes and then if here what more 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.180
 time it took us was the disinfection of 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:53.640
 this soil that is in these bags like this 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:58.280
 as they are born this is a substrate that the 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.280
 prepared sand signature action 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.210
 and we put this in a bigger drawer 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.819
 and authorizes it 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:14.819
 when it reaches 85 90 degrees 

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:17.819
 temperature is already spreading and there what 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:20.130
 we take out carefully what we bring to each 

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:21.960
 bag to make sure in the 

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.100
 interwomen we can say your 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.420
 perspective 

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.420
 because plants 

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:36.030
 it's a work of a job of 18 days 

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:38.630
 with four people between being 

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.630
 preparing 

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:44.200
 substrate mixing ripping earth 

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:48.130
 it has already pocketed me almost already we said in 

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.130
 load the plants and then 

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.810
 well we would have been 

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.730
 to plant a larger variety and 

00:07:54.810 --> 00:08:01.480
 bigger but the market there 

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:03.970
 Now that we handle is this size 

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.860
 well of 32 tomatoes per pound 

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:08.940
 and still it grew more than normal because 

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.940
 this two spanish 

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:17.480
 and there is a little bit bigger 

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.480
 we can see the other end too
