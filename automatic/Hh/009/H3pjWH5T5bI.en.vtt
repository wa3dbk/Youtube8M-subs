say a bad game is a bad game regardless
of<00:00:26.160> circumstance<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:27.029> say<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:28.019> depends<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:28.740> the

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
of circumstance I say it depends on the

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.070 
of circumstance I say it depends on the
circumstance<00:00:29.460> because<00:00:29.820> sometimes<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.630> game's

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
circumstance because sometimes a game's

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.680 
circumstance because sometimes a game's
faults<00:00:31.679> aren't<00:00:32.160> actually<00:00:32.669> false<00:00:33.180> they're

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
faults aren't actually false they're

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.209 
faults aren't actually false they're
just<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.050> products<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.680> certain<00:00:34.980> time

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
just the products of a certain time

just the products of a certain time
whether<00:00:35.760> it's<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.030> design<00:00:36.450> trend<00:00:36.899> or<00:00:37.170> a

whether it's a design trend or a

case<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.170> point<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.890> 2013<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:42.450> game<00:00:42.719> kind<00:00:42.960> of

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
case in point in 2013 this game kind of

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:58.229 
case in point in 2013 this game kind of
sucks<00:00:43.320> but<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:43.860> 2001<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.910> kind<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.930> didn't

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.630 

Roger<00:00:59.239> so<00:01:00.109> there<00:01:00.589> are<00:01:00.710> two<00:01:00.890> important<00:01:01.609> things

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
Roger so there are two important things

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.529 
Roger so there are two important things
to<00:01:02.030> note

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
to note

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.410 
to note
broadly<00:01:03.199> speaking<00:01:03.409> about<00:01:04.250> extermination<00:01:05.149> for

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
broadly speaking about extermination for

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.050 
broadly speaking about extermination for
starters<00:01:05.810> it's<00:01:06.080> a<00:01:06.470> very<00:01:06.799> early<00:01:06.890> ps2<00:01:07.729> release

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
starters it's a very early ps2 release

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.270 
starters it's a very early ps2 release
which<00:01:08.479> means<00:01:08.750> we<00:01:09.380> were<00:01:09.530> years<00:01:09.920> away<00:01:10.250> from

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
which means we were years away from

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.520 
which means we were years away from
people<00:01:10.850> figuring<00:01:11.570> out<00:01:11.689> the<00:01:11.810> capabilities<00:01:12.020> of

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
people figuring out the capabilities of

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.499 
people figuring out the capabilities of
the<00:01:12.740> system<00:01:13.130> with<00:01:13.369> a<00:01:13.460> game<00:01:13.610> like<00:01:13.789> Resident

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
the system with a game like Resident

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.620 
the system with a game like Resident
Evil<00:01:14.780> 4<00:01:15.100> secondly<00:01:16.100> it's<00:01:16.640> a<00:01:16.789> survival<00:01:17.360> horror

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
Evil 4 secondly it's a survival horror

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.639 
Evil 4 secondly it's a survival horror
game<00:01:18.020> from<00:01:18.909> 2001<00:01:19.909> which<00:01:20.539> means<00:01:20.780> we<00:01:21.170> were<00:01:21.289> years

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
game from 2001 which means we were years

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.139 
game from 2001 which means we were years
away<00:01:21.860> from<00:01:21.950> the<00:01:22.159> genres<00:01:22.610> much-needed

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
away from the genres much-needed

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.990 
away from the genres much-needed
reinvention<00:01:24.080> with<00:01:24.619> Resident<00:01:25.130> Evil<00:01:25.460> 4<00:01:25.759> the

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
reinvention with Resident Evil 4 the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.840 
reinvention with Resident Evil 4 the
point<00:01:26.270> is<00:01:26.710> extermination<00:01:27.710> feels<00:01:28.220> kind<00:01:28.520> of<00:01:28.610> old

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
point is extermination feels kind of old

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.760 
point is extermination feels kind of old
and<00:01:29.119> looks<00:01:29.929> kind<00:01:30.170> of<00:01:30.229> ugly

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
and looks kind of ugly

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.290 
and looks kind of ugly
for<00:01:31.100> reasons<00:01:31.399> that<00:01:31.520> are<00:01:31.640> completely

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
for reasons that are completely

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.630 
for reasons that are completely
understandable<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.350> not<00:01:33.679> necessarily<00:01:34.310> the

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
understandable and not necessarily the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.609 
understandable and not necessarily the
result<00:01:34.970> of<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.149> game's<00:01:35.390> own<00:01:35.600> flaws<00:01:35.960> then

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
result of the game's own flaws then

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.130 
result of the game's own flaws then
again<00:01:36.920> extermination<00:01:37.700> is<00:01:37.909> plenty<00:01:38.720> fucking

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
again extermination is plenty fucking

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.630 
again extermination is plenty fucking
flawed

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.400 

you<00:01:42.640> play<00:01:42.880> as<00:01:43.120> a<00:01:43.150> Marine<00:01:43.750> sent<00:01:44.170> to<00:01:44.290> investigate

you play as a Marine sent to investigate

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.890 
you play as a Marine sent to investigate

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
extermination plays out like a

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.390 
extermination plays out like a
third-person<00:01:58.960> shooter<00:01:59.619> built<00:02:00.100> on<00:02:00.250> the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
mechanics of late 90s survival horror so

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.390 
mechanics of late 90s survival horror so
tanky<00:02:04.360> controls<00:02:04.990> stop<00:02:05.650> the<00:02:05.890> shoot

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
tanky controls stop the shoot

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.109 
tanky controls stop the shoot
backtracking<00:02:07.500> yeah<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:09.039> again<00:02:09.550> that's<00:02:09.940> the

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
backtracking yeah and again that's the

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.120 
backtracking yeah and again that's the
circumstance<00:02:10.539> right<00:02:11.110> I<00:02:11.140> mean<00:02:11.410> this<00:02:11.770> was

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
circumstance right I mean this was

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.640 
circumstance right I mean this was
survival<00:02:12.760> horror<00:02:13.000> these<00:02:13.420> mechanics<00:02:13.989> define

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
survival horror these mechanics define

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.080 
survival horror these mechanics define
the<00:02:14.860> genre<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.580> considering<00:02:16.060> that

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
the genre and considering that

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.150 
the genre and considering that
extermination<00:02:17.020> was<00:02:17.050> developed<00:02:17.590> by<00:02:17.770> some<00:02:18.070> of

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
extermination was developed by some of

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.280 
extermination was developed by some of
the<00:02:18.220> original<00:02:18.700> creators<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.180> Resident<00:02:19.720> Evil<00:02:20.080> I

the original creators of Resident Evil I

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.199 
the original creators of Resident Evil I
I<00:02:20.650> mean<00:02:21.130> there<00:02:21.280> was<00:02:21.370> no<00:02:21.610> way<00:02:21.640> this<00:02:21.940> game

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
I mean there was no way this game

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.180 
I mean there was no way this game
wouldn't<00:02:22.570> play<00:02:22.810> this<00:02:22.840> way<00:02:23.230> old<00:02:23.560> fans<00:02:24.010> will

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
wouldn't play this way old fans will

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.729
