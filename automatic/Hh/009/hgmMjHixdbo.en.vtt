00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.010
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.480
 video of I do in this case we're going to 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.480
 make a trapillo necklace 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.900
 these are the materials 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:29.430
 We will cut 6 strips of 1 meter 60 more or 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.710
 less and we will double them in 4 times 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.410
 to start we're going to take two of the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.880
 strips we are going to join them and we are going to 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.300
 double in four times and we're going to 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.290
 put in the fork shape as you see and 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.290
 we cross 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.630
 now we take another two strips of 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.630
 trapillo 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.020
 and we're going to place them under the 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.020
 first strip 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.620
 we cross again cross 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.720
 and now we go below 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:19.170
 you see now little by little we start to throw 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.170
 do not do it slowly 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.359
 so that the knot fits very well 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.650
 once we have done the knot well 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.920
 We are going to separate the trapillo strips in 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.900
 3 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.900
 to be able to make a braid 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.950
 now we think 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.950
 you can tighten the braid so that 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.720
 you're pretty finite or leave it more 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.610
 Chubby from the beginning and go squeezing 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.200
 To the end 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.200
 how do you like it 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.369
 once 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.369
 we do the other side 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.930
 now let's do the termination with 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:31.000
 a small trapillo strip we help 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.000
 around to tie all the strips 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.500
 a strong knot 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.120
 on this side we do the same 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.350
 now we have plenty of fringes 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:04.030
 then we are going to cut a pair of scissors 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.030
 all the fringes that we have left 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.120
 i 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.239
 we have done on both sides and now with 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:24.370
 We opened a strip of cloth and with a 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.010
 little bit of hot silicone or glue 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.569
 for fabric we are going to stick the end for 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.569
 leave a deep finish 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.140
 and we rolled up very hard pulling a lot 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.960
 of the fabric and we close 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.180
 it is important to leave the little girl we have 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.410
 made with the trapillo to be able to later 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.470
 knot our cord 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.470
 and 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.860
 of the cloth 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.980
 we close 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.980
 and 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.920
 now we just have to put a cord in 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.400
 the ends and we can knot 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.400
 our neck 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.419
 our necklace is already 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.940
 we liked it, I hope so and if so 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.690

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.520
