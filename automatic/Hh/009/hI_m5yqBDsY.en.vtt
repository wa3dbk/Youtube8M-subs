00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
the way that it works is one side is the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.080 
the way that it works is one side is the
defending<00:00:56.039> team<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.460> they<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.820> defend

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
defending team and they have to defend

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.660 
defending team and they have to defend
to<00:00:57.500> escape<00:00:58.500> points<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.100> then<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.219> other<00:00:59.430> team

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
to escape points and then the other team

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.760 
to escape points and then the other team
has<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> VIP<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.960> they<00:01:01.170> have<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.410> get<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> VIP

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
has a VIP and they have to get the VIP

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.009 
has a VIP and they have to get the VIP
to<00:01:02.280> one<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.670> two<00:01:02.820> escape<00:01:03.120> points<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.629> once

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
to one of the two escape points and once

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.289 
to one of the two escape points and once
you<00:01:04.110> get<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.500> escape<00:01:04.650> point<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.610> VIP<00:01:05.909> it

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
you get to the escape point the VIP it

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.910 
you get to the escape point the VIP it
only<00:01:06.420> takes<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:07.020> think<00:01:07.049> like<00:01:07.380> three<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.890> five

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
only takes I think like three to five

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.679 
only takes I think like three to five
seconds<00:01:08.520> something<00:01:08.700> like<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.090> it's<00:01:09.420> pretty

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
seconds something like that it's pretty

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.539 
seconds something like that it's pretty
fast<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.229> then<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.740> escape<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.400> win

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
fast and then you escape and you win

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.219 
fast and then you escape and you win
that<00:01:11.580> round<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.570> best<00:01:12.750> out<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.110> nine

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
that round and it's best out of nine

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.899 
that round and it's best out of nine
rounds<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.920> first<00:01:14.100> person<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.460> win<00:01:14.670> five

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
rounds so the first person to win five

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.240 
rounds so the first person to win five
rounds<00:01:15.420> from<00:01:16.020> either<00:01:16.140> team<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.920> person

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
rounds from either team is the person

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.120 
rounds from either team is the person
who<00:01:17.520> wins<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.689> side<00:01:18.900> swap<00:01:19.350> after<00:01:19.890> every

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
who wins and the side swap after every

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.590 
who wins and the side swap after every
four<00:01:20.369> rounds<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.180> nothing<00:01:21.479> too

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
four rounds so it's nothing too

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.719 
four rounds so it's nothing too
complicated<00:01:21.960> by<00:01:22.380> any<00:01:22.560> means<00:01:22.770> now<00:01:23.250> how<00:01:23.490> well

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
complicated by any means now how well

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.700 
complicated by any means now how well
does<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.090> game-mode<00:01:24.360> actually<00:01:24.869> work<00:01:25.110> well

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
does this game-mode actually work well

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.830 
does this game-mode actually work well
it<00:01:25.979> seems<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.369> work<00:01:26.520> fairly<00:01:26.820> well<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.180> have<00:01:27.600> had

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
it seems to work fairly well I have had

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.569 
it seems to work fairly well I have had
a<00:01:27.869> couple<00:01:28.200> rounds<00:01:28.320> where<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.040> other<00:01:29.159> team<00:01:29.400> is

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
a couple rounds where the other team is

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.609 
a couple rounds where the other team is
just<00:01:29.759> camping<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.960> really<00:01:31.290> have<00:01:31.409> no

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
just camping and we really have no

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.440 
just camping and we really have no
chance<00:01:31.860> especially<00:01:32.280> for<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.759> VIP<00:01:33.090> to

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
chance especially for the VIP to

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.090 
chance especially for the VIP to
actually<00:01:33.780> go<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.259> escape<00:01:34.500> points<00:01:34.829> because

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
actually go to the escape points because

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.039 
actually go to the escape points because
there's<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:36.090> two<00:01:36.270> or<00:01:36.299> three<00:01:36.570> guys<00:01:36.659> on<00:01:36.930> each

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
there's like two or three guys on each

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.649 
there's like two or three guys on each
of<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> drop-off<00:01:37.710> points<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:39.000> really<00:01:39.360> can

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
of the drop-off points and it really can

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.929 
of the drop-off points and it really can
make<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.900> game<00:01:40.079> not<00:01:40.470> fun<00:01:40.770> at<00:01:40.920> all<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.220> play<00:01:41.430> but

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
make the game not fun at all to play but

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.639 
make the game not fun at all to play but
in<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.180> situations<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.110> seems<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.380> be<00:01:43.530> the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
in the situations and seems to be the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.080 
in the situations and seems to be the
majority<00:01:43.770> at<00:01:44.310> least<00:01:44.460> for<00:01:44.579> my<00:01:44.700> gameplay

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
majority at least for my gameplay

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.120 
majority at least for my gameplay
experience<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.320> lot<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.680> people<00:01:46.920> have

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
experience is that a lot of people have

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.920 
experience is that a lot of people have
been<00:01:47.310> rushing<00:01:47.700> from<00:01:47.880> both<00:01:48.180> teams<00:01:48.420> which

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
been rushing from both teams which

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.330 
been rushing from both teams which
certainly<00:01:49.229> makes<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.560> game<00:01:49.740> whole<00:01:49.950> lot<00:01:50.100> more

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
certainly makes the game whole lot more

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.340 
certainly makes the game whole lot more
enjoyable<00:01:50.610> as<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.060> whole<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.899> seemed<00:01:52.140> like<00:01:52.320> a

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
enjoyable as a whole it seemed like a

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.960 
enjoyable as a whole it seemed like a
lot<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.740> times<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.189> was<00:01:53.220> joining<00:01:53.640> lobbies

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
lot of the times I was joining lobbies

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.569 
lot of the times I was joining lobbies
that<00:01:54.149> only<00:01:54.299> had<00:01:54.600> like<00:01:55.200> four<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.799> five<00:01:55.829> maybe

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
that only had like four to five maybe

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.700 
that only had like four to five maybe
sometimes<00:01:57.030> six<00:01:57.329> people<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.810> them<00:01:57.990> then<00:01:58.469> again

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
sometimes six people in them then again

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.289 
sometimes six people in them then again

as you're seeing in this gameplay I had

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.690 
as you're seeing in this gameplay I had
some<00:02:29.500> pretty<00:02:29.590> nice<00:02:29.800> moments<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.400> lot<00:02:30.550> of<00:02:30.640> the
