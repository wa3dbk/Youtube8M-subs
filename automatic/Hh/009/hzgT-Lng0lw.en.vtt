very seriously the honest answer is that
when<00:00:55.770> you're<00:00:55.920> building<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.399> game<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:57.120> don't

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
when you're building a game you don't

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.360 
when you're building a game you don't
have<00:00:57.570> infinite<00:00:58.050> resources<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.980> don't<00:00:59.219> have

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
importantly sometimes something's got to

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.200
