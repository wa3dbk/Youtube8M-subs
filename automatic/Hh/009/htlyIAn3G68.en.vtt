00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.900 
jiggling animated cysts yeah yeah I
don't<00:00:55.710> want<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.920> say<00:00:56.010> anything<00:00:56.370> more<00:00:56.550> wise

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
don't want to say anything more wise

lunch

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.120 

there<00:01:04.850> are<00:01:05.030> so<00:01:05.360> many<00:01:05.810> design<00:01:06.290> or<00:01:06.619> balance

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
there are so many design or balance

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.370 
there are so many design or balance
changes<00:01:07.280> going<00:01:07.759> in<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:08.210> game<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:09.170> biggest

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
changes going in the game the biggest

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.570 
changes going in the game the biggest
thing<00:01:09.500> probably<00:01:09.799> is<00:01:09.979> smoothing<00:01:10.280> out<00:01:10.430> the

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
thing probably is smoothing out the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.280 
thing probably is smoothing out the
marine<00:01:10.790> tech<00:01:11.060> tree<00:01:11.360> there<00:01:11.960> were<00:01:12.049> a<00:01:12.080> lot<00:01:12.259> of

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
marine tech tree there were a lot of

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.670 
marine tech tree there were a lot of
upgrades<00:01:13.009> and<00:01:13.549> structures<00:01:14.509> and<00:01:14.930> technologies

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
upgrades and structures and technologies

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.950 
upgrades and structures and technologies
that<00:01:15.860> were<00:01:15.979> really<00:01:16.189> expensive<00:01:16.430> never<00:01:17.299> I<00:01:17.570> think

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
that were really expensive never I think

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.440 
that were really expensive never I think
they're<00:01:18.080> too<00:01:18.289> expensive<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:19.880> I<00:01:19.909> kind<00:01:20.299> of

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
they're too expensive and so I kind of

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.270 
they're too expensive and so I kind of
led<00:01:20.600> to<00:01:20.630> some<00:01:20.899> false<00:01:21.080> choices<00:01:21.350> on<00:01:21.830> the<00:01:22.100> brain

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
led to some false choices on the brain

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.020 
led to some false choices on the brain
side<00:01:22.520> so<00:01:23.210> while<00:01:23.630> that<00:01:23.659> stuff<00:01:23.990> has<00:01:24.110> been

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
side so while that stuff has been

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.630 
side so while that stuff has been
smoothed<00:01:26.030> out<00:01:26.320> noticeably<00:01:27.320> prototype<00:01:28.280> lab<00:01:28.460> is

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
smoothed out noticeably prototype lab is

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.370 
smoothed out noticeably prototype lab is
cheaper<00:01:29.000> jet<00:01:29.270> packs<00:01:29.479> are<00:01:29.630> cheaper<00:01:29.960> a<00:01:30.140> lot<00:01:30.320> of

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
cheaper jet packs are cheaper a lot of

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.020 
cheaper jet packs are cheaper a lot of
that<00:01:30.500> stuff's<00:01:30.740> been<00:01:30.890> kind<00:01:31.369> of<00:01:31.399> democratized

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
that stuff's been kind of democratized

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.990 
that stuff's been kind of democratized
to<00:01:33.369> come<00:01:34.369> out<00:01:34.460> a<00:01:34.490> little<00:01:34.610> bit<00:01:34.789> earlier<00:01:34.909> and

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
to come out a little bit earlier and

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.760 
to come out a little bit earlier and
unlocking<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.090> life<00:01:38.210> forms<00:01:38.509> so<00:01:39.350> you<00:01:39.409> don't

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
unlocking the life forms so you don't

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.469 
unlocking the life forms so you don't
need<00:01:39.950> two<00:01:40.310> hives<00:01:40.490> for<00:01:40.759> fade<00:01:40.970> you<00:01:41.149> don't<00:01:41.330> need

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
need two hives for fade you don't need
