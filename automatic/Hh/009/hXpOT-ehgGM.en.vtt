00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
I'm going to try it with acoustic using

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.590 
I'm going to try it with acoustic using
the<00:01:57.900> mic<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.470> then<00:01:58.979> with<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.970> vibration

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
the mic and then with the the vibration

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.670 
the mic and then with the the vibration
and<00:02:00.810> then<00:02:00.960> I'll<00:02:01.050> do<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.200> same<00:02:01.290> with<00:02:01.470> an

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
and then I'll do the same with an

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.240 
and then I'll do the same with an
electric<00:02:02.240> let's<00:02:03.240> get<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.660> cue<00:02:03.840> stick<00:02:04.140> here

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:20.760 

I'll<00:02:08.250> go<00:02:08.429> with<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:11.510> Regal<00:02:12.510> dobro

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770

that's<00:02:39.510> too<00:02:39.690> exciting<00:02:40.110> if<00:02:40.170> Victor<00:02:40.470> is<00:02:40.590> already

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
that's too exciting if Victor is already

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.450 
that's too exciting if Victor is already
in<00:02:40.950> tune
