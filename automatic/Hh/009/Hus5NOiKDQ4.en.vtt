00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
can try to get a hayate but more often

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.450 
can try to get a hayate but more often
than<00:00:42.690> not<00:00:42.840> like<00:00:43.170> you're<00:00:43.649> going<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.829> get<00:00:43.980> you

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
than not like you're going to get you

know<00:00:44.719> that's<00:00:45.719> book<00:00:45.840> llegue<00:00:46.140> because<00:00:46.559> you're

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
know that's book llegue because you're

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.709 
know that's book llegue because you're
pressing<00:00:46.980> forth<00:00:47.399> like<00:00:47.850> punch<00:00:48.090> first<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.600> then

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
pressing forth like punch first and then

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.720 
pressing forth like punch first and then
you're<00:00:48.840> convoying<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.469> into<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:50.039> light<00:00:50.460> I

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
you're convoying that into a light I

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.439 
you're convoying that into a light I
often<00:00:51.530> so<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.710> wasn't<00:00:53.010> really<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.879> useful

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
often so it wasn't really that useful

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.450 
often so it wasn't really that useful
however<00:00:55.289> she<00:00:55.379> did<00:00:55.680> have<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.920> three<00:00:56.219> frame

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
however she did have a three frame

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.459 
however she did have a three frame
interrupt<00:00:56.850> which<00:00:57.120> meant<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.510> after<00:00:58.170> this

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
interrupt which meant that after this

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.830 
interrupt which meant that after this
kind<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.800> situation<00:00:58.980> hayat<00:00:59.940> aur<00:01:00.359> plus<00:01:00.570> one

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
kind of a situation hayat aur plus one

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.889 
kind of a situation hayat aur plus one
so<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.430> frame<00:01:02.760> Trapt<00:01:03.090> with<00:01:03.420> four<00:01:03.719> light

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
so you can frame Trapt with four light

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.719 
so you can frame Trapt with four light
punch<00:01:04.140> into<00:01:04.379> stand<00:01:04.680> light<00:01:04.830> punch<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.369> then

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
punch into stand light punch and then

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.149 
punch into stand light punch and then
combo<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> stain<00:01:06.720> medium<00:01:06.990> punch<00:01:07.200> into<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:08.040> know

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
a situation that leaves the opponent

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.480 
a situation that leaves the opponent
negative<00:01:25.770> three<00:01:26.009> such<00:01:26.549> as<00:01:26.869> dick<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.990> phrase

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
negative three such as dick a phrase

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.060 
negative three such as dick a phrase
daggers<00:01:29.490> let<00:01:30.479> me<00:01:30.540> see<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:31.259> was<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.409> lot<00:01:32.009> of

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
daggers let me see it was a lot of

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.440 
daggers let me see it was a lot of
different<00:01:32.189> situations<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> game<00:01:33.210> that

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
different situations in the game that

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.819 
different situations in the game that
will<00:01:33.540> leave<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.900> opponent<00:01:34.290> negative<00:01:34.650> three

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
will leave the opponent negative three

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.230 
will leave the opponent negative three
so<00:01:35.040> she<00:01:35.100> has<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.310> ability<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.700> punish<00:01:36.060> this

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
so she has the ability to punish this

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.770 
so she has the ability to punish this
real<00:01:36.810> given<00:01:37.140> hard<00:01:37.439> now

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
real given hard now

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.660 
real given hard now
and<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.170> other<00:01:40.350> significance<00:01:40.980> of<00:01:41.160> this<00:01:41.430> move

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
and the other significance of this move

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.080 
and the other significance of this move
is<00:01:41.900> again<00:01:42.900> a<00:01:42.930> combos<00:01:43.440> out<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.650> itself<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.430> combo

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
is again a combos out of itself it combo

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.400 
is again a combos out of itself it combo
example<00:01:45.510> i<00:01:45.570> mean<00:01:45.720> obvious<00:01:45.990> I'm<00:01:46.110> not<00:01:46.260> hitting

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.130 
but I there's a couple moves that you
can<00:01:50.100> only<00:01:50.280> combo<00:01:50.910> into<00:01:51.120> for<00:01:51.450> light<00:01:51.630> punch<00:01:51.900> and

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
can only combo into for light punch and

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.950 
can only combo into for light punch and
I<00:01:53.070> honestly<00:01:53.970> think<00:01:54.120> it's<00:01:54.240> kind<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.600> little

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
I honestly think it's kind of a little

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.680 
I honestly think it's kind of a little
beyond<00:01:55.200> my<00:01:55.440> skill<00:01:55.710> set<00:01:55.740> but<00:01:56.210> it<00:01:57.210> there<00:01:57.510> has

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
beyond my skill set but it there has

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.270 
beyond my skill set but it there has
been<00:01:57.900> times<00:01:58.140> where<00:01:58.440> I've<00:01:58.619> done<00:01:58.800> like<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.979> setup

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
been times where I've done like a setup

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.830 
been times where I've done like a setup
like<00:01:59.400> a<00:01:59.610> you<00:02:00.390> know<00:02:02.330> do<00:02:03.330> that<00:02:03.510> and<00:02:03.690> then<00:02:03.780> you

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
like a you know do that and then you

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.859 
like a you know do that and then you
jump<00:02:04.050> up<00:02:04.140> with<00:02:04.290> wisely<00:02:04.470> do<00:02:04.860> crouch<00:02:05.550> tech<00:02:05.869> so

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
jump up with wisely do crouch tech so

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.320 
jump up with wisely do crouch tech so
what<00:02:07.380> this<00:02:07.590> does<00:02:07.650> is<00:02:09.200> in<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.440> situation<00:02:11.330> you

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
what this does is in this situation you

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.470 
what this does is in this situation you
can<00:02:12.540> potentially<00:02:13.110> land<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:13.590> into<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.730> if

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
can potentially land this into that if

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.360 
can potentially land this into that if
they<00:02:15.870> get<00:02:16.020> hit<00:02:16.170> by<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.739> you<00:02:17.100> can<00:02:17.250> hit

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
they get hit by it and you can hit

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.640 
they get hit by it and you can hit
confirm<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.850> too<00:02:18.030> which<00:02:18.600> is<00:02:18.630> really<00:02:18.840> like<00:02:19.440> the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
confirm it too which is really like the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.820 
confirm it too which is really like the
big<00:02:19.800> part<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.070> it<00:02:20.190> like<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.550> can<00:02:20.760> wake<00:02:21.330> up<00:02:21.360> low

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
big part of it like you can wake up low

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.130 
big part of it like you can wake up low
and<00:02:22.830> try<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:23.610> combo<00:02:23.940> into<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.330> for<00:02:24.510> like<00:02:24.690> punch
