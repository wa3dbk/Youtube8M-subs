00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.370
 quickie is right and I think that's it 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.750
 so come on 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.250
 here on the computer what are you going to 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.320
 you will need to activate the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.360
 sharing folders that all 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.070

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.179
 but how I want my whole computer 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.179
 then make direct ears for sure 

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:17.670
 Let's not go there for what you do. 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:21.869
 with the unit button comes 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:25.200
 sharing tab properties and 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.869
 there is advanced sharing for anyone 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.159
 share folder and settings 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.149
 You can here by the name of 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:38.990
 sharing starts 1,000 units and 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:42.479
 here it says that the place is undone iron 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:47.700
 local disk 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:50.279
 then apply hockey close fast 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.469
 one that can already access the others 

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:56.609
 just do the same thing in the others 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:02:00.990
 took practically released sharing 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:02.880
 folder and visited grams 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.039
 remembering that here you can put the name 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.810
 What do you want, the sun is right? 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.000
 by putting the same name of the unit for 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.880
 a matter of organization even're 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.430
 applying right close ok 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.180
 What I like about Grandpa's debut is not neo 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.370
 ktt I think it's okay beauty in the 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.650
 computer is just that so not now 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.020
 stop there we also need to know 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.140
 what is the ip of our computer on the network 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.230
 It's okay for this that you do well in 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:38.120
 command prompt and next digit 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:41.690
 ipconfig from a1 to find the adapter 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.970
 that you are connected to in the now leaves 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.030
 I see here mine is the one here 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:53.240
 wireless network adapters address 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:55.430
 ipv4 192.168.0.1 27 this is my ip 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.900
 It's okay, I guess it's on the computer. 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.950
 That's right, now we're going to the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.950
 mobile works out 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.720
 so let's go here the historical flaw 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.630
 As I told you. 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.170
 the registration link is just you download 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:15.280
 and used and right and has already been installed 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.280
 So let's open it from here. 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.280
 What are you going to do in here? 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:29.900
 button menu and let's that raining network 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:33.160
 lan is already with us and he knows 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.160
 Where are you paying? 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.420
 you have two options to configure the 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.360
 Your computer here is right. 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.230
 first let's go here new and let's put 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.880
 every day here 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.930
 the server the address we saw on the 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.790
 computer right here gives my 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.620
 192.168.0.1 2 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.380
 the user is the user you use to 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.160
 connect your computer to your computer 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.910
 Login 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.910
 my goal is my username and password 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.290
 damn it 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.409
 ii shows what a name is just for him 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:16.389
 to be able to identify something in your 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:18.400
 hit places like computer and 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.579
 not right, okay 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.440
 he will check and ready these people 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.600
 to come here and I've been here our 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.350
 two legs that we share the 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.050
 computer 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:34.000
 that's right you can see here have access 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:36.610
 to all files even if you 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.740
 If you have, you can configure your 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.539
 I contract the computer here in a way 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.740
 A little more practical, it's true that I 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:48.009
 I chose here again to delete as 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.479
 that's all you want to look for is it going 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.240
 search your network for all 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:54.820
 folder shares and have had 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.669
 Your ipi ago I was watching this here. 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.400
 I can close here already, but when you 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:10.930
 open it will ask the eyes and normal by 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:13.720
 here remember the ok 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.130
 access here is much more practical than you 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.260
 do not need to know ip 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.940
 and if you want to change the name and if someone 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.430

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:26.349
