there anything else you want to tell us
about<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.890> track<00:02:34.879> the<00:02:35.879> zip<00:02:36.090> line<00:02:36.329> yeah<00:02:36.510> it's

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
about the track the zip line yeah it's

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.690 
about the track the zip line yeah it's
pretty<00:02:36.870> neat<00:02:37.170> is<00:02:37.980> there<00:02:38.250> anything<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:38.670> don't

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
pretty neat is there anything you don't

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:53.680 
pretty neat is there anything you don't
like<00:02:38.970> about<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:52.160> yeah

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
like about it yeah

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.869 
like about it yeah
so<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.930> slows<00:02:55.260> down<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.950> doesn't<00:02:56.220> have<00:02:56.340> its<00:02:56.519> it

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
so it slows down it doesn't have its it

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.640 
so it slows down it doesn't have its it
loses<00:02:57.269> its<00:02:57.450> power<00:02:57.660> when<00:02:57.989> it's<00:02:58.140> on<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.319> zip

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
loses its power when it's on the zip

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.979 
loses its power when it's on the zip
line<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:59.220> so<00:02:59.819> far<00:03:00.090> we<00:03:00.239> haven't<00:03:00.269> been<00:03:00.660> able<00:03:00.810> to

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
line and so far we haven't been able to

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.309 
line and so far we haven't been able to
get<00:03:01.200> it<00:03:01.319> to<00:03:01.440> go<00:03:01.590> around<00:03:01.680> twice<00:03:02.250> right<00:03:02.930> yeah<00:03:03.930> so

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
get it to go around twice right yeah so

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.860 
get it to go around twice right yeah so
that<00:03:04.819> we'll<00:03:05.819> keep<00:03:05.970> working<00:03:06.180> on<00:03:06.450> that<00:03:06.510> we'll

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
that we'll keep working on that we'll

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.330 
that we'll keep working on that we'll
see<00:03:07.019> if<00:03:07.140> we<00:03:07.290> can<00:03:07.500> get<00:03:07.799> it<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.069> loop<00:03:08.220> around

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
see if we can get it to loop around

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.259 
see if we can get it to loop around
twice<00:03:09.590> okay<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:10.650> that's<00:03:11.069> our<00:03:11.250> review<00:03:11.430> of<00:03:12.000> hot
