00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.439
Welcome to the third part of the tutorial
how to create a switch's signal

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.669
We are going to use a old signal

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.550
to support our LEDs

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.140
put the old switch

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.140
in the supporter, and we put the LEDs 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.580
with the negative part (cathode)

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.160
up, the short wire

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.790
We put the white wire right here

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.050
on negative part and next

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.710
to each positive (anode)

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.090
we use three stranded wire

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.340
and the white one will be the negative pole

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.770
and the red one

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.770
will be connected to the anode's red LED and blue 
wire to green LED

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.170
in this case the red one is this

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.060
the green

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.680
is

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.520
at top of the signal

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.860
contrary to the normal signal

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.960
the green

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.460
is up and red is down of the signal

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.360
next we cut the wire

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.530
leaving the white wire longer the others

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.790
the red wire we will cut it

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.060
small, because is the nearest LED

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.040
and the blue longer 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.070
because

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.710
because is the farest LED

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.200
next we tin the wire

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.800
to solder

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.380
put a good amount

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.920
in the wire

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.780
to have a good contact

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.479
next we put it in the lagarto

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.379
to

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:13.999
solder the pieces

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:18.789
together

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:21.459
the nearest possible

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:28.459
to the LED

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.169
next we soldering

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:53.669
the green one

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.249
the nearest 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:03:02.249
as possible

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:10.069
to LED, same thing to the red one

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:14.239
again, nearby possible

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.499
you a hot soldering gun, to use

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:18.609
a small

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.519
time

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.339
to get

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:23.599
a very well

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.809
contact

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:28.639
and the wire and LED be one

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:33.169
right here

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.829
the first 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:37.650
LED connection

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.689
now we cut the legs of the LEDs

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:42.509
and we test it

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:46.299
OK, testing time

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.109
let see if works

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.479
because I have a voltage

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:54.279
of 18 volts

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:58.489
of AC, I am going to use a

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.749
1.5 k ohms resistor

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:02.749
to reduce

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:05.109
to 3 volts to 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.199
LED need

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:10.919
we use only one in the negative part (white wire)

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.829
in the positive part

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.259
we will connect the wire directly to the

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:19.639
AC transformer

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.170
let connect

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.879
negative

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:26.300
with the resistor

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.809
and the green one

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:30.879
to the positive power

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:35.650
let see

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.029
OK, we have

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:39.110
power

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.580
the light pass througt the plastic,
we will paint around the LED

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:50.580
wit black paint to resolve the problem

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.340
next we switch

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.229
the power

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:02.949
to the red one

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.849
and the red LED works

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:07.889
the last thing

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.400
is to

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.979
paint the LED, and cover the switch

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.969
in the next video

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:19.539
we learn how to connect them

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:20.919
to a switch

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.909
to have 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:24.210
a working

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.249
signal, who change

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:29.089
color when the swith change

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:36.089
route

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:03.149
end
