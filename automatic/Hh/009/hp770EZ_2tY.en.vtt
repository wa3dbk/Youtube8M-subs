and<00:00:07.200> also<00:00:07.980> I<00:00:08.010> will<00:00:08.309> be<00:00:08.460> selling<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:09.210> fix<00:00:09.690> but

and also I will be selling a fix but
I'll<00:00:11.099> talk<00:00:11.519> about<00:00:11.550> that<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.690> few<00:00:13.019> so

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
I'll talk about that in a few so

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.079 
I'll talk about that in a few so
basically<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.099> just<00:00:14.250> did<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.519> carbon<00:00:14.849> fiber

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
basically I just did the carbon fiber

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.720 
basically I just did the carbon fiber
fix<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.780> did<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.470> with<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.800> clear<00:00:17.130> nail<00:00:17.310> polish

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
fix I did it with the clear nail polish

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.090 
fix I did it with the clear nail polish
because<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:18.090> seem<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:19.080> seemed<00:00:19.439> like<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.740> best

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
because I seem that seemed like the best

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.590 
because I seem that seemed like the best
I<00:00:20.160> bought<00:00:20.699> clear<00:00:21.800> carbon<00:00:22.800> fiber<00:00:23.010> samples<00:00:23.600> but

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
I bought clear carbon fiber samples but

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.410 
I bought clear carbon fiber samples but
I<00:00:24.630> felt<00:00:25.260> like<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:25.650> would<00:00:25.830> look<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.160> lot<00:00:26.279> better

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
I felt like this would look a lot better

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.570 
I felt like this would look a lot better
than<00:00:27.590> actually<00:00:28.590> having<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.890> carbon<00:00:29.189> fiber

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
than actually having a carbon fiber

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.220 
than actually having a carbon fiber
because<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.119> real<00:00:30.300> ones<00:00:30.480> don't<00:00:30.929> look<00:00:31.050> I'd

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
because the real ones don't look I'd

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.319 
because the real ones don't look I'd
rather<00:00:31.380> look<00:00:31.590> like<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.820> basically<00:00:32.850> you

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
rather look like this so basically you

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.380 
rather look like this so basically you
just<00:00:33.360> like<00:00:33.680> take<00:00:34.680> clear<00:00:34.920> nail<00:00:35.100> polish<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.880> on

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
just like take clear nail polish and on

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.220 
just like take clear nail polish and on
every<00:00:36.899> dot<00:00:37.829> like<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.879> gray<00:00:39.090> part<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.870> don't

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
every dot like the gray part I don't

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.590 
every dot like the gray part I don't
know<00:00:40.379> if<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.559> can<00:00:40.710> see<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.360> where<00:00:42.360> it's<00:00:42.450> all

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
know if you can see that where it's all

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.209 
know if you can see that where it's all
raised<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:43.140> just<00:00:43.320> take<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.800> just<00:00:43.860> make<00:00:44.190> a

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
raised you just take it and just make a

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.319 
raised you just take it and just make a
dot<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.950> then<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:48.120> want<00:00:48.149> to

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
dot on it and then you just you want to

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.910 
dot on it and then you just you want to
do<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:48.660> three<00:00:48.899> times<00:00:49.140> like<00:00:49.469> do<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.770> all

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
do that like three times like do it all

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.799 
do that like three times like do it all
on<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.190> shoe<00:00:50.430> then<00:00:51.030> do<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.239> all<00:00:51.329> on<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.539> shoe

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
on this shoe then do it all on this shoe

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.840 
on this shoe then do it all on this shoe
then<00:00:52.410> come<00:00:52.680> back<00:00:52.710> do<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.100> again<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.610> switch

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
then come back do it again and switch

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.840 
then come back do it again and switch
and<00:00:54.600> then<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.840> want<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.110> take<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.550> go

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
and then you want to take it and go

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.369 
and then you want to take it and go
lines<00:00:57.629> down<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:59.309> bumps<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.910> then<00:01:00.300> do<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.350> on

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
lines down the bumps and then do it on

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.640 
lines down the bumps and then do it on
that<00:01:01.559> shoe<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.070> then<00:01:02.219> go<00:01:02.370> up<00:01:02.719> and<00:01:03.719> then<00:01:03.930> across

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
that shoe and then go up and then across

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.469 
that shoe and then go up and then across
three<00:01:05.100> times<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.729> want<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.000> switch<00:01:06.240> off

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
three times so you want to switch off

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.020 
three times so you want to switch off
and<00:01:06.750> then<00:01:07.530> let<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.130> dry<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.700> you'll<00:01:08.850> have

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
and then let that dry and you'll have

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.230 
and then let that dry and you'll have
the<00:01:09.270> carbon<00:01:09.869> fiber<00:01:10.049> fix<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:11.280> then<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.760> also<00:01:11.939> did

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
the carbon fiber fix and then I also did

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.890 
the carbon fiber fix and then I also did
the<00:01:12.990> 23<00:01:13.530> fix<00:01:13.799> as<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.939> can<00:01:15.030> see<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.479> both<00:01:15.689> of

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
the 23 fix as you can see on both of

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.440 
the 23 fix as you can see on both of
them<00:01:16.130> they<00:01:17.130> look<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.549> lot<00:01:17.970> better<00:01:18.119> than<00:01:18.270> they

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
them they look a lot better than they

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.320 
them they look a lot better than they
did<00:01:18.509> before

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
did before

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.760 
did before
so<00:01:21.799> the<00:01:22.799> 23<00:01:23.400> fix<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:24.000> will<00:01:24.299> be<00:01:24.420> selling<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.049> have

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
him my fat Jordan 23 when in my last

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.569 
him my fat Jordan 23 when in my last
video<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:44.620> when<00:03:44.829> I<00:03:44.859> looked<00:03:45.190> at<00:03:45.310> a<00:03:45.340> pair<00:03:45.549> of

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
video and when I looked at a pair of

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.640 
video and when I looked at a pair of
Authentics<00:03:46.180> and<00:03:46.510> you<00:03:46.810> definitely<00:03:47.290> need<00:03:47.470> these

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
Authentics and you definitely need these

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.569 
Authentics and you definitely need these
and<00:03:48.690> for<00:03:49.690> this<00:03:49.900> I<00:03:50.230> did<00:03:50.650> make<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.370> little

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
and for this I did make it a little

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.750 
and for this I did make it a little
taller<00:03:51.880> so<00:03:52.569> it's<00:03:53.019> exactly<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:54.280> same<00:03:54.489> like

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
taller so it's exactly the same like

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.690 
taller so it's exactly the same like
size<00:03:55.090> as<00:03:55.510> like<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.840> real<00:03:56.019> one<00:03:56.230> so<00:03:57.100> it's<00:03:57.400> a<00:03:57.489> lot

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
size as like the real one so it's a lot

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.759 
size as like the real one so it's a lot
it's<00:03:57.910> better<00:03:58.239> than<00:03:58.450> even<00:03:59.139> these<00:03:59.290> that<00:03:59.560> are<00:03:59.680> on

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.720 
it's better than even these that are on
my<00:03:59.950> shoes<00:04:00.250> so<00:04:00.630> it'll<00:04:01.630> be<00:04:01.720> three<00:04:02.260> four<00:04:02.639> three<00:04:03.639> of
