 james t 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.289
 hello people is that it was champion today will 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.080
 to continue the series of tents 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.850
 small only in the river of barraca debate and 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.920
 share seconds 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.920
 check the details of the tent there 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.350
 how can you observe one of the 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.579
 best tents that are on sale in the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.350
 brazilian market 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.969
 it is specific for those who want to reduce 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.739
 weight and volume 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.870
 we did it and it has just one that 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.809
 he kind of is extremely light an 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.699
 tent size is for one person 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.070
 and only one person without many 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.930
 equipment, the water column of it is 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.359
 2mm which gives enough 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.149
 Tranquility if you're going to get rain 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.860
 inside Brazil is as calm as the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.290
 tent room has quite a space 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.990
 reduced you will probably need 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.119
 use the advance space for 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.400
 equipment is not a 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.790
 very large space but each equipment 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.930
 of cooking the fact that things can stay 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.299
 outside 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.580
 similar to this space on the other side 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.950
 there is also that you do not have a clasp 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.530
 then you can use it to 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.119
 store any rucksack something 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.750
 that you will not use during the 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.090
 night 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.369
 you do not have access to them when inside 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.530
 from the tent to get there you will have 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.079
 that take the spec put the equipment 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.549
 as if it were a storage and then 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.740
 put a new spectrum 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.079
 she has two small windows to make the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.479
 air circulation here on the side and 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.040
 another in the front of the tent 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.560
 both are quite small when 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.659
 people caught the cold situation happened 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.740
 to condense inspiration into the 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.210
 inside part 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.030
 so if you go to the wire is 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.549
 important to keep it well open and 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.110
 here it is possible to place the 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.899
 cords at the angle that she is the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.390
 possible allows the 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.720
 air circulate in the bedroom the largest walls 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.730
 part in mosque canvas 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.470
 included here in the door part in the 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.960
 internal part does not have any little tips 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.270
 fixed for you to store your utensils 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.970
 but it comes with this canvas pocket 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.950
 mosquito net that you can attach to 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.300
 top of the tent 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.760
 Just doing this means you're done. 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.910
 further decreasing the internal height 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.920
 from the room as we discussed before 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.480
 main feature of the tent is 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.940
 that the cut is too small 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.050
 beyond them six narrow a problem is 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.210
 the question of height 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.340
 are 70 centimeters which means that 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.680
 not even a low person can 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.930
 sitting inside it and 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.420
 maybe even to change clothes 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.010
 if you take a long time 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.110
 rain that you have to stay inside the 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.959
 tent will be quite uncomfortable 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.970
 is a tent to be seen only as 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.220
 a local territory tent where you 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.680
 It's not going to happen the day, you go. 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.230
 simply if you are a 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.880
 very tall person 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.620
 I'm going to use practically all the space 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.720
 and there is no way to put 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.640
 equipment inside the 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.769
 maximum one backpack of attack 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.750
 the smaller the size of the person a 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.580
 little more comfort and things you 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.620
 can put in but she 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.780
 really for a very big person 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.880
 will be thus interpreted ending 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.650
 Therefore, it is worth mentioning that 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.269
 tent it is not ideal to be 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.610
 used in the structured field where 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.220
 You will spend several days in the campaign. 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.540
 the comfort it offers is minimal 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.090
 is a tent for those who want to reduce 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.040
 weight and reduce volume so much that 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.769
 rods and aspects are made in 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.170
 aluminum or actually with the public 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.330
 remember that the tourist or public trek will 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.190
 put the tent in the backpack and pass 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.310
 some days walking with her 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.440
 That's it, Lusa. That was the iwaki tent. 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.480
 natural of course you can check
