new Nokia series they are all running on
the<00:00:25.170> same<00:00:25.320> software<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.400> that's<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.939> Nokia

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
the same software so that's the Nokia

point<00:00:30.929> one<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.590> both<00:00:32.250> these<00:00:32.369> phones<00:00:32.640> so

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
point one that is both these phones so

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.389 
point one that is both these phones so
that's<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.989> common<00:00:34.350> factor<00:00:34.770> between<00:00:34.800> all

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
that's the common factor between all

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.250 
that's the common factor between all
these<00:00:35.700> phones<00:00:36.059> they<00:00:36.600> are<00:00:36.630> support<00:00:37.110> for

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
these phones they are support for

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.170 
these phones they are support for
whatsapp<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.950> recently<00:00:38.370> numerous

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
whatsapp and recently numerous

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.959 
whatsapp and recently numerous
improvements<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.930> software<00:00:40.670> so<00:00:41.670> about<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
improvements in software so about the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.299 
improvements in software so about the
hardware<00:00:42.360> then<00:00:42.540> Nokia<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.559> unleashed<00:00:43.950> a

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
hardware then Nokia have unleashed a

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.840 
hardware then Nokia have unleashed a
range<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:45.000> devices<00:00:45.149> with<00:00:45.989> differing

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
range of devices with differing

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.979 
range of devices with differing
specifications<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.030> similar

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
specifications and similar

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.200 
specifications and similar
specifications<00:00:49.590> too<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.399> what<00:00:50.640> are<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
specifications too so what are the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.450 
specifications too so what are the
differences<00:00:51.719> between<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.530> Nokia<00:00:52.890> Asha<00:00:53.039> for

this dual shot casing was initially

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.750 
this dual shot casing was initially
pioneered<00:01:25.300> with<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.720> Lumia<00:01:26.200> 620<00:01:26.770> which<00:01:27.460> was

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
pioneered with the Lumia 620 which was

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.330 
pioneered with the Lumia 620 which was
different<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:28.450> it<00:01:28.810> was<00:01:29.020> mad<00:01:29.470> but<00:01:30.010> this<00:01:30.160> is

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
different and it was mad but this is

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.570 
different and it was mad but this is
glossy<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.540> looks<00:01:32.259> gorgeous<00:01:32.530> you<00:01:33.280> can<00:01:33.310> see

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
glossy and looks gorgeous you can see

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.999

the<00:01:33.880> bright<00:01:34.180> red<00:01:34.450> version<00:01:34.960> is<00:01:35.259> very<00:01:35.619> striking

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
the bright red version is very striking

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.880 
the bright red version is very striking
by<00:01:36.790> the<00:01:36.850> black<00:01:37.119> itself<00:01:37.509> is<00:01:37.840> striking<00:01:38.410> but<00:01:38.590> as

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
by the black itself is striking but as

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.620 
by the black itself is striking but as
you<00:01:39.040> can<00:01:39.160> see<00:01:39.220> both<00:01:39.460> are<00:01:39.520> a<00:01:39.790> fingerprint

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
you can see both are a fingerprint

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.620 
you can see both are a fingerprint

let's take a look at the subtle

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.820 
let's take a look at the subtle
differences<00:01:52.479> between<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.440> build<00:01:53.619> quality

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830

and design of the Nokia Asha 5 or 2 and
the<00:01:58.030> fiyo<00:01:58.240> 3<00:01:58.570> so<00:01:59.080> over<00:01:59.380> at<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.619> front<00:01:59.950> both

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
the fiyo 3 so over at the front both

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.690 
the fiyo 3 so over at the front both
these<00:02:00.970> phones<00:02:01.270> if<00:02:01.720> they<00:02:02.380> had<00:02:02.560> both<00:02:02.860> been<00:02:02.890> in

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
these phones if they had both been in

the same color they are virtually

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:08.219 
the same color they are virtually
indistinguishable<00:02:06.550> but<00:02:07.390> again<00:02:07.690> note<00:02:07.929> that

indistinguishable but again note that
the<00:02:08.619> fiyo<00:02:08.830> 3<00:02:09.160> is<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.459> bit<00:02:09.940> taller<00:02:10.300> both<00:02:10.810> these

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
the fiyo 3 is a bit taller both these

the fiyo 3 is a bit taller both these
phones<00:02:11.380> are<00:02:11.770> placed<00:02:12.130> on<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.640> same<00:02:13.240> table<00:02:13.540> with

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
phones are placed on the same table with

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.330 
phones are placed on the same table with
the<00:02:14.500> same<00:02:15.420> height<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:17.230> can<00:02:17.349> notice<00:02:17.740> that<00:02:18.069> they

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
the same height you can notice that they

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.160 
the same height you can notice that they
are<00:02:18.370> in<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.670> same<00:02:18.849> height<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.480> below<00:02:19.900> you<00:02:19.959> can

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
are in the same height and below you can

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.370 
are in the same height and below you can
note<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:21.370> Asha<00:02:21.970> fiyo<00:02:22.180> 3<00:02:22.540> is<00:02:22.990> a<00:02:23.080> bit

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
note that the Asha fiyo 3 is a bit

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.320 
note that the Asha fiyo 3 is a bit
longer<00:02:23.560> that<00:02:23.770> might<00:02:24.069> be<00:02:24.280> due<00:02:24.459> to<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:25.030> design

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
longer that might be due to the design

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.650 
longer that might be due to the design
constraints<00:02:26.050> posed<00:02:26.319> by<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.740> 3G<00:02:27.700> modem<00:02:28.030> inside

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
constraints posed by the 3G modem inside

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.600 
constraints posed by the 3G modem inside
the<00:02:28.930> fiyo<00:02:29.260> 3<00:02:29.590> so<00:02:29.830> that's<00:02:29.980> one<00:02:30.280> of<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.400> main

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
the fiyo 3 so that's one of the main

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.660 
the fiyo 3 so that's one of the main
differences<00:02:31.000> we<00:02:31.180> will<00:02:31.270> discuss<00:02:31.540> that<00:02:31.620> and

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
differences we will discuss that and

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.610 
differences we will discuss that and
again<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:33.910> can<00:02:34.120> notice<00:02:34.270> that<00:02:34.810> on<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.349> back

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
again you can notice that on the back

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.610 
again you can notice that on the back
both<00:02:36.520> these<00:02:36.670> phones<00:02:36.970> have<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:38.050> different

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
both these phones have a different

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.160 
both these phones have a different
camera<00:02:39.010> module<00:02:39.370> so<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.630> camera<00:02:40.959> module

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
camera module so the camera module

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.100 
camera module so the camera module
design<00:02:41.800> itself<00:02:42.400> is<00:02:42.730> just<00:02:43.090> different<00:02:43.450> you<00:02:43.720> can

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
design itself is just different you can

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.140 
design itself is just different you can
see<00:02:44.319> that<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:45.489> red<00:02:45.819> one<00:02:46.709> has<00:02:47.709> a<00:02:47.770> Lumia<00:02:48.520> 800

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
see that the red one has a Lumia 800

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.699 
see that the red one has a Lumia 800
style<00:02:49.510> frame<00:02:50.319> for<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.099> camera<00:02:51.489> while<00:02:52.060> the

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
style frame for the camera while the

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.320 
style frame for the camera while the
black<00:02:53.709> one<00:02:53.980> doesn't<00:02:54.520> have<00:02:54.550> that<00:02:54.700> just<00:02:55.180> a

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
black one doesn't have that just a

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.750 
black one doesn't have that just a
circle<00:02:55.750> with<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.440> chrome<00:02:56.920> ring<00:02:57.190> around<00:02:57.430> it

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
circle with the chrome ring around it

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.820 
circle with the chrome ring around it
even<00:02:58.239> at<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.420> front<00:02:58.660> you<00:02:58.780> can<00:02:58.930> see<00:02:59.080> that<00:02:59.319> the

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
even at the front you can see that the

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.260 
even at the front you can see that the
502<00:03:00.370> is<00:03:00.700> full<00:03:01.330> glass<00:03:01.830> while<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:03.010> fiyo<00:03:03.190> 3<00:03:03.580> has<00:03:04.239> a

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
502 is full glass while the fiyo 3 has a

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.229 
502 is full glass while the fiyo 3 has a
small<00:03:04.690> frame<00:03:05.160> before<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.250> class<00:03:06.430> so<00:03:07.060> that's

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
small frame before the class so that's

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.259 
small frame before the class so that's
one<00:03:07.569> minor<00:03:07.930> difference<00:03:08.430> we<00:03:09.430> noted<00:03:09.909> between

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
one minor difference we noted between

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.670 
one minor difference we noted between
the<00:03:10.420> 5<00:03:10.629> over<00:03:10.840> 2<00:03:11.049> and

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
the 5 over 2 and

five year Oh three which are very

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.369 
five year Oh three which are very
similar<00:03:13.420> devices<00:03:14.129> so<00:03:15.129> quickly<00:03:16.049> again<00:03:17.049> going

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
similar devices so quickly again going

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.819 
similar devices so quickly again going

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:33.189 
switched for nose I don't know what

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:36.030 
switched for nose I don't know what
reason<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:34.269> left<00:03:34.480> is<00:03:34.599> left<00:03:34.780> flush<00:03:35.170> and<00:03:35.379> over

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
reason the left is left flush and over

the<00:03:36.250> right<00:03:36.370> hand<00:03:36.400> side<00:03:36.730> you<00:03:36.849> can<00:03:36.879> see<00:03:37.000> that

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
the right hand side you can see that

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.830 
the right hand side you can see that
they<00:03:37.930> are<00:03:38.019> very<00:03:38.349> very<00:03:38.739> similar<00:03:39.569> or<00:03:40.569> at<00:03:40.780> the

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
they are very very similar or at the

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.809 
they are very very similar or at the
back<00:03:40.989> again<00:03:41.319> you<00:03:41.439> can<00:03:41.590> see<00:03:41.739> that<00:03:42.040> there<00:03:42.549> is<00:03:42.579> an

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
back again you can see that there is an

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.740 
back again you can see that there is an
extra<00:03:43.209> bit<00:03:43.780> of<00:03:44.250> plastic<00:03:45.250> on<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:45.849> fiyo<00:03:46.060> 3<00:03:46.450> which

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
extra bit of plastic on the fiyo 3 which

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.899 
extra bit of plastic on the fiyo 3 which
is<00:03:46.900> used<00:03:47.200> to<00:03:47.439> pry<00:03:48.069> open<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.669> back<00:03:48.879> cover

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
devices are almost exactly the same so

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.099 
devices are almost exactly the same so
nothing<00:03:59.709> to<00:04:00.609> show<00:04:00.819> there<00:04:01.060> you<00:04:01.510> can<00:04:01.659> see<00:04:01.870> that

nothing to show there you can see that

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.229 
nothing to show there you can see that
they're<00:04:02.290> doing<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:03.129> single<00:04:03.340> LED<00:04:03.760> flash<00:04:03.790> beg

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
they're doing the single LED flash beg

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.589 
they're doing the single LED flash beg
your<00:04:04.359> pardon<00:04:04.629> is<00:04:05.280> different<00:04:06.329> in<00:04:07.329> different

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
your pardon is different in different

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.319 
your pardon is different in different
places<00:04:08.109> but<00:04:08.469> virtually<00:04:09.310> both<00:04:09.730> of<00:04:09.849> them<00:04:10.030> are

places but virtually both of them are

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.869 
places but virtually both of them are
exactly<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:11.079> same<00:04:11.109> in<00:04:11.620> terms<00:04:12.159> of<00:04:12.370> camera<00:04:12.700> the

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
exactly the same in terms of camera the

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.330 
exactly the same in terms of camera the
solution<00:04:13.359> as<00:04:13.480> well<00:04:14.109> as<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:14.950> camera

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
solution as well as the camera

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.819 
solution as well as the camera
capabilities<00:04:15.760> let's<00:04:16.690> quickly<00:04:17.019> open<00:04:17.500> up<00:04:17.590> the

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
capabilities let's quickly open up the

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.580 
capabilities let's quickly open up the
camera<00:04:18.070> app<00:04:18.459> and<00:04:18.639> show<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:19.349> what<00:04:20.349> exactly

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
camera app and show you what exactly

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.149 
camera app and show you what exactly
both<00:04:21.250> these<00:04:21.459> cameras<00:04:21.909> look<00:04:22.150> like<00:04:22.830> so<00:04:23.830> as<00:04:24.010> you

00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:24.159 
both these cameras look like so as you

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:26.129 
both these cameras look like so as you
can<00:04:24.280> see<00:04:24.490> both<00:04:24.729> have<00:04:25.060> the<00:04:25.210> same<00:04:25.240> camera<00:04:25.930> app

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
can see both have the same camera app

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.800 
can see both have the same camera app
with<00:04:26.860> the<00:04:26.979> same<00:04:27.190> functionalities<00:04:28.030> settings

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
with the same functionalities settings

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.379 
with the same functionalities settings
you<00:04:28.990> can<00:04:29.139> see<00:04:29.289> that<00:04:29.530> both<00:04:29.740> have<00:04:30.099> flash<00:04:30.490> you<00:04:31.360> can

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
you can see that both have flash you can

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.930 
you can see that both have flash you can
enable<00:04:31.750> flash<00:04:32.110> on<00:04:32.409> both<00:04:32.590> of<00:04:32.740> them<00:04:32.919> and<00:04:34.320> you<00:04:35.320> can

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
enable flash on both of them and you can

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.330 
enable flash on both of them and you can
find<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:37.180> resolution<00:04:37.409> to<00:04:38.409> be<00:04:38.560> exactly<00:04:39.130> the

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
find the resolution to be exactly the

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.610 
find the resolution to be exactly the
same<00:04:39.370> between<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.210> both<00:04:40.479> nothing<00:04:41.380> much<00:04:41.590> to

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
same between the both nothing much to

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.999 
same between the both nothing much to
say<00:04:42.099> here<00:04:42.570> except<00:04:43.570> the<00:04:43.659> fact<00:04:43.900> that<00:04:44.199> both<00:04:44.500> can

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
say here except the fact that both can

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.659 
say here except the fact that both can
take<00:04:45.550> 5<00:04:46.330> MP<00:04:46.840> photos<00:04:47.229> you<00:04:48.039> can<00:04:48.190> see<00:04:48.340> that<00:04:48.520> there

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
take 5 MP photos you can see that there

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.909 
take 5 MP photos you can see that there
is<00:04:48.699> a<00:04:48.820> bit<00:04:49.060> of<00:04:49.180> a<00:04:49.270> difference<00:04:49.659> in<00:04:49.919> display

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
is a bit of a difference in display

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.330 
is a bit of a difference in display
technology<00:04:51.610> not<00:04:52.449> exactly<00:04:52.840> technology<00:04:53.440> but<00:04:53.650> by

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
technology not exactly technology but by

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.029 
technology not exactly technology but by
the<00:04:54.400> looks<00:04:54.610> of<00:04:54.759> it<00:04:54.909> the<00:04:55.150> display<00:04:55.509> on<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:56.169> fire

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
the looks of it the display on the fire

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.640 
the looks of it the display on the fire
3<00:04:57.310> is<00:04:57.460> a<00:04:57.490> bit<00:04:57.759> cooler<00:04:58.210> and<00:04:58.449> the<00:04:58.960> fiyo<00:04:59.169> 2<00:04:59.440> is<00:04:59.560> a

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
3 is a bit cooler and the fiyo 2 is a

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.550 
3 is a bit cooler and the fiyo 2 is a
bit<00:04:59.830> warmer<00:05:00.250> we<00:05:00.400> like<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:00.729> fire<00:05:00.909> to<00:05:01.210> better<00:05:01.560> in

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
bit warmer we like the fire to better in

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.950 
bit warmer we like the fire to better in
our<00:05:02.800> opinion<00:05:03.220> but<00:05:03.250> that's<00:05:03.759> not<00:05:03.970> going<00:05:04.900> to

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
our opinion but that's not going to

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.390 
our opinion but that's not going to
change<00:05:05.050> anything<00:05:05.409> because<00:05:05.590> both<00:05:05.979> are<00:05:06.190> three

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
change anything because both are three

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.649 
change anything because both are three
inch<00:05:06.550> screens<00:05:06.940> with<00:05:07.630> 320<00:05:08.229> by<00:05:08.440> 240<00:05:08.650> resolution

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:09.659 
inch screens with 320 by 240 resolution

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:11.909 
inch screens with 320 by 240 resolution
not<00:05:10.659> really<00:05:10.930> great<00:05:11.110> for<00:05:11.320> a<00:05:11.349> draining<00:05:11.650> screen

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
not really great for a draining screen

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.629 
not really great for a draining screen
but<00:05:12.159> again<00:05:12.820> these<00:05:13.000> are<00:05:13.180> low-cost<00:05:13.479> phones<00:05:13.840> so

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
but again these are low-cost phones so

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.700 
but again these are low-cost phones so
coming<00:05:15.639> back<00:05:15.669> to<00:05:15.820> the<00:05:16.000> main<00:05:16.210> difference<00:05:16.870> both

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
coming back to the main difference both

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.149 
coming back to the main difference both
these<00:05:17.889> phones<00:05:18.419> this<00:05:19.419> has<00:05:20.139> only<00:05:20.380> 2<00:05:20.680> G<00:05:20.860> while

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:21.159 
these phones this has only 2 G while

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:22.570 
these phones this has only 2 G while
this<00:05:21.430> has<00:05:21.760> 3

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
this has 3

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.180 
this has 3
for<00:05:23.270> our<00:05:23.420> dual<00:05:23.660> sim<00:05:23.960> that's<00:05:24.590> the<00:05:24.890> main

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
for our dual sim that's the main

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.270 
for our dual sim that's the main
difference<00:05:25.700> that<00:05:25.850> Nokia<00:05:26.480> is<00:05:26.810> bringing<00:05:27.680> to

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
difference that Nokia is bringing to

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.040 
difference that Nokia is bringing to
both<00:05:28.460> these<00:05:28.610> phones<00:05:28.970> between<00:05:29.600> both<00:05:29.870> these

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
both these phones between both these

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.040 
both these phones between both these
phones<00:05:30.350> and<00:05:30.590> that<00:05:31.250> we<00:05:31.520> count<00:05:31.790> as<00:05:32.180> one<00:05:32.720> very

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
phones and that we count as one very

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.670 
phones and that we count as one very
interesting<00:05:33.380> so<00:05:34.180> in<00:05:35.180> terms<00:05:35.750> of<00:05:35.930> pricing<00:05:36.380> due

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
interesting so in terms of pricing due

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.090 
interesting so in terms of pricing due
to<00:05:36.800> the<00:05:36.920> 3G<00:05:37.190> modem<00:05:37.690> the<00:05:38.690> fiyo<00:05:38.990> 2<00:05:39.320> is<00:05:39.590> priced<00:05:39.920> at

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
to the 3G modem the fiyo 2 is priced at

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.960 
to the 3G modem the fiyo 2 is priced at
5800<00:05:41.030> rupees<00:05:41.330> while<00:05:41.900> the<00:05:42.200> fiyo<00:05:43.010> 3<00:05:43.400> is<00:05:43.670> priced

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
5800 rupees while the fiyo 3 is priced

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.150 
5800 rupees while the fiyo 3 is priced
at<00:05:44.650> 6,800<00:05:45.650> rupees

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
at 6,800 rupees

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.670 
at 6,800 rupees
pretty<00:05:46.340> hefty<00:05:46.670> pricing<00:05:47.060> for<00:05:47.240> the<00:05:47.330> 403<00:05:47.810> but<00:05:48.080> we

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
pretty hefty pricing for the 403 but we

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.040 
pretty hefty pricing for the 403 but we
think<00:05:48.920> it's<00:05:49.550> up<00:05:49.700> to<00:05:49.790> the<00:05:49.910> consumer<00:05:50.240> to<00:05:50.450> judge

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
think it's up to the consumer to judge

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.690 
think it's up to the consumer to judge
whether<00:05:51.320> that<00:05:51.650> pricing<00:05:52.070> is<00:05:52.160> correct<00:05:52.520> or<00:05:52.670> not

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
whether that pricing is correct or not

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.840 
whether that pricing is correct or not
and<00:05:53.240> due<00:05:54.170> to<00:05:54.200> the<00:05:54.410> 3G<00:05:54.770> modem<00:05:55.040> again<00:05:55.280> underneath

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
and due to the 3G modem again underneath

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.460 
and due to the 3G modem again underneath
the<00:05:55.940> battery<00:05:56.120> is<00:05:56.510> different<00:05:56.990> between<00:05:57.110> the<00:05:57.440> two

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
the battery is different between the two

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.120 
the battery is different between the two
the<00:05:57.770> fiyo<00:05:57.980> 2<00:05:58.190> has<00:05:59.150> a<00:05:59.180> thousand<00:05:59.870> 10<00:06:00.260> mAh<00:06:00.680> battery

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
the fiyo 2 has a thousand 10 mAh battery

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.220 
the fiyo 2 has a thousand 10 mAh battery
which<00:06:01.160> is<00:06:01.340> pretty<00:06:01.580> sufficient<00:06:02.180> for<00:06:02.690> the<00:06:02.810> fiyo

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.230 
which is pretty sufficient for the fiyo

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.030 
which is pretty sufficient for the fiyo
2<00:06:03.470> and<00:06:03.830> again<00:06:04.250> Fire<00:06:04.760> 3<00:06:05.030> has<00:06:05.930> a<00:06:05.960> thousand<00:06:06.590> 200

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
2 and again Fire 3 has a thousand 200

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.340 
2 and again Fire 3 has a thousand 200
mAh<00:06:07.340> battery<00:06:07.730> which<00:06:07.760> is<00:06:08.120> much<00:06:08.330> needed<00:06:08.360> for<00:06:09.260> the

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
mAh battery which is much needed for the

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.210 
mAh battery which is much needed for the
extra<00:06:09.770> 3G<00:06:10.190> modem<00:06:10.520> or<00:06:10.760> the<00:06:11.150> fire<00:06:11.330> 3<00:06:11.600> so<00:06:12.530> that's

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
extra 3G modem or the fire 3 so that's

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.790 
extra 3G modem or the fire 3 so that's
about<00:06:13.430> it<00:06:13.700> not<00:06:14.090> many<00:06:14.450> differences<00:06:15.050> many

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
about it not many differences many

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.800 
about it not many differences many
similarities<00:06:16.190> both<00:06:17.180> these<00:06:17.390> are<00:06:17.600> cell<00:06:17.780> phones

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
similarities both these are cell phones
