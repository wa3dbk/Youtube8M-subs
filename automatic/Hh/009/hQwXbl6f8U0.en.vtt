this uh browse whatever the I don't know

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.340 
this uh browse whatever the I don't know
how<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.580> says<00:00:14.969> because<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.870> can't<00:00:16.080> see<00:00:16.320> it

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
how that says because I can't see it

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.130 
how that says because I can't see it
from<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.949> screen<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:17.850> I'm<00:00:17.970> looking<00:00:18.090> at<00:00:18.359> but

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
from the screen that I'm looking at but

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.599 
from the screen that I'm looking at but
she's<00:00:19.560> really<00:00:19.770> easy<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:20.010> take<00:00:20.100> care<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.310> anyway

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
she's really easy to take care of anyway

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.980 
she's really easy to take care of anyway
so<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.789> can<00:00:20.880> see<00:00:21.000> she<00:00:21.119> does<00:00:21.270> like<00:00:21.420> no<00:00:21.570> damage

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
so you can see she does like no damage

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.540 
so you can see she does like no damage
and<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.199> think<00:00:22.380> she's<00:00:22.500> actually<00:00:22.710> missing<00:00:23.220> every

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
and I think she's actually missing every

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.210 
and I think she's actually missing every
single<00:00:23.820> attack<00:00:24.470> trying<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.529> do<00:00:25.650> her<00:00:25.740> claws<00:00:26.010> at

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
single attack trying to do her claws at

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.920 
single attack trying to do her claws at
me<00:00:26.340> but<00:00:26.519> not<00:00:26.699> out<00:00:27.000> there<00:00:27.210> not<00:00:27.390> like<00:00:27.570> doing<00:00:27.660> any

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
me but not out there not like doing any

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.529 
me but not out there not like doing any
damage<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.470> think<00:00:28.680> she<00:00:28.830> missed<00:00:29.070> or<00:00:29.250> whatever

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
damage so I think she missed or whatever

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.060 
damage so I think she missed or whatever
but<00:00:30.539> she<00:00:31.050> really<00:00:31.230> take<00:00:31.560> care<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.830> don't<00:00:31.920> worry

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
but she really take care of don't worry

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.650 
but she really take care of don't worry
about<00:00:32.250> her<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.399> wouldn't<00:00:32.759> get<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> pommel<00:00:33.630> of

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
that's actually gives us some trouble

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.930 
that's actually gives us some trouble
and<00:03:02.829> look<00:03:03.040> at<00:03:03.070> that<00:03:03.130> just<00:03:03.340> one<00:03:03.519> swing<00:03:03.760> to<00:03:03.910> the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
and look at that just one swing to the

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.550 
and look at that just one swing to the
face<00:03:04.180> was<00:03:04.630> that<00:03:04.690> a<00:03:04.750> power<00:03:04.959> swing<00:03:05.290> I<00:03:05.380> don't<00:03:05.500> know

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
face was that a power swing I don't know

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.599 
face was that a power swing I don't know
anything<00:03:05.680> I<00:03:05.799> use<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.010> power<00:03:06.220> swing<00:03:06.459> there

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
anything I use the power swing there

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.690 
anything I use the power swing there
just<00:03:06.880> got<00:03:07.690> next<00:03:08.049> to<00:03:08.079> him<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:08.440> just<00:03:09.250> did<00:03:09.459> work
