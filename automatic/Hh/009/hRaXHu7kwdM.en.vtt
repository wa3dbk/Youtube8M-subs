00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
of guessing at least 32 of that would be

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.760 
of guessing at least 32 of that would be
a<00:00:38.309> good<00:00:38.430> number<00:00:38.610> for<00:00:38.730> me<00:00:39.140> went<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.200> there<00:00:40.379> this

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
either Pullman over 35 so I think the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.450 
either Pullman over 35 so I think the
competitive<00:00:49.260> within<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.649> makes<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.219> want<00:00:50.370> to

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
competitive within you makes you want to

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.819 
competitive within you makes you want to
do<00:00:50.550> more<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.090> still<00:00:51.329> succeed<00:00:51.780> for<00:00:52.440> me<00:00:52.590> you

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
do more and still succeed for me you

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.290 
do more and still succeed for me you
know<00:00:52.860> regards<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.399> hide<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.699> dimensional

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
know regards to hide the dimensional

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.430 
know regards to hide the dimensional
