00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.220 
was there and about but it all came back
together<00:04:30.060> inside<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.090> last<00:04:31.450> two<00:04:32.020> kilometers

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
together inside the last two kilometers

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.659 
together inside the last two kilometers
and<00:04:35.230> I<00:04:35.440> think<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:35.770> del<00:04:35.919> Evans<00:04:36.190> can<00:04:36.370> be<00:04:36.460> proud

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
and I think the del Evans can be proud

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.940 
and I think the del Evans can be proud
of<00:04:36.730> the<00:04:36.940> way<00:04:37.090> he<00:04:37.590> defended<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.740> world

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
of the way he defended the world

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.909 
of the way he defended the world
championship<00:04:39.790> and<00:04:40.600> of<00:04:40.720> course<00:04:40.960> that<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:41.830> end

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
championship and of course that the end

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.219 
championship and of course that the end
of<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.070> day<00:04:42.250> really<00:04:42.550> didn't<00:04:43.060> suit<00:04:43.270> his

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
of the day really didn't suit his

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:49.050 
of the day really didn't suit his
stature<00:04:44.710> you<00:04:45.220> know<00:04:45.910> six<00:04:46.270> months<00:04:46.330> ago<00:04:46.660> people
