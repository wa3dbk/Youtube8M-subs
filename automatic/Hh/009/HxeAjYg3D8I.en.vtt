00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.460
 when well over a thousand people in one 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.660
 completely overheated hall around the cars 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.230
 where are there then only one thing 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.050
 mean 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.000
 it is traditionally vw on group evening 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.400
 evening before the Geneva Motor Show shows 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.320
 volkswagen here his novelties 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.970
 according to doctor martin winterkorn has that 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.490
 lasted 60 minutes 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.530
 According to my clock then it's more like 90 and it 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.180
 Another hour will pass 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.250
 We can also get to the cars 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.840
 and just see something 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.400
 So far , therefore, are only human form 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.300
 it will take another hour for me 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.300
 Just ten seconds 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.290
 with cameras instead of mirrors as 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.930
 Automobile steps started and 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.580
 meanwhile the star here on the vw 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.300
 evening in geneva this is the one 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.370
 series version of the vw xl1 of the so-called 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.870
 a liter of cars and he uses up 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.250
 even under 1 liter 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.510
 the exciting thing about this car is 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.220
 that he is now really chic 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.950
 looks almost like a small sports car 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.720
 but he consumes significantly less 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.300
 he has a two-cylinder here at the back 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.940
 diesel under the hood and in front 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.369
 electric motor of 27 ps more 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.790
 This is the automobile 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.800
 future as well as vw and the 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.110
 a technology carrier for everything in the world 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.520
 future vw group as hybrid or 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.520
 Electric car comes on the street 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:49.520
 this is the audi a3 sportback e 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.480
 tron that is the first audi 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.450
 for the outlet 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.580
 the first plug in hybrid out of the house 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.890
 volkswagen and audi first 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.430
 get the golf also as a plug in 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.430
 hybrid first comes to yes so 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.430
 world premiere 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.760
 this is the new golf like that 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.380
 new golf is already a dane 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.520
 is not that this is namely the 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.870
 golf variant with extra space in the 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.270
 tail and the most beautiful thing about this car is 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.110
 that's just back there right now 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.080
 with my logo on it 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.790
 this is probably the best car right now 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.390
 in the compact class that is the skoda 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.980
 octavia 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.080
 but this is also something new 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.490
 namely the skoda octavia combi 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.120
 with the czechs with c 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.830
 written 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.840
 and the rear has a luggage compartment volume 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.030
 what is currently in this class actually 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.190
 nobody offers he is as big as one 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.000
 vw passat and that is actually one 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.410
 number bigger 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.240
 the nicest thing about this car but that 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.740
 design meanwhile it is on none 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.180
 more embarrassing if you go there 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.780
 one is seen from this car 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.270
 gets out 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.890
 you can not do that from this car now 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.140
 necessarily claim either you need 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.520
 a mask like the rega crew or man 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.320
 needs a huge self-confidence 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.690
 because with this lambo you stand out 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.540
 every case on this is a kind 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.709
 tuned version of the aventador of zero 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.030
 at one hundred meters under three seconds 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:13.640
 experiences over 350 peaks and has 750 ps 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.720
 the good thing is that again 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.250
 Do not worry about it 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.290
 if you have to leave this car 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.510
 get out because it will only be three 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.480
 give copies of it and all three are 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.320
 for 36 million pieces per piece 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.320
 already sold 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.200
 how to do it right with the 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.710
 racers Porsche shows this here 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.710
 is the new gt3 and the new elfer 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.960
 shutters know what's coming now 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.360
 Here's the hottest version you can get 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.440
 At the moment the new Elfer can drive 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:57.500
 that the racer 475 hp out of one 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:58.970
 3.8 liters engine with 315 km h top of 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.310
 it goes from zero to one hundred in three and a half 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.610
 seconds 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.560
 That's what a racing athlete must look like 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.360
 wanna tell us this car it looks 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.210
 like having an american donker with you 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.490
 but this giant rims is a concept 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.410
 by giugiaro italian designer the 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.900
 have thought we'll do it that way 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.420
 a kind of lancia stratos of the modern times and 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.160
 put him on the platform of an audi 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.040
 For example, q7 here is one 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.380
 kind race car suv so you can through 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.760
 the desert of abu dhabi will heat up without you 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.170
 having to make thoughts about that 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.480
 the front bumper maybe missing afterwards 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.970
 that means this is the car for the 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.760
 apocalypse if he goes down then can 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.230
 you have to have fun with it 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.060
 Let's take a quick look at this car 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.690
 this is the bugatti veyron grand sport 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.100
 like never a work of art on four wheels 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.650
 but that was it, too 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.820
 many thanks for that vw-bus love 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.990
 window, look at this 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.770
 once exactly 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.660
 and this is the new vw t 6 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.820
 Well, at least the outlook on the 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.080
 new vw t6 this is one more 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.910
 study and this study becomes pure 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.250
 electrically operated that is with 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.190
 Battery packs under the car so poses 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.180
 vw imagine the future of transportation 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.530
 I can still conclude 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.900
 bit of peace from all this bustle 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.150
 in a real Volkswagen in 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.860
 his honest skin is what we car 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:20.720
 Anyone can afford this here 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:25.610
 is the new bentley flying birds 625 hp 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:28.100
 from 0 to 100 under five seconds 322 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.840
 km / h top and that though this car 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.520
 well over two tons weighs over the 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.870
 Consumption we are better not where 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.970
 actually quite proud at bentley 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.890
 it is that only 14 7 liters 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.409
 Ultimately , you just have to take it 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:44.179
 say that is also Volkswagen 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:44.179
 and that's it from geneva
