Easter<00:00:10.450> egg<00:00:10.600> on<00:00:10.750> the<00:00:10.840> map

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
Easter egg on the map

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.660 
Easter egg on the map
sub-zero<00:00:12.480> so<00:00:13.480> there's<00:00:14.260> no<00:00:14.440> obvious<00:00:14.740> Easter

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:15.670 
sub-zero so there's no obvious Easter

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.610 
sub-zero so there's no obvious Easter
eggs<00:00:15.790> of<00:00:16.120> reference<00:00:16.540> more<00:00:16.990> combat<00:00:17.470> or

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:17.620 
eggs of reference more combat or

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.670 
eggs of reference more combat or
sub-zero<00:00:18.220> but<00:00:19.030> this<00:00:19.330> got<00:00:19.600> me<00:00:19.750> thinking<00:00:20.200> and

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
sub-zero but this got me thinking and

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.400 
sub-zero but this got me thinking and
let<00:00:20.950> me<00:00:21.070> explain<00:00:21.310> this<00:00:21.610> so<00:00:22.210> the<00:00:22.360> map<00:00:22.600> itself<00:00:23.110> is

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
let me explain this so the map itself is

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.700 
let me explain this so the map itself is
named<00:00:23.860> sub-zero<00:00:24.610> and<00:00:24.880> one<00:00:25.840> the<00:00:25.990> main<00:00:26.230> catters

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
named sub-zero and one the main catters

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.340 
named sub-zero and one the main catters
in<00:00:26.890> more<00:00:27.070> combat<00:00:27.550> is<00:00:27.730> named<00:00:28.060> sub-zero<00:00:28.720> and<00:00:29.020> the

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.350 
in more combat is named sub-zero and the

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.010 
in more combat is named sub-zero and the
character<00:00:29.770> sub-zero<00:00:30.310> is<00:00:30.760> ability<00:00:31.449> to<00:00:31.660> control

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
character sub-zero is ability to control

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.169 
character sub-zero is ability to control
ice<00:00:32.259> in<00:00:32.499> many<00:00:32.649> forms<00:00:33.129> so<00:00:33.819> you<00:00:33.909> look<00:00:34.089> around

00:00:34.169 --> 00:00:34.179 
ice in many forms so you look around

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:36.119 
ice in many forms so you look around
this<00:00:34.449> map<00:00:34.629> this<00:00:34.899> map<00:00:35.140> is<00:00:35.379> covered<00:00:35.800> with<00:00:35.829> like<00:00:36.100> a

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
this map this map is covered with like a

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:37.979 
this map this map is covered with like a
frozen<00:00:36.670> tundra<00:00:36.850> that's<00:00:37.420> taking<00:00:37.809> place<00:00:37.839> in

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
frozen tundra that's taking place in

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.709 
frozen tundra that's taking place in
Canada<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:39.460> what<00:00:39.789> really<00:00:40.059> got<00:00:40.329> me<00:00:40.510> thinking

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
Canada but what really got me thinking

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.569 
Canada but what really got me thinking
this<00:00:41.530> map<00:00:41.949> is<00:00:42.249> based<00:00:42.670> upon<00:00:42.999> hockey<00:00:43.949> so<00:00:44.949> this<00:00:45.460> is

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
this map is based upon hockey so this is

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.399 
this map is based upon hockey so this is
going<00:00:45.699> to<00:00:45.760> be<00:00:45.850> my<00:00:46.059> weird<00:00:46.329> concept<00:00:46.629> that<00:00:47.139> might

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:47.409 
going to be my weird concept that might

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:50.459 
going to be my weird concept that might
be<00:00:47.620> related<00:00:47.889> to<00:00:48.190> more<00:00:48.399> combat<00:00:48.909> so<00:00:49.719> if<00:00:50.139> you<00:00:50.260> look

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
be related to more combat so if you look

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:53.399 
be related to more combat so if you look
at<00:00:50.620> when<00:00:50.829> you<00:00:50.920> watch<00:00:51.100> hockey<00:00:52.109> besides<00:00:53.109> what

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
at when you watch hockey besides what

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:54.959 
at when you watch hockey besides what
hockey<00:00:53.620> players<00:00:54.010> actually<00:00:54.339> do<00:00:54.670> when<00:00:54.850> they're

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
hockey players actually do when they're

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.599 
hockey players actually do when they're
playing<00:00:55.149> hockey<00:00:55.420> they<00:00:55.870> actually<00:00:56.350> fight<00:00:56.769> so

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
playing hockey they actually fight so

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.939 
playing hockey they actually fight so
well<00:00:58.420> hockey<00:00:58.690> players<00:00:59.109> when<00:00:59.440> they<00:00:59.530> don't<00:00:59.799> play

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
well hockey players when they don't play

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:01.949 
well hockey players when they don't play
hockey<00:01:00.159> they<00:01:00.579> fight<00:01:00.940> among<00:01:01.269> each<00:01:01.299> other<00:01:01.600> and

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:01.959 
hockey they fight among each other and

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:04.170 
hockey they fight among each other and
what<00:01:02.620> are<00:01:02.679> you<00:01:02.739> doing<00:01:02.979> more<00:01:03.159> combat<00:01:03.579> you<00:01:03.819> fight

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
what are you doing more combat you fight

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.899 
what are you doing more combat you fight
so<00:01:05.049> that<00:01:05.350> we<00:01:05.560> got<00:01:05.770> me<00:01:05.890> thinking<00:01:06.310> maybe<00:01:06.610> it's

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
so that we got me thinking maybe it's

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.149 
so that we got me thinking maybe it's
this<00:01:07.149> has<00:01:07.360> to<00:01:07.509> be<00:01:07.600> like<00:01:07.689> some<00:01:07.930> kind<00:01:08.200> of<00:01:08.350> weird

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
this has to be like some kind of weird

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.730 
this has to be like some kind of weird
logic<00:01:10.119> that<00:01:10.299> has<00:01:10.390> a<00:01:10.450> reference<00:01:10.780> for<00:01:11.170> a<00:01:11.229> combat

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
logic that has a reference for a combat

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.100 
logic that has a reference for a combat
but<00:01:12.430> there's<00:01:12.640> one<00:01:12.880> more<00:01:13.060> thing<00:01:13.119> I<00:01:13.450> found<00:01:13.810> in

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
but there's one more thing I found in

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.319 
but there's one more thing I found in
this<00:01:14.200> building<00:01:14.710> that<00:01:15.310> got<00:01:15.609> me<00:01:15.820> like<00:01:16.000> really

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
this building that got me like really

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.630 
this building that got me like really
surprised<00:01:16.840> so<00:01:17.740> I<00:01:17.770> was<00:01:18.039> searching<00:01:18.250> throughout

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
surprised so I was searching throughout

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.569 
surprised so I was searching throughout
this<00:01:18.759> building<00:01:18.969> may<00:01:19.689> beg<00:01:19.869> a<00:01:20.369> finance<00:01:21.369> or<00:01:21.520> a

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
this building may beg a finance or a

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:24.450 
this building may beg a finance or a
clue<00:01:21.969> to<00:01:22.390> more<00:01:22.899> combat<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.829> I<00:01:23.920> found<00:01:24.280> this

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
clue to more combat and I found this

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.380 
clue to more combat and I found this
donut<00:01:25.240> box<00:01:25.509> and<00:01:26.229> it<00:01:26.439> says<00:01:26.680> how<00:01:27.039> wena<00:01:27.520> dition<00:01:28.000> so

sub-zero from Mortal Kombat I mean this

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.959 
sub-zero from Mortal Kombat I mean this
is<00:01:38.229> not<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.469> most<00:01:38.679> obvious<00:01:38.950> Easter<00:01:39.789> egg<00:01:39.939> that

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
is not the most obvious Easter egg that

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.690 
is not the most obvious Easter egg that
pacifically<00:01:40.750> reference<00:01:41.409> more<00:01:41.649> to<00:01:41.740> combat<00:01:42.189> but

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
pacifically reference more to combat but

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.910 
pacifically reference more to combat but
piecing<00:01:43.149> everything<00:01:43.240> together<00:01:43.740> might<00:01:44.740> be

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
piecing everything together might be

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.620 
piecing everything together might be
representing<00:01:45.640> more<00:01:45.850> combat

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
representing more combat

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.020 
representing more combat
