00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 Good day to all friends with you 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.960
 I'm a dentist again 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:10.889
 and this is 5 villages of the springtrap facts 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.889
 and remind him that 5 hours of facts is 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.560
 heading title 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.869
 they mean 5 facts of the village 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.670
 springtrape I'm other character between 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.670
 stop asking him to be 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.200
 first fact 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.200
 most likely the nickname springtrap 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.079
 It turned out that the purple guy 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.620
 got into this suit when he climbed 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.300
 spring locks broke down and 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.870
 animatronic details slammed like 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:53.379
 trap tasks violet guy into a trap 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:57.190
 second fact springtrap can 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.540
 open his mouth if he opens it wide 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.180
 then you can see not 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.360
 springtrand endoskeleton a head 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.240
 purple guy 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.390
 the third fact after the end of the game to us 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.050
 show the newspaper which is written 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.240
 that the attraction burned down if you light it 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.149
 then in the photo in the background you can 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.000
 see the springtrap most likely he 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.160
 survived the fire 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.380
 fourth fact in springtrap five 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.280
 fingers and not four like others 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.530
 animatronics 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.250
 This is due to the fact that he can 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.590
 climb man 5 fact phone guy 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.960
 said that there are only two specially 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.530
 tailored suits and for man 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.710
 and for endoskeletons one of them is a springtrap 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.790
 and he was the first prototype of such a suit 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.409
 it means there is a suit more reliable and 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.200
 maybe we'll see him in the fourth part 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.439
 games and I will no longer do the role of cup 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:01.649
 of five night at freddy but immediately 50 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:05.170
 facts about them are not necessary no I will not 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:09.850
 ask for another but they give us a puppet 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:12.760
 this I will not ask later well there 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:18.120

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.120
