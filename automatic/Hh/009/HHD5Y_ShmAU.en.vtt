we're<00:00:09.360> looking<00:00:09.630> at<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.780> cartridge<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.559> now<00:00:11.100> we

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
we're looking at a cartridge and now we

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.120 
we're looking at a cartridge and now we
will<00:00:11.430> study<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.940> anatomy<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.540> cartridge

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.130 
will study the anatomy of the cartridge

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.970 
will study the anatomy of the cartridge
we<00:00:14.130> looked<00:00:14.520> inside<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.059> cartridge<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.980> see

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
we looked inside the cartridge and see

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.190 
we looked inside the cartridge and see
the<00:00:17.580> various<00:00:17.939> components<00:00:18.080> inside<00:00:19.080> the

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.200 
the various components inside the

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.490 
the various components inside the
cartridge<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.830> their<00:00:20.700> functionalities<00:00:21.500> this

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
cartridge and their functionalities this

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.900 
cartridge and their functionalities this
is<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.650> CV<00:00:23.070> 436<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:24.000> cartridge<00:00:25.340> which<00:00:26.340> represent

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
is a CV 436 a cartridge which represent

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.850 
is a CV 436 a cartridge which represent
the<00:00:26.939> new<00:00:27.150> generation<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.810> cartridges<00:00:28.320> which

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
the new generation of cartridges which

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.120 
the new generation of cartridges which
are<00:00:29.040> smaller<00:00:31.070> how<00:00:32.070> but<00:00:32.520> they<00:00:33.480> print<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.290> same

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
are smaller how but they print the same

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.639 
are smaller how but they print the same
more<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.730> pages<00:00:35.970> as<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.809> bigger<00:00:37.079> cartridge

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
more of the pages as a bigger cartridge

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.280 
more of the pages as a bigger cartridge
good<00:00:37.800> too<00:00:38.010> these<00:00:38.940> cartridges<00:00:39.300> come<00:00:40.080> with<00:00:40.260> a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
good too these cartridges come with a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.670 
good too these cartridges come with a
chip<00:00:40.560> a<00:00:40.880> microchip<00:00:41.880> controller<00:00:42.300> chip<00:00:42.680> which

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
chip a microchip controller chip which

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.860 
chip a microchip controller chip which
gives<00:00:44.430> added<00:00:44.970> functionality<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
gives added functionality to the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.270 
gives added functionality to the
conference<00:00:46.350> now<00:00:47.280> we'll<00:00:47.700> look<00:00:47.910> inside<00:00:48.720> the

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
specifically built for that engine so

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.990 
specifically built for that engine so
the<00:05:22.710> toner<00:05:22.889> which<00:05:23.100> goes<00:05:23.280> into<00:05:23.310> this<00:05:23.669> cartridge

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
the toner which goes into this cartridge

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.129 
the toner which goes into this cartridge
is<00:05:24.300> this<00:05:25.139> toner<00:05:25.729> this<00:05:26.729> is<00:05:26.910> specially<00:05:27.389> key<00:05:27.510> to

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
is this toner this is specially key to

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.810 
is this toner this is specially key to
learn<00:05:28.290> and<00:05:28.440> say<00:05:29.250> chemical<00:05:29.639> toner<00:05:29.820> is<00:05:30.240> weighs

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
learn and say chemical toner is weighs

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:40.430 
learn and say chemical toner is weighs
130<00:05:32.820> grams<00:05:33.060> and<00:05:37.010> so<00:05:38.090> this<00:05:39.090> is<00:05:39.240> the<00:05:39.600> toner<00:05:39.840> for

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
130 grams and so this is the toner for

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.000 
130 grams and so this is the toner for
the<00:05:41.510> 36<00:05:42.510> 8<00:05:42.690> not<00:05:42.870> French<00:05:43.139> for<00:05:43.650> different

the 36 8 not French for different

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.950 
the 36 8 not French for different
cartridges<00:05:46.039> this<00:05:47.039> is<00:05:47.220> 453<00:05:47.910> a<00:05:48.090> cartridge<00:05:48.539> this

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
cartridges this is 453 a cartridge this

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.490 
cartridges this is 453 a cartridge this
is<00:05:49.139> the<00:05:49.260> print<00:05:49.470> owner<00:05:50.180> to<00:05:51.180> 5v<00:05:51.419> cartridges<00:05:52.020> we

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
is the print owner to 5v cartridges we

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.850 
is the print owner to 5v cartridges we
have<00:05:52.680> different<00:05:53.010> donor<00:05:53.250> a<00:05:54.380> biggie<00:05:55.380> cartridges

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
have different donor a biggie cartridges

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:02.180 
have different donor a biggie cartridges
42<00:05:56.669> a<00:05:56.699> and<00:05:57.590> 16<00:05:58.590> a<00:05:58.740> we<00:05:59.070> have<00:05:59.250> different<00:05:59.639> load

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.570 

so<00:06:02.820> we<00:06:02.910> use<00:06:03.120> engine<00:06:04.020> specific<00:06:04.440> torah<00:06:04.650> to

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
so we use engine specific torah to

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.900 
so we use engine specific torah to
ensure<00:06:06.000> the<00:06:06.510> compatibility<00:06:07.200> and<00:06:07.670> the<00:06:08.670> print

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
ensure the compatibility and the print

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:15.630 
ensure the compatibility and the print
quality<00:06:09.090> stays<00:06:10.020> like<00:06:10.290> be<00:06:11.280> boiling
