stay stuck on learning how to do dosage
calculations<00:04:34.400> they<00:04:34.550> have<00:04:34.730> calculators<00:04:35.420> for

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
calculations they have calculators for

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.570 
calculations they have calculators for
that<00:04:35.690> and<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.230> nursing<00:04:36.530> profession<00:04:36.620> plus<00:04:37.430> you

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
it's not just dosage calculations yeah

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.920 
it's not just dosage calculations yeah
you're<00:04:49.940> gonna<00:04:50.060> need<00:04:50.120> math<00:04:50.480> it's<00:04:50.750> very

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
you're gonna need math it's very

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.510 
you're gonna need math it's very
important<00:04:51.410> but<00:04:52.370> science<00:04:54.310> biochemistry<00:04:55.310> stuff

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
important but science biochemistry stuff

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.220 
important but science biochemistry stuff
like<00:04:55.670> that<00:04:55.820> it's<00:04:56.060> a<00:04:56.300> necessity<00:04:56.570> brother

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
like that it's a necessity brother

so like pharmacology I'm sorry enough
for<00:05:00.500> apology<00:05:00.770> but<00:05:00.860> form<00:05:01.330> pathophysiology

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
for apology but form pathophysiology

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.830 
for apology but form pathophysiology
physiology<00:05:03.290> chemistry<00:05:04.480> chemistry<00:05:05.480> you<00:05:05.660> might

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
physiology chemistry chemistry you might

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.450 
physiology chemistry chemistry you might
not<00:05:06.020> use<00:05:06.260> that<00:05:06.500> but<00:05:06.710> you're<00:05:06.860> definitely<00:05:07.130> going

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
not use that but you're definitely going

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.520 
not use that but you're definitely going
to<00:05:07.490> use<00:05:07.550> anatomy<00:05:08.510> and<00:05:08.690> physiology<00:05:08.930> that's

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
to use anatomy and physiology that's

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.200 
to use anatomy and physiology that's
very<00:05:09.950> important<00:05:10.340> it's<00:05:10.460> a<00:05:10.490> requirement<00:05:11.060> you

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
very important it's a requirement you

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.340 
very important it's a requirement you
have<00:05:11.360> to<00:05:11.570> know<00:05:11.660> the<00:05:11.780> whole<00:05:11.870> thing<00:05:11.930> about<00:05:12.230> the

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
have to know the whole thing about the

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.050 
have to know the whole thing about the
anatomy<00:05:12.680> of<00:05:12.710> the<00:05:12.800> body<00:05:12.890> and<00:05:13.190> how<00:05:13.700> it<00:05:13.760> functions

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
anatomy of the body and how it functions

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.420 
anatomy of the body and how it functions
properly<00:05:14.480> because<00:05:14.960> when<00:05:15.110> you<00:05:15.170> educate<00:05:15.680> the

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
properly because when you educate the

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.840 
properly because when you educate the
individual<00:05:17.180> patient<00:05:17.780> comes<00:05:17.930> in<00:05:18.110> for<00:05:18.850> diabetes

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
individual patient comes in for diabetes

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.520 
individual patient comes in for diabetes
you<00:05:20.180> have<00:05:20.300> to<00:05:20.390> break<00:05:20.540> that<00:05:20.750> down<00:05:20.930> understand

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
you have to break that down understand

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.860 
you have to break that down understand
the<00:05:21.920> physiology<00:05:22.220> part<00:05:22.640> endocrine<00:05:23.270> pancreas

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
the physiology part endocrine pancreas

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.930 
the physiology part endocrine pancreas
secretes<00:05:24.260> insulin<00:05:24.680> and<00:05:25.130> also<00:05:25.550> digestive

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
secretes insulin and also digestive

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.340 
secretes insulin and also digestive
enzymes<00:05:26.270> insulin<00:05:26.750> what<00:05:26.870> does<00:05:26.960> it<00:05:27.050> do<00:05:27.110> break

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
enzymes insulin what does it do break

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.960 
enzymes insulin what does it do break
down<00:05:27.380> the<00:05:27.590> sugar<00:05:27.770> in<00:05:27.890> the<00:05:27.920> blood<00:05:28.160> utilize<00:05:28.820> that

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
down the sugar in the blood utilize that

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.490 
down the sugar in the blood utilize that
energy<00:05:29.180> you<00:05:29.810> don't<00:05:29.990> you're<00:05:30.230> gonna<00:05:30.290> have<00:05:30.440> a

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
energy you don't you're gonna have a

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.050 
energy you don't you're gonna have a
three<00:05:30.770> piece<00:05:31.010> which<00:05:31.220> is<00:05:31.370> poly<00:05:31.580> dis<00:05:31.730> you<00:05:31.850> pull

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
three piece which is poly dis you pull

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.210 
three piece which is poly dis you pull
your<00:05:32.240> whole<00:05:32.420> aphasia<00:05:32.690> you<00:05:33.260> have<00:05:33.560> to<00:05:33.800> know<00:05:34.010> this

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
your whole aphasia you have to know this

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.710 
your whole aphasia you have to know this
brother<00:05:34.550> so<00:05:35.000> yes<00:05:35.210> you're<00:05:35.390> gonna<00:05:35.480> need<00:05:35.660> your
