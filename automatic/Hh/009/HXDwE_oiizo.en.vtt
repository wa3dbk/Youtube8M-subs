00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
to do with boys but I think that it just

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.390 
to do with boys but I think that it just
makes<00:00:09.870> me<00:00:09.960> lie<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.620> sneak<00:00:10.740> around<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.309> they

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
makes me lie and sneak around and they

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.009 
makes me lie and sneak around and they
can't<00:00:11.700> tell<00:00:11.910> them<00:00:12.059> anything<00:00:12.210> about<00:00:12.690> boys<00:00:12.870> or

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
can't tell them anything about boys or

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.320 
can't tell them anything about boys or
even<00:00:13.259> talked<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.650> them<00:00:13.769> about<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.400> my<00:00:14.969> sister's

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
even talked to them about it my sister's

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.390 
even talked to them about it my sister's

and do that stuff you're choosing to do

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.479 
and do that stuff you're choosing to do
that<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:31.740> have<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.009> know<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.460> a

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
that so you have to know that is a

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.180 
that so you have to know that is a
choice<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.790> you're<00:00:33.180> making<00:00:33.239> um<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:34.620> terms<00:00:34.680> of

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
choice that you're making um in terms of

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.680 
choice that you're making um in terms of
like<00:00:35.399> how<00:00:35.610> your<00:00:35.969> relationship<00:00:36.059> could

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
like how your relationship could

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.360 
like how your relationship could
potentially<00:00:37.170> be<00:00:37.290> altered<00:00:37.680> because<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.219> that

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
potentially be altered because of that

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.900 
potentially be altered because of that
now<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.800> think<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> sophomore<00:00:41.579> doesn't

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
now I think that a sophomore doesn't

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.030 
now I think that a sophomore doesn't
necessarily<00:00:42.510> have<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.809> be<00:00:43.079> dating<00:00:43.350> if<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.829> were

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040
