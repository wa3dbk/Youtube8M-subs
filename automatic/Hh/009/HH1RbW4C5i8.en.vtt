00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.509
 let's show how the 

00:00:02.979 --> 00:00:07.810
 error that occurs when we try 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:10.260
 copy a file of more than 4 gb to a 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.260
 pendrive 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.209
 if we see the properties of the pencil 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.390
 memory or a removable hard disk 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.960
 when you have the file system 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.869
 fat32 as we see here 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.910
 we will not be able to copy files of more than 4 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.489
 size gb for example if we try 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.289
 copy this file that has more than 4 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.649
 gb 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.969
 shows us this error message 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.710
 saying that the file is too much 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.860
 great for the file system of 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.600
 destination with which you can not copy it in 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.129
 change if we try to copy a file 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.129
 less than 4 GB 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.650
 we see that yes it is copied to the pendrive 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.370
 to solve this problem 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:00.400
 we will have to format the pendrive or the 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.310
 external hard drive and format it with 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.640
 ntfs file system logically 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:09.160
 before formatting if we have any data 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.990
 we must copy it to the team wherever 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.880
 so as not to lose the information since 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.160
 Formatting will eliminate all 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.470
 device information once 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.460
 we have copied the information from 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:25.540
 pendrive right button format and here 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.150
 we must choose the ntfs system that 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.130
 will allow to copy files of more than 4 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.170
 gigas on the pendrive by selecting the 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.100
 maximum capacity which is the one that comes by 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.160
 ntfs defect in the file system and 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.860
 pressing in quick format we will press in 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.619
 start accept and start the 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.600
 formatting the pendrive will warn us that 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.060
 the format has been completed we will press 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.880
 in accepting we close this window on 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.410
 pendrive as I say is clean removes 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.200
 all the information and now if 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:59.190
 we try to copy a file of more than 4 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.190
 gb for example 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.970
 we see that you already let copy it you have to have 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.869
 note that the file system 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.790
 ntfs is not compatible with many others 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.220
 operating systems for example if 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.340
 we have a mac or that yes that will allow 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.490
 read files from a file system 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.250
 ntfs but you can not write this type of 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.500
 file system therefore if 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.190
 we have mac or other devices that we 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.650
 let you write about ntfs and versions 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.760
 old windows 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:40.870
 the other option is to format the unit 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.930
 with exfat file system that is a 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.879
 file system like 32 but 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.170
 improved and yes it is compatible with 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:53.110
 Mac versions higher than the 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.319
 10.0 max and we have devices with mac 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.019
 or sa from 10 if it allows 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.170
 both read and write in format x 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:05.069
 fat that also admit more files 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.069
 of 4 GB
