00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.760
 Hello everyone, we are here 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.480
 new and today I am going to bring you an unboxing 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.429
 uses a stylus for our use 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.310
 with our tablet it's worth 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.260
 I already have this open 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.680
 Y 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.680
 is 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:27.150
 wacom's bamboo is worth 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.010
 here you can see it for ipad for 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.140
 iphone also for android 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:38.060
 bamboo paper that I think is only 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.620
 available for ipad and iphone and then the 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.020
 new bamboo paper that comes with a 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.000
 New style wacom light that only serves 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:50.700
 for the note 1 and 2 and the galaxy s3 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.700
 Well, here we have the box 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.930
 and everything is explained and now 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.670
 let's open this around here we're going to 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.670
 catch a thing that cut 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.410
 and let's open it 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.230
 so you can see all this is colored 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.590
 black we see the range of colors there 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:21.570
 if you focus 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.570
 well there you have it 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.370
 let's open it 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.090
 we see that it is tiny 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.860
 OK 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:39.450
 and we see what it brings here papers 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.930
 a quick guide 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.799
 How to assemble how to disassemble 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:49.880
 quick instructions and a piece of paper with 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.880
 the bamboo paper application 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.360
 and a little more 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:04.100
 Well here we have it 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.320
 nice touch grid does not become grip 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.929
 plastic but 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.710
 It is very nice to see the size where 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:16.160
 it stays in your hand like a pencil if you 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.310
 we compare with a normal- sized pencil 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.520
 we see 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.160
 you see the size that has a size 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.950
 pretty restrained and we're going to put it in 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.440
 practice 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.700
 Today I'm just going to teach this style looks 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:36.890
 in another I will make a comparison between 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.890
 several styles among three that I have 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.730
 and you will choose the one that most 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.209
 like 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.209
 I'm going to unlock the 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:56.430
 I have it here, let's make it shine 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.430
 and for everyone to see 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.459
 we will open an application and also 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.290
 I take advantage and I show you an application that 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.960
 many asked for applications that 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.460
 I use this week free note 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.120
 and it is an application that allows you 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.120
 to write 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.959
 directly 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.959
 you have seen it 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.370
 directly 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.280
 from the screen to the paper 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.580
 it's impressive I assure you it's 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.010
 Awesome 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.010
 how well you slide on the screen 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.969
 I assure you that it is impressive because 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.430
 I have two more I have a cheap one 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:58.409
 one euro I'll show you what you have 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.409
 pasted on the screen and this is 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.450
 It is impressive and well explained by one 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.030
 bit this application the free note that 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.340
 you can write here directly you can 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.970
 underline you can copy I'll change 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.920
 colour 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.000
 then you have here the way of writing 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:18.299
 able to paint set in English and 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.709
 biographical and then what you write I'm going 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.109
 to teach for example some notes me 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.800
 you see this is a problem to see 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.560
 but more than error 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.199
 here where endorsement is not that it has nothing 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.289
 Here I will show you a longer one here 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:35.930
 this a complete problem 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.360
 well this problem that is made way to 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.580
 step later I can export it in pdf and 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.129
 I would have all the problem that I have done 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.300
 in the class 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:47.940
 and I would have everything on paper 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.979
 it's very interesting because she just 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.659
 Use folios with this application is very 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.000
 fast here we have another problem with a 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:56.960
 drawing 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.520
 and the resolution another problem of a 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.980
 pipeline with the resolution another problem 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.370
 input flow output with the 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:11.570
 resolution is very very very interesting 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:13.430
 and here he is adding notes and they are 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.530
 infinite I tell you are the brakes of 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.530
 normal and then I was fine t plus that is 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:22.409
 of payment and little else a good application 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.569
 to take advantage of your styles 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:26.159
 and just before I finish I'm going to 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:28.439
 teach a small drawing application 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:30.330
 also these word processors here 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:33.089
 editing and drawing one that all 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.569
 you will know that the sketchbook pro did it 

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:37.119
 very famous apple 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:41.400
 and now it's for any kind of 

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:44.780
 platform is for drawing 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:48.880
 and nothing I will teach you here here 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:52.820
 capacity thickness color 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:55.040
 a little bit of red and nothing 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:59.590
 here we draw I am bad drawing the 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.590
 cartoonist that you know but we're going 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:05.270
 we can see how you can draw 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.000
 a little bug 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.310
 orejon 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.319
 and you have enough precision does not reach 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:28.819
 the accuracy of others style but the 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:33.759
 true that this is the loop to both 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:33.759
 to make small sketches or 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:38.169
 writing about everything is fine but 

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:39.729
 for example if we had to do if 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:41.199
 I had to paint a problem to 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:46.390
 better the one I had to paint before 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:48.340
 good if I put this not like that yes 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:51.180
 the problem I had before several 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.180
 flow inputs 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:03.360
 we see how it works 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.360
 it clears very well 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.870
 we would return cardboard pencil 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.800
 the entrance or exit of entrance 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:34.720
 and the truth is that it looks amazing 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.160
 it's very good status very very good now 

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.490
 same I will say for how much has 

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.490
 stepped out 

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.930
 and little more than showing you the brake where 

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:49.300
 for writing and writing but for 

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:53.350
 I am drawing more but I have another another day 

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:57.630
 I teach you more things because nothing 

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:57.630
 here we have seen the bamboo
