a good idea the main problem though is

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.120 
a good idea the main problem though is
that<00:00:33.090> SSDs<00:00:33.780> are<00:00:33.870> relatively<00:00:34.320> expensive<00:00:34.710> so

that SSDs are relatively expensive so

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.530 
that SSDs are relatively expensive so
you'll<00:00:35.280> likely<00:00:35.550> make<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> trade-off<00:00:36.239> between

you'll be putting in a smaller drive
that's<00:00:40.350> faster<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:40.920> more<00:00:41.040> durable<00:00:41.300> before
