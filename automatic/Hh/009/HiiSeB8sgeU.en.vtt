millimeters<00:02:53.730> this<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:54.330> very<00:02:54.750> interesting

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
millimeters this is a very interesting

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.729 
millimeters this is a very interesting
shape<00:02:55.830> on<00:02:56.100> this<00:02:56.430> lens<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:57.030> bows<00:02:57.600> out<00:02:57.959> I<00:02:58.470> haven't

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
shape on this lens it bows out I haven't

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.650 
shape on this lens it bows out I haven't
seen<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:58.980> lens<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.400> bows<00:02:59.790> out<00:03:00.030> it's<00:03:00.330> got<00:03:00.510> that

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
seen a lens it bows out it's got that

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.470 
seen a lens it bows out it's got that
very<00:03:01.110> interesting<00:03:01.920> look<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.310> says<00:03:02.730> Otis<00:03:03.239> right

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
very interesting look it says Otis right

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.620 
very interesting look it says Otis right
there<00:03:03.780> 1.4<00:03:04.620> 55<00:03:05.220> millimeters<00:03:05.790> printed<00:03:06.450> in

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
there 1.4 55 millimeters printed in

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.190 
there 1.4 55 millimeters printed in
yellow<00:03:07.260> but<00:03:08.000> guess<00:03:09.000> what<00:03:09.269> this<00:03:09.390> lens<00:03:09.630> doesn't

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
yellow but guess what this lens doesn't

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.780 
yellow but guess what this lens doesn't
do<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:11.400> doesn't<00:03:12.470> autofocus<00:03:13.470> yeah<00:03:14.130> it<00:03:14.459> has

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
do it doesn't autofocus yeah it has

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.729 
do it doesn't autofocus yeah it has
these<00:03:15.060> contacts<00:03:15.630> right<00:03:15.870> here<00:03:16.140> for<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.380> Canon

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
these contacts right here for the Canon

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.319 
these contacts right here for the Canon
camera<00:03:17.070> so<00:03:17.220> that<00:03:17.340> it<00:03:17.430> could<00:03:17.580> read<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:18.120> meter

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
camera so that it could read the meter

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.390 
camera so that it could read the meter
and<00:03:18.540> everything<00:03:18.930> along<00:03:19.140> those<00:03:19.410> lines<00:03:19.680> but<00:03:20.190> it

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
and everything along those lines but it

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.580 
and everything along those lines but it
will<00:03:20.730> not<00:03:21.000> be<00:03:21.060> auto<00:03:21.540> focusing<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:22.410> that's

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
will not be auto focusing so that's

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.370 
will not be auto focusing so that's
right<00:03:22.769> it's<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:23.060> $4,000<00:03:24.060> manually<00:03:24.810> focusing

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
right it's a $4,000 manually focusing

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.259 
right it's a $4,000 manually focusing
lens<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:25.980> they<00:03:26.190> say<00:03:26.459> is<00:03:26.610> one<00:03:26.880> of<00:03:27.090> the

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
lens that they say is one of the

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.210 
lens that they say is one of the
sharpest<00:03:27.840> of<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.140> sharpest<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.709> sharpest

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
sharpest of the sharpest of sharpest

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.030 
sharpest of the sharpest of sharpest
lenses<00:03:29.340> with<00:03:29.730> honor<00:03:29.970> sir<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:30.870> smells<00:03:31.260> like

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.640 

LASIK<00:03:35.040> eye<00:03:35.220> surgery<00:03:35.750> that's<00:03:36.750> right<00:03:37.140> it<00:03:37.380> smells

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
LASIK eye surgery that's right it smells

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.620 
LASIK eye surgery that's right it smells
like<00:03:38.040> it<00:03:38.190> should<00:03:38.400> come<00:03:38.610> with<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.790> free<00:03:39.209> LASIK

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
like it should come with a free LASIK

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.810 
like it should come with a free LASIK
eye<00:03:39.750> surgery<00:03:39.780> because<00:03:40.650> you<00:03:40.829> need<00:03:41.040> lasers<00:03:41.549> to

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
eye surgery because you need lasers to

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.430 
eye surgery because you need lasers to
cut<00:03:42.060> your<00:03:42.269> eyes<00:03:42.420> so<00:03:42.780> that<00:03:42.810> they<00:03:43.049> can<00:03:43.200> be<00:03:43.320> as

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
cut your eyes so that they can be as

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.370 
cut your eyes so that they can be as
sharp<00:03:43.739> as<00:03:43.950> this<00:03:44.190> lens<00:03:44.519> yep<00:03:45.150> that's<00:03:45.989> right<00:03:46.140> and

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
sharp as this lens yep that's right and

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.930 
sharp as this lens yep that's right and
I<00:03:46.590> think<00:03:46.620> it's<00:03:46.890> more<00:03:47.040> expensive<00:03:47.190> than<00:03:47.640> LASIK

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
I think it's more expensive than LASIK

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.390 
I think it's more expensive than LASIK
eye<00:03:48.060> surgery<00:03:48.090> if<00:03:48.570> I<00:03:48.690> am<00:03:49.200> correct<00:03:49.560> so<00:03:50.130> here<00:03:50.310> it

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400
