00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
imagine how most people felt the first

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.660 
imagine how most people felt the first
time<00:00:06.930> they<00:00:07.109> heard<00:00:07.290> that<00:00:07.319> one<00:00:07.799> day<00:00:08.010> man<00:00:08.400> would

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670

be<00:00:08.790> able<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:09.059> fly<00:00:09.360> or<00:00:09.990> that<00:00:10.230> we<00:00:10.320> hope<00:00:10.469> to

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
be able to fly or that we hope to

be able to fly or that we hope to
actually<00:00:10.800> land<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.849> man<00:00:12.030> on<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.240> moon<00:00:12.269> those

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
actually land a man on the moon those

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.990

in<00:02:49.650> an<00:02:49.740> airplane<00:02:50.040> we<00:02:50.190> do<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.400> same<00:02:50.670> thing<00:02:51.000> we

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
in an airplane we do the same thing we

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.910 
in an airplane we do the same thing we
put<00:02:51.480> these<00:02:51.630> jets<00:02:51.960> inside<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.500> wing<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.800> the

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
put these jets inside the wing of the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.010 
put these jets inside the wing of the
airplane<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.670> say<00:02:54.240> for<00:02:54.420> example<00:02:54.750> we<00:02:54.840> had<00:02:54.990> a

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
airplane and say for example we had a

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.050 
airplane and say for example we had a
gust<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.500> wind<00:02:55.710> coming<00:02:56.040> into<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.400> airplane<00:02:56.880> we

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
gust of wind coming into the airplane we

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.330 
gust of wind coming into the airplane we
would<00:02:57.210> turn<00:02:57.390> on<00:02:57.570> very<00:02:58.050> specific<00:02:58.380> Jets<00:02:59.010> at<00:02:59.220> the

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
would turn on very specific Jets at the

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.970 
would turn on very specific Jets at the
right<00:02:59.580> time<00:02:59.880> at<00:03:00.210> the<00:03:00.270> right<00:03:00.360> frequency<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.800> by

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
right time at the right frequency and by

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.860 
right time at the right frequency and by
doing<00:03:02.160> so<00:03:02.310> then<00:03:02.700> we<00:03:02.790> can<00:03:02.880> adjust<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.360> airflow

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
doing so then we can adjust the airflow

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.170 
doing so then we can adjust the airflow
over<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.290> wings<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.740> the<00:03:04.800> airplane<00:03:05.180> thereby

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
over the wings of the airplane thereby

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.850 
over the wings of the airplane thereby
making<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.510> air<00:03:06.690> plane<00:03:06.930> very<00:03:07.080> stable<00:03:07.500> and

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
making the air plane very stable and

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.650 
making the air plane very stable and
comfortable<00:03:08.070> and<00:03:08.580> maneuverable<00:03:09.209> at<00:03:09.330> it<00:03:09.510> all

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
comfortable and maneuverable at it all

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.050 
comfortable and maneuverable at it all
flight<00:03:09.930> conditions<00:03:10.440> we<00:03:11.010> also<00:03:11.220> want<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.850> be

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
flight conditions we also want to be

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.449 
flight conditions we also want to be
able<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.360> mimic<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.900> pooris<00:03:13.470> inside<00:03:14.040> section

able to mimic the pooris inside section

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.000 
able to mimic the pooris inside section
of<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.820> bird<00:03:15.090> bone<00:03:15.390> because<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.290> course<00:03:16.590> inside

section<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.610> lightweight<00:03:18.120> but<00:03:18.570> it<00:03:18.660> adds<00:03:18.930> extra

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
section is lightweight but it adds extra

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.580 
section is lightweight but it adds extra
strength<00:03:19.950> we<00:03:20.820> do<00:03:21.060> that<00:03:21.330> by<00:03:21.840> using<00:03:21.870> what<00:03:22.560> are

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
strength we do that by using what are

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.520 
strength we do that by using what are
called<00:03:22.680> tiny<00:03:23.360> microspheres<00:03:24.360> you<00:03:25.230> would<00:03:25.350> take

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
called tiny microspheres you would take

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.550 
called tiny microspheres you would take
these<00:03:25.739> microspheres<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.970> actually<00:03:27.930> inject

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
these microspheres and actually inject

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.890 
these microspheres and actually inject
them<00:03:28.739> into<00:03:28.770> a<00:03:29.010> composite<00:03:29.610> material<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:30.390> once

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
them into a composite material and once

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.360 
them into a composite material and once
we<00:03:31.050> inject<00:03:31.380> them<00:03:31.530> then<00:03:31.680> we<00:03:31.770> would<00:03:31.890> use<00:03:32.070> heat<00:03:32.340> to

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
we inject them then we would use heat to

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.970 
we inject them then we would use heat to
fuse<00:03:32.850> them<00:03:33.120> together<00:03:33.360> so<00:03:34.320> therefore<00:03:34.739> we<00:03:34.830> could

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
fuse them together so therefore we could

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.520 
fuse them together so therefore we could
achieve<00:03:35.070> a<00:03:35.640> lightweight<00:03:36.510> structure<00:03:37.110> that<00:03:37.380> is

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
achieve a lightweight structure that is

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.620 
achieve a lightweight structure that is
also<00:03:37.770> very<00:03:37.980> strong<00:03:38.610> which<00:03:38.880> is<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.090> same<00:03:39.360> thing

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
also very strong which is the same thing

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.660 
also very strong which is the same thing
that<00:03:39.660> birds<00:03:40.020> use<00:03:40.260> when<00:03:40.440> they<00:03:40.530> fly<00:03:40.800> and<00:03:41.280> it

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
that birds use when they fly and it

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
over the wings of an airplane if you

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.420 
over the wings of an airplane if you
look<00:04:01.170> at<00:04:01.290> charts<00:04:01.650> skin<00:04:01.920> under<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.220> microscope

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.220 
look at charts skin under a microscope
you'll<00:04:03.060> actually<00:04:03.209> see<00:04:03.510> a<00:04:03.540> bunch<00:04:03.900> of<00:04:03.989> little

so<00:04:05.690> our<00:04:05.840> hope<00:04:06.080> at<00:04:06.290> NASA<00:04:06.500> Langley<00:04:06.680> is<00:04:07.220> that

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
so our hope at NASA Langley is that

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:08.979 
so our hope at NASA Langley is that
perhaps<00:04:07.700> our<00:04:08.000> material<00:04:08.390> scientists<00:04:08.870> can

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
perhaps our material scientists can

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.589 
perhaps our material scientists can
create<00:04:09.409> the<00:04:09.920> same<00:04:10.190> groove<00:04:10.519> like<00:04:10.819> material<00:04:11.450> we

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
create the same groove like material we

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.210 
create the same groove like material we
can<00:04:11.659> apply<00:04:11.930> that<00:04:12.140> to<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.379> skin<00:04:12.590> of<00:04:12.709> airplanes

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
can apply that to the skin of airplanes

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.940 
can apply that to the skin of airplanes
and<00:04:13.430> make<00:04:13.970> them<00:04:14.150> much<00:04:14.360> better<00:04:14.569> fliers<00:04:15.110> we're

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
and make them much better fliers we're

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.340 
and make them much better fliers we're
also<00:04:16.100> looking<00:04:16.400> at<00:04:16.760> flapping<00:04:17.510> wing<00:04:17.750> airplanes

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
also looking at flapping wing airplanes

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.530 
also looking at flapping wing airplanes
believe<00:04:18.739> it<00:04:18.889> or<00:04:18.979> not<00:04:19.160> this<00:04:19.729> design<00:04:20.269> was

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
believe it or not this design was

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.330 
believe it or not this design was
inspired<00:04:20.720> by<00:04:21.260> the<00:04:21.320> wings<00:04:21.650> of<00:04:21.829> a<00:04:21.889> hummingbird

actually use what are called smart or

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.189 
actually use what are called smart or
active<00:04:43.220> materials<00:04:43.820> instead<00:04:44.510> of<00:04:44.660> using<00:04:45.080> an

were<00:04:58.940> a<00:04:58.970> common<00:04:59.449> one<00:04:59.630> that<00:04:59.660> we've<00:04:59.870> just

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
were a common one that we've just

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.590 
were a common one that we've just
developed<00:05:00.380> is<00:05:00.919> called<00:05:01.220> a<00:05:01.400> macro<00:05:02.090> fiber

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
developed is called a macro fiber

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.290 
developed is called a macro fiber

works<00:05:05.539> by<00:05:05.930> the<00:05:06.470> apply<00:05:06.740> electricity<00:05:07.400> to<00:05:07.580> it<00:05:07.729> it

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
works by the apply electricity to it it

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.610 
works by the apply electricity to it it
will<00:05:08.000> move<00:05:08.240> in<00:05:08.600> the<00:05:08.660> direction<00:05:08.690> you'd<00:05:09.260> like<00:05:09.440> it

will move in the direction you'd like it
to<00:05:09.740> move<00:05:09.919> so<00:05:10.490> what<00:05:10.610> we<00:05:10.700> would<00:05:10.820> do<00:05:11.000> is<00:05:11.150> homemade

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
to move so what we would do is homemade

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.080 
to move so what we would do is homemade
here<00:05:12.020> this<00:05:12.320> or<00:05:12.919> if<00:05:13.220> you<00:05:13.310> were<00:05:13.430> embedded<00:05:13.940> inside

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
here this or if you were embedded inside

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.170 
here this or if you were embedded inside
an<00:05:14.750> airplane<00:05:15.289> wing<00:05:15.530> what<00:05:16.130> a<00:05:16.160> tails<00:05:16.610> of<00:05:17.030> a

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
an airplane wing what a tails of a

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.279 
an airplane wing what a tails of a
fighter<00:05:17.419> airplane<00:05:17.930> it<00:05:18.080> would<00:05:18.169> actually

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
fighter airplane it would actually

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.800 
fighter airplane it would actually
absorb<00:05:18.740> the<00:05:18.889> vibration<00:05:19.520> as<00:05:20.000> a<00:05:20.060> consumer<00:05:20.690> you

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
absorb the vibration as a consumer you

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.360 
absorb the vibration as a consumer you
can<00:05:20.960> put<00:05:21.139> these<00:05:21.260> on<00:05:21.440> your<00:05:21.560> washing<00:05:21.770> machine<00:05:21.950> to

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
can put these on your washing machine to

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.219 
can put these on your washing machine to
absorb<00:05:22.700> vibration<00:05:23.330> you<00:05:23.630> can<00:05:23.780> put<00:05:23.930> it<00:05:24.020> in<00:05:24.110> your

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
absorb vibration you can put it in your

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.620 
absorb vibration you can put it in your
cars<00:05:24.530> you<00:05:25.099> can<00:05:25.250> even<00:05:25.400> use<00:05:25.610> it<00:05:25.639> to<00:05:25.789> absorb<00:05:26.180> sound

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
cars you can even use it to absorb sound

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.930 
cars you can even use it to absorb sound
so<00:05:27.289> we<00:05:27.440> think<00:05:27.800> that<00:05:27.950> basic<00:05:28.250> materials<00:05:28.669> like

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
so we think that basic materials like

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.400 
so we think that basic materials like
this<00:05:29.180> one<00:05:29.450> are<00:05:29.870> really<00:05:30.200> going<00:05:30.320> to

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
this one are really going to

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.200 
this one are really going to
revolutionize<00:05:30.590> how<00:05:31.099> we<00:05:31.370> build<00:05:31.700> things<00:05:31.970> in<00:05:32.150> the

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
revolutionize how we build things in the

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.210 
revolutionize how we build things in the
future<00:05:32.690> we're<00:05:33.320> also<00:05:33.440> looking<00:05:33.710> at<00:05:33.889> a<00:05:34.010> material

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
future we're also looking at a material

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.250 
future we're also looking at a material
called<00:05:34.550> a<00:05:34.639> shape<00:05:34.940> memory<00:05:35.150> alloy<00:05:35.630> you<00:05:36.139> would

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
called a shape memory alloy you would

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.930 
called a shape memory alloy you would
use<00:05:36.440> this<00:05:36.590> material<00:05:36.770> to<00:05:37.099> bend<00:05:37.490> and<00:05:37.729> twist

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
use this material to bend and twist

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.689 
use this material to bend and twist
airplane<00:05:38.630> wings<00:05:38.900> now<00:05:39.830> you<00:05:40.310> might<00:05:40.460> want<00:05:40.639> to

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 
airplane wings now you might want to

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:42.219 
airplane wings now you might want to
probably<00:05:40.820> want<00:05:41.090> to<00:05:41.120> do<00:05:41.270> that<00:05:41.300> kind<00:05:41.630> of<00:05:41.690> thing

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
probably want to do that kind of thing

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:44.650 
probably want to do that kind of thing
well<00:05:42.410> birds<00:05:43.039> also<00:05:43.669> bend<00:05:43.970> and<00:05:44.240> twist<00:05:44.360> their

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
well birds also bend and twist their

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.170 
well birds also bend and twist their
wings<00:05:44.900> and<00:05:45.139> flight<00:05:45.590> now<00:05:46.340> being<00:05:46.580> able<00:05:46.729> to<00:05:46.970> bend

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
wings and flight now being able to bend

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.150 
wings and flight now being able to bend
and<00:05:47.389> twist<00:05:47.570> airplane<00:05:48.410> wings<00:05:48.650> is<00:05:48.830> really

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
and twist airplane wings is really

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.980 
and twist airplane wings is really
difficult<00:05:49.669> because<00:05:49.789> airplane<00:05:50.360> wings<00:05:50.599> tend<00:05:50.930> to

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
difficult because airplane wings tend to

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.279 
difficult because airplane wings tend to
be<00:05:51.110> very<00:05:51.620> stiff<00:05:52.250> if<00:05:53.180> you<00:05:53.270> bend<00:05:53.539> this<00:05:53.690> material

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
be very stiff if you bend this material

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:56.260 
be very stiff if you bend this material
the<00:05:54.380> shape-memory<00:05:54.680> alloy<00:05:55.370> it<00:05:55.880> will<00:05:56.060> actually

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
the shape-memory alloy it will actually

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.480 
the shape-memory alloy it will actually
go<00:05:56.539> back<00:05:56.750> to<00:05:56.930> its<00:05:57.050> original<00:05:57.169> shape<00:05:57.680> so<00:05:58.310> if<00:05:58.400> you

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
go back to its original shape so if you

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.010 
go back to its original shape so if you
bend<00:05:58.699> this<00:05:58.910> I'll<00:05:59.120> show<00:05:59.419> you<00:05:59.479> what<00:05:59.750> it<00:05:59.840> looks

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
bend this I'll show you what it looks

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.089 
bend this I'll show you what it looks
like

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:01.099 
like

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:03.770 
like
then<00:06:02.099> I'm<00:06:02.250> going<00:06:02.400> to<00:06:02.460> apply<00:06:02.699> this<00:06:03.090> lighter<00:06:03.449> to

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
then I'm going to apply this lighter to

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.779 
then I'm going to apply this lighter to
it<00:06:03.930> and<00:06:04.199> you<00:06:04.289> can<00:06:04.409> watch<00:06:04.590> it<00:06:04.650> go<00:06:05.190> back<00:06:05.400> to<00:06:05.639> its

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
it and you can watch it go back to its

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:09.140 
it and you can watch it go back to its
original<00:06:05.879> shape<00:06:07.370> now<00:06:08.370> this<00:06:08.550> simple<00:06:08.819> little

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
original shape now this simple little

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.230 
original shape now this simple little
material<00:06:09.449> can<00:06:10.199> pull<00:06:10.409> around<00:06:10.580> 700<00:06:11.580> pounds

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
material can pull around 700 pounds

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.879 
material can pull around 700 pounds
so<00:06:12.509> I<00:06:12.539> placing<00:06:13.020> a<00:06:13.080> couple<00:06:13.289> of<00:06:13.530> these<00:06:13.620> in<00:06:13.800> an

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
so I placing a couple of these in an

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.309 
so I placing a couple of these in an
airplane<00:06:14.220> wing<00:06:14.550> we<00:06:15.270> can<00:06:15.509> make<00:06:15.960> the<00:06:16.080> airplane

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.319 
airplane wing we can make the airplane

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:19.100 
airplane wing we can make the airplane
bend<00:06:16.650> or<00:06:16.800> twist<00:06:16.940> we<00:06:17.940> hope<00:06:18.120> that<00:06:18.360> by<00:06:18.599> flying

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
bend or twist we hope that by flying

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.809 
bend or twist we hope that by flying
more<00:06:19.349> like<00:06:19.440> a<00:06:19.470> bird<00:06:19.770> does<00:06:20.039> we<00:06:20.220> can<00:06:20.340> save<00:06:20.580> a<00:06:20.759> lot

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:20.819 
more like a bird does we can save a lot

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:23.510 
more like a bird does we can save a lot
of<00:06:21.330> money<00:06:21.539> on<00:06:21.750> fuel<00:06:22.110> as<00:06:22.620> well<00:06:22.889> as<00:06:22.949> reduce<00:06:23.370> the

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
of money on fuel as well as reduce the

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.219 
of money on fuel as well as reduce the
complexity<00:06:24.180> of<00:06:24.210> the<00:06:24.330> mechanisms<00:06:24.930> within<00:06:25.110> the

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:25.229 
complexity of the mechanisms within the

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.230 
complexity of the mechanisms within the
airplane<00:06:25.620> wing<00:06:25.830> so<00:06:26.490> we're<00:06:26.580> using<00:06:26.729> a<00:06:26.909> lot<00:06:27.060> of

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
airplane wing so we're using a lot of

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.300 
airplane wing so we're using a lot of
these<00:06:27.330> biologically<00:06:27.990> inspired<00:06:28.310> materials

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
these biologically inspired materials

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.909 
these biologically inspired materials
and<00:06:29.580> technologies<00:06:30.360> to<00:06:30.750> make<00:06:31.199> aircraft<00:06:31.710> and

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
and technologies to make aircraft and

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:35.930 
and technologies to make aircraft and
spacecraft<00:06:32.159> a<00:06:32.819> lot<00:06:33.210> safer<00:06:33.479> to<00:06:33.690> fly
