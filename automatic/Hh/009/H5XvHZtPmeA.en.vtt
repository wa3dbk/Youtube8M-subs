00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.839
 now we are going to tell you now what 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:07.779
 that we have titled as myth or reality 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:09.940
 it is not a custom an old tradition 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.459
 that many families conserve and we are 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.770
 talking about rue tea more precisely something 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.990
 that despite modern times a 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.180
 Although the same disbelief 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.190
 maintains and transmits from generation to 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.100
 generation when a girl my grandfather 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.920
 all the first from August to the morning 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.520
 I was not sure why but it was good 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.520
 some cheerful 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.470
 some say to live a little longer 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.500
 others to be healthy 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.149
 heat the wonderful there are many 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.510
 versions actually of why the 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.820
 people are leaning for this good you 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.920
 is your house should surely talk 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.809
 this topic and many are going to prepare 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.940
 go out and look because not everyone wants 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.590
 of macho the time inside some 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.480
 people in the back of your house you have 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.579
 the little plant others do not but want 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.290
 take it and have to go out to a field 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.500
 good beyond what are the 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.940
 beliefs and we're going to tell you in this 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.970
 note too 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.470
 the benefits that this male rude 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.710
 they also have to be the most benefit 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.710
 there 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.920
 actually the rue 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.870
 it is something very particular not only in 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.230
 our province but it was in the 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.840
 country because it's a tradition 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.470
 that curiously is not Argentina because 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.480
 the ruda brings it the Spaniards from the east 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.660
 the rue is not a plant that was born 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.500
 here in the country they bring them from the east and 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.500
 good I know 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.390
 it spreads throughout the country more than anything 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.370
 by the Argentine north that is an area 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.070
 where we related to the 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:54.730
 pachamama with everything else the rue is 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.670
 something important for folklore I do not 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.480
 success and the tradition of our 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.790
 our town 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.290
 who are the ones who buy the most 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.210
 large people the elderly 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.360
 they already know and know and young people 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.789
 they also come and curiously 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.780
 and it's a curious thing to see not only 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.690
 on wheels but in all 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.210
 natural products young people are 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.740
 is very close to this because 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.260
 a whole move not only in the matter 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.930
 of good nutrition health that is 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.270
 related to natural products 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.190
 call yourself herbs or 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.380
 and products made with natural herbs 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.360
 specifically with what it has to do 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.190
 with the terrassa they started to buy 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.470
 surely until the same day first 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.860
 August to follow 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:42.590
 we mean is one is a way 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.270
 to think if we had opened 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.340
 from the first of August from 6 in the 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.020
 am to 10 pm 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.230
 surely they will continue buying all 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.940
 the wrinkle to make you undoubtedly people 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.000
 get closer which is equal and 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.490
 He also comes and they have tea here and he 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.590
 Arman talk of people who 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.150
 here they are taking rough carvings 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.920
 says that you have to take it fasting but 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.050
 the people out there take it to any 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.280
 time to not let the faith pass clear and 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.840
 more those who have lost a bit of 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.370
 memory to take any moment of the 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.370
 day is also worth also worth 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.489
 marc there was the clarification because the 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.920
 tradition says that you have to take it in 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.319
 fasting or saying before breakfast 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.689
 you have to take 1 sips some say 3 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.819
 but we present in some details that 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:26.379
 of course and surely everyone 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.629
 it has its presumption but of all 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.810
 ways you have to take it before the 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:34.829
 breakfast 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.840
 we actually have 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:45.120
 in these years of so much technology 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:47.650
 tablet smartphone and everything is you 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.250
 a co- worker who waits for us 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.250
 with tenderness
