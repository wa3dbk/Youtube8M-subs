 hello welcome to negrÃ­n is if you want 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.380
 know how to make these nails with 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.450
 newspaper stamping I am the 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.700
 looking 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.220
 Newsprint will need a 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.900
 scissors top coat a clear enamel that 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.600
 cover the nail a container in which 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.490
 fit our fingers and alcohol 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.740
 we cut newspaper 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.570
 preferred in strips so that later we 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.720
 it's easier to take references and be able 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.370
 place the remains besides they must 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.440
 be manageable so it's convenient 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.150
 do not make them very big but yes 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.140
 wide enough to cover the 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.300
 a 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.580
 certainly the more pigmented they are 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.580
 the letters will better transfer the ink 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.760
 we paint the nail with the base color 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.920
 chosen dollar in gray like own 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.840
 paper but it can be cream white 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.040
 pink or any color that covers but 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.670
 that allows then see the ink 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.670
 transferred 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.700
 probably to get a good 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.680
 coverage we will have to apply another layer and 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.390
 this will have to be left to dry very very 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.390
 well to be able to do the design 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.760
 in our container we put alcohol 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.400
 up to a height that manages to cover the 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.120
 nail the smaller the less alcohol 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.120
 we will waste 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.030
 we introduce the nail and we wait 5 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.100
 seconds if you wait much longer or you have not 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.229
 let dry the enamel this is 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.229
 will melt our fingers 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.659
 and we place the newspaper on 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.610
 the nail as straight as possible to the 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.229
 transfer it we press with fingers 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.840
 on all surfaces without moving the 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.820
 will leave you blurred and done this 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.689
 we remove the paper quickly so that 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.689
 does not stick the nail 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.120
 with the brush well wet and loosely 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.010
 so that we do not drag the ink we apply 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.010
 top coat to protect the design 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.260
 our newspaper paper nails 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.260
 finished until next time
