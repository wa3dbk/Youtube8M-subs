00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.700
 Welcome to the next wow gold guide 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.170
 This time we are in the Kremlin to exactly 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.790
 its the high tones 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.410
 you are here on the map and 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.120
 it's about us actually 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:21.830
 just those little critters 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:23.880
 blow away and luton off but you should 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.769
 bring along the drinks of happiness 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.750
 Conceptless ten to twenty gold 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:34.320
 buy the then take and then this 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.700
 snow cover this year to go 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.710
 be really many of these little ones 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.550
 come and you brush the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.520
 just gone and after that was this 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.170
 then, for one thing, they drop relatively 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.820
 a lot of green crÃªpes what they disenchant 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.379
 can and can sell the dust or 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.660
 directly in the action house or also at the npc 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.039
 and on the other still found treasure chest 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.730
 but I just no words because I 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.399
 you open it 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.890
 in this treasure chest is five gold 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:07.320
 and always according to doctors 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.080
 example here you can see the animal i 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.150
 around ore and two white sterile march that 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.610
 otherwise I have two treasure boxes so 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.330
 in one is about four to five 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.140
 bring doctors 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.640
 I have a perfect one, for example 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.670
 team ok because it only ball inside the 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.520
 is stupid but probably understands the principle 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.479
 and then there is still such a thing 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.070
 Schatzkisten just stand on the edge 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.170
 here is opened right there are always 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.030
 100 gold in there but it is very rare 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.680
 I just found only one 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.900
 I have unfortunately been wearing nothing 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.619
 and maybe I'll find one more 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:47.000
 well as I said here you will find green 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:50.450
 crÃªpes treasure chests doctors and there still 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.220
 wind wool fabric and harmonious particles 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.490
 that's a really good spot and before 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.420
 all because they are several of these 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.420
 Snow covers are several spots 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.560
 when we come back to a patient 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.760
 but should be good or much 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.110
 Somehow bring something like that because 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.920
 you already press a lot if you like that 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.920
 many has and politics until slower 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:29.810
 so made about 7000 gold in the 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:31.400
 hour and that's pretty good 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.350
 because he is at the area 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.300
 capital and above all is total 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.840
 you just do not need them 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.459
 requirements is just 90 and 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.130
 job or so does not need so synonymous 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.530
 that really a really easy way around 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.790
 fast gold we get one again 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:54.860
 treasure chest and here again a green one 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:58.390
 tal treasure chest open and here five 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.069
 goldwind woolen fabric and spirits iron ore 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.350
 I found big wheel 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.829
 Of course you will, of course, here the 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.690

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.829
