all<00:00:04.310> right<00:00:08.680> and<00:00:09.680> our<00:00:11.260> excavator<00:00:13.030> parts<00:00:19.390> in<00:00:20.390> the

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
all right and our excavator parts in the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.690 
all right and our excavator parts in the
battery<00:00:20.840> has<00:00:20.870> a<00:00:21.050> motorway<00:00:21.440> it's<00:00:21.680> in<00:00:21.830> the<00:00:21.950> back

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:22.700 
battery has a motorway it's in the back

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.910 
battery has a motorway it's in the back
we<00:00:22.910> have<00:00:23.120> a<00:00:23.150> scene<00:00:23.450> that's<00:00:23.480> made<00:00:23.870> out<00:00:23.900> of<00:00:24.050> wood

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
we have a scene that's made out of wood

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.610 
we have a scene that's made out of wood
corrugated<00:00:25.730> wood<00:00:26.060> so<00:00:26.720> it<00:00:26.840> really<00:00:27.020> allows<00:00:27.410> for

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:27.620 
corrugated wood so it really allows for

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.930 
corrugated wood so it really allows for
some<00:00:27.740> flexibility

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:30.940 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:47.880 

a<00:00:35.610> lot<00:00:36.610> of<00:00:36.640> cars<00:00:36.970> are<00:00:37.180> going<00:00:37.270> electrical

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.150 

in<00:00:48.010> charge<00:00:48.399> of<00:00:48.489> the<00:00:48.640> earth

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
in charge of the earth

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.910 
in charge of the earth
excavator<00:00:51.030> no

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.660 

we<00:00:55.399> working<00:00:55.760> brother

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
we working brother

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.250 
we working brother
those<00:00:57.149> really<00:00:57.480> long<00:00:57.629> shot<00:00:57.899> regions

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
those really long shot regions

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.400 
those really long shot regions
that's<00:00:59.829> the<00:00:59.949> good<00:01:00.070> of<00:01:00.129> machinery

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
that's the good of machinery

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.479 
that's the good of machinery
we<00:01:01.740> think<00:01:01.980> there's<00:01:02.130> going<00:01:02.220> to<00:01:02.310> be<00:01:02.340> two

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
we think there's going to be two

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.220 
we think there's going to be two
scenarios<00:01:02.760> there's<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.600> scenario<00:01:03.989> where<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.230 
scenarios there's a scenario where the

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.590 
scenarios there's a scenario where the
machine<00:01:04.500> will<00:01:04.680> really<00:01:04.920> work

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.170 

metric<00:01:09.110> bikes<00:01:09.290> indian<00:01:09.650> removal

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
metric bikes indian removal

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.970 
metric bikes indian removal
and<00:01:11.330> there's<00:01:11.540> also<00:01:11.690> the<00:01:11.870> fact<00:01:11.990> that

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:21.200 

into<00:01:15.980> a<00:01:16.010> generator

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.820 

what<00:01:21.780> would<00:01:21.870> that<00:01:21.960> cord<00:01:22.260> look<00:01:22.440> like<00:01:22.620> what<00:01:22.799> it

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
what would that cord look like what it

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.710 
what would that cord look like what it
would<00:01:23.070> lie<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.610> ground<00:01:23.790> or<00:01:24.180> how<00:01:24.510> would<00:01:24.630> you

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
would lie on the ground or how would you

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.120 
would lie on the ground or how would you
guys<00:01:24.840> kind<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.140> make<00:01:25.350> sure<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> Machine<00:01:25.920> kind

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
guys kind of make sure the Machine kind

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.380 
guys kind of make sure the Machine kind
of<00:01:26.190> avoids<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:28.369> bat<00:01:29.369> without<00:01:29.729> displaying<00:01:30.119> its

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
of avoids a bat without displaying its

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.220 
of avoids a bat without displaying its
but<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.050> deep<00:01:31.229> pretty<00:01:31.470> much<00:01:31.650> like

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
but it's in deep pretty much like

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.020 
but it's in deep pretty much like
like<00:01:33.470> you<00:01:33.560> notice<00:01:33.800> cause<00:01:34.070> those<00:01:34.820> cars

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
like you notice cause those cars

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.450 
like you notice cause those cars
right<00:01:35.330> oh<00:01:35.480> okay<00:01:35.840> from<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.140> top<00:01:36.170> great<00:01:37.010> okay

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
right oh okay from the top great okay

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.260 
right oh okay from the top great okay
cool<00:01:37.820> cool<00:01:39.610> think<00:01:40.610> some<00:01:40.790> people<00:01:41.060> might<00:01:41.090> think

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
cool cool think some people might think

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.180 
cool cool think some people might think
it's<00:01:41.600> scary<00:01:41.810> but<00:01:42.050> it's<00:01:42.230> actually<00:01:42.500> not<00:01:42.860> scary

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
it's scary but it's actually not scary

particular it's who is that is offended

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.710 
particular it's who is that is offended
in<00:01:55.460> both<00:01:55.640> direction<00:01:55.820> in<00:01:56.270> both<00:01:56.450> in<00:01:56.600> that

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
in both direction in both in that

direction in this direction so because
of<00:01:59.090> that<00:01:59.240> is<00:01:59.450> extremely<00:01:59.840> strong<00:02:00.070> we<00:02:01.070> have

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.719 

corrugated<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.930> lot<00:02:08.080> of<00:02:08.170> Frank

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
corrugated a lot of Frank

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.410 
corrugated a lot of Frank
we're<00:02:10.060> using<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.450> natural

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
we're using the natural

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.170 
we're using the natural
all<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.380> mechanical<00:02:13.860> parts

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.860 

we<00:02:19.420> tested<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:20.019> up<00:02:20.349> to<00:02:20.439> 300<00:02:20.829> kilos<00:02:21.129> and<00:02:21.870> it's

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
we tested it up to 300 kilos and it's

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.929 
we tested it up to 300 kilos and it's
been<00:02:22.989> holding<00:02:23.260> fairly<00:02:23.680> well<00:02:23.799> but<00:02:24.069> you<00:02:24.849> know

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:24.939 
been holding fairly well but you know

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:27.149 
been holding fairly well but you know
once<00:02:25.090> again<00:02:25.359> it's<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.569> vision<00:02:25.870> so<00:02:26.170> whether<00:02:26.980> it's

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
once again it's a vision so whether it's

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.920 
once again it's a vision so whether it's
a<00:02:27.219> good<00:02:27.370> idea<00:02:27.489> or<00:02:27.670> not<00:02:27.760> we<00:02:28.569> don't<00:02:28.689> know

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.890 

absolutely<00:02:31.769> okay<00:02:32.040> now<00:02:32.370> you're<00:02:32.549> holding<00:02:32.900> the

absolutely okay now you're holding the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.929 
absolutely okay now you're holding the

are gone to HMI is that correct exactly

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.920 
are gone to HMI is that correct exactly
the<00:02:38.129> remote<00:02:38.549> control<00:02:38.909> yeah<00:02:39.209> so<00:02:39.510> talk<00:02:39.719> to<00:02:39.840> talk

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
the remote control yeah so talk to talk

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.420 
the remote control yeah so talk to talk
a<00:02:39.959> little<00:02:40.049> bit<00:02:40.230> about<00:02:40.379> that<00:02:40.620> absolutely<00:02:41.219> so

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
a little bit about that absolutely so

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.949 
a little bit about that absolutely so
actually<00:02:41.819> this<00:02:41.909> one<00:02:42.090> is<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.239> mock-up<00:02:42.599> on<00:02:42.780> its

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
actually this one is a mock-up on its

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.050 
actually this one is a mock-up on its
right<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:44.010> saw<00:02:44.159> the<00:02:44.219> functionality<00:02:44.879> and<00:02:44.939> the

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
right you saw the functionality and the

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.080 
right you saw the functionality and the
ipad<00:02:45.359> earlier<00:02:45.689> exactly<00:02:46.230> in<00:02:47.040> reality<00:02:47.280> when<00:02:47.909> we

ipad earlier exactly in reality when we

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.240 
ipad earlier exactly in reality when we
have<00:02:48.239> it<00:02:48.389> behind<00:02:48.689> you<00:02:48.810> it's<00:02:49.319> it's<00:02:49.739> it's<00:02:50.069> an

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.860 
oled screen it's transparent and it's
tactile<00:02:52.920> so<00:02:53.909> we<00:02:54.329> had<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.659> made<00:02:55.519> it's<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:56.639> one-off

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
tactile so we had it made it's a one-off

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.240 
tactile so we had it made it's a one-off
okay<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:57.930> that's<00:02:58.200> why<00:02:58.290> we<00:02:58.319> can<00:02:58.590> really<00:02:58.889> use<00:02:59.069> it

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
okay so that's why we can really use it

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.610 
okay so that's why we can really use it
and<00:02:59.969> and<00:03:00.780> we<00:03:01.109> really<00:03:01.349> think<00:03:01.500> that

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
and and we really think that

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.229 
and and we really think that
transparency<00:03:02.219> is<00:03:02.430> probably<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.879> next<00:03:03.000> thing

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
transparency is probably the next thing

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.970 
transparency is probably the next thing
there's<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.810> augmented<00:03:04.260> reality<00:03:04.650> correct

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
there's the augmented reality correct

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.470 
there's the augmented reality correct
yeah<00:03:05.159> exactly<00:03:05.370> being<00:03:05.700> able<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.090> kind<00:03:06.419> of

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
yeah exactly being able to kind of

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.319 
yeah exactly being able to kind of
envision<00:03:07.260> what<00:03:07.530> could<00:03:07.889> happen<00:03:08.239> before<00:03:09.239> it

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
envision what could happen before it

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:10.819 
envision what could happen before it
actually<00:03:09.450> has<00:03:09.780> right<00:03:10.169> and<00:03:10.349> all<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.620> other
