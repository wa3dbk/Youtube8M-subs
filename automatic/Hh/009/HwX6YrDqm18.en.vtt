00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.620
 hello today we are here to learn to 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:10.070
 make this pretty 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.379
 well to do 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.379
 We are going to need scissors 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.010
 a glue a glue track 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.010
 tongs 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.939
 iron the thicker the better because 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:29.939
 this way we avoid that we do damage 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.939
 pearls 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.660
 And cough 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.079
 crystallitos what we have at home in 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.079
 decoration plan and a bit of 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:46.300
 so let's start first we cut 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:50.260
 the thread 45 centimeters and we're going 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:54.640
 forming a circle ring with a 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:58.750
 knot try to make the knot the more 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.239
 smooth better and if you are with children 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.629
 The thicker the thread, the better 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:08.789
 because it avoids damage to do 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.789
 like a scratch 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.340
 and on the fingers with the pincers 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.380
 The more malleable and thick the 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.530
 best ring 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.770
 when we have done it 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.400
 we went to 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.540
 what 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.210
 the decoration of the girl 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.820
 try to make the ring a bit 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.970
 loose that we go very just because 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.720
 at the time of decorating it will leave room 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.720
 to 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.970
 being fine do it finish it 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:49.399
 give it a good finish here I have a few 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:52.549
 as many examples of decorations and for 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.890
 that we need 6 pearls of one color and 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.799
 one that is different color or a 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.050
 landmark crystal or a pebble what 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.320
 now it is and what you want 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.480
 to start the decoration I usually use 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.160
 a piece of cloth cut it on a 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:12.350
 circulito because I use that because because 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.080
 fall if I drop the ring many 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.780
 several times before using the plaster 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.430
 they released the pearls but since I use 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:25.810
 the fabric is made that no matter how much 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.810
 I fell 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.270
 the ring the pearls are not released 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.900
 what 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.900
 age 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:44.480
 well let's put the 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:47.420
 pearlite of different color in the middle 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.170
 of the fabric and little by little we are adding 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.750
 the pearls that are the same color 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.690
 both the central pearl and the fabric 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.260
 because this way we give more fixation and we 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.840
 We make sure that you do not let go of 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.269
 put the beads in such a way that the 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.519
 holes that are a little 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.590
 unaesthetic unite with holes 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.280
 the next pearl that is in 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:17.290
 laterals in 3-d outwards so the 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.290
 ring is much more aesthetic 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.490
 much more professional I almost have it 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:28.240
 so I advise you if you are with children 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:31.180
 do not let them use the glue and if they are 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.520
 very tiny because many times in 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.879
 instead of making a ring we end up with 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.920
 having 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:40.620
 glue everywhere 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.930
 that they hurt themselves in this case the 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.480
 gun that he used what he does is warm up 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.180
 the then clear glue could be 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.250
 make wounds when you have the ring and 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.019
 has made the decoration leave it a 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.970
 minute to dry and cool the 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:58.300
 glue and 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.400
 what we want to do is cut a 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:06.200
 piece of cloth 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:11.329
 and stick it to the ring in the bullet part of the 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:14.989
 ring like that that makes us as much as that 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:19.280
 it helps us so much as to cover the part 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:23.210
 ugly and also to protect the skin 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.610
 because the pieces of iron on weekends 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.789
 often they tend to ryan 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.800
 scratch then with this we get that 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.979
 let's not hurt ourselves I hope that I have 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.979
 liked 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.389
 nothing awaits you in the next tutorial a 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.389
 big kiss
