00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.520
 I recently had a PS4 and I played 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.230
 so directly there a lot of fifa 15 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.070
 yes there are 11 minutes and it says 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.139
 one one 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.910
 that's how you do it well i thought i'm going 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.070
 what else do i go fifa ultimate team 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.350
 m doing it after all, but poor packaging 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.510
 that doesn't matter when we went 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.890
 went on to win and I too cm 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.810
 and it went really well 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:32.360
 let's pause for a moment at one thing 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:34.760
 ok my team spirit was 32 that is not 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.170
 so very high okay so not all my purple 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.309
 arrive like that 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.019
 but of course that is not allowed because I 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.549
 have a good defense so they will 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:45.110
 probably not leave him any holes 

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:48.650
 fall because 3 because something with it 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.309
 oh oh oh my fucking 20 minutes and extra 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.610
 2 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.339
 oh hi i am really disappointed what is 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.900
 wrong with this defense man 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.299
 but don't be afraid here comes a man 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.729
 who can do everything i have secret weapon that is 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:04.280
 mustamu look so fast he is super fast 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:06.619
 those PCs so fast and go from kick-off 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.450
 kick off immediately to the goal and 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.250
 shoot and the 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.740
 yes that shoot is a little less yes that is 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.930
 a pity but that does not mean of course 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.440
 that we take the specified opponent 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.510
 out and soon I know through really one here 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.280
 lucky way to intercept the ball and 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.050
 then it will happen 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.990
 yes then the construction is going to happen 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.300
 stage young mayer paired with easter back 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.820
 for oil in white stitch on mustamu 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.820
 save and step a star 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.899
 the 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:45.299
 and so we quickly returned to 2 2 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.789
 tie but it didn't stop there 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.770
 We are currently in the 28th minute 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.079
 the opponent takes out and I am 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.579
 just not that good okay he 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.229
 comes through the opponent 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.360
 for some reason 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.819
 the fly something 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:08.129
 one minute later one minute later 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:09.269
 seriously what a disappointment but me 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.709
 this would of course not be lawful 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.590
 if I do not pick something else or 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.510
 sometimes happens through a few purple games 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.970
 we immediately got the ball back 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.950
 mass and had to perform saga through as well 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.500
 wifi stab bosses by everyone one 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.620
 moussa shoots and he scores another 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.890
 minute late this is just 3 fucking 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.329
 goal in four me great and so it stands 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.560
 the weather is right in a real treat 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:35.010
 only to win this competition 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.769
 to go to Division 9 and we stay 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.569
 actually doing well 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.250
 we keep playing well, we stay a lot 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.900
 balls to the creatures here we 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.680
 intercept the paul and 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.810
 oil leak some work the bow and olivia 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.859
 pore officers so bad it is not 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.060
 more normal 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.310
 but we don't intercept ball much 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.010
 had to be yes again later 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.950
 to the moussa that fits that was true 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.450
 fucking stupid of me and our opponent 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.700
 they still try some things 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.100
 but we all know that by now 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.100
 there forgive so I keep all the balls 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.260
 intercept and yes yes until wait 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.950
 know god forget me chemistry completely 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.910
 no, only tattoo 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.910
 the paint is real 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.450
 and that is before the first half 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.550
 almost over another corner has been taken 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.620
 call by god oh yes I played against 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.750
 fuckin robben and we know him away 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.090
 the first half works and that's how we succeeded 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.920
 have fought hard and state 3 3 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.200
 quite a few goals the city is something 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.880
 better my team so it should be alright 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.680
 In contrast begins second half 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.420
 the one with a bit of a damper in between 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.430
 immediately comes along with a cat again 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.060
 A this early feel to me then so I the 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.370
 grab the ball 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.750
 stab boss solve had to go with 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.940
 freelancer and hard he fast yet he 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.430
 shoot and it's great easy 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.370
 thus day three here within two 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.160
 minutes that two Belgians could do is so 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.900
 we keep playing but the opponent 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.420
 she continues to apply tactics, he runs 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.770
 immediately again and goes well he comes 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.550
 up to me 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:13.890
 oh oh oh I want to look back 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.890
 oh oh oh oh oh 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.220
 wait 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:29.020
 reasonable worth giel the no no see that 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:30.970
 what ok why no red when i ask 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.460
 allowed 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.300
 maybe a little different but when the 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.759
 corner 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.099
 with luck again miss that leak it is 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:41.110
 really annoying but it doesn't matter 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.759
 meanwhile continue to generate the opportunity 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.070
 others on the other hand and I have to 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:46.330
 we defended that pretty well 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.639
 second half that went second half 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.349
 tasty and we went through and on 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.090
 and so as to slow down you had 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:53.500
 just take it easy but 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.750
 Fernandez can make it through a nice stitch 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.220
 owner or franÃ§ois and the forgets 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.300
 then nice and smart to shoot 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.820
 and then the moment when we all 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.729
 have waited oil gerard injured 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.380
 your there finally that man that i like not 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.539
 may the window 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.789
 who are we going to put my talent into? 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.979
 I scouted yes the best striker on it 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.570
 moment guys he is from sweden and 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.330
 his name is way too long to say 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.430
 and he has such a good one 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.099
 I seriously had nothing better with me 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.229
 that's a risk they say that's one 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:29.139
 risk that you had to take me 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:31.389
 yes that was so handy no indeed 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:34.389
 but good because the creator via the ball 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.940
 pushing a nice pass through sea bass 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:41.349
 goes in a mustamu that evening 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:43.780
 is a pity but we will stay 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:46.840
 can generate them yes yes again one 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:49.030
 insert base and put on the pole and 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.289
 offside i don't know how it is with 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.090
 you sit but I am outside so often 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.889
 game it's not normal 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.630
 offense no we just go through we 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:58.150
 just shit everyone with 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.719
 for men man who is 63 meters we go 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.180
 around it 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:04.330
 yes dribbling skills french we walk to 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.990
 bed we go to work we do 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.990
 shoot him 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.080
 Hey 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.350
 and so I shut this division or do you 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.550
