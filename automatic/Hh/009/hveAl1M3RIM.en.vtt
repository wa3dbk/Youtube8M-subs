they<00:02:26.880> fire<00:02:27.450> half<00:02:28.319> of<00:02:28.709> 1%<00:02:29.250> why<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.000> so<00:02:30.360> what's

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
they fire half of 1% why is so what's

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.910 
they fire half of 1% why is so what's
happening<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.500> that<00:02:31.800> we<00:02:32.400> don't<00:02:32.670> have<00:02:33.300> good

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
happening is that we don't have good

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.670

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
where they live and not all kids learn

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.620 
where they live and not all kids learn
the<00:03:47.100> same<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:47.489> so<00:03:47.640> if<00:03:47.850> you<00:03:47.970> hold<00:03:48.180> all<00:03:48.299> kids

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
the same and so if you hold all kids

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:57.140 
the same and so if you hold all kids
that<00:03:48.750> one<00:03:48.959> yes<00:03:51.799> right<00:03:54.980> only<00:03:55.980> 7%<00:03:56.459> of<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:56.940> kids

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
that one yes right only 7% of the kids

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.400 
that one yes right only 7% of the kids
were<00:03:57.299> proficient<00:03:57.540> in<00:03:57.810> English<00:03:58.079> because<00:03:58.290> they

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
were proficient in English because they

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.569 
were proficient in English because they
probably<00:03:58.620> come<00:03:58.890> from<00:03:58.920> a<00:03:59.160> home<00:03:59.310> where<00:03:59.340> they

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
probably come from a home where they

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.610 
probably come from a home where they
don't<00:03:59.760> speak<00:03:59.970> English<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:01.079> makes<00:04:01.350> a<00:04:01.500> big

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
don't speak English that makes a big

don't speak English that makes a big
difference
