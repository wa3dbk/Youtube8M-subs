00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.130
 never deserved previous we saw how the tv studios work 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:15.429
 we know the basic structure of them could record the program combination 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.480
 of the positive river scenario - to the different models 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.829
 we'll learn the basics for handling a model camera 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:26.099
 had 7 5 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.269
 this type of equipment has low weight characteristics 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.529
 around two fifths of the pen without leaving anything to be desired for 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.300
 ecosystems coercion 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.980
 now let's learn the main functions of the camera as basic part 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.630
 from them 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.730
 brightness adjustment yen 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.420
 and with the premiere of paris known as keys 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.730
 we also have today's guest student 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.870
 alexei belchior repartition 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.550
 he studies communication have many questions about probable cameras 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.140
 the construction of minds and a camera is based to stimulate the capture 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.090
 new world 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.430
 unlike lehman than automatically adjusts people know that 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.130
 we have 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.549
 plus a balanced gemstone 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:06.130
 every change of the name of the city 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.899
 like different types of 20 bodies 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:09.969
 what the fuck but the most kids 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:13.829
 the more isolated warm colors the balancing and support of that difference 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:15.790
 What time did her father get paid? 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.609
 that the union of all colors 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:20.609
 and apart from it the lens and produces the actual cut of the dnit 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.890
 camera normally has so-called presets 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.550
 to justice 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.900
 We are going to rock a lot 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.340
 very well we have the princes here 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.340
 if we pay attention before starting the recording is here 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.490
 if it's correct 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.440
 is the regulation of eads 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.480
 61 bosses and here is the balancing work 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.790
 let's here that filter using as the rules that this is not what the 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.810
 own 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.730
 of a studio 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.570
 that's why it's more yellowish 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.750
 the first step the first item 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.180
 the skin gets sick begins in the year that the maximum recording 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.750
 is the white balance 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.860
 Now you're going to hit Brazil, you have a vacancy. 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.860
 we have here 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.589
 and we already see here 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:11.389
 the image is 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:14.239
 well-defined mood with things 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.979
 own 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:17.769
 let's go now then 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.929
 auchan 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:22.959
 pulled by what a chief wants the general law of the state that I arrived 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.229
 the so-called city indicator of frames being beaten per second 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:30.049
 we have here 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.369
 Do you know what the pictures are? 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:33.539
 six fronts exactly at kindergartens 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:35.959
 the phones are accelerated 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.069
 they pass they change the fans and the Muslim world 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.709
 we have at the time of elimination 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:45.199
 we have here 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:48.429
 now 250 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:51.249
 I think this is selection 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:53.769
 is the number of frames 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.279
 The bell we have here now 

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:59.569
 20 15 the rate is getting more attention modify the oil has how to imitate 

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:03.539
 and how does it stay? 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:06.149
 it's a bit smaller in the middle of the ocean 

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:08.809
 situation may 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:11.809
 the actors have photographs exactly 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.910
 your name can already be more we put 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.519
 the whole year 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.809
 any time 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:25.489
 the standard number you can sign contract with duration of 24 4% 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:27.969
 video cameras on motorcycles 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:30.809
 celebration 29 by 97 

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:33.809
 but redeemed himself 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.319
 my maximum we can get to offer 50 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.119
 but this is a truth 

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:43.639
 is ideal even if you want to do a TV show with luck in the 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:44.209
 movie theater 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.209
 is to use another 34 30 frames per second 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:50.779
 which is closest to the pattern above 

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:54.349
 Very well, I need to know 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.469
 What happens also that the ground shakes 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:59.469
 the fines delegate luminosity 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:02.909
 then passed which are passed 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.909
 Very well, let's not go here. It's enviable. 

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:09.299
 I opened it 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.829
 is the setting of the aperture 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.529
 give entrance 

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:16.090
 if you want a lot of lucidity 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.900
 You will open a lot to them. 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.049
 this museum generally by victimizing it dominates of the city enough English 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.049
 What do you want to capture the maximum light coming in at night 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.770
 if you are in a bright environment you close them 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:32.279
 because the image is outside the system 

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:35.279
 we took here was an end of each initial stage 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:43.930
 aquino tv monitor 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.300
 came to Libya but regardless of that, Mello said 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.300
 as we have grown up now 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:52.219
 And you, what do you think 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:56.979
 after the expedition of the new mamoré, it is Guaporé where they present themselves here 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.050
 completely closed there is no light there was not then a camera 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.569
 Very well, we're going to turn off the studio lights. 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:07.719
 to see how the good people and the northeast light 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:10.529
 gave a kick 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:13.629
 we realize that much and we have a low light environment 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:16.099
 because we are part dark 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:19.099
 boluda denied extradition 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.339
 were not affected 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:26.759
 let's increase sensitivity 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:28.400
 the date 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.590
 as a prison officer 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.809
 I stay with us now 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:33.099
 the bc highlights 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:36.589
 did you already know of these three basic items they begin to 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:38.849
 recording did not know what we know who it is 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:40.379
 after college 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:42.879
 gas systems asahi television in block 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:46.209
 among them we will have a schedule of the French clay court 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:51.110
 in these technical terms and all that part ida jesus 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.050
 in the service sector if we do not know 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.520
 and now I propose to get worse by now no more 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.869
 who else should help the defense? 

00:05:59.869 --> 00:06:02.009
 The news has a basis 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:05.599
 I think I'm going to practice a little more because I 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:07.449
 it was this work 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:10.960
 our idea that we are forced to hendrix wales hope you have 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.440
 liked the can in action today until the next
