some<00:00:35.460> people<00:00:35.640> want<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.820> see<00:00:35.910> me<00:00:36.030> use<00:00:36.149> maybe

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
some people want to see me use maybe

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.799 
some people want to see me use maybe
some<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.960> other<00:00:37.370> unused<00:00:38.510> assault<00:00:39.510> rifles

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
some of the other unused assault rifles

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.229 
some of the other unused assault rifles
like<00:00:40.050> not<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.399> guns<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.730> aren't<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
like not the the guns that aren't the

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.369 
like not the the guns that aren't the
m8a1<00:00:42.510> m27<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:44.059> put<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.270> n25<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.050> think

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
m8a1 m27 and put it the a n25 I think

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.540 
m8a1 m27 and put it the a n25 I think
that's<00:00:46.530> think<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.039> would<00:00:47.160> think<00:00:47.460> that's

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
that's think that would think that's

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.209 
that's think that would think that's
what<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.120> called<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.379> ak-47

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
what that one is called the the ak-47

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.560 
what that one is called the the ak-47
pretty<00:00:50.430> much<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.789> guess<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.030> could<00:00:51.180> just<00:00:51.329> called

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
pretty much I guess I could just called

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.290 
pretty much I guess I could just called
that<00:00:51.710> but<00:00:52.710> anyways<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.219> really<00:00:53.430> like<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:54.030> and

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
that but anyways I really like the a and

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.910 
that but anyways I really like the a and
25<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.719> think<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.079> really<00:00:55.410> good<00:00:55.559> one<00:00:55.829> I

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
25 I think it's a really good one I

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.889 
25 I think it's a really good one I
think<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.129> might<00:00:56.250> use<00:00:56.670> try<00:00:57.329> news<00:00:57.510> then<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.840> get

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
think I might use try news then and get

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.959 
think I might use try news then and get
some<00:00:58.109> gameplays<00:00:58.500> with<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.760> won't

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
some gameplays with that so it it won't

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.770 
some gameplays with that so it it won't
just<00:01:00.090> be<00:01:00.239> all<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.100> all<00:01:02.100> SMGs<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.180> whatnot<00:01:03.510> but

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
just be all the all SMGs and whatnot but

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.390 
just be all the all SMGs and whatnot but
anyways<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.260> gameplay<00:01:04.409> using<00:01:04.589> I'm<00:01:04.860> 27

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
anyways in this gameplay using I'm 27

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.300 
anyways in this gameplay using I'm 27
real<00:01:05.549> good<00:01:05.760> guns<00:01:06.000> basically<00:01:06.510> like<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.740> m4<00:01:07.740> a1<00:01:07.920> in

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
real good guns basically like a m4 a1 in

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.950 
real good guns basically like a m4 a1 in
the<00:01:08.430> previous<00:01:08.760> called<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.330> real<00:01:09.540> accurate

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
the previous called it is real accurate

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.109 
the previous called it is real accurate
pretty<00:01:10.409> much<00:01:10.560> very<00:01:10.799> consistent<00:01:11.549> actually<00:01:11.909> I

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
pretty much very consistent actually I

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.880 
pretty much very consistent actually I
think<00:01:12.630> that's<00:01:12.900> what<00:01:13.020> insomnia<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.560> like<00:01:13.710> so

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
think that's what insomnia is like so

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.800 
think that's what insomnia is like so
say<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.850> think<00:01:15.540> it's<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.659> most

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
say it is I think it's the most

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.940 
say it is I think it's the most
consistent<00:01:17.600> consistent<00:01:18.600> assault<00:01:18.930> rifle<00:01:19.350> so

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
consistent consistent assault rifle so

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.039 
consistent consistent assault rifle so
pretty<00:01:20.369> good<00:01:20.549> stuff<00:01:20.820> but<00:01:21.540> anyways<00:01:21.780> use<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
pretty good stuff but anyways use the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.350 
pretty good stuff but anyways use the
m27<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.950> my<00:01:23.130> attachments<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.150> are

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
m27 and my attachments on it are

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.140

extended mags silencer and stock and

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.280 
extended mags silencer and stock and
that's<00:01:27.270> kind<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.570> what<00:01:27.720> i<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.020> use<00:01:28.049> on

most to my most of my assault assault
rifles<00:01:31.079> maybe<00:01:31.259> not<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.890> m8a1<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:32.850> for

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
rifles maybe not on the m8a1 but for

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.399 
rifles maybe not on the m8a1 but for
most<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.570> them<00:01:33.689> that's<00:01:33.869> what<00:01:33.960> i<00:01:34.049> like<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.229> use

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
most of them that's what i like to use

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.520

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
but kill streaks in this game using vsat

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.700 
but kill streaks in this game using vsat
lodestar<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.430> swarm<00:01:39.000> which<00:01:39.270> isn't<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.470> ideal

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
lodestar and swarm which isn't the ideal

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.980 
lodestar and swarm which isn't the ideal
one<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.340> i've<00:01:41.460> been<00:01:41.490> using<00:01:41.880> i<00:01:42.240> guess<00:01:42.659> as<00:01:42.869> of

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
gameplay was achieved but I don't know

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.749 
gameplay was achieved but I don't know
why<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.399> said<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.729> but<00:01:54.570> anyways<00:01:55.729> gameplays<00:01:56.729> a

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
why I said that but anyways gameplays a

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.130 
why I said that but anyways gameplays a
little<00:01:56.939> bit<00:01:57.030> old<00:01:57.210> now<00:01:57.299> what<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.750> usually<00:01:58.079> like

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
little bit old now what I usually like

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.819 
little bit old now what I usually like
to<00:01:58.200> use<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.469> lodestar<00:01:59.630> feet<00:02:00.630> tall<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.170> swarm

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
to use is lodestar feet tall and swarm

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.160 
to use is lodestar feet tall and swarm
so<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:02.399> cut<00:02:02.549> out<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.939> cult<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.810> vsat

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
so just cut out the cult the vsat

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.780 
so just cut out the cult the vsat
because<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.439> don't<00:02:04.590> think<00:02:04.680> it's<00:02:04.950> too<00:02:05.430> needed

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
because I don't think it's too needed

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.059 
because I don't think it's too needed
honestly<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> don't<00:02:06.420> know<00:02:06.600> now<00:02:07.290> like<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.920> map

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
honestly I don't know now like this map

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.800 
honestly I don't know now like this map
is<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:08.310> wide<00:02:08.489> open<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.849> got<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.239> go<00:02:09.330> with<00:02:09.360> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
is so wide open you got to go with the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.449 
is so wide open you got to go with the
high<00:02:10.140> high<00:02:10.560> killstreaks<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.310> can<00:02:11.430> just

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
high high killstreaks so you can just

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.430 
high high killstreaks so you can just
try<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:11.879> get<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> bunch<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.420> kills<00:02:12.629> that's

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
think in two weeks which kind of sucks

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.770 
think in two weeks which kind of sucks
kind<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.459> came<00:03:32.670> up<00:03:32.700> a<00:03:32.880> little<00:03:32.970> bit<00:03:33.150> fast<00:03:33.420> on<00:03:33.660> me

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
kind of came up a little bit fast on me

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.750 
kind of came up a little bit fast on me
but<00:03:33.989> then<00:03:34.110> I<00:03:34.170> get<00:03:34.350> whatever<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.800> think<00:03:35.430> three<00:03:35.730> or

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
but then I get whatever I think three or

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.400 
but then I get whatever I think three or
four<00:03:36.030> weeks<00:03:36.209> where<00:03:36.540> I<00:03:36.570> don't<00:03:36.750> have<00:03:36.900> any<00:03:37.050> school

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
four weeks where I don't have any school

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.620 
four weeks where I don't have any school
or<00:03:37.560> any<00:03:37.709> I<00:03:37.980> guess<00:03:38.250> major<00:03:38.700> responsibilities

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
or any I guess major responsibilities

like<00:03:39.780> that<00:03:39.959> so<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.170> can<00:03:40.350> kind<00:03:40.560> of<00:03:40.650> focus<00:03:40.830> on

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160
