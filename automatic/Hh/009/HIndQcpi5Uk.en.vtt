00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
tour performance models we do recognize

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.170 
tour performance models we do recognize
that<00:00:47.430> there<00:00:47.579> are<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.670> lot<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.820> players<00:00:48.030> that

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.970 
that there are a lot of players that
swing<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.750> club<00:00:48.960> like<00:00:49.200> Davis<00:00:49.530> Love<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.829> third

swing the club like Davis Love the third

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.229 
swing the club like Davis Love the third
so<00:00:50.430> we've<00:00:50.550> got<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.730> make<00:00:50.820> sure<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.059> we<00:00:51.120> have

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
so we've got to make sure that we have

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.400 
so we've got to make sure that we have
golf<00:00:51.449> balls<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.660> stand<00:00:51.960> up<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.079> high<00:00:52.289> your

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
golf balls that stand up to high your

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.110 
golf balls that stand up to high your
head<00:00:52.530> speeds<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.980> that's<00:00:53.309> where<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.579> B<00:00:53.670> 3<00:00:53.910> 30

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
head speeds and that's where the B 3 30

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.389 
head speeds and that's where the B 3 30
and<00:00:54.270> B<00:00:54.360> 3<00:00:54.510> 30's<00:00:54.870> come<00:00:55.199> from<00:00:55.440> there<00:00:55.829> for<00:00:56.160> peace

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
and B 3 30's come from there for peace

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.220 
and B 3 30's come from there for peace
as<00:00:56.610> opposed<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.270> three-piece<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.899> RX

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
as opposed to the three-piece in the RX

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.810 
as opposed to the three-piece in the RX
series<00:00:58.500> that's<00:00:59.070> because<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> more<00:00:59.640> layers

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
series that's because the more layers

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.279 
series that's because the more layers
that<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.210> add<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.539> better<00:01:00.690> they<00:01:00.840> stand<00:01:01.079> up<00:01:01.199> to

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
that you add the better they stand up to

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.900 
that you add the better they stand up to
higher<00:01:01.469> head<00:01:01.739> speeds<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.489> less<00:01:02.670> layers

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
higher head speeds the less layers

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.759 
higher head speeds the less layers
easier<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.660> compress<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.260> core<00:01:04.470> so

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
easier it is to compress the core so

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.350 
easier it is to compress the core so
these<00:01:05.220> are<00:01:05.430> generally<00:01:05.820> for<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.090> players<00:01:06.299> that

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
these are generally for the players that

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.000 
these are generally for the players that
are<00:01:06.510> going<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> swing<00:01:06.840> over<00:01:07.049> 105<00:01:07.619> miles<00:01:07.830> per

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
are going to swing over 105 miles per

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.920 
are going to swing over 105 miles per
hour<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:09.270> be<00:01:09.390> able<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.600> differentiate

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
hour and to be able to differentiate

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.410 
hour and to be able to differentiate
between<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.439> two<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.830> b3<00:01:11.159> 30s<00:01:11.549> primarily<00:01:12.180> for

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
between the two the b3 30s primarily for

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.240 
between the two the b3 30s primarily for
the<00:01:12.450> player<00:01:12.689> that's<00:01:12.930> looking<00:01:13.260> for<00:01:13.470> definitely

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
the player that's looking for definitely

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.890 
the player that's looking for definitely
distance<00:01:14.549> off<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.700> tee<00:01:14.820> but<00:01:15.390> maximum

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
distance off the tee but maximum

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.170 
distance off the tee but maximum
greenside<00:01:16.259> control<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.830> covers<00:01:17.070> 12%<00:01:17.729> softer

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
greenside control that covers 12% softer

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.120 
greenside control that covers 12% softer
which<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.750> increasing<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.590> responsiveness

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
which is increasing the responsiveness

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.100 
which is increasing the responsiveness
around<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> green<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.939> thinner<00:01:21.420> cover<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.049> a

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.109 
around the green a thinner cover and a
larger<00:01:22.439> core<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.130> not<00:01:23.310> only<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.790> spending

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
larger core so not only is it spending

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.480 
larger core so not only is it spending
more<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:24.659> it's<00:01:24.750> longer<00:01:25.170> off<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.500> tee<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.369> be

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
more but it's longer off the tee the be

more but it's longer off the tee the be
330<00:01:26.939> also<00:01:27.509> are<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.930> four<00:01:28.500> piece<00:01:28.650> golf<00:01:28.799> ball

which<00:01:40.290> means<00:01:40.530> increased<00:01:40.979> performance<00:01:41.130> around

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
which means increased performance around

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.520 
which means increased performance around
the<00:01:41.670> green<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> larger<00:01:42.840> core<00:01:43.079> means<00:01:43.320> higher
