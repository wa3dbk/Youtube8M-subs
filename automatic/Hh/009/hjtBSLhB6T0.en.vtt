00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.000

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.470

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.730
 I think I do not believe it I knew it I did not know uncle 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.470
 I knew it and I was not 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.510
 resale but so much time there that the 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.430
 It was not me, but the car that was not 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.010
 it was putting good value so we have the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.480
 point behind it seems that we have it nobody 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.250

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.320

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.420
 first that yes we are not feeding 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.760
 all the while the first one is catching 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:10.980

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:13.079

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.540

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.920
 after three days 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.920
 three days after I shot 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.140
 but it's enough is following me has given 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.610
 time to catch the missiles this is a 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.950
 joke here you are very careful I was 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.240
 already turning to throw me a missile I do 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.240
 we are dodging 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:54.629
 that you are worth the madness 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:56.250
 Careful care with this missile is not left 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:59.219
 second voucher worth voucher we can get 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.019
 third party is still pretty good and I 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:02.670
 has really liked this race has 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.310
 been very funny this kind of career 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.049
 I love here really time not 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.150
 matter to win because you have to really 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.140
 If you have a great time for me, that's 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.090
 What I liked most about this race 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.799
 that has been very very funny everything is 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.689
 here exploiting everything is there in tension 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.220
 that we should appear fast 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:20.250
 to exploit it and so that it has us 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.740
 time that the second does not reach anything and 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.389
 really the first one wanted the 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.160
 first you will really earn it first 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.599
 we have given the victory because the 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.130
 second and the third that was me and the 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:30.960
 another subscriber we were all the time 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.820
 popping up exploding has not been very 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.680
 fun so I hope caused too 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.759

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.560
