00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:02.830
 filtering and boarding 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.279
 the clarification system begins at the terminal pipeline station 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:09.349
 you the second 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.529
 which has different circuits with rings visitadores depression 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:17.490
 to regulate the pressure with which the concentrate 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.310
 arrives 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.779
 by the pipeline 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.929
 The concentrate is stored in three agitator tanks with a capacity for 2 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.349
 1,500 cubic meters 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.059
 two of them are destined to store the copper concentrate and one 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.740
 to the zinc concentrate 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.260
 the terminal station unloads and concentrates in the drawer 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.730
 510 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.090
 stp 501 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.240
 that distributes concentrate so both lower drawers 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.320
 the drawer 510 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.000
 stp 502 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.090
 that feed the storage tank of zinc concentrates 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.070
 and the drawer 510 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.660
 stp 503 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.989
 that feed the copper concentrate storage tanks 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.000
 besides downloading the tanks 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.570
 the drawers have the option to discharge the water that arrives by the 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.660
 pipeline 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.660
 towards copper or zinc concentrate planners 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.430
 or directly 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.430
 to the effluent treatment pond 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.460
 the storage tanks unload by gravity like this the tank of 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.340
 power to filters 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.880
 the filter feed tank 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.900
 It has four discharge pumps 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.100
 for each filter 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.999
 in the vicinity of the filter feed tank is located 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.400
 the filtering tank 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.430
 that receives water that is recovered from the concentrate after filtration 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.680
 the process water tank that stores the water that comes from the 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.540
 effluent treatment 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.540
 and it is used for the processes of the plant 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.370
 the filtering system is composed of four filters the rocks 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.270
 that operate continuously 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.409
 and that they discharge the one that is concentrated filtered in the conveyor belt 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.400
 number one 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.400
 located on the lower level 

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:15.159
 to press the concentrate, high pressure air is used 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.279
 the compressor ram that is located on the side of the filtering building 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:24.189
 and consists of an air compressor for instrumentation 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.679
 two low pressure air compressors 

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:30.679
 hi-5 high pressure air compressor 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.889
 in the number one conveyor belt 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:38.199
 collects the filter cake from the four concentrate filters 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:42.099
 and unloads it in conveyor belt number 2 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.470
 that runs along the length of the warehouse deconcentrated by the 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:47.949
 higher 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:51.539
 in this belt a peter monfils has been installed 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:55.059
 that unloads in a trouser hopper 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:56.989
 the tri pÃ©rez 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.420
 can move it 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.629
 to the entire length of the strip 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.589
 parking the entire concentrate warehouse 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:05.239
 the position of the tri peer 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.510
 depends on the type of concentrate that is leaking 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:12.539
 since each type of concentrate 

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:15.359
 a storage area foresees an end 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.229
 in the concentrate store 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:21.059
 at a level below the warehouse floor 

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:24.469
 the conveyor belt number 3 is located 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:27.769
 that runs throughout the concentrate warehouse 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.260
 through that girdle 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.750
 the concentrate is removed from the warehouse 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.229
 what will you do on board 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:36.179
 two mobile feeders 

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:39.199
 they discharge the filtered concentrate in the strip 

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:41.989
 said feeders 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.999
 they can move freely along the strip 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:48.109
 and they are positioned according to the location 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.109
 of the stack of concentrate to be shipped 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.879
 when you are going to embark concentrated 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.209
 two front loaders operate on the storage floor 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:04.729
 which removed material from the pile of concentrate to ship and unload it 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:08.459
 in the fed mobile stations of strip number 2 

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:12.499
 in strip number 3 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:15.629
 discharge on conveyor belt number 4 

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:21.069
 in which the concentrate is transported to the ship's loader 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.979
 pons and plo she 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.870
 in the strip continues on the pier of punta lobitos 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.319
 protected by a tubular structure 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.840
 and unloading in the conveyor belt 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.840
 of the ciprodeh inter 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.330
 he can be 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.180
 is a unit that the shotgun with movement ability 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.939
 on vertical and horizontal axes 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:48.540
 in order to reach the whole area 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.759
 of the both gas of the boats 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.150
 and so load 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.199
 the concentrate evenly
