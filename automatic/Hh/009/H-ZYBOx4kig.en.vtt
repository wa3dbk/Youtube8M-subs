00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
saving up for a while all right so I was

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.550 
saving up for a while all right so I was
thinking<00:03:14.210> about<00:03:14.480> opening<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.020> heart<00:03:15.260> chest

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
thinking about opening the heart chest

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.030 
thinking about opening the heart chest
then<00:03:15.860> um<00:03:16.280> I<00:03:16.760> don't<00:03:17.360> know<00:03:17.420> it's<00:03:17.780> 24<00:03:18.440> gems<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:18.950> if

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
then um I don't know it's 24 gems and if

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.370 
then um I don't know it's 24 gems and if
I<00:03:19.130> don't<00:03:19.280> get<00:03:19.400> something<00:03:19.670> I'd<00:03:19.910> like<00:03:20.270> then<00:03:20.720> it

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
I don't get something I'd like then it

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.979 
I don't get something I'd like then it
would<00:03:21.530> suck<00:03:21.800> but<00:03:22.190> oh<00:03:22.520> I<00:03:23.420> think<00:03:23.570> I<00:03:23.750> might<00:03:23.930> just

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
would suck but oh I think I might just

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.160 
would suck but oh I think I might just
open<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:24.590> now<00:03:24.739> just<00:03:25.070> for<00:03:25.250> fun<00:03:25.489> and<00:03:26.050> even<00:03:27.050> though

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
open it now just for fun and even though

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.840 
open it now just for fun and even though
the<00:03:27.320> summer<00:03:27.530> chest<00:03:27.920> would<00:03:28.280> be<00:03:28.430> more<00:03:28.670> useful

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
the summer chest would be more useful

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.979 
the summer chest would be more useful
since<00:03:29.480> it<00:03:29.690> would<00:03:29.840> go<00:03:30.110> with<00:03:30.380> my<00:03:31.030> my<00:03:32.030> store<00:03:32.480> the

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
since it would go with my my store the

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.020 
since it would go with my my store the
summer<00:03:33.320> beach<00:03:33.650> theme<00:03:34.070> I<00:03:34.310> can<00:03:34.520> always<00:03:34.760> open

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
summer beach theme I can always open

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.530 
summer beach theme I can always open
that<00:03:35.209> later<00:03:35.660> so<00:03:36.650> if<00:03:36.860> I<00:03:36.950> open<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:37.700> heart<00:03:38.239> chest

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
that later so if I open the heart chest
