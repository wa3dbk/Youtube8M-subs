00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 well play these finally 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.290
 today talk about the victory of suzuki then 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.599
 there are particulars like this 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:16.100
 suzuki bleed suzuki chain that is 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.900
 so here's the engine of the track the new 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.220
 the crux of the problem which arrived three days 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.650
 hors de combat 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.539
 petal board fails by 2 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.390
 the reason for these idiotic location 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.119
 air filter and due to unsuccessful 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.170
 selection of materials for its manufacture 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.989
 Basically, these two factors are a bunch 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.309
 unite he gives birth and bricks in 90 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.579
 percent of the owner of a torpedo are done so 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.940
 what you get and that is right next to 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.090
 with the wheel and all the dust from the wheel falls 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.520
 by filter 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.860
 places the filter quickly becomes clogged up 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.449
 skip on you too be able to 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.340
 look for a brother past the carburetors 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.379
 the flap valve which is manufactured in 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.980
 I will give you these thanks and there 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.870
 Lipetsk made 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.899
 secretary how does an abrasive fall 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.159
 between Anthony's petal knocks out 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.200
 mood all the way worms 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.909
 it's not a whim ok I stop 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.130
 because of this, you both stop normal 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.020
 wind up and keep idle 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.259
 motor can be absolutely 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.490
 basis you passed new glands 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.380
 good adjusted carburetor 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.009
 numbered sand because everything is there 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.679
 somehow hampered or due to the fact that 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.299
 principle what should break on because 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:31.920
 that let's say he doesn't break it 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.990
 Generally due to the fact that the petal itself 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.750
 essentially made of fiberglass and 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.090
 rubber these two materials are very principle 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.569
 even well smoothed i.e. 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.299
 of essence 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:45.149
 fucking forgot the dirt away elabuga her 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.429
 quietly hawala and continues to work 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.270
 over the years and decades with this when you 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.890
 motor boomer 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.780
 removed on the texture of the valve and he's all 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.000
 equal to the choice of the method essentially with 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.840
 the main does not pass as soon as it hits 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.959
 dust there 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:03.869
 write gone so that's it yourself 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:05.670
 root of evil and this guy is evil because 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.270
 the fact that he was constantly dusting 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.390
 and dirt 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.459
 petals knocked out everything for that is because of 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.700
 this petals are tight to the frame the goal is not 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.459
 resorts therefore then when the mixture 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.829
 follows the crank at the camera 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.829
 she comes back through the cracks for 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.510
 we do n't hold a song for this 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:26.970
 abnormally unable to start not 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.980
 cold not hot so usually what 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.459
 There I offer to run away shop to buy 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.859
 attack new hrenachit case it is so 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.690
 that either the store is available or time 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.850
 unsuitable for any planet 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.739
 Well, in general, to be honest in fact 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.600
 Basically you buy the same crap 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.880
 which sooner or later you walk strings 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.170
 so basically vitories us now 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.019
 need to fix the problem 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.489
 and after that just follow 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.680
 periodically for the air filter 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.569
 that is, his honor prescribe impregnations 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.709
 to the flap valve 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.239
 hit the minimum were play so here for 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.660
 order to restore the flap 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.650
 valve 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.840
 we need a transparent piece of glass 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.470
 as a smooth surface well, of course you can 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.350
 same 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.190
 use a grinding stone but not 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.470
 everyone he and 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.050
 and due to this we will use 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.600
 improvised means so here we take 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.040
 glass we put on the glass of course a piece 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:26.840
 emery paper and begin to become of 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:30.150
 treasure there is paper with dimension 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.690
 320 i.e. 320 cobble on square 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.200
 millimeters we can take this hrenaten on 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.590
 glass 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.890
 take our hated petal valve 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.630
 or rather what is left of it as 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.380
 made back progressive 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.070
 movements begin to pump it about 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.280
 back and forth 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.540
 so spiro bumps for 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.940
 achieve a perfectly flat surface 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.480
 what then our Christi attracted 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.330
 as if they would just like to do it slowly 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:06.660
 because as they say you sign 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:09.050
 run for parts so look here 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.790
 principle already started to download 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:15.290
 you can take the paper smaller and closer 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:18.090
 uluru even valve principle 320 just right 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.700
 after a couple back progressive 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:25.790
 movements she's a little clogged 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:28.050
 in principle, the procedure is not so active 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.110
 time consuming and time consuming 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.180
 but the result is very noticeable 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.910
 believe me if you on this spot 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.650
 okay did not start you heel again 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.500
 holy how do that now 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.750
 showed not recognize their there you 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.750
 wind up the scope is young and to as seen 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.040
 talk to the common people here we got 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.430
 enough 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.830
 alive it is small on petal square 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.550
 the valve which we now have petals will 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.830
 jump of course is bad and everything is like 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.210
 it's about five minutes it's even 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.340
 less than run a number of money for the sake of 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.110
 outwardly grandmother she how to check 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.220
 leaf valve operability 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.900
 after such alterations 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.970
 that's basically 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.380
 I think itâ€™s clear to anyone 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:16.289
 squeaks back and fasten set 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:20.520
 stop limiters and as they say there 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:22.740
 blow back to this one right now we have it 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.500
 We will do the tool for genes 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.039
 we take a good live screwdriver figures 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.289
 take our petals 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:33.389
 authorities here though I already look for you 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.590
 the guys experimented with turning 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:37.289
 petals on and zanzas 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.150
 since they are already on the one hand 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:42.180
 pretty pretty worked from 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.139
 chair 1 we put the position in which 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.810
 they stood before 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.699
 I still cranked this number serials 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.400
 fig has cut the limiter yet it 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:52.110
 bending back slightly to petal 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.880
 smelt your surrender than he can 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.570
 pay on standard petal 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.479
 valve so we still 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:03.120
 make it easier as they say in the start 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:05.190
 walking camera and and so not 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:09.180
 gets a gas-air mixture more 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:11.580
 Here we take our screwdriver to stand 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:15.930
 we twist the whole thing in a bunch and 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:17.669
 check show really he 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.440
 let me or not let me now I can not 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:22.289
 just seen on opa 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.330
 but in principle, if checked quite 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:26.970
 well got the result of how 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.440
 it was said there was nothing at all here for what 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.560
 flying back to 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:34.340
 whether such force is now the principle if 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.780
 I blow him in, he understands well and 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:39.180
 pretty good lets but this 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.199
 I'll get you Putin too number is not 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.199
 passes your general 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:49.490
 that is, in principle, I can even him 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:52.550
 keep a vacuum in your mouth well of course 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.590
 do not show well, all basically take here 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.900
 this karina key 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.550
 in addition to the place and enjoy the lives of sisters 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.820
 without spending any captain yes 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:05.440
 Is that a piece of good expensive 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:08.169
 sandpaper which died time 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:11.350
 olesya work 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:11.350
 me all
