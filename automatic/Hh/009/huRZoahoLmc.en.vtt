00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.090 
know I really don't know what's going to
happen<00:00:21.240> that's<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.990> creative<00:00:22.320> process<00:00:22.740> that

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
happen that's the creative process that

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.060 
happen that's the creative process that
it's<00:00:23.250> hard<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:24.150> actually<00:00:24.720> let's<00:00:25.590> look<00:00:25.740> over<00:00:25.859> on

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
it's hard so actually let's look over on

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.179 
it's hard so actually let's look over on
the<00:00:26.160> wall<00:00:26.310> here<00:00:26.760> these<00:00:27.119> are<00:00:27.800> paintings<00:00:28.800> that

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
the wall here these are paintings that

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.490 
the wall here these are paintings that
are<00:00:29.340> just<00:00:29.699> started<00:00:30.330> they're<00:00:30.539> just<00:00:30.900> totally<00:00:31.410> in

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
are just started they're just totally in

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.740 
are just started they're just totally in
process<00:00:31.980> they're<00:00:32.219> really<00:00:32.550> just<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.719> first

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
process they're really just the first

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.500 
process they're really just the first
layer<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.829> like<00:00:35.340> there's<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.210> much<00:00:36.450> more

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
layer this is like there's so much more

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.560 
layer this is like there's so much more
to<00:00:36.960> do<00:00:37.079> on<00:00:37.110> these<00:00:37.469> right<00:00:37.800> now<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:38.270> was<00:00:39.270> playing

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
to do on these right now I was playing

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.420 
to do on these right now I was playing
around<00:00:39.719> with<00:00:40.020> spray<00:00:40.440> paint<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.010> lot<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.280> them

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
around with spray paint on a lot of them

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.180 
around with spray paint on a lot of them
so<00:00:41.610> these<00:00:41.730> are<00:00:41.940> these<00:00:42.090> baby<00:00:43.190> embryonic

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
so these are these baby embryonic

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.959 
so these are these baby embryonic
paintings<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.180> let<00:00:45.390> me<00:00:45.539> show<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.079> over<00:00:46.410> here

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
series of paintings that I've been

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.700 
series of paintings that I've been
working<00:00:54.480> on

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
working on

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.090 
working on
they<00:00:56.520> are<00:00:56.789> acrylic<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.480> panel<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.170> I'm<00:00:58.829> doing

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
they are acrylic on panel and I'm doing

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.099 
they are acrylic on panel and I'm doing
these<00:00:59.609> backgrounds<00:01:00.420> where<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.660> build<00:01:00.930> up

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
these backgrounds where I build up

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.799 
these backgrounds where I build up
layers<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.710> layers<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.399> color<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.359> then<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.629> do

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
layers and layers of color and then I do

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.170 
layers and layers of color and then I do
pouring<00:01:04.379> medium<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.860> top<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.549> use<00:01:05.760> pouring

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
pouring medium on top and I use pouring

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.270 
pouring medium on top and I use pouring
medium<00:01:06.570> like<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> resin<00:01:07.439> coat<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.130> very

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
medium like a resin coat so it's very

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.660 
medium like a resin coat so it's very
clear<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.240> very<00:01:09.270> deep<00:01:10.260> I'll<00:01:10.530> maybe<00:01:10.799> pour<00:01:11.430> I

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
clear and very deep I'll maybe pour I

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.149 
clear and very deep I'll maybe pour I
haven't<00:01:12.150> been<00:01:12.299> counting<00:01:12.680> but<00:01:13.680> I'm<00:01:13.799> saying

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
haven't been counting but I'm saying

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.249 
haven't been counting but I'm saying
each<00:01:14.340> one<00:01:14.640> probably<00:01:14.850> has<00:01:15.119> like<00:01:15.360> ten<00:01:15.720> layers<00:01:16.020> of

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
each one probably has like ten layers of

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.770 
each one probably has like ten layers of
pouring<00:01:16.560> medium<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:18.060> I'm<00:01:18.509> going<00:01:18.689> to

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
pouring medium on it so I'm going to

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.600 
pouring medium on it so I'm going to
show<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.470> one<00:01:19.710> for<00:01:19.979> instance<00:01:20.340> how

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
show you on this one for instance how

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.630 
show you on this one for instance how
that<00:01:20.880> looks<00:01:21.180> if<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:22.189> see<00:01:23.189> sort<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.580> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
that looks if you can see sort of the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.420 
that looks if you can see sort of the
cast<00:01:24.000> shadow<00:01:24.540> these<00:01:24.990> marks<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.710> white<00:01:25.920> marks

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
cast shadow these marks the white marks

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.850 
cast shadow these marks the white marks
are<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.420> top<00:01:27.840> layer<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.470> pouring

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
are on the top layer of the pouring

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.710 
are on the top layer of the pouring
medium<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.460> then<00:01:29.670> they're<00:01:29.850> casting<00:01:30.390> shadow

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
medium and then they're casting shadow

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.420 
medium and then they're casting shadow
onto<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:32.280> background<00:01:33.710> underneath<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.100> I'm

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
onto the background underneath so I'm

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.609 
onto the background underneath so I'm
interested<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.509> doing<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.290> sort<00:01:37.560> of

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
interested in in doing that sort of

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.510 
interested in in doing that sort of
layered<00:01:37.920> effect<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:39.509> these<00:01:39.659> paintings<00:01:40.369> so<00:01:41.369> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
layered effect on these paintings so the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.690 
layered effect on these paintings so the
ones<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.090> wall<00:01:42.299> are<00:01:42.720> at<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.950> point<00:01:44.310> my

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
ones on the wall are at this point my

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.910 
ones on the wall are at this point my
intention<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.570> make<00:01:45.810> them<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.530> but

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
intention is to make them like that but

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.530 
intention is to make them like that but
I<00:01:47.130> do<00:01:47.189> want<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.610> say<00:01:47.759> something<00:01:47.790> about<00:01:48.270> this

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
I do want to say something about this

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.719 
I do want to say something about this
because<00:01:48.960> since<00:01:49.170> I'm<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.409> teacher<00:01:49.770> too<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.490> I

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
because since I'm a teacher too and I

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.179 
because since I'm a teacher too and I
think<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.600> lot<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.780> people<00:01:52.110> don't<00:01:52.350> understand

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
think a lot of people don't understand

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.590 
think a lot of people don't understand
the<00:01:53.310> creative<00:01:53.520> process<00:01:54.000> especially<00:01:54.299> if

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
the creative process especially if

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.410 
the creative process especially if
they're<00:01:54.869> not<00:01:55.020> people<00:01:55.829> who<00:01:56.100> make<00:01:56.399> art<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.030> they

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
they're not people who make art and they

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.480 
they're not people who make art and they
go<00:01:57.630> into<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:58.079> museum<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.860> they<00:01:58.979> see<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.189> painting

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
go into a museum and they see a painting

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.069 
go into a museum and they see a painting
and<00:01:59.820> they're<00:01:59.939> like<00:02:00.090> oh<00:02:00.240> wow<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.750> person<00:02:01.049> just

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
and they're like oh wow that person just

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.679 
and they're like oh wow that person just
had<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.530> idea<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.950> then<00:02:02.100> boom<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.820> just<00:02:02.850> they

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
had that idea and then boom it just they

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.440 
had that idea and then boom it just they
just<00:02:03.719> executed<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.770> idea<00:02:05.130> there<00:02:05.369> was<00:02:05.460> no<00:02:05.670> but

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
just executed the idea there was no but

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.010 
just executed the idea there was no but
in<00:02:06.750> order<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.290> make<00:02:07.680> art<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:09.420> actually<00:02:09.869> goes

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
in order to make art it actually goes

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.630 
in order to make art it actually goes
through<00:02:10.050> many<00:02:10.440> phases<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.220> have

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
through many phases and you have

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.180 
through many phases and you have
to<00:02:11.790> be<00:02:11.970> prepared<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.810> go<00:02:12.990> into<00:02:13.200> this<00:02:13.500> uncharted

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
to be prepared to go into this uncharted

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.610 
to be prepared to go into this uncharted
unknown<00:02:14.550> territory<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.959> usually<00:02:16.319> go<00:02:16.440> through

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
unknown territory you usually go through

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.380 
unknown territory you usually go through
a<00:02:16.680> phase<00:02:16.890> where<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.280> have<00:02:17.490> no<00:02:17.790> idea<00:02:18.150> what's

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
a phase where you have no idea what's

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.050 
a phase where you have no idea what's
going<00:02:18.600> on<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.830> then<00:02:20.010> often<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.700> will<00:02:20.850> take<00:02:21.030> a

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
going on and then often it will take a

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.460 
going on and then often it will take a
divergent<00:02:21.600> paths<00:02:21.840> than<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.200> had<00:02:22.290> originally

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
divergent paths than you had originally

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.620 
divergent paths than you had originally
intended<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.370> that's<00:02:23.550> when<00:02:23.790> things<00:02:24.120> really

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
intended and that's when things really

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.630 
intended and that's when things really
interesting<00:02:24.980> start<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.100> happen<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.550> that's

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
interesting start to happen and that's

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.340 
interesting start to happen and that's
been<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.150> way<00:02:27.180> I've<00:02:27.510> worked<00:02:27.840> for<00:02:27.959> many<00:02:28.200> years

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
been the way I've worked for many years

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.800 
been the way I've worked for many years
I<00:02:28.830> don't<00:02:29.220> want<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.640> control<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.420> don't<00:02:30.720> have

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
I don't want to control it I don't have

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.440 
I don't want to control it I don't have
a<00:02:30.990> you<00:02:31.860> know<00:02:31.980> like<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.310> blueprint<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.240> it's

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
a you know like a blueprint and it's

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.970 
a you know like a blueprint and it's
gonna<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:33.959> know<00:02:33.990> I<00:02:34.080> put<00:02:34.350> this<00:02:34.470> mark<00:02:34.709> there<00:02:34.860> in

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
gonna you know I put this mark there in

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.590 
gonna you know I put this mark there in
that<00:02:35.130> blue<00:02:35.340> there<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.730> this<00:02:36.150> red<00:02:36.390> they're

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
that blue there and this red they're

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.890 
that blue there and this red they're
done<00:02:36.959> it's<00:02:37.650> like<00:02:37.770> I'll<00:02:38.250> start<00:02:38.880> something<00:02:39.660> and

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
done it's like I'll start something and

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.960 
done it's like I'll start something and
then<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.470> idea<00:02:40.770> will<00:02:40.920> come<00:02:41.100> it's<00:02:41.280> almost<00:02:41.610> I've

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
then the idea will come it's almost I've

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.610 
then the idea will come it's almost I've
heard<00:02:42.209> people<00:02:42.360> say<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:43.140> feel<00:02:43.350> this<00:02:43.470> way

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
heard people say it and I feel this way

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.010 
heard people say it and I feel this way
the<00:02:43.739> painting<00:02:44.190> tells<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:45.209> how<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.480> paint<00:02:45.780> it

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
the painting tells you how to paint it

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.640 
the painting tells you how to paint it
and<00:02:46.230> I'm<00:02:46.350> very<00:02:46.530> interested<00:02:46.830> in<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.760> I'm

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
and I'm very interested in that so I'm

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.170 
and I'm very interested in that so I'm
starting<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.769> off<00:02:49.800> it's<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.670> little<00:02:50.700> scary

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
starting you off it's a little scary

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.120 
starting you off it's a little scary
because<00:02:51.390> you're<00:02:51.690> going<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.870> get<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.200> see<00:02:52.410> the

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
because you're going to get to see the

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.060 
because you're going to get to see the
crappy<00:02:53.370> parts<00:02:54.200> usually<00:02:55.200> when<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:55.500> exhibit

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
crappy parts usually when you exhibit

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.370 
crappy parts usually when you exhibit
work<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.430> show<00:02:56.790> like<00:02:57.150> only<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.540> best<00:02:57.959> and

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
work you show like only the best and

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.500 
work you show like only the best and
everything's<00:02:58.830> finished<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.580> and<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.269> think

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
everything's finished and and I think

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.180 
everything's finished and and I think
it's<00:03:00.660> helpful<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.110> take<00:03:01.410> people<00:03:01.769> behind<00:03:02.010> the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
it's helpful to take people behind the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.160 
it's helpful to take people behind the
scenes<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.880> see<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.180> awkwardness<00:03:03.600> and<00:03:04.019> see

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
scenes and see the awkwardness and see

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.430 
scenes and see the awkwardness and see
the<00:03:04.290> frustration<00:03:04.470> that<00:03:05.220> might<00:03:05.400> happen<00:03:06.440> and

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
the frustration that might happen and

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.650 
the frustration that might happen and
you<00:03:08.310> know<00:03:08.430> see<00:03:08.700> when<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:08.970> doesn't<00:03:09.180> look<00:03:09.330> so

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
you know see when it doesn't look so

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.890 
you know see when it doesn't look so
great<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:11.269> so<00:03:12.269> I'm<00:03:12.390> just<00:03:12.570> going<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.780> be

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
great and so I'm just going to be

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.509 
great and so I'm just going to be
completely<00:03:13.380> transparent<00:03:13.769> in<00:03:14.130> my<00:03:14.250> process

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
completely transparent in my process

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.000
