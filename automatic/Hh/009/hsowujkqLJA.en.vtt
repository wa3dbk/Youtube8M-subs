00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.850

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:42.119
 cost him if I take it with me 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:44.119
 water and at first slowly in the creative 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.690
 and I thought this toy 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:51.570
 I'm sure I'll live well in the oven 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.720
 what then do it so hot is it 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.850

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.030
