00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.099
 this signaling to make today 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.619
 It's Sunday morning anyway. 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.960
 and I'll tell you who are reading 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.609
 the continuous physical violence 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.390
 I wish I was saved beyond balance was so intense 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.390
 in the morning in which page was conafisio network but are on page 101 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.339
 I already trained 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.089
 I arrived at the part that deals more quietly and television sa small pieces 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.350
 more sense 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.010
 the acronym 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.360
 the card in a newspaper law 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.060
 appears without acting 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.420
 the newspaper report nh remove the title of the headline what was thinking 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.720
 in mirian account or aliava keep the team in the championship in that part 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.990
 one of them 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.440
 and that yes 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.190
 it's not because I know you're all right and have a week to come talking 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.440
 with three people in mind who was cheated 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.150
 recently 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.610
 No, I'm not understanding anything 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.640
 finally carried out by the government thus alerting of maceiÃ³ pages 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.850
 I do not know what's real at the end of the movie 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.380
 the big screen 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.790
 this scenario does not become a fine 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.790
 To understand what's going on later I'm going to look for something else. 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.200
 some pages that 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.730
 It's time someone did talking about the book explains the day symbol and the 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.800
 Hall 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.260
 eventually a sequence here and not the end of winter 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.420
 Dynamo Bucharest If I understood something because 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.770
 to allow serving 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.430
 it is a matter of interest to see how it moves away from the roads 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.010
 traveling 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.079
 he has notion 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.780
 57 pages so it went well 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.780
 160 pages nothing 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.880
 demetrius 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.250
 the peak 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.070
 I do not know if anyone there is on leave and helps the molex people of a 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.510
 force 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.720
 admission is free 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.740
 I recently purchased that it would have interfered brand 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.519
 and then I bought a competent 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.669
 which was so decent his classic 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:14.879
 solana school italy 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.889
 This is the one I met. He is still hospitalized. 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:21.869
 A little bit of reservation in the introduction pages 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:26.609
 and then I realize that in the first chapter the boy approve 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:27.610
 any amendment 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.959
 luciana rodrigues living here 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.370
 furthermore admits tug air as you already know how you read a book so 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.380
 dreamed and your son is called the dreamed 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.939
 then it would seem that law would have to be eliminated from the program at last I found a 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:44.849
 virtual environment 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.339
 so the cell phone 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:49.579
 teresinha who tried a few pages 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.579
 is that the situation here is the first opinion 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.609
 becky who has a wallet has grown a little different because I know that I 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.660
 I have in classics of the American classics 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.450
 has a different texture the rates are also different option and those of the 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.729
 our classic of the British 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:08.969
 The decision will provoke a very sweet conversation. 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:11.289
 if my low temperature here 

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:15.369
 and acceptance wonders had risen and superstrings inscribed each continent 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:18.009
 front and everything else then 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:19.780
 the clean sheet law 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.780
 I like you was yellow indicates great 

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:26.929
 finally the impression that it is less tiring in the opening 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:31.429
 so it's ok then I stopped a little bit more about how it ended 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:32.999
 But ready 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:37.629
 and then something that is difficult because he did and also morumbi solidity 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.829
 we have to respect 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.139
 in fact they do not live in the southern cemtec-ms place in their moral beliefs 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:47.539
 they are children 

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:52.239
 she was scared of the September leaves at the time of purchase the two are friends 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:54.869
 and so 

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:59.279
 are stories for children if more so confuse the fine if the present 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:00.249
 received here 

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:03.249
 I'm almost finishing in January. 

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:06.339
 in chapter 25 already 

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:09.829
 is the murdered content the boys are 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.909
 Witnesses of murder then have well-planted feet well despite being 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:14.499
 a book 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:16.769
 for children super humorous 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.299
 he was crazy but he makes some jokes while he tells the story 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.080
 he converses with the reader directly on average 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.080
 and this is one but very cool footprint 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.150
 he this thing of parral the history 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.740
 to talk with other readers after returning storytelling 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.460
 it's even better 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.440
 the Berlin chat - yes have a partner but so the difference if you want it to be 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.849
 accompanied by marfrig 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.249
 said that hiring happens 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:46.819
 and there the guy 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:51.259
 we want 10% of the Swiss that was written in the late 19th century 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.939
 There is a lot of jargon and many dialects know 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:05:00.729
 would it be that the blacks here at the time still had the captain and daughter 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.289
 so sometimes it happens 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.199
 Anyway, if you knew that it would be so the writing is difficult but when you hear everything 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.460
 is well - passed away from the ig-m has passed from something they do not forgive 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.870
 then the guy who does goal has a bit of both I doubt it will leave a 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.870
 covered 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:28.449
 even so the guy who wrote the introduction of the vote or the purchase and withdrawal 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.469
 he is a musician 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:32.039
 the British 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:36.119
 and attention he says he has to get that book he had to 

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:40.129
 we imagine the American accent to see the southern accent 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:44.770
 then kill me in secret and made necessary very intense stresses that 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.770
 we are short near the child so it draws enough attention 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:51.909
 finally evidence has already been made 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:55.739
 again the singer in a random thing here so the first time 

00:05:55.739 --> 00:05:58.930
 the size of the work is proven to buy scorpion by email 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.199
 I watched the movie but I could not sleep at all 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:03.599
 deficient 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:05.770
 Who has seen the allen movie? 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.669
 thomas and penamacor arriving in iraq and points to such a fast and 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:13.169
 pushing limits of risk pigment 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:15.369
 but I found it very cute very funny 

00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:19.239
 and then do not start buying more perfect the work even a condominium 

00:06:19.239 --> 00:06:20.539
 I'm not finished yet 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:24.770
 I understand that this is developed here is the 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.139
 border fill 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.139
 and have the three are need municipal nursery 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:33.839
 I had not forgotten Portuguese. 

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:36.949
 buy three volumes of sun and can even stop 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:41.509
 which each issue costs 26 reais 

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:43.870
 the pleasure the brazilian team alecsandro 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:44.960
 Two in one 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.940
 rita rat 35 something like that but finally start like no one but now not 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.309
 okay, everything right 

00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:56.069
 then to supply this absence of a resident who is a very good city that 

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:59.270
 rewarded my mother and the Canadian 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.699
 and anyway 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:04.469
 USA the film is also a fishing breed itiquira terminal read here 

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:09.110
 it is hoped that one thing of those films again and sorting the two together 

00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:11.080
 face 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:16.590
 neymar however to refer you to the licensing of lights with pm the man 

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:17.550

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:18.770
 vacation 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.919
 only then what situations of conflict are you reading?
