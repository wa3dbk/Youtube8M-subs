00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
to be different like I already did the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.790 
to be different like I already did the
second<00:00:23.820> half<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.330> tutorial<00:00:24.529> so<00:00:25.529> here's

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800

second half of the tutorial so here's
the<00:00:25.920> first<00:00:25.949> half<00:00:26.460> um<00:00:27.109> what<00:00:28.109> we're<00:00:28.289> using<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:29.070> a

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
the first half um what we're using is a

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.620 
the first half um what we're using is a
nickel<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.779> jumbo<00:00:31.740> braid<00:00:32.149> now<00:00:33.149> when<00:00:33.480> you're

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
nickel on jumbo braid now when you're

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.500 
nickel on jumbo braid now when you're
shopping<00:00:33.870> for<00:00:34.170> your<00:00:35.040> synthetic<00:00:35.610> hair<00:00:36.059> you're

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
synthetic hair like the synthetic

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.760 
synthetic hair like the synthetic
braiding<00:00:41.579> hair<00:00:41.879> because<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:42.960> not<00:00:43.200> going<00:00:43.260> to

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
braiding hair because it's not going to

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.350

Kinect lon to Kelly on and basically the
higher<00:00:52.590> ends<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:54.000> he'll<00:00:54.180> get<00:00:54.360> sorry<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
higher ends but this he'll get sorry the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.170 
higher ends but this he'll get sorry the
connect<00:00:55.469> lon<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.280> best<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:57.000> use

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.920 
it should be good so I've separated this
is<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.930> main<00:02:43.890> piece<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.700> asset<00:02:45.120> just<00:02:45.390> here<00:02:45.900> for

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
is the main piece of asset just here for

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.270 
is the main piece of asset just here for
now<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:47.600> this<00:02:48.600> is<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:49.050> section<00:02:49.290> for<00:02:49.890> my<00:02:50.040> first

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
now and this is the section for my first

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.430 
now and this is the section for my first
read<00:02:51.020> now<00:02:52.020> in<00:02:52.530> order<00:02:52.770> to<00:02:52.920> start<00:02:53.610> driving<00:02:54.440> the

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
read now in order to start driving the

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.770 
read now in order to start driving the
hair<00:02:55.620> falls<00:02:56.100> apart<00:02:56.520> pretty<00:02:56.910> easily<00:02:57.090> so<00:02:57.540> you

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
hair falls apart pretty easily so you

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.720 
hair falls apart pretty easily so you
want<00:02:58.050> to<00:02:58.140> make<00:02:58.170> sure<00:02:58.290> it's<00:02:58.560> anchored<00:02:58.950> what<00:02:59.700> I

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
want to make sure it's anchored what I

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.250 
want to make sure it's anchored what I
do<00:02:59.880> is<00:03:00.330> I<00:03:00.570> grab<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:01.020> like<00:03:01.500> this<00:03:01.740> I<00:03:02.040> get<00:03:02.520> a<00:03:02.550> loop<00:03:02.790> I

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
do is I grab it like this I get a loop I

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.580 
do is I grab it like this I get a loop I
stick<00:03:04.260> my<00:03:04.560> two<00:03:04.770> fingers<00:03:05.220> through<00:03:05.550> loop<00:03:07.490> and<00:03:08.490> I

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
stick my two fingers through loop and I

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.410 
stick my two fingers through loop and I
make<00:03:10.590> kind<00:03:10.890> of<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.700> don't<00:03:11.880> know<00:03:12.030> if<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.240> can

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
make kind of a I don't know if you can

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.060 
make kind of a I don't know if you can
see<00:03:12.660> that<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:14.040> like<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.280> bow<00:03:14.490> and<00:03:15.440> I<00:03:16.440> pull<00:03:16.890> it

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
see that and like a bow and I pull it

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.400 
see that and like a bow and I pull it
through<00:03:18.530> so<00:03:19.530> now<00:03:19.770> I<00:03:20.160> got<00:03:20.670> one<00:03:21.000> big<00:03:21.750> lead<00:03:21.990> with

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
through so now I got one big lead with

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.559 
through so now I got one big lead with
two<00:03:22.590> sides<00:03:23.690> from<00:03:24.690> here

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
two sides from here

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.209 
two sides from here
I<00:03:26.629> grab<00:03:27.319> coat<00:03:27.769> hanger<00:03:29.469> stick<00:03:30.469> it<00:03:30.590> through<00:03:30.889> that

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:31.219 
I grab coat hanger stick it through that

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:37.510 
I grab coat hanger stick it through that
loop<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:32.870> pull<00:03:33.790> both<00:03:34.790> ends

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.610 

and<00:03:38.520> then<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.870> make<00:03:39.960> the<00:03:40.140> little<00:03:40.260> bit<00:03:40.440> easier

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
and then to make the little bit easier

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.500 
and then to make the little bit easier
so<00:03:41.130> I<00:03:41.190> don't<00:03:41.340> have<00:03:41.430> all<00:03:41.550> this<00:03:41.700> extra<00:03:41.880> hair<00:03:42.240> all

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
so I don't have all this extra hair all

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.320 
so I don't have all this extra hair all
over<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:42.930> place<00:03:43.490> usually<00:03:44.490> I'll<00:03:44.610> just<00:03:44.760> kind<00:03:45.210> of

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
over the place usually I'll just kind of

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.270 
over the place usually I'll just kind of
wrap<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.140> end<00:03:46.320> that<00:03:46.620> I'm<00:03:46.740> not<00:03:46.890> going<00:03:47.070> to<00:03:47.160> work

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
wrap the end that I'm not going to work

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.340 
wrap the end that I'm not going to work
with<00:03:47.520> first<00:03:47.900> just<00:03:48.900> around<00:03:49.200> that<00:03:50.030> side<00:03:51.200> so<00:03:52.200> now

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
with first just around that side so now

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.470 
with first just around that side so now
we've<00:03:52.620> got<00:03:52.800> this<00:03:53.070> side<00:03:53.370> is<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:54.060> first<00:03:54.300> side

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
we've got this side is the first side
