I was tap it out on my hand so that it's

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.450 
I was tap it out on my hand so that it's
not<00:01:19.549> so<00:01:19.820> severe<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.770> then<00:01:21.950> you<00:01:22.069> just<00:01:22.280> start

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
not so severe and then you just start

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.859 
not so severe and then you just start
applying<00:01:22.759> it<00:01:22.939> in<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.090> shape<00:01:23.420> of<00:01:23.569> the<00:01:23.630> facial

00:01:23.869 --> 00:02:09.960 
applying it in the shape of the facial
hair

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.060 

okay<00:02:10.970> now<00:02:11.150> that<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.480> blue<00:02:11.720> is<00:02:11.930> on<00:02:12.140> you<00:02:12.710> can<00:02:12.860> see

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
okay now that the blue is on you can see

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.550 
okay now that the blue is on you can see
that<00:02:13.100> it's<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.550> nice<00:02:13.700> like<00:02:14.240> kind<00:02:14.810> of<00:02:14.990> subtle

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
that it's a nice like kind of subtle

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.880 
that it's a nice like kind of subtle
step<00:02:16.360> sometimes<00:02:17.360> I<00:02:17.630> do<00:02:17.690> this<00:02:17.930> even<00:02:18.320> when<00:02:18.590> it's

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
step sometimes I do this even when it's

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.620 
step sometimes I do this even when it's
a<00:02:19.040> guy<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.400> doesn't<00:02:19.610> necessarily<00:02:20.390> have

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
a guy that doesn't necessarily have

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.250 
a guy that doesn't necessarily have
stubble

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
stubble

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.610 
stubble
I'll<00:02:21.500> just<00:02:21.830> darken<00:02:22.280> oh<00:02:22.840> very<00:02:23.840> tiny<00:02:24.290> bit

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
I'll just darken oh very tiny bit

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.790 
I'll just darken oh very tiny bit
because<00:02:25.130> it<00:02:25.310> helps<00:02:26.170> make<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.290> face<00:02:27.470> look<00:02:27.500> a

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
because it helps make the face look a

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.100 
because it helps make the face look a
little<00:02:27.950> more<00:02:28.130> masculine<00:02:28.600> because<00:02:29.600> no<00:02:29.870> guys

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
little more masculine because no guys

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.980 
little more masculine because no guys
are<00:02:30.590> absolutely<00:02:31.550> perfectly<00:02:32.150> when<00:02:32.600> you<00:02:32.720> shave

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
are absolutely perfectly when you shave

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.040 
are absolutely perfectly when you shave
and<00:02:33.020> unless<00:02:33.440> they<00:02:33.650> just<00:02:34.370> shave<00:02:34.760> or<00:02:35.450> most<00:02:35.870> guys

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
and unless they just shave or most guys

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.710 
and unless they just shave or most guys
aren't<00:02:37.420> so<00:02:39.220> then<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.370> next<00:02:40.520> step<00:02:40.730> is<00:02:41.300> the

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
aren't so then the next step is the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.010 
aren't so then the next step is the
actual<00:02:41.870> stove<00:02:42.350> part<00:02:42.880> which<00:02:43.880> take<00:02:44.840> your

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
actual stove part which take your

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.540 
actual stove part which take your
stubble<00:02:45.260> sponge<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:45.950> put<00:02:46.430> it<00:02:46.520> in<00:02:46.820> makeup<00:02:47.720> I

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
stubble sponge and put it in makeup I

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.760 
stubble sponge and put it in makeup I
keep<00:02:49.550> I<00:02:50.000> try<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.510> have<00:02:50.870> a<00:02:50.900> light<00:02:51.200> hand<00:02:51.530> with

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
keep I try to have a light hand with

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.710 
keep I try to have a light hand with
this<00:02:51.950> because<00:02:52.490> if<00:02:52.610> you<00:02:52.640> do<00:02:52.850> it<00:02:52.970> too<00:02:53.210> dark<00:02:53.480> it's

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
this because if you do it too dark it's

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.480 
this because if you do it too dark it's
going<00:02:53.900> to<00:02:53.960> be<00:02:54.020> really<00:02:54.290> obvious<00:02:54.470> whereas<00:02:55.310> if

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
going to be really obvious whereas if

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.360 
going to be really obvious whereas if
you<00:02:55.670> do<00:02:56.390> it<00:02:56.510> very<00:02:56.720> lightly<00:02:56.980> it's<00:02:57.980> a<00:02:58.070> lot<00:02:58.220> more

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
you do it very lightly it's a lot more

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.810 
you do it very lightly it's a lot more
subtle<00:02:58.780> I<00:02:59.780> also<00:03:00.350> usually<00:03:00.710> tap<00:03:01.220> it<00:03:01.370> out<00:03:01.460> on<00:03:01.700> the

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
subtle I also usually tap it out on the

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.710 
subtle I also usually tap it out on the
back<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.120> my<00:03:02.240> hand

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
back of my hand

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.270 
back of my hand
right<00:03:02.930> after<00:03:03.140> I<00:03:03.170> put<00:03:03.440> it<00:03:03.470> in<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.710> makeup<00:03:04.040> just

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
right after I put it in the makeup just

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.040 
right after I put it in the makeup just
to<00:03:04.400> make<00:03:04.940> sure<00:03:05.120> I'm<00:03:05.240> not<00:03:05.270> having<00:03:05.720> any<00:03:05.900> like

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
to make sure I'm not having any like

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.500 
to make sure I'm not having any like
really<00:03:06.740> heavy<00:03:06.980> splotches<00:03:07.970> in<00:03:08.120> case<00:03:08.300> it

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
chin cloth that's going to be really

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.220 
chin cloth that's going to be really
dark<00:03:31.340> and<00:03:32.240> you<00:03:32.360> can<00:03:32.510> take<00:03:32.720> a<00:03:32.750> chin<00:03:33.050> cleft

really<00:03:33.709> easily<00:03:34.040> with<00:03:34.459> stubble<00:03:35.680> just<00:03:36.680> because

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
really easily with stubble just because

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.590 
really easily with stubble just because
it's<00:03:37.010> not<00:03:37.430> an<00:03:37.640> area<00:03:37.790> they<00:03:38.060> can<00:03:38.120> shave<00:03:38.450> in

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
it's not an area they can shave in

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.850 
it's not an area they can shave in
easily<00:03:39.130> another<00:03:40.130> area<00:03:40.520> that<00:03:40.550> I<00:03:40.730> do<00:03:40.850> the

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
easily another area that I do the

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.400 
easily another area that I do the
darkest<00:03:42.860> is<00:03:43.130> along<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.240> jaw<00:03:44.450> line<00:03:44.480> because

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
darkest is along the jaw line because

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.240 
darkest is along the jaw line because
it's<00:03:45.650> multiple<00:03:46.220> angles<00:03:46.730> that<00:03:47.000> are<00:03:47.150> showing

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
it's multiple angles that are showing

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.790 
it's multiple angles that are showing
and<00:03:49.250> that<00:03:49.760> just<00:03:50.030> in<00:03:50.450> general<00:03:50.690> tends<00:03:51.320> to<00:03:51.530> be<00:03:51.680> the

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
and that just in general tends to be the

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.000 
and that just in general tends to be the
darkest<00:03:52.480> and<00:03:53.480> also<00:03:53.959> don't<00:03:54.110> forget<00:03:54.230> to<00:03:54.530> go<00:03:54.800> on

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
darkest and also don't forget to go on

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.730 
darkest and also don't forget to go on
the<00:03:55.130> neck<00:03:55.310> a<00:03:55.340> little<00:03:55.459> bit<00:03:55.670> because<00:03:56.440> most<00:03:57.440> guys

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
the neck a little bit because most guys

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.550 
the neck a little bit because most guys
unless<00:03:58.310> they<00:03:58.520> like<00:03:58.760> really<00:03:59.000> shave<00:03:59.420> a<00:03:59.600> lot<00:03:59.780> so

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
unless they like really shave a lot so

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.980 
unless they like really shave a lot so
we<00:04:00.680> do<00:04:00.800> a<00:04:00.830> lot<00:04:00.980> of<00:04:01.100> grooming<00:04:01.420> they<00:04:02.420> don't<00:04:02.630> just

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
have like a clean line so it should be

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:13.970 
have like a clean line so it should be
firm

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:05:12.350 

you

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.930
