really<00:00:52.840> when<00:00:53.840> you're<00:00:53.960> driving<00:00:54.200> a<00:00:54.410> Jaguar<00:00:54.649> you

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
really when you're driving a Jaguar you

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.650 
really when you're driving a Jaguar you
feel<00:00:55.250> what's<00:00:55.820> going<00:00:56.059> on<00:00:56.149> underneath<00:00:56.480> the

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
feel what's going on underneath the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.209 
feel what's going on underneath the
bonnet<00:00:56.960> you<00:00:57.110> feel<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.379> engine<00:00:57.500> you<00:00:57.890> feel<00:00:58.100> the

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
bonnet you feel the engine you feel the

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:59.850 
bonnet you feel the engine you feel the
speed<00:00:58.489> I<00:00:58.700> think<00:00:59.059> nothing<00:00:59.300> much<00:00:59.600> has<00:00:59.780> changed

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
speed I think nothing much has changed

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.040 
speed I think nothing much has changed
from<00:01:00.860> 60<00:01:01.430> years<00:01:01.579> ago<00:01:01.610> until<00:01:02.030> now<00:01:02.270> you<00:01:02.840> still

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
from 60 years ago until now you still

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.510 
from 60 years ago until now you still
get<00:01:03.170> that<00:01:03.199> same<00:01:03.469> feeling<00:01:03.530> with<00:01:03.860> a<00:01:03.949> jegging<00:01:04.160> so

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:04.520 
get that same feeling with a jegging so

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.450 
get that same feeling with a jegging so
I'm<00:01:05.119> looking<00:01:05.270> forward<00:01:05.600> for<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:07.100> specific

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
I'm looking forward for the specific

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.639 
I'm looking forward for the specific
challenges<00:01:08.030> that<00:01:08.180> we<00:01:08.330> face<00:01:08.600> as<00:01:09.020> you<00:01:09.470> might

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
challenges that we face as you might

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:11.410 
challenges that we face as you might
well<00:01:09.860> see<00:01:10.130> it's<00:01:10.340> freezing<00:01:10.789> cold<00:01:10.819> it's

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
well see it's freezing cold it's

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.840 
well see it's freezing cold it's
actually<00:01:11.600> starting<00:01:11.959> to<00:01:12.170> rain<00:01:12.440> now<00:01:12.470> and<00:01:12.950> the

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
actually starting to rain now and the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.880 
actually starting to rain now and the
piece<00:01:14.030> of<00:01:14.179> road<00:01:14.360> that<00:01:14.390> we<00:01:14.630> have<00:01:14.899> to<00:01:15.380> do<00:01:15.500> this<00:01:15.679> on

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
piece of road that we have to do this on

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.010 
piece of road that we have to do this on
he's<00:01:16.100> actually<00:01:16.250> very<00:01:16.429> very<00:01:16.819> bumpy<00:01:17.209> I<00:01:17.600> think

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
he's actually very very bumpy I think

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.449 
he's actually very very bumpy I think
the<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.470> reason<00:01:18.590> for<00:01:18.800> the<00:01:18.860> bumps<00:01:19.160> are<00:01:19.340> though

00:01:19.449 --> 00:01:19.459 
the the reason for the bumps are though

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:21.430 
the the reason for the bumps are though
tree<00:01:19.759> roots<00:01:20.000> actually<00:01:20.330> growing<00:01:21.080> up<00:01:21.259> through

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
tree roots actually growing up through

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.040 
tree roots actually growing up through
the<00:01:21.619> surface<00:01:21.860> of<00:01:22.099> the<00:01:22.220> road<00:01:22.429> so<00:01:23.149> yeah<00:01:24.020> I

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
the surface of the road so yeah I

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.469 
the surface of the road so yeah I
imagine<00:01:24.410> it<00:01:24.860> nearly<00:01:25.399> 300<00:01:25.670> kilometres<00:01:26.060> an<00:01:26.360> hour

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
imagine it nearly 300 kilometres an hour

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:27.520 
imagine it nearly 300 kilometres an hour
it's<00:01:26.690> not<00:01:26.780> going<00:01:26.869> to<00:01:26.959> be<00:01:27.050> a<00:01:27.080> walk<00:01:27.259> in<00:01:27.289> the<00:01:27.440> park

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
it's not going to be a walk in the park

00:01:27.530 --> 00:02:06.570 
it's not going to be a walk in the park
but<00:01:28.369> it<00:01:28.490> will<00:01:28.640> be<00:01:28.670> exciting

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.280 

I'm<00:02:07.580> gonna<00:02:07.820> turn<00:02:08.030> sneaker<00:02:08.600> to<00:02:08.750> run<00:02:08.930> in<00:02:09.080> if<00:02:09.200> I

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
I'm gonna turn sneaker to run in if I

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.070
