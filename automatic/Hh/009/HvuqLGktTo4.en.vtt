you<00:01:54.270> know<00:01:54.360> sometimes<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.869> just<00:01:54.899> got<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.200> go

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
you know sometimes you just got to go

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.480 
you know sometimes you just got to go
through<00:01:55.470> some<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.740> growing<00:01:55.950> pains<00:01:56.189> and

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
through some of the growing pains and

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.709 
through some of the growing pains and
then<00:01:56.670> some<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.060> lumps<00:01:57.270> along<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.570> way<00:01:57.659> but

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
then some of the lumps along the way but

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.170 
then some of the lumps along the way but
I<00:01:58.200> do<00:01:58.530> think<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.159> way<00:01:59.280> we<00:01:59.399> finished<00:01:59.700> leaves<00:02:00.090> us

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
I do think the way we finished leaves us

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.820 
I do think the way we finished leaves us

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.210 
thing is about the BC Lions just in
general<00:03:07.050> as<00:03:07.380> they<00:03:07.500> spend<00:03:07.739> a<00:03:07.769> lot<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:07.950> times

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
general as they spend a lot of times

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.790 
general as they spend a lot of times
with<00:03:08.670> kids<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.300> it's<00:03:09.690> such<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.870> great<00:03:10.080> thing<00:03:10.200> to

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
with kids and it's such a great thing to

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.350 
with kids and it's such a great thing to
give<00:03:11.100> that<00:03:11.280> back<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.730> community<00:03:11.940> is<00:03:12.239> that

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
give that back to the community is that

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.120 
give that back to the community is that
why<00:03:12.510> you<00:03:12.570> started<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.959> camp<00:03:13.170> yeah<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.709> think

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
why you started the camp yeah I think

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.830 
why you started the camp yeah I think
definitely<00:03:14.310> have<00:03:14.610> you<00:03:14.730> I've<00:03:14.970> been<00:03:15.420> with<00:03:15.570> Wally

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
definitely have you I've been with Wally

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.020 
definitely have you I've been with Wally
in<00:03:16.680> Calgary<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.250> think<00:03:17.489> what<00:03:17.640> he<00:03:17.820> brought

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
in Calgary and I think what he brought

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.400 
in Calgary and I think what he brought
to<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.300> Lions<00:03:18.630> was<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.810> sense<00:03:19.140> of<00:03:19.230> community

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
to the Lions was a sense of community

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.410 
to the Lions was a sense of community
and<00:03:19.769> guys<00:03:20.340> had<00:03:20.580> to<00:03:20.700> do<00:03:20.820> so<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.030> think<00:03:21.150> that's

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
and guys had to do so I think that's

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.330 
and guys had to do so I think that's
what<00:03:21.540> we<00:03:21.780> were<00:03:21.810> missing<00:03:21.959> before<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:23.040> because

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
what we were missing before and because

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.490 
what we were missing before and because
I<00:03:23.430> grew<00:03:23.580> up<00:03:23.640> here<00:03:23.760> as<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.840> Lions<00:03:25.200> weren't<00:03:25.380> in

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
I grew up here as the Lions weren't in

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.780 
I grew up here as the Lions weren't in
the<00:03:25.590> community<00:03:25.980> weren't<00:03:26.190> doing<00:03:26.370> as<00:03:26.430> much<00:03:26.580> and

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
the community weren't doing as much and

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.160 
the community weren't doing as much and
I<00:03:26.820> think<00:03:26.850> wally<00:03:27.180> brought<00:03:27.420> that<00:03:27.570> from<00:03:27.720> Calgary

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
I think wally brought that from Calgary

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.320 
I think wally brought that from Calgary
as<00:03:28.320> a<00:03:28.769> sense<00:03:29.040> of<00:03:29.130> community<00:03:29.280> get<00:03:29.970> out<00:03:30.060> there
