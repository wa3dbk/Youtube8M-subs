you dodged i think but it is more like

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.750 
you dodged i think but it is more like
it<00:03:09.910> looks<00:03:10.030> more<00:03:10.180> physical<00:03:11.160> what<00:03:12.160> should<00:03:12.579> they

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.070 
period on a 21-day cleanse they might
they<00:04:59.729> might<00:04:59.970> how<00:05:00.240> about<00:05:00.390> just<00:05:00.600> a<00:05:00.690> big<00:05:00.840> up<00:05:01.050> here

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080

well<00:05:04.950> I<00:05:04.979> think<00:05:05.340> a<00:05:05.430> comment<00:05:05.669> symptom<00:05:06.120> might<00:05:06.300> be

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
well I think a comment symptom might be

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.210 
well I think a comment symptom might be
if<00:05:06.690> someone<00:05:07.050> is<00:05:07.260> eating<00:05:07.440> a<00:05:07.650> lot<00:05:07.770> of<00:05:07.860> processed
