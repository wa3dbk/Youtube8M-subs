Wolverine which one do you think is you

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:04.760 
Wolverine which one do you think is you
think<00:02:02.429> it's<00:02:02.579> like<00:02:02.959> the<00:02:03.959> first<00:02:04.139> one<00:02:04.319> I<00:02:04.380> did<00:02:04.409> you

know<00:02:04.859> tortillas<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.609> think<00:02:05.759> series<00:02:06.090> three

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
know tortillas I think series three

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.880 
know tortillas I think series three
Wolverine<00:02:07.079> or

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
Wolverine or

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.040 
Wolverine or
or<00:02:08.340> maybe<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.790> savage<00:02:09.150> Wolverine<00:02:09.600> out<00:02:09.780> that's

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
or maybe the savage Wolverine out that's

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.210 
or maybe the savage Wolverine out that's
arguably<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.650> worst

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
arguably the worst

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.430 
arguably the worst
yeah<00:02:12.150> that's<00:02:12.330> targeted<00:02:12.810> where<00:02:12.960> single<00:02:13.110> reason

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
yeah that's targeted where single reason

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.810 
yeah that's targeted where single reason
I<00:02:13.500> don't<00:02:13.590> think<00:02:13.860> that's<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.310> seven<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.700> over

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
I don't think that's the seven to over

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.810 
I don't think that's the seven to over
here's<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.030> worst<00:02:15.270> is<00:02:16.130> because<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.310> can<00:02:17.490> take

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
here's the worst is because you can take

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.310 
here's the worst is because you can take
