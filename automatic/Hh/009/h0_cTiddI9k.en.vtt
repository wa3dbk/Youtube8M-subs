actually set up flush a little bit

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.100 
actually set up flush a little bit
better<00:01:28.470> with<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.390> one's<00:01:30.570> pretty

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
better with it so so that one's pretty

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.840 
better with it so so that one's pretty
typical<00:01:31.320> another<00:01:31.860> way<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.040> do<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.250> here<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.700> you

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850

going to see we can maximize our all the
way<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:43.730> that<00:02:43.880> gets<00:02:44.060> us<00:02:44.180> really<00:02:44.480> close<00:02:44.810> right

right now I have the drawer front setup
I<00:03:41.600> have<00:03:42.019> a<00:03:42.049> gap<00:03:42.350> of<00:03:42.560> about<00:03:42.650> 1/8<00:03:43.040> diminish<00:03:43.370> here

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
I have a gap of about 1/8 diminish here

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.880 
I have a gap of about 1/8 diminish here
but<00:03:43.790> it<00:03:43.850> looks<00:03:44.000> like<00:03:44.120> it's<00:03:44.299> about<00:03:44.709> 3/16<00:03:45.709> of<00:03:45.799> an

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
but it looks like it's about 3/16 of an

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:46.990 
but it looks like it's about 3/16 of an
inch<00:03:45.980> over<00:03:46.160> there<00:03:46.340> so<00:03:46.489> I'm<00:03:46.610> gonna<00:03:46.700> do<00:03:46.820> is<00:03:46.880> to

up<00:03:54.860> so<00:03:55.400> basically<00:03:55.760> like<00:03:56.360> by<00:03:56.660> unscrewing<00:03:57.170> it

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
up so basically like by unscrewing it

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.090 
up so basically like by unscrewing it
just<00:03:57.500> a<00:03:57.590> little<00:03:57.709> bit

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
just a little bit

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.310 
just a little bit
I'm<00:03:58.820> moving<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.269> hinge<00:03:59.450> out<00:03:59.690> so<00:03:59.959> I'm<00:04:00.049> gonna<00:04:00.140> do

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
I'm moving the hinge out so I'm gonna do

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.520 
I'm moving the hinge out so I'm gonna do
a<00:04:00.350> counterclockwise<00:04:01.010> I<00:04:01.989> would<00:04:02.989> go<00:04:03.140> with<00:04:03.290> about

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
a counterclockwise I would go with about

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.090 
a counterclockwise I would go with about
a<00:04:03.560> half<00:04:03.860> a<00:04:04.010> turn<00:04:04.190> when<00:04:04.430> you're<00:04:04.579> adjusting

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
a half a turn when you're adjusting

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.490 
a half a turn when you're adjusting
each<00:04:05.220> time<00:04:05.460> and<00:04:06.030> that's<00:04:06.210> nice<00:04:06.420> because<00:04:06.600> half<00:04:07.470> a

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
each time and that's nice because half a

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.630 
each time and that's nice because half a
turn<00:04:07.740> gets<00:04:07.980> you<00:04:08.040> that<00:04:08.190> much

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
turn gets you that much

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.890 
turn gets you that much
in<00:04:08.760> fact<00:04:08.940> that's<00:04:09.090> actually<00:04:09.240> got<00:04:09.480> perfect

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
in fact that's actually got perfect

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.890 
in fact that's actually got perfect
right<00:04:10.440> there<00:04:10.470> I<00:04:11.240> need<00:04:12.240> to<00:04:12.300> do<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.480> same<00:04:12.660> thing

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
right there I need to do the same thing

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.660 
right there I need to do the same thing
if<00:04:13.020> you<00:04:13.110> need<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.320> door<00:04:13.470> to<00:04:13.560> go<00:04:13.680> down<00:04:13.980> or<00:04:14.430> shift

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
if you need the door to go down or shift

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:15.890 
if you need the door to go down or shift
down<00:04:14.880> let's<00:04:15.180> say<00:04:15.240> that<00:04:15.360> this<00:04:15.480> gap<00:04:15.690> was<00:04:15.840> too

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
down let's say that this gap was too

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.229 
down let's say that this gap was too
tight<00:04:16.230> up<00:04:16.380> here<00:04:16.410> then<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:17.520> can<00:04:17.640> either<00:04:17.730> pull

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
tight up here then you can either pull

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.790 
tight up here then you can either pull
this<00:04:18.420> one<00:04:18.570> in<00:04:18.720> you<00:04:18.989> can<00:04:19.110> you<00:04:19.320> can<00:04:19.470> screw<00:04:19.709> this

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:19.800 
this one in you can you can screw this

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.050 
this one in you can you can screw this
one<00:04:19.950> in<00:04:20.130> which<00:04:20.340> it<00:04:20.489> moves<00:04:20.640> the<00:04:20.730> door<00:04:20.880> down<00:04:21.030> a

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
one in which it moves the door down a

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.760 
one in which it moves the door down a
little<00:04:21.239> bit<00:04:21.390> or<00:04:21.989> you<00:04:22.020> can<00:04:22.230> move<00:04:22.350> this<00:04:22.410> one<00:04:22.560> out

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
little bit or you can move this one out

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.580 
little bit or you can move this one out
and<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.640> idea<00:04:23.880> here<00:04:24.140> when<00:04:25.140> looking<00:04:25.410> at<00:04:25.500> the

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
and the idea here when looking at the

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.140 
and the idea here when looking at the
cab<00:04:25.770> me<00:04:25.890> you<00:04:26.040> really<00:04:26.250> want<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.820> reveals

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
cab me you really want the the reveals

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.060 
cab me you really want the the reveals
so<00:04:27.420> basically<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:28.020> gap<00:04:28.230> from<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.770> edge<00:04:28.890> of

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
so basically the gap from the edge of

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.770 
so basically the gap from the edge of
the<00:04:29.130> door<00:04:29.280> to<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.520> edge<00:04:29.610> of<00:04:29.730> the<00:04:29.820> case<00:04:30.030> to<00:04:30.330> be

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
the door to the edge of the case to be

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.240 
the door to the edge of the case to be
the<00:04:30.840> same<00:04:31.050> on<00:04:31.230> this<00:04:31.350> side<00:04:31.410> of<00:04:31.590> the<00:04:31.710> cabinet<00:04:32.100> as

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
the same on this side of the cabinet as

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.940 
the same on this side of the cabinet as
it<00:04:32.400> is<00:04:32.520> on<00:04:32.700> this<00:04:32.820> side<00:04:33.030> now<00:04:33.720> technically<00:04:34.200> I'm

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
it is on this side now technically I'm

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.770
