ride<00:00:33.059> real<00:00:33.270> tight<00:00:33.480> trails<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.530> for<00:00:35.010> me<00:00:35.100> this

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
ride real tight trails and for me this

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.760 
ride real tight trails and for me this
the<00:00:35.670> stock<00:00:35.940> settings<00:00:36.450> are<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.870> little<00:00:37.590> too

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
the stock settings are a little too

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.240 
the stock settings are a little too
heavy<00:00:37.950> they<00:00:38.280> may<00:00:39.410> make<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> bike<00:00:40.710> feel<00:00:40.980> heavy

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
heavy they may make the bike feel heavy

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.250 
heavy they may make the bike feel heavy
when<00:00:42.180> you're<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.600> know<00:00:42.629> whip<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:42.989> up<00:00:43.079> between

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
when you're you know whip it up between

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.020 
when you're you know whip it up between
the<00:00:43.469> trees<00:00:43.770> or<00:00:44.629> through<00:00:45.629> some<00:00:45.809> plate<00:00:45.960> sections

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
the trees or through some plate sections

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.080 
the trees or through some plate sections
so<00:00:48.030> my<00:00:48.780> my<00:00:49.379> settings<00:00:49.980> makes<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> wider

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
so my my settings makes it have a wider

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.549 
so my my settings makes it have a wider
feel<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.690> know<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.870> don't<00:00:52.050> really<00:00:52.320> notice

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
feel you know you don't really notice

feel you know you don't really notice
you<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> damper<00:00:53.280> on<00:00:53.309> man<00:00:54.739> so<00:00:55.739> what<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.890> do<00:00:55.980> is

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
you have a damper on man so what I do is

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.430 
you have a damper on man so what I do is
on<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.059> low<00:00:57.210> speed<00:00:57.270> which<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> knob<00:00:58.199> here

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
on the low speed which is the knob here

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.090 
on the low speed which is the knob here
and<00:00:59.340> by<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.760> way<00:00:59.940> all<00:01:00.180> all<00:01:00.750> dampers<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:01.890> wide

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
and by the way all all dampers it's wide

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.179 
and by the way all all dampers it's wide
sleeve<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.550> Racing<00:01:02.910> come<00:01:03.120> with<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.480> knob

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
sleeve and Racing come with this knob

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.950 
sleeve and Racing come with this knob
one<00:01:05.189> from<00:01:05.430> other<00:01:05.519> sources<00:01:06.380> they<00:01:07.380> easily<00:01:07.500> dump

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
one from other sources they easily dump

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.020 
one from other sources they easily dump
but<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.320> little<00:01:10.560> speed<00:01:10.799> up<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.700> turn

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
but this is little speed up and so turn

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.840 
but this is little speed up and so turn
this<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.420> all<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.720> way<00:01:13.010> clockwise<00:01:14.010> until<00:01:14.610> it

bikes mmm so turn this in until it
bottoms<00:01:46.549> clockwise<00:01:47.549> back<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.750> out

bottoms clockwise back it out
counterclockwise<00:01:49.439> 12<00:01:50.189> clicks<00:01:51.079> this<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
counterclockwise 12 clicks this is the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.139 
counterclockwise 12 clicks this is the
high<00:01:52.530> speed<00:01:52.799> here<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.579> can't<00:01:53.850> take<00:01:54.000> this

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
high speed here and I can't take this

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.940 
high speed here and I can't take this
cap<00:01:54.360> completely<00:01:54.899> off<00:01:55.049> because<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.590> hits<00:01:55.770> my

cap that you pull off it underneath
there<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:02.240> adjuster<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.270> should<00:02:03.600> use<00:02:03.750> a

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
there is a adjuster that should use a

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.740 
there is a adjuster that should use a
flat<00:02:04.110> blade<00:02:04.320> screwdriver<00:02:04.680> on<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.570> sing<00:02:06.570> with

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
flat blade screwdriver on and sing with

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.100 
flat blade screwdriver on and sing with
it<00:02:06.869> turn<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.350> clockwise<00:02:07.819> gently<00:02:09.110> till

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
it turn it in clockwise gently till

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.910 
it turn it in clockwise gently till
globs<00:02:10.379> then<00:02:10.860> back<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.280> out<00:02:11.370> one

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
globs then back it out one

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.900 
globs then back it out one
half-turns<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:13.780> 12<00:02:14.140> turns<00:02:14.500> 12<00:02:15.310> clicks<00:02:15.700> out

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
half-turns so 12 turns 12 clicks out

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.320 
half-turns so 12 turns 12 clicks out
here<00:02:16.270> one<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.260> half<00:02:17.410> turns<00:02:17.680> out<00:02:17.980> here<00:02:18.340> and

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
here one and a half turns out here and

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.850 
here one and a half turns out here and
then<00:02:19.480> adjust<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.840> sweep<00:02:20.140> differently<00:02:20.620> so

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
then adjust the sweep differently so

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.770 
then adjust the sweep differently so
this<00:02:21.580> adjuster<00:02:21.970> here<00:02:22.180> is<00:02:22.300> one<00:02:22.510> on<00:02:22.630> each<00:02:22.750> side

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780

very slick and those do two things one

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.150 
very slick and those do two things one
is<00:03:43.780> they<00:03:43.930> keep<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.290> cable<00:03:44.590> from<00:03:44.680> hanging<00:03:45.040> up

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
is they keep the cable from hanging up

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.670 
is they keep the cable from hanging up
and<00:03:45.310> making<00:03:45.850> this<00:03:45.970> model<00:03:46.329> stick<00:03:46.600> they<00:03:47.470> also

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
and making this model stick they also

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.710 
and making this model stick they also
keep<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.280> cable<00:03:48.609> from<00:03:48.670> rubbing<00:03:48.970> a<00:03:49.150> hole<00:03:49.359> the

against that damper and grip gets on
there<00:03:53.920> it<00:03:54.549> will<00:03:54.670> grind<00:03:54.970> a<00:03:55.090> hole<00:03:55.650> in<00:03:56.650> that

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
there it will grind a hole in that

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.180 
there it will grind a hole in that
damper<00:03:58.350> you<00:03:59.350> wouldn't<00:03:59.590> think<00:03:59.709> that<00:03:59.920> rubber

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
damper you wouldn't think that rubber
