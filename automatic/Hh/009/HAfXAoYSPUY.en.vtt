00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.510 

but<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.780> American<00:01:19.439> version<00:01:19.619> as<00:01:20.280> it

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
but this is the American version as it

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:31.090

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.260 

basically<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:33.030> pain<00:01:34.189> this<00:01:35.189> was<00:01:35.460> either<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
basically to pain this was either the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.990 
basically to pain this was either the
