by<00:01:29.070> everything<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:30.450> then<00:01:31.939> but<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.119> think<00:01:33.600> to

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
by everything and then but I think to

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.020 
by everything and then but I think to
have<00:01:33.780> fixed<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.140> now<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.790> basically<00:01:35.790> what<00:01:35.939> it

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
have fixed it now and basically what it

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.630 
have fixed it now and basically what it
was<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.479> was<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> theater<00:01:37.049> mode<00:01:37.520> and<00:01:38.520> he's

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
was it was the theater mode and he's

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.399 
was it was the theater mode and he's
anything<00:01:39.090> about<00:01:39.329> theater<00:01:39.689> mode<00:01:39.840> recording

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
anything about theater mode recording

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.609 
anything about theater mode recording
off<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> options<00:01:42.290> improves<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.409> lack<00:01:43.590> of

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
off in the options improves the lack of

compensation<00:02:55.240> shit<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:56.290> was<00:02:56.410> in<00:02:56.530> black<00:02:56.710> ops<00:02:56.920> as

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
compensation shit it was in black ops as

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.310 
compensation shit it was in black ops as
well<00:02:57.280> but<00:02:57.520> i<00:02:57.730> think<00:02:58.120> i<00:02:58.270> remember<00:02:58.390> rightly<00:02:58.870> the

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
well but i think i remember rightly the

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.230 
well but i think i remember rightly the
first<00:02:59.530> like<00:02:59.770> weak<00:03:00.220> black<00:03:00.490> ops<00:03:00.700> is<00:03:00.820> out<00:03:00.940> it<00:03:01.120> was

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
first like weak black ops is out it was

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.630 
first like weak black ops is out it was
terrible<00:03:01.750> it<00:03:01.930> was<00:03:01.990> really<00:03:02.470> bad<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:02.890> I<00:03:03.430> think

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
terrible it was really bad and I think

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.010 
terrible it was really bad and I think
it's<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.850> same<00:03:04.030> one<00:03:04.210> off<00:03:04.450> at<00:03:04.630> three<00:03:04.870> so<00:03:04.990> I

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
it's the same one off at three so I

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.170 
it's the same one off at three so I
think<00:03:05.140> they're<00:03:05.350> gonna<00:03:05.470> like<00:03:05.820> patch<00:03:06.820> it<00:03:07.060> and

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
think they're gonna like patch it and

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.570 
think they're gonna like patch it and
don't<00:03:07.390> turn<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:07.900> down<00:03:07.990> a<00:03:08.050> bit<00:03:08.200> but<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.710> yeah

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
don't turn it down a bit but and yeah

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.650 
don't turn it down a bit but and yeah
but<00:03:09.730> if<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:09.850> just<00:03:09.970> turn<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.270> theater<00:03:10.540> mode

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
but if you just turn the theater mode

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.060 
but if you just turn the theater mode
off<00:03:10.840> it<00:03:10.990> seems<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.290> start<00:03:11.530> quite<00:03:11.770> a<00:03:11.800> lot<00:03:11.950> of<00:03:12.010> the

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
off it seems to start quite a lot of the

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.210 
off it seems to start quite a lot of the
like<00:03:12.250> out<00:03:13.110> did<00:03:14.110> for<00:03:14.260> me<00:03:14.350> anyway<00:03:14.710> I<00:03:14.740> don't<00:03:15.010> know
