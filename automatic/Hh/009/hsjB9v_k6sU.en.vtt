the pots together without PVC glue it
looks<00:00:45.159> something<00:00:45.370> like<00:00:45.519> this

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.750 

notice<00:00:56.170> how<00:00:56.320> I<00:00:56.350> drilled<00:00:56.740> two<00:00:57.040> holes<00:00:57.070> on<00:00:57.520> each

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
notice how I drilled two holes on each

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.350 
notice how I drilled two holes on each
side<00:00:58.950> these<00:00:59.950> holes<00:01:00.280> will<00:01:00.520> accompany<00:01:00.730> a<00:01:01.000> wooden

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
side these holes will accompany a wooden

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.350 
side these holes will accompany a wooden
dowel<00:01:01.600> which<00:01:02.350> is<00:01:02.650> about<00:01:02.920> 16<00:01:03.520> centimeters<00:01:04.089> long

and 15 millimeters in diameter now for

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.070 
and 15 millimeters in diameter now for
the<00:01:12.190> chamber<00:01:12.370> part<00:01:12.729> of<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:12.910> blowgun<00:01:13.360> this<00:01:13.900> is

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
the chamber part of the blowgun this is

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.640 
the chamber part of the blowgun this is
just<00:01:14.380> seven<00:01:15.040> PVC<00:01:15.670> pipes<00:01:16.140> all<00:01:17.140> glued<00:01:17.440> together

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
just seven PVC pipes all glued together

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.219 
just seven PVC pipes all glued together
and<00:01:18.190> the<00:01:18.729> pipes<00:01:19.030> are<00:01:19.300> about<00:01:19.510> seven<00:01:19.840> point<00:01:20.020> five

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
and the pipes are about seven point five

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.670 
and the pipes are about seven point five
centimeters<00:01:20.770> long<00:01:22.110> after<00:01:23.110> gluing<00:01:23.440> them<00:01:23.500> all

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
centimeters long after gluing them all

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.950 
centimeters long after gluing them all
together<00:01:23.890> I<00:01:24.130> sanded<00:01:24.790> them<00:01:24.940> flush<00:01:25.479> with

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
together I sanded them flush with

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.600 
together I sanded them flush with
sandpaper<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:28.290> middle<00:01:29.290> pipe<00:01:29.860> accommodates

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
sandpaper the middle pipe accommodates

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.150 
sandpaper the middle pipe accommodates
the<00:01:31.030> dowel<00:01:31.630> and<00:01:31.990> it<00:01:32.410> should<00:01:32.590> be<00:01:32.710> able<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:32.950> spin

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
the dowel and it should be able to spin

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.960 
the dowel and it should be able to spin
freely<00:01:35.009> after<00:01:36.009> putting<00:01:36.220> everything<00:01:36.640> together

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
freely after putting everything together

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.590 
freely after putting everything together
it<00:01:37.420> looks<00:01:37.450> something<00:01:37.840> like<00:01:38.020> this<00:01:39.330> now<00:01:40.330> I've

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
it looks something like this now I've

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.780 
it looks something like this now I've
taped<00:01:40.899> up<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.170> wooden<00:01:41.619> dowel<00:01:41.860> pots<00:01:42.190> and<00:01:42.520> I'm

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
taped up the wooden dowel pots and I'm

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:43.859 
taped up the wooden dowel pots and I'm
gonna<00:01:42.970> give<00:01:43.149> it<00:01:43.240> a<00:01:43.300> paint<00:01:43.509> job

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
gonna give it a paint job

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.650 
gonna give it a paint job
this<00:01:44.140> is<00:01:44.259> gonna<00:01:44.410> be<00:01:44.640> camouflage<00:01:45.640> because<00:01:46.540> I

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
this is gonna be camouflage because I

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.900 
this is gonna be camouflage because I
thought<00:01:46.810> it<00:01:46.930> would<00:01:47.020> look<00:01:47.050> cool<00:01:47.170> and<00:01:47.910> strings

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
thought it would look cool and strings

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.530 
thought it would look cool and strings
just<00:01:49.119> there<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.390> hang<00:01:49.570> it<00:01:49.690> up<00:01:51.240> after<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.330> paint

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
just there to hang it up after the paint

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.300 
just there to hang it up after the paint
job<00:01:52.750> I<00:01:52.840> thought<00:01:53.020> it<00:01:53.170> looked<00:01:53.229> really<00:01:53.680> cool<00:01:53.800> and

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
job I thought it looked really cool and

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:03.490 
job I thought it looked really cool and
it<00:01:54.880> turned<00:01:55.300> out<00:01:55.479> pretty<00:01:55.750> nice

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.460 

now<00:02:04.070> on<00:02:04.310> to<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:04.490> blue<00:02:04.790> dots<00:02:05.060> as<00:02:05.900> you<00:02:06.110> can<00:02:06.260> see

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
now on to the blue dots as you can see

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.969 
now on to the blue dots as you can see
these<00:02:06.710> are<00:02:06.980> just<00:02:07.420> really<00:02:08.420> sharp<00:02:08.720> nails<00:02:09.140> with<00:02:09.710> a

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
these are just really sharp nails with a

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.580 
these are just really sharp nails with a
paper<00:02:10.369> fletching<00:02:10.910> which<00:02:11.690> is<00:02:11.840> just<00:02:12.080> a<00:02:12.230> funnel

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
paper fletching which is just a funnel

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.430 
paper fletching which is just a funnel
that<00:02:12.770> fits<00:02:13.040> into<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.430> pot<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:14.290> they<00:02:15.290> are

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
that fits into the pot and they are

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.370 
that fits into the pot and they are
really<00:02:15.950> sharp<00:02:19.330> so<00:02:20.330> if<00:02:20.480> we<00:02:20.570> loaded<00:02:20.930> up<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.200> blue

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
really sharp so if we loaded up the blue

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.270 
really sharp so if we loaded up the blue
a<00:02:21.410> gun<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:21.920> I'm<00:02:22.250> ready<00:02:22.460> to<00:02:22.520> test<00:02:22.850> it<00:02:24.280> this

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
a gun and I'm ready to test it this

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.890 
a gun and I'm ready to test it this
definitely<00:02:25.700> isn't<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.060> most<00:02:26.270> powerful<00:02:26.750> blow

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
definitely isn't the most powerful blow

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.540 
definitely isn't the most powerful blow
gun<00:02:27.140> that<00:02:27.320> I've<00:02:27.410> made<00:02:27.590> that's<00:02:27.950> mostly<00:02:28.430> because

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
gun that I've made that's mostly because

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.910 
gun that I've made that's mostly because
of<00:02:29.180> all<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.540> air<00:02:29.720> that<00:02:29.960> escapes<00:02:30.320> through<00:02:30.800> the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
of all the air that escapes through the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.010 
of all the air that escapes through the
gaps<00:02:31.130> in<00:02:31.340> between<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.790> chamber<00:02:32.300> but<00:02:32.690> it's

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
gaps in between the chamber but it's

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:41.280 
gaps in between the chamber but it's
also<00:02:33.260> really<00:02:33.620> easy<00:02:33.770> to<00:02:34.070> make<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.490> really<00:02:34.880> fun

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.030 

thanks<00:02:42.290> for<00:02:42.380> watching<00:02:42.620> this<00:02:42.709> video<00:02:42.890> guys
