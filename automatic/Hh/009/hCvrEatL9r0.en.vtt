already done okay that's all done and
then<00:04:03.100> here's<00:04:03.580> this<00:04:03.940> is<00:04:04.120> why<00:04:04.300> so<00:04:04.690> we<00:04:04.810> glue<00:04:05.080> this

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
then here's this is why so we glue this

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.949 
then here's this is why so we glue this
on<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.739> set<00:04:05.950> in<00:04:06.100> the<00:04:06.130> center<00:04:06.459> go<00:04:07.120> over<00:04:07.450> our

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
on the set in the center go over our

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.460 
on the set in the center go over our
leaves<00:04:08.200> bring<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.800> leaves<00:04:09.190> back<00:04:09.489> I<00:04:10.000> used<00:04:10.989> a

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
leaves bring the leaves back I used a

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.920 
leaves bring the leaves back I used a
punch<00:04:12.070> a<00:04:12.400> leaf<00:04:12.820> punch<00:04:13.120> and<00:04:13.360> I<00:04:13.420> just<00:04:13.600> punched

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
punch a leaf punch and I just punched

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.380 
punch a leaf punch and I just punched
out<00:04:14.050> two<00:04:14.320> leaves<00:04:14.590> and<00:04:14.920> then<00:04:15.430> I<00:04:15.550> much<00:04:16.060> like<00:04:16.090> I

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
out two leaves and then I much like I

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.150 
out two leaves and then I much like I
said<00:04:16.630> just<00:04:17.049> put<00:04:17.169> those<00:04:17.290> much<00:04:17.530> pressure<00:04:17.769> large

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
said just put those much pressure large

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.920 
said just put those much pressure large
parts<00:04:18.459> at<00:04:18.549> them<00:04:18.669> onto<00:04:18.850> because<00:04:19.480> I<00:04:19.570> wanted<00:04:19.810> to

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
parts at them onto because I wanted to

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.870 
parts at them onto because I wanted to
have<00:04:20.019> the<00:04:20.169> leaves<00:04:20.380> okay<00:04:20.799> okay

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
have the leaves okay okay

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.650

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
is here again I glued these are actually

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.940 
is here again I glued these are actually
made<00:04:43.360> so<00:04:43.540> you<00:04:43.660> can<00:04:43.810> hang<00:04:44.020> them<00:04:44.169> if<00:04:44.410> you<00:04:44.650> want<00:04:44.860> to

jam<00:04:48.789> on<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.419> head<00:04:49.680> so<00:04:50.680> we<00:04:50.860> see<00:04:51.070> the<00:04:51.280> jam<00:04:51.520> right

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
jam on the head so we see the jam right

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:52.189 
jam on the head so we see the jam right
here

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199

this<00:05:31.050> is<00:05:31.199> not<00:05:31.409> as<00:05:31.560> fun<00:05:31.710> as<00:05:31.770> just<00:05:32.069> snapping

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
this is not as fun as just snapping

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.610 
this is not as fun as just snapping
unlike<00:05:32.759> when<00:05:32.939> you<00:05:33.089> don't<00:05:33.240> have<00:05:33.419> any<00:05:33.569> items<00:05:34.379> on

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
unlike when you don't have any items on

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.290 
unlike when you don't have any items on
them<00:05:34.770> you<00:05:35.159> want<00:05:35.310> to<00:05:35.339> carefully<00:05:35.639> just<00:05:36.089> bend

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
them you want to carefully just bend

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.820 
them you want to carefully just bend
them<00:05:36.449> a<00:05:36.509> little<00:05:36.779> bit<00:05:36.900> because<00:05:37.259> they're<00:05:37.800> a

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
them a little bit because they're a

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.260 
them a little bit because they're a
little<00:05:38.069> stiffer<00:05:38.310> because<00:05:38.580> they<00:05:38.699> have<00:05:38.909> glue

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
little stiffer because they have glue

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.969 
little stiffer because they have glue
