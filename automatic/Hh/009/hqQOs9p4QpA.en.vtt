00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:10.460
 hello guys I bring you a new video and 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.379
 well I bring you a new tutorial very 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.910
 handsome that he was good the other day 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:17.570
 the VAT and the cat was in another already 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.670
 for the cne it was like that and I said wow I think 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.670
 very rare that this can not be placed 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.290
 water you see I can not place it and 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.990
 well I tried to get 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.000
 a way to do it first of all 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.100
 to say is that these modes your rivals do not 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.879
 you are going to be able to do this, it is only via 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.679
 commands but you can can and you can 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.510
 can do basically good I'm going to 

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:39.260
 explain a few more things but it 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.390
 can do 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.859
 with commands but well this is you can 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.300
 serve to decorate any map of 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:45.769
 adventures until you look at water at the level 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.109
 I was testing here once it was done 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.670
 everyday but it does not stay a bit 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:51.409
 bit weird the water of mnr but to me 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.019
 I like it a lot and good because what 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.879
 discovered because I wanted to teach you to 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.530
 hours I'll explain well how this works 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.210
 first of all tell you how good this 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.850
 week has not uploaded any videos but 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.620
 this weekend we are going strong up a 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.260
 daily video on Sunday you know how 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.909
 improve your house and well tomorrow I'm 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.140
 saying although climb and climb a 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.890
 tutorial 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.750
 of the ways a upload a tutorial of 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.510
 how to make a mini tnt that exploits that 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.740
 if he chooses that I already said that I was going to do it 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.170
 I already told a subscriber that I 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.260
 he asked so he surely will but 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.420
 I do not know when it's good, let's go with 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.600
 the following state investigating vale I have 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.890
 seen that crops grow or be 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.340
 they can grow 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.530
 what is very important, this is 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.540
 very interesting because it is not necessary 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.110
 that we light them basically the lava 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.760
 already illuminates them and not wii or if this 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.270
 it works in its rival mode we could 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.650
 leave the crops on and grow 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.660
 right away because they would not need day and 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.270
 night and only grow when there's a good day 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.680
 this I will place here the light depends on 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.540
 see in this site you see that there is very little 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.240
 light but if I put it next to the 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.270
 lava fixed that you do not notice the change of 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.050
 with the torch 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.429
 it's not worth then it's very interesting 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.800
 well nothing more from heaven is that the 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.790
 crops here grow that is nothing 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:18.239
 we do well we have crops in the never 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.840
 sorry seems very very weird does not look like 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.610
 something strange does not just convince me 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.050
 basically because good is 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.700
 entangling here we go the color 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.350
 now I will teach you the commands what 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.660
 they are very simple is a set block 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.670
 another thing that I have discovered is that the 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.820
 sites do not burn on duty fixed 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.650
 what are these are leaves worth and this is 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.450
 wood I do not know which hand I do not know why not 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.180
 just burned I do not understand why 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.760
 but hey, I was doing the other day 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.769
 some tests 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.900
 I've also tried with ice, I do not know 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.159
 it undoes in still water 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.670
 trying everything until it came to this 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:59.420
 conclusion we have the first command 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.910
 It's ok that he put water in here 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.130
 to wait 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.960
 ok let's do something else let's 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.210
 put a 2 here so you can see it well 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.060
 let's explain the command worth us 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.700
 Place a block of water that does not move 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.960
 it is static but if we modify its 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.980
 around and we do like that 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.530
 unconfigured and good becomes 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.080
 a normal block of water is worth this as 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.700
 is done is done in set blog is worth 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.100
 place a block in these coordinates 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.930
 ok if you want to place this symbol that 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.420
 Many of you ask me, do you have to 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.480
 look to come here and put map of 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.670
 characters, you open it and you look for it 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.350
 You are here to select and copy 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.210
 it already so you can put here 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.480
 that control v when from this and you put it 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.910
 ok and the coordinates this means 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.410
 approximately in the block and this 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.960
 means the 2 this means that 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.660
 approximately two blocks away 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.090
 of the command block is worth 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.560
 with the idea of ​​minecraft water could 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.900
 have put the idea number 9 that 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.160
 Equals water, but you know 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.450
 good thing I'm going to turn this thing off 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.120
 making a lot of noise you see that this is not 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.160
 it would burn could put that air but already 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.050
 you know what good 1.8 will surely go to 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.520
 change all this and they will remove the 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.790
 number sites and they are going to change the 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.950
 also that the colon 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.930
 dirt for example are worth 3 and placed mini 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.380
 kraft water this what I would do already 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.020
 you have seen 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.410
 create static water wash that is until 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:27.530
 that we do not modify its surroundings with 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:30.380
 this is not going to be static 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.630
 let's go with the next one we're going to 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.100
 place also a 2 is very simple is 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.510
 tutorial is going to be very short but good 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.060
 I wanted to explain it because in macho much 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:41.240
 grace, you see, it goes directly to the 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.730
 water comes out flowing already worth this would be 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.730
 because the command of the air comes 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.650
 craft flowin water is also worth telling 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.090
 that good do not know if you will need this 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.790
 because lava can be placed but 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.830
 It can also be done with lava in 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.800
 both on the two sites is worth here if 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.080
 placed the lava 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:04.130
 to see if he has lost the button again and 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:07.820
 have not paid that is your thing, you see 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.200
 that also does that and good guys for 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.850
 that you see that I am a leader that I am not 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.390
 inventing what can you look there I'm 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.130
 in hell good guys I hope that 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.260
 you liked the video if you have 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.240
 some suggestion some problem with him 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.320
 with commands or something less to say already 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.360
 you know that normally not only 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.160
 solve although good some hits 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.300
 some commands that cost me theirs 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.670
 but well, I usually do it 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.050
 better late a few days and this because I do not 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.540
 I have all the time I want but 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.940
 well this is all guys I hope that you 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.780
 I liked the video and nothing until another 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.780
 goodbye
