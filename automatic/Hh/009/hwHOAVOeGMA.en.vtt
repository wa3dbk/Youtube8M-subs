for<00:05:23.500> the<00:05:23.590> shrinkage<00:05:24.130> I<00:05:24.570> think<00:05:25.570> if<00:05:25.810> I<00:05:26.020> would

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.129 
for the shrinkage I think if I would
have<00:05:26.620> applied<00:05:27.100> it<00:05:27.370> in<00:05:27.610> smaller<00:05:28.240> sections<00:05:28.930> and

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
have applied it in smaller sections and

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.460 
have applied it in smaller sections and
paid<00:05:29.350> attention<00:05:29.710> to<00:05:29.919> the<00:05:30.330> stretch<00:05:31.330> breaking<00:05:32.260> I

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
paid attention to the stretch breaking I

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.070 
paid attention to the stretch breaking I
would<00:05:32.800> have<00:05:32.979> gotten<00:05:33.190> a<00:05:33.370> lot<00:05:33.580> more<00:05:33.720> length<00:05:34.720> but
