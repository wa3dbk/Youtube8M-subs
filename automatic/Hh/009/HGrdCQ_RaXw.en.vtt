00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:10.290
 Hail people that spoke adriano and today I 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.309
 I bring you a tutorial that will 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.820
 help countries that are not 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.400
 managing to play the original drawing 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:21.779
 recently the application of a 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:26.820
 beta test 11.63 which also brought the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:30.720
 change of owners of old father games 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.520
 for the to sting and with that many 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.190
 players have found it very difficult 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.309
 to return to play since origins do not 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.719
 found some errors is the desing 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.010
 command is not working properly 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.840
 still 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.879
 then the idea of the tutorial just 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.149
 help these players first thing that 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.160
 have to do is here on the steam in your 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.949
 library will look for the shipowners 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.309
 operation hatch will right-click 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.879
 above and in properties will look for the 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:05.580
 open and here you will have 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:08.580
 which to choose simply beto after 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.880
 back on the general tab and set options 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.170
 This option will start 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.750
 This is where I'm going to leave it here. 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.260
 description of the video to facilitate 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.640
 you're 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.290
 with whom you close now you go there 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.010
 steam paste 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.010
 in your computer 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:39.490
 i had pp as after gun 2 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.810
 and here you will get the ons folder 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:47.080
 this will copy it here and then 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.020
 back here in charge again will 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.070
 look for the fish owner in the head who 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.860
 who to enter 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.920
 and here you will paste this folder as I already 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.330
 I made it appear here but in case 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.090
 This passion will not exist for you. 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.330
 even then when when you copied 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.070
 shipowners and will paste her aquino 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:10.810
 ship owners operation the head done this 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.780

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.610
 Click here to play in amazon 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:22.240
 operation is the cyclic steam in play 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:25.900
 leave this option checked even without 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:30.130
 play and wait to load the game 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.560
 now when you want to play is you 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.170
 You'll have to launch the game here by and 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.640
 yes the desing command is not yet 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.970
 running right 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.290
 so many servers they do not 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.150
 are working right when you 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.610
 you click several times to find 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.980
 so I'll give you the hint of 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:52.300
 how do you do to find the game of 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.340
 You guys I clicked on Steam to play 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.709
 had no weapon for this year's network 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.620
 he brought me here to the screen of the 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:03.280
 nude multiplayer and backgrounds 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.440
 I'll click multiplayer for you 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.610
 find the server you play has two 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.070
 options or you use the filter 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.010
 and you click on the filter and choose 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.380
 what you write the name of the server that 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.840
 You play in case we play in that 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:25.080
 sense here the fs brazil click ok 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.520
 the refresh and now a little bit sometimes 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:32.430
 takes a while to appear in the 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:36.750
 server that is just waiting ready 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:40.470
 appear just click on join and you will 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.170
 load the server screen another 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.830
 way and much more practice you click 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.470
 here in weymouth and here you type ip 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:57.989
 server and after that is the ip of our 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:59.670
 server 37.8 7.37 point 2 1 6 7 5 7 7 a 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.980
 port, click ok 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.970
 it already goes straight from the server 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.760

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.050
 the server that is johny and leave with the 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.200
