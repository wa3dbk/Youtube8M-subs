00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.759
 how about youtube friends greetings friend 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.259
 louis from the android channel smx the me les 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.810
 I bring this new game that of spider-man 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:23.119
 or a limit in a game as a crooner 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.369
 Of course the game is pretty good 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.289
 It works since last night 4.0 and up 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.390
 It's totally free in the place thor 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.859
 and its size is 400 megabytes 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.530
 approximately once we have 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.120
 download additional data for 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.220
 we had to leave some data 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.470
 extras to keep moving forward in the game 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.380
 then what would be the interface where 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.300
 some options 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.730
 up here in 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.290
 to recruit some characters 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.480
 simply to select and 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.570
 we will select there to recruit 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.220
 some characters then clear that 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.899
 that's why you have to collect some 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.980
 objects within the game here pass 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.019
 some levels so to be able 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.760
 download them to the characters 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.280
 we simply give here what we 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.260
 we came back 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.000
 we can see here on our team 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.220
 all the different characters that 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.659
 we asked for it to be downloaded and we can 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.659
 do with some as you can see 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.000
 then you here go to all your 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.790
 characters so that you can breath 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.050
 let's try to play on a mission 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.760
 that's how it goes 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.190
 code if some climber is quite 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.840
 pretty good the graphics as can 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.890
 be the pretty good the move of 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.570
 also pretty good 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.270
 It is only as I say you should go 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.900
 collecting these objects and you have to go 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.150
 passing the obstacles to 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.430
 and complete what the mission would be 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.020
 inside school children like me this 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.710
 game is found for free in 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.690
 the pressure 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.159
 so I'm going to the in the description of 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.890
