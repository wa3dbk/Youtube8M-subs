00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.210 
pretty interesting the thing is of
course<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.560> would<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.040> lot

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
course and you would have to have a lot

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.319 
course and you would have to have a lot
of<00:01:35.250> monsters<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.640> your<00:01:35.670> deck<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.880> really<00:01:36.270> I

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
of monsters in your deck to really I

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.569 
of monsters in your deck to really I
guess<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.689> use<00:01:36.869> its<00:01:37.049> effect<00:01:37.130> to<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.250> fullest

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
guess I use its effect to the fullest

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.060 
guess I use its effect to the fullest
but<00:01:39.180> yeah<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.780> actually<00:01:40.320> kind<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:40.799> this

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
but yeah I actually kind of like this

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.140 
but yeah I actually kind of like this
car<00:01:41.250> for<00:01:41.369> some<00:01:41.490> reason<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.729> think<00:01:41.790> it's<00:01:42.000> pretty

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
car for some reason I think it's pretty

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.460 
car for some reason I think it's pretty
cool<00:01:42.390> i'm<00:01:42.630> glad<00:01:42.810> they<00:01:42.960> kind<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.170> kept<00:01:43.320> at<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
cool i'm glad they kind of kept at the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
cool i'm glad they kind of kept at the
artwork<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.860> was<00:01:43.950> kind<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.100> wondering<00:01:44.220> that

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
artwork I was kind of wondering that

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.310 
artwork I was kind of wondering that
would<00:01:44.640> change<00:01:44.850> or<00:01:45.329> not<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.780> never<00:01:45.899> know<00:01:46.140> with

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
would change or not you never know with

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.359 
would change or not you never know with
some<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.649> centering<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.070> weird<00:01:47.280> stuff

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
some of the centering and weird stuff

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.550 
some of the centering and weird stuff
they<00:01:47.610> do<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.299> I'm<00:01:48.360> glad<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:49.049> looks<00:01:49.350> I

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
they do so I'm glad that it looks I

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.050 
they do so I'm glad that it looks I
think<00:01:49.799> that's<00:01:50.159> exactly<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.549> same<00:01:50.700> artwork<00:01:50.880> is

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
think that's exactly the same artwork is

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.960 
think that's exactly the same artwork is
from<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.329> anime<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:52.460> yeah<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.670> looks<00:01:53.850> pretty

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
from the anime and yeah it looks pretty
