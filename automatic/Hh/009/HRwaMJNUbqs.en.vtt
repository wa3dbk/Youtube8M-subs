00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:02.680
 but even after this home full success 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.420
 only you can wish her 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.750
 then on saturday after lumbago 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.030
 new record will converge rogozhin scenes 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.509
 biggest loss 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.769
 Russian ferry fittings 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:18.480
 us 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.999
 worse 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:21.239
 someone time 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:23.499
 and here will be more that this time was his 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:25.579
 by orders 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:26.570
 four 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.570
 pronounce 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.050
 so the governor 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.530
 everything 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.150
 no other country 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.150
 about so 1 st km 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.530
 task 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.360
 so as seen on the governor 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.920
 four 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.810
 he won't be long 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.200
 303 UK RF 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.330
 and then only Ukraine 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.590
 the joys of new countries 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.080
 It is obvious 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.150
 elections 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.220
 and recently a customer 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.220
 Pavlovsky says but 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.480
 so why country 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.560
 because as soon as Russia could 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.910
 it will be nothing 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.720
 such as it was before 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.010
 congratulating Moscow 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.610
 in association 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.610
 Igor Shuvalov's candidacy 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.700
 by the way so 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.270
 remained 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.270
 increased 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.360
 in the morning 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.760
 you can also save 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.860
 First of all 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.080
 So 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.080
 in my opinion 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.229
 divorced but 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.229
 viewing depth am 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.799
 Congress opened the point at which the Kremlin 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:20.779
 Antonov 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:23.029
 according to the laws of the game 

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:24.539
 at substation 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:25.559
 So 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:26.929
 m 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:29.329
 you think she is ready 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.739
 I need to see 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.909
 invented 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.909
 casket from the depths this question to whom 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.909
 from that here
