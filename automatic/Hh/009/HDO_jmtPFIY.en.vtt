00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:07.770
 warning this video may have 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.770
 disturbing information 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.650
 Pokemon is from our favorite sagas 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.660
 not only for the animated series also by 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.000
 its great and excellent variety of games 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.970
 we have heard good things and things 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.820
 bad as you can not miss many but 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.640
 many urban myths and legends some 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.489
 very ridiculous others a little credible 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.890
 but how about those myths of terror 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.570
 those myths that destroy our 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.120
 childhood and we see things from another 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.940
 perspective because we are interested in those 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.640
 things maybe we like to know things that 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.399
 can these myths disturb us 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.070
 will be real, as a child, look at things 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.989
 bad without realizing how many more things 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.260
 There will be bad and I never gave myself 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:57.769
 mind then I will tell you myths will not be 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.660
 curiosities will only be myths but the 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.050
 myths more disturbing and that fucked up 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.050

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.590

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.660
 I'll tell you pokemon myths but the 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.370
 myths and urban legends that are 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.430
 fear or that someone fucked 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.560
 childhood if I know that many have done 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.869

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.039
 they like only those that I will tell x of good 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.050
 let's start with this fucking video come the 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.080
 first myth the first myth or legend 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.930
 urban that I will tell you is the same 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.850
 podomon pedophile there are many anecdotes and 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.640
 tests that ensure that going is not everything 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.369
 calm edge that we will review step by 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.470
 step in we'll pass by knowing a little bit of 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.229
 hymn then the details that what 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.450
 accredit as the pedophile pokemon and not 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.610
 is a pokÃ©mon of the first generation and 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.620
 the evolved form of draw share 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.400
 your skills can be insomnia or 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.160
 alert weighs 75 kilos and measures 16 meters 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.320
 has a human form its habitat is the 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.630
 prairie and its color is yellow now 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.630
 we will begin to analyze if he loves him 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.880
 too much to children starting with the 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.880
 hymn song in that song it 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.740
 makes it clear that he does not kidnap children without 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.840
 However, most likely, the 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.910
 song has been written by a fan 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.220
 disturbed and not necessarily by 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.770
 someone from the pokemon company to 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.060
 then I will put the song them 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.060
 I recommend discretion 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.890
 yes 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.890
 and gÃ¼iza 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.640
 my life 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.640
 without more 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.040
 once 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:27.269
 24 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:32.690
 2 plunged into chaos 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.690
 childhood export 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.840
 Y 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.990
 regards 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.990
 aside 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.599
 Yes Yes 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.450
 Yes Yes Yes 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.780
 two 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.630
 i 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.530
 we also have the shirt at the time 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.470
 of the first generation in Japan came out 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.440
 a clothing brand called pokemon 151 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.940
 that sold in its great part shirts what 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.680
 what they wanted to achieve was to call the 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.500
 attention of the adult public with 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.020
 products related to pokemon these 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.760
 T-shirts were officially 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.460
 authorized by the company the curious 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.950
 is that there was one that said schleper 097 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.840
 is to read in English means the one who does 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.570
 sleep and is the name of hymn in Japanese 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.910
 he had a strange drawing in which he left 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.460
 a hymn walking stealthily taken 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.740
 by the hand of some children that caused 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.420
 controversy since many asked what 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.580
 rays has to do that with what 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.400
 we look at the series the funny thing is that 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.560
 that hymn shirt with the number 97 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.130
 it was the rarest and also the best-selling 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.130
 of all 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.370
 Another important thing to note is the 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:08.379
 kidnap pedrito if they have played and 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.659
 completed seven medals in pokemon 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:12.520
 red fire and green leaf should know 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:14.259
 that when you visit is the second a 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.810
 man asks us to help him look for his 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:19.180
 little daughter, little girl, then at the moment 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.099
 in which we are in island ctera comes the 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.349
 rumor that pedrita has gone to the forest 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:25.330
 go by the time we go to that 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:27.610
 forest we search and find pedrito 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.289
 but at that time a pokemon that 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.439
 he was with her and to which she had 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:34.270
 terror attacks us that sign really 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:36.190
 pedrita was lost in that forest at 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.259
 which was always going to look for berries alone 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.690
 because suddenly he forgot the way 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:42.580
 it will not be that certain psychic pokemon 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.110
 using her powers confused her and 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.659
 he lost his way so that later 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:49.150
 being alone could take advantage of 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:52.289
 she that is also a factor to think 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:55.469
 that going is not a pedophile 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:57.629
 finally we have this other test if 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:06:00.419
 some saw episode 27 of the first 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:02.520
 season of the anime series will know 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.589
 that in blue city a lot 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.259
 of children were missing three 

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:09.629
 days in that chapter when the 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:11.729
 protagonists only thanks to it 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:13.559
 find the missing children and the 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:17.759
 that he had kidnapped them was nothing more 

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:20.219
 or nothing less than guessing who does and does not 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:22.110
 at no time in that chapter will 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:24.659
 says that the children were harassed 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:27.300
 sexually by anthem but the question 

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:30.330
 is what the hell did he make an anthem in those three 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.159
 days with those children those are all 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.740
 evidence against which has hymn up 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:36.779
 now but not only 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.749
 has evidence against it also has 

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:42.119
 ways to defend yourself so far and not 

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:43.919
 has never been seen abusing children or 

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:46.169
 maybe he does not do it with bad intentions 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:48.869
 and its nature is to fuck be everything 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:50.879
 innocent you see xd besides his group of 

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:52.469
 egg is human form and the goal of 

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:56.899
 a pokemon apart from serving his 

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:56.899
 trainer is to conserve the species xd
