00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.389
 to avoid the bus and the traffic jams 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.880
 can opt for the bike but since 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.120
 January 2011 a 7-hour training 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.410
 is required to drive a 125 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.090
 so zerotracas took his little 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.609
 scooter to go see how it gets 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.230
 passed and keith concerned and this 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.230
 training is mandatory every 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.930
 people who want to drive a 125 in 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.730
 having a license b for more than two 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.579
 years and who have never been insured 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.579
 before 1 January 2009 2011 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.260
 also those who already ride in 125 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.210
 classic and who want to buy an mp3 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.760
 greater than 125 cubic centimeters of 150 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.780
 cm 400-500 e even if they were 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.530
 insured they are obliged to do 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.530
 information too 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.590
 this seven-hour training which 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.890
 would be gone as well in theory 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:03.910
 in practice so as to raise awareness 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:07.750
 the future moped rider at audenge and 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.200
 of two wheels in city parking 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.200
 it is more common to be pretty 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.200
 witch 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.770
 the purpose of the training already theoretical ca 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.689
 to educate them to have a good 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.210
 good ah equipment you have a good headphones 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.170
 to the integral rather than a jet for 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.820
 have better protection of the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.080
 face the gloves because ben everything 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.070
 simply when you fall first 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.740
 reflex is to put hands forward 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.060
 so and of course motorcycle boots so 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.289
 possible and then a little pants 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.330
 reinforced that's what we do not need 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:36.810
 of July very very strong to be done 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.240
 very bad 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.520
 20 out of two scooter drivers in the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.920
 three months worth going there fell 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.229
 anyway so if it is equipped with 30 40 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.250
 on time if he has a good equipment 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.960
 correct today 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.530
 he can go out of the moment with no 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.530
 scratch 1 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:00.219
 no 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.320
 behind and before 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.859
 then to equal and initiation to both 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.510
 wheels off traffic so 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:17.409
 that they can truly occupy 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.409
 their gear only 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.300
 we made them through a 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.130
 low-speed maneuverability 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.290
 balance now we'll do them 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.200
 to roll a little faster this 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.490
 which were called fast ones 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.380
 so to roll a little faster 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.300
 for him to look further and to us 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.750
 manages to manage their craft with 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.750
 to braking 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.280
 and once they are comfortable at 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.709
 from there we can put them in 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.580
 circulation so that they 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.420
 can move safely 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.420
 in the middle of the others 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.519
 it's them 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.650
 so ok if that's okay it's cool but you 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.960
 learned what and especially the tips 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.880
 and then have security because it's 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.190
 it's scary a bit so it's okay 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.380
 only the grip on the 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.790
 roads with a vision of higher 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.190
 etc. 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.980
 we realize that good for a little 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.620
 more furious practice may 4 done 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.840
 to learn to look not close 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.500
 but far better that controls 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.720
 his trajectory 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.100
 it's really useful it's more 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.320
 at the level of maneuverability in fact that 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.420
 I find it interesting leafs and that's 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.280
 the circuit of a loan of a motorcycle not 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.290
 this is a motorcycle bet so in the end 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.600
 it's a little bit it's a little bit 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.739
 the bases of the two wheels 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.530
 on the other hand that I find that 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.720
 if it is or this price can be cut 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.290
 source no we're going to leave it around 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.209
 300 euros 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.209
 but security is priceless
