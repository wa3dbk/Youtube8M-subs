00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
if it's actually working correctly so go

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.670 
if it's actually working correctly so go
on<00:04:30.540> and<00:04:30.570> log<00:04:30.720> in<00:04:32.270> and<00:04:33.270> there<00:04:33.990> we<00:04:34.080> go<00:04:34.110> so<00:04:34.440> we
