00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.660
 new succession of kites rising from the mountain 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.670
 Today sunday that means today I greet 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.549
 I'm back for a father today 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.730
 stand on my paper and that 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.170
 it is once more 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.519
 I hope I have it right 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.519
 the julia pronounced a little like 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:40.469
 sure love greetings to the line 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.180
 florian giese and jonas again courage yes 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.670
 is good if you like that by the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.840
 Names on each other scribbles on everyone 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.010
 to get on a piece of paper that one 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.530
 can not read afterwards that one 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.730
 wrote that was again one 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:57.199
 master of mine oh man oh man 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.760
 well then we make here once more 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.370
 Cockatoos we always have the good ones 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.239
 can not search again 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.049
 have to go here for a while 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.049
 level with it 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.240
 would be a bit behind afterwards too 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.520
 can continue to level because I'm on 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.490
 each case with next on level 30 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.710
 bring a little bit missing us now 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.560
 for 27 but we'll get that guaranteed 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.340
 still within this sequence 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.950
 at the latest now and the storm is snowing 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.300
 level 3 is 10 eur 18,000 fischer that 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.440
 unfortunately we can not do that right now 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:37.310
 we 're pretty much behind 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.340
 against the fish so dan hacker 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.890
 592,000 but it is already expensive 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.960
 that he did not bring much more had you 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.300
 how much does it cost in the storm fighter 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:57.150
 fish 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:02:00.900
 damn fix darn specially the 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.750
 deadly nada from this brings 103,000 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.800
 but never much improvement 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:11.060
 we should probably do it then 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:13.080
 already collect the cockatoo levels 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.550
 We can do that relatively quickly 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.290
 I would be full again now 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.190
 so the others can say kite 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.390
 so keep looking for a while like that 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:26.330
 God, I can now more sick 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.330
 many fish have too little value 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.370
 to be worried there but we still make it 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.510
 I need some fish again 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.220
 that we will look for it again 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.690
 can send otherwise the last 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.030
 eternal to be completed by hesebeck west 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.070
 is crazy is here is yes 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.470
 Beyond Good and Evil 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.470
 ok you need 400 fischer for it 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.750
 globex to cite fifi fish some 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.180
 the part was that again I think 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.340
 America was where they were traveling 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.340
 It was supposed to have been that 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.060
 okay we have enough fish but now 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.390
 you can not continue for now 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.970
 train I think today we have 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.530
 still to look for space 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.530
 besides , he collects water anyway 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:30.200
 just over 4000 wood you have to 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:35.000
 still collect with the sick and 10,000 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.290
 fish we still have left the fish is 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.120
 that annoying because then i really can 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.570
 good fish collectors will not let go 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:45.670
 send 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:49.280
 that is stupid that we are not not good 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.900
 ok we could age the gigantic 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.390
 also continue to train is also 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:59.840
 not so badly expensive now 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.520
 catch the trap sometimes with the 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.610
 hand still burst so expensive was the now 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.990
 just not okay again we collect 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.400
 through again and then I would 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.830
 say try our luck again 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.600
 in the fleet this time I will 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.190
 try to attack from above 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.860
 without 10 right here you have something 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.299
 found 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.310
 An anchor that's great 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:28.310
 that means number anchor number one 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:32.200
 We already there should see that we 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.200
 come on ran that would be really hot 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.630
 In any case, so we go now 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.760
 first to fleet 33 I said try 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.990
 to attack from above this time because of me 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.480
 think that's the case here 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:48.070
 more meaningful to attack from below that he 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.070
 really clear all the ships out of the way 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.210
 or at the bottom 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.770
 Of course, a possibility would be me too 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.170
 I think my last time of about 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.390
 attack him head-on without a tooth 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:03.980
 I think we just try it 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.980
 to send downstairs 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.600
 now, without paying, you can rest 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.010
 because the front ship blow away 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.760
 there gets so no harm there is 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.930
 completely out of reach 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.520
 I think now we need here so 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.640
 Exactly I hold the other kites 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:24.080
 ever going to see on the big 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.080
 yes, but then it also makes way 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:43.849
 look there that was here now 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:43.849
 It's supposed to be totally easy 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:47.999
 now noticed that here hicks on 

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:50.249
 sits on it without a tooth 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:51.469
 clearly he must be able to pay without yes 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:57.839
 not fly anyway 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:59.279
 I must back di di di di di 

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:01.049
 tail of the classic 

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:03.229
 rudder tail on the tail 

00:06:01.049 --> 00:06:06.239
 control 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:09.659
 Well that was a bad idea again 

00:06:06.239 --> 00:06:11.399
 back to insidious things even 

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:14.849
 We were able to save all three keys 

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:19.739
 fish very well where more fish still 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:22.739
 better and five gears okay astrid 

00:06:19.739 --> 00:06:24.689
 what exactly does hicks especially not have 

00:06:22.739 --> 00:06:27.299
 thought of the book mr dragon hexagon 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:29.099
 Outwitted he has some time for him now 

00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:32.429
 procures a secret weapon 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:33.959
 to manufacture and felix he thinks now 

00:06:32.429 --> 00:06:38.129
 really like a chief but tell him 

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:38.669
 not that I said that their tics 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:42.360
 sour again 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:43.979
 ok so contis so at least one 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.789
 little bit of our fish on the spot again 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:46.579
 brush up 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:49.579
 that is not bad 

00:06:46.579 --> 00:06:49.579
 Well 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:59.849
 where do we get these send from 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:07:01.739
 things here in a hacker doda in 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:06.389
 looking for Schopfheim then we are looking for 

00:07:01.739 --> 00:07:09.709
 Let's paint hkd here 

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:14.219
 invest a little bit of pure rein or 

00:07:09.709 --> 00:07:16.669
 not for fish in the end it is yes 

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:16.669
 for fish 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:25.780
 Well, that's what I would say 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.160
 I say goodbye again 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.300
 We have you with us today 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.560
 we have no interesting letter 

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.850
 Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a Sturmfels partner 

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.270
 I have just looked more 

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:38.260
 there are only crane partners and well 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.270
 I do not necessarily feel sick now 

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:43.500
 so great, I must have honestly say though 

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:45.370
 cute but are like the strong collector 

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.510
 i can not fight yet 

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.670
 judge but I believe now 

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:53.440
 actually that's how they are now 

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:55.690
 outstanding so are so until tuesday 

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.320
 let her love and have a nice rest 

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.320
 Sunday
