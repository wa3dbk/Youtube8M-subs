just<00:04:54.110> handles<00:04:54.470> great<00:04:54.770> the<00:04:55.490> acceleration<00:04:56.240> is<00:04:56.360> a

just handles great the acceleration is a

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.590 
just handles great the acceleration is a
lot<00:04:56.630> quicker<00:04:56.930> than<00:04:57.200> a<00:04:57.290> 300<00:04:57.770> I<00:04:58.400> did<00:04:59.150> notice<00:04:59.390> I
