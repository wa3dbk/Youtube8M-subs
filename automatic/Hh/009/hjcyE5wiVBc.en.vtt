is<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.750> best<00:00:15.960> skate<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.260> think<00:00:16.529> it's<00:00:16.650> the

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
is the best skate I think it's the

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.470 
is the best skate I think it's the
best-looking<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.520> best<00:00:18.029> performing

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
to pull the tongue right towards you it

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.679 
to pull the tongue right towards you it
actually<00:01:07.860> uses<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.280> stainless<00:01:08.909> steel<00:01:08.939> lacing

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
actually uses a stainless steel lacing

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.020 
actually uses a stainless steel lacing
system<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.740> put<00:01:10.920> your<00:01:11.070> foot<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.400> pop<00:01:12.000> the

and<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.799> tightens<00:01:16.979> escapes<00:01:17.460> up<00:01:17.670> real<00:01:18.210> nicely

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
and it tightens escapes up real nicely

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.260 
and it tightens escapes up real nicely
not<00:01:18.840> only<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.350> easy<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.799> use<00:01:20.070> but<00:01:20.790> with<00:01:21.030> this

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
not only is it easy to use but with this

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.990 
not only is it easy to use but with this
lacing<00:01:22.080> system<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.590> gives<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.130> consistent

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
opposed to a standard lacing system is

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.730 
opposed to a standard lacing system is
usually<00:01:30.060> typically<00:01:30.390> only<00:01:30.630> laces<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.290> top<00:01:31.530> your

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
usually typically only laces to top your

usually typically only laces to top your
hard<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.430> have<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.579> work<00:01:32.670> your<00:01:32.850> way<00:01:33.090> down<00:01:33.119> to

hard you have to work your way down to
the<00:01:33.479> bottom<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.079> gives<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.680> really

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
the bottom so it gives you a really

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.429 
the bottom so it gives you a really
tight<00:01:35.820> comfortable<00:01:36.780> fit<00:01:36.990> without<00:01:37.140> any

tight comfortable fit without any
pressure<00:01:37.650> points<00:01:38.130> also<00:01:38.579> allows<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.540> not<00:01:40.079> only

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
pressure points also allows you not only

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.780 
pressure points also allows you not only
get<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.740> would<00:01:40.860> have<00:01:40.950> been<00:01:41.040> really<00:01:41.250> easy<00:01:41.490> when

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
get I would have been really easy when

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.090 
get I would have been really easy when
you<00:01:41.880> want<00:01:42.119> but<00:01:42.570> also<00:01:42.810> allows<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.890> be<00:01:43.979> able

skate starts to loosen up because you've

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.100 
skate starts to loosen up because you've
been<00:01:52.140> skating<00:01:52.619> during<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.729> day<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.630> also<00:01:54.780> has

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
a little bit of light brown on the back

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.950 
a little bit of light brown on the back
of<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.640> boot<00:01:56.790> makes<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.240> easier<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.600> get<00:01:57.810> you
