00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:10.370
 grandma ana maria malik 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.130
 and that's who you are talking on here 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.770
 they will and today I will teach you 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.420
 there is no way to leave your Estoril steering wheel with 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.820
 a flashback and in the game is another 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.189
 I encouraged 2 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:35.880
 In fact, the steering wheel has no 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:39.629
 becky but another word 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:44.280
 he actually saw it or dual 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:47.610
 shock it is the vibration plus the force 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.399
 of lichen centralization between the spin 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:59.070
 fly loose he makes a force to 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:01:03.660
 center the steering wheel with a deck and I 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.729
 I just thought I could only set up linen 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.240
 in the game 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.650
 reader 2 that he is single said that 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.790
 available for what I found right? 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.500
 a formula 1 2012 also makes it available 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:25.700
 plus it keeps vibrating direct nonstop 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.700
 but then configure yourself in the group 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.920
 control 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:42.170
 I thought I should leave this box here. 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:51.049
 You mark her later and the monkey will have 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.820
 only six options available here 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.960
 start at the last and then climb 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.990
 the next three first to strength 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.570
 collision feedback increases 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:11.330
 After I became, will you remember? 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:13.610
 when you hit me and I am so 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.660
 leave but I'm from those side collision 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:21.099
 then worked not think here you get 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:25.580
 here the next round close to the 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:28.640
 terrain feedback and also increases 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.670
 any in ground detention 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.560
 it will vibrate a lot it has a bad 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.400
 transporters and goes there she's from 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.200
 Earth 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.870
 there live a lot in that 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:44.720
 Carrier is good to be here O force 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.830
 and motor feedback also increases 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.819
 Wow 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.950
 and then when you speed up the truck 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.349
 that either way we set it up 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.660
 in the next to whom he goes he goes 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.730
 vibrate when accelerating aÃª know 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.040
 take your foot off the accelerator it stops 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.470
 vibrate 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:07.959
 then this one O branches next have here is 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:11.299
 the power center of feedback force 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.090
 you decrease if you want to leave the 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:17.030
 anti heavier that was what I wanted 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.079
 that made it far heavier and then I 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.239
 No decrease 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.579
 I was thinking about these three here in 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.650
 which decreases leaving heavier 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.420
 the others you better be seeing this 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.510
 when after you bought the steering wheel you 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.230
 see what's each one here these three 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.489
 on here 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:37.549
 there is this one here or stiffness and strength 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.680
 you also decrease 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:44.239
 I want to be heavier, that's what I 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:47.180
 I wanted to leave and this one is the non gain 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:53.319
 I know if he will see strength gain of 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:56.850
 I wanted him to vibrate in a 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:59.970
 me that celebrates so or you accelerate 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.140
 of life you can accelerate it though 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.930
 vibrate 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.910
 so if you want, that's how I did 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.370
 You can advance that at the same moment. 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.120
 A little bit more so he will do. 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.790
 that 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.530
 if you raise about here it 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.320
 will vibrate very little when 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.959
 Have not stopped drinking a little 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.360
 forcing it vibrates more 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.010
 so I wanted this because it will show the 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.060
 two in the movies and feel what the 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.490
 difference 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.420
 your everything increases will remember all time 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.050
 it's time to remember 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.980
 It's very rough there so I let you 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.790
 like this 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.800
 and now I will show how it is okay 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.060
 but there is the force of the force of 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.590
 I can not show centering 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:45.720
 Because she is you you have to 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.610
 come to if you do so you come to the 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.680
 The maximum you bought steering wheel turns the 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.540
 maximum and try to follow with one hand you 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.000
 You'll feel that I'll be more 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:57.210
 heavy when you buy the steering wheel 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.970
 you make a match without setting this 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.980
 and then with him after the 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.330
 second match if you do this will feel 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.780
 quite a difference 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:10.130
 Now, let's go to the protest, will not I? 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:19.770
 show the vibration changes is 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:23.340
 try to vote blank 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:28.250
 understood then is this guys until the 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.250
 Next video and spoke
