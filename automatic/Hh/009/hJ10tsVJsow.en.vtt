just taste completely different and I

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.760 
just taste completely different and I
think<00:01:55.020> that's<00:01:55.200> one<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.619> really

think that's one of the really
interesting<00:01:56.040> things<00:01:56.430> about<00:01:56.520> coffee<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.149> just

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
interesting things about coffee is just

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.359 
interesting things about coffee is just
the<00:01:57.450> endless<00:01:57.899> range<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.590> flavors<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.070> you

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
the endless range of flavors that you

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.030 
the endless range of flavors that you
can<00:01:59.520> discover<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.619> some<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.710> them<00:02:01.799> are<00:02:01.920> just

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
can discover and some of them are just

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.980 
can discover and some of them are just
not<00:02:02.100> repeatable<00:02:02.759> at<00:02:02.909> all<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.270> just<00:02:03.299> depends<00:02:03.899> on

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
not repeatable at all it just depends on

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.760 
not repeatable at all it just depends on
that<00:02:04.110> one<00:02:04.380> harvest<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.520> one<00:02:05.850> climate

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
that one harvest that one climate

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.279 
that one harvest that one climate
and<00:02:06.920> that<00:02:07.040> one<00:02:07.250> varietal<00:02:07.959> and<00:02:08.959> that's<00:02:09.140> what

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
and that one varietal and that's what

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.040
