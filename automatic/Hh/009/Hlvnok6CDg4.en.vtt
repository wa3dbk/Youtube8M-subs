what<00:02:04.789> I<00:02:04.850> could<00:02:04.909> do<00:02:05.359> to<00:02:05.630> show<00:02:06.200> this<00:02:07.039> idea<00:02:07.369> of

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
what I could do to show this idea of

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.770 
what I could do to show this idea of
speed<00:02:07.759> which<00:02:07.969> is<00:02:08.000> you<00:02:08.390> know<00:02:08.420> kind<00:02:08.660> of

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
speed which is you know kind of

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.440 
speed which is you know kind of
complicated<00:02:09.320> and<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:10.310> thought<00:02:10.549> is<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:11.359> about

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
complicated and I thought is it about

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.000 
complicated and I thought is it about
the<00:02:11.720> speed<00:02:12.019> of<00:02:12.140> someone<00:02:12.470> walking<00:02:12.590> buyers

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
the speed of someone walking buyers

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.160 
the speed of someone walking buyers
about<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.459> speed<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.820> photographer<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.660> so

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
about the speed the photographer and so

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.860 
about the speed the photographer and so
I<00:02:15.200> kind<00:02:15.829> of<00:02:15.890> imagined<00:02:16.400> this<00:02:16.519> whole<00:02:16.870> commuting

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
I kind of imagined this whole commuting

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.840 
I kind of imagined this whole commuting
ritual<00:02:18.680> that<00:02:18.859> happens<00:02:19.250> in<00:02:19.430> New<00:02:19.519> York<00:02:19.670> City

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
every morning of people you know racing

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.370 
every morning of people you know racing
to<00:02:21.950> get<00:02:22.070> into<00:02:22.340> town<00:02:22.549> and<00:02:22.989> also<00:02:23.989> during<00:02:24.140> that

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
to get into town and also during that

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.110 
to get into town and also during that
rush<00:02:24.560> hour<00:02:24.769> there's<00:02:25.190> also<00:02:25.400> this<00:02:25.760> sort<00:02:26.060> of

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120

traffic jam so I look for places where
the<00:02:33.060> crowd<00:02:33.450> like<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.139> released<00:02:34.620> from<00:02:34.769> the

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
bolt down the street so you have these

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.020 
bolt down the street so you have these

can't<00:02:42.239> have<00:02:42.359> speed<00:02:42.659> without<00:02:42.810> having

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
can't have speed without having

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
moving fast you know like they stop for

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.259 
moving fast you know like they stop for
a<00:02:49.469> minute<00:02:49.650> at<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.159> stoplight<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.939> then<00:02:51.120> they

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
a minute at the stoplight and then they

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.509 
a minute at the stoplight and then they
take<00:02:51.540> off<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.049> so<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.560> like<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.159> get<00:02:53.310> that

take off and so I like to get that

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.339 
take off and so I like to get that
moment<00:02:53.879> just<00:02:54.359> when<00:02:54.510> they're<00:02:54.659> kind<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:54.959> taking

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
moment just when they're kind of taking

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.800 
moment just when they're kind of taking
off<00:02:55.530> with<00:02:56.310> this<00:02:56.459> camera<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:57.209> don't<00:02:57.540> even<00:02:57.629> have

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
off with this camera I don't even have

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.360 
off with this camera I don't even have
to<00:02:57.900> look<00:02:58.079> through<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.409> camera<00:02:58.620> half<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.159> time

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
to look through the camera half the time

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.670 
to look through the camera half the time
because<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.849> autofocus<00:03:00.329> is<00:03:00.689> so<00:03:00.840> good<00:03:01.079> so<00:03:01.620> you

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
because the autofocus is so good so you

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.490 
because the autofocus is so good so you
can<00:03:01.859> get<00:03:02.040> people<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:03.090> know<00:03:03.209> moving<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.260> like

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
can get people you know moving it like

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.949 
can get people you know moving it like
to<00:03:04.799> 50th<00:03:05.159> of<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.489> second<00:03:05.909> and<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.359> can<00:03:06.569> shoot<00:03:06.780> it

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
to 50th of a second and you can shoot it

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.270 
to 50th of a second and you can shoot it
I<00:03:08.419> look<00:03:09.419> for<00:03:09.689> for<00:03:10.049> places<00:03:10.650> where<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:11.069> would

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.790 
photography let's think it's really big
but<00:04:43.889> actually<00:04:44.340> it's<00:04:44.910> kind<00:04:45.419> of<00:04:45.509> small<00:04:45.800> it's

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
but actually it's kind of small it's

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.219 
but actually it's kind of small it's
just<00:04:47.069> you<00:04:47.160> have<00:04:47.190> all<00:04:47.490> of<00:04:47.610> these<00:04:47.870> very<00:04:48.870> unique

just you have all of these very unique
parts<00:04:49.680> and<00:04:50.060> so<00:04:51.060> you<00:04:51.660> can<00:04:51.840> travel<00:04:52.139> from<00:04:52.470> one

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
parts and so you can travel from one

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.770 
parts and so you can travel from one
little<00:04:52.860> spot<00:04:53.160> to<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:53.460> next<00:04:53.520> and<00:04:54.090> be<00:04:54.630> in<00:04:54.720> a

little spot to the next and be in a
different<00:04:55.139> world<00:04:55.289> and<00:04:55.710> so<00:04:56.310> that's<00:04:56.729> really

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
different world and so that's really

days of a kind of typical New York
weather<00:05:21.419> which<00:05:21.690> means<00:05:21.960> like<00:05:22.199> you<00:05:22.319> can't

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
weather which means like you can't

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.969 
weather which means like you can't
predict<00:05:22.889> anything<00:05:23.069> it's<00:05:23.580> been<00:05:23.759> frigidly<00:05:24.659> cold

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
predict anything it's been frigidly cold

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.309 
predict anything it's been frigidly cold
then<00:05:25.979> snow<00:05:26.310> then<00:05:26.880> rain<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.780> other<00:05:27.930> day<00:05:28.110> we<00:05:28.289> had

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 
then snow then rain the other day we had

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:30.950 
then snow then rain the other day we had
bright<00:05:28.800> sunshine<00:05:29.460> I<00:05:29.849> wanted<00:05:30.419> to<00:05:30.509> see<00:05:30.750> if<00:05:30.870> this

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
bright sunshine I wanted to see if this

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.540 
bright sunshine I wanted to see if this
camera<00:05:31.349> could<00:05:31.500> handle<00:05:31.800> all<00:05:31.949> those<00:05:32.130> conditions

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
camera could handle all those conditions

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.260 
camera could handle all those conditions
and<00:05:33.440> so<00:05:34.440> far<00:05:34.770> it's<00:05:35.099> been<00:05:35.310> kind<00:05:35.729> of<00:05:35.789> remarkable

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
and so far it's been kind of remarkable

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.029 
and so far it's been kind of remarkable
for<00:05:36.599> me<00:05:36.720> to<00:05:36.870> know<00:05:37.050> that<00:05:37.080> with<00:05:37.409> one<00:05:37.590> camera<00:05:37.830> I

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
for me to know that with one camera I

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.830 
for me to know that with one camera I
can<00:05:38.190> go<00:05:38.310> in<00:05:38.400> the<00:05:38.490> subway<00:05:38.880> shooting<00:05:39.780> these

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
can go in the subway shooting these

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.200 
can go in the subway shooting these
really<00:05:40.110> dingy<00:05:40.500> grungy<00:05:41.159> conditions<00:05:41.699> and<00:05:42.060> then

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
really dingy grungy conditions and then

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
it's different than when I'm shooting

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.550 
it's different than when I'm shooting
with<00:05:52.560> my<00:05:53.300> DSLRs<00:05:54.300> because<00:05:54.750> i'm<00:05:54.960> shooting<00:05:55.440> as

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
with my DSLRs because i'm shooting as

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.490 
with my DSLRs because i'm shooting as
such<00:05:55.800> high<00:05:56.490> frame<00:05:56.969> rates<00:05:57.270> really<00:05:57.840> that<00:05:58.469> I

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
such high frame rates really that I

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.930 
such high frame rates really that I
didn't<00:05:59.039> even<00:05:59.130> know<00:05:59.400> when<00:05:59.580> I<00:05:59.610> was<00:05:59.759> shooting

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
didn't even know when I was shooting

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.580 
didn't even know when I was shooting
what<00:06:00.270> it<00:06:00.419> isn't<00:06:00.539> going<00:06:00.780> to<00:06:00.870> get<00:06:01.020> so<00:06:01.320> when<00:06:01.469> i'm

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
what it isn't going to get so when i'm

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.399 
what it isn't going to get so when i'm
looking<00:06:01.949> at<00:06:02.039> afterwards<00:06:02.820> it's<00:06:03.599> even<00:06:03.870> more<00:06:04.229> of

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:04.409 
looking at afterwards it's even more of

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:06.110 
looking at afterwards it's even more of
a<00:06:04.469> surprise<00:06:04.710> like<00:06:05.009> what<00:06:05.219> did<00:06:05.430> that<00:06:05.580> camera<00:06:05.789> get

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
a surprise like what did that camera get

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.820 
a surprise like what did that camera get
so<00:06:06.419> i<00:06:06.449> think<00:06:06.690> most<00:06:06.840> photographers<00:06:07.139> would<00:06:07.620> say

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
so i think most photographers would say

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.189 
so i think most photographers would say
that<00:06:08.069> that<00:06:08.310> it's<00:06:09.030> the<00:06:09.240> surprises<00:06:09.870> that<00:06:09.900> make

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
that that it's the surprises that make

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.629 
that that it's the surprises that make
the<00:06:10.349> picture

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:27.300 

you

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310
