00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.549
 hello how are you welcome 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.049
 again make a different video 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.779
 you write me 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.679
 tips to quickly download that 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.470
 some routine some tip that you can 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.880
 help you get your results a lot 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.550
 they always expect me to give them some 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.739
 very advanced or complex formula for 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.390
 be able to lose weight quickly but 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.629
 as I always tell them to lose weight 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.640
 It must be something very simple 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.940
 nothing complicated so this time 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.559
 they keep 4 simple tips for you 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.780
 can apply them to your life so that 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.909
 they can apply them to their routines and they will see 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.129
 how by applying they will maximize their 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:53.329
 useful results then let's start 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.329
 with the number 1 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.300
 I think that doing two hours is cardio 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.670
 kill us in the gym really more 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.400
 We serve him much better results 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.640
 really the key is to maximize the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.600
 effort in short periods of time 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.150
 you do not need much with 30 to 45 minutes 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.490
 of a routine with a lot of effort is more 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.890
 enough to be able to have a 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.870
 extreme calorie burning so 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.180
 training for periods of 30 to 40 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.790
 minutes but very very intense during 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.729
 four to five days a week you 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.460
 will help keep much better shape 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.930
 reduce fat much more quickly and 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.720
 in addition to that if meals with a 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.440
 good food you will have maximum 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.390
 maximum results 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.390
 well let's go with the number 2 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.119
 and concentrate on high-level exercises 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.070
 intensity like the hit type exercises 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.979
 The objective of these exercises is 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.990
 maximize the amount of demanding that 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.939
 your body can use when increasing the 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.250
 amount of oxygen you can train very 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.159
 very intense during very short periods 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.640
 of time approximately one minute 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.289
 after that the time when you 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.660
 energy has been spent after that 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.090
 minute we must wait for our 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.610
 heart rate was normalized a little bit 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.130
 lower our heart rate a little 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.209
 approximately 30 seconds 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.580
 immediately before the rhythm 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.950
 cardiac went down a lot we do again 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.709
 high intensity exercises this we 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.099
 helps increase metabolic treat 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.830
 and they activate a lot more calories these 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.680
 workouts are very short are 15 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.319
 20 minutes to very advanced maximum 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.239
 30 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.239
 ok number 3 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:53.480
 because I do not want to get muscular is 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.250
 a lie really the do not do weights 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.710
 you're missing out on a burning 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.190
 extreme fats when increasing your mass 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.930
 muscle increases your metabolic rate that 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.720
 is to increase your metabolic rate and 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.730
 increase the metabolic rate increases the 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.200
 number of calories that has more and 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.260
 being at rest 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.500
 that is to say without exercising in 10 that 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.180
 that marker and being asestando 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.030
 displacement to bolÃ­var thus increasing 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.730
 to improve your muscle tone going 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.160
 to improve the way that fat is 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.989
 converts the problem in the desert 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.080
 I see very common is that gyms to 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.790
 Sometimes there are not really very consultancies 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.190
 few are the coaches that really 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.280
 makes you a custom routine of 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.319
 according to the needs but good if 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.150
 they want the fingering of gmt their 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.120
 comments if we could start with 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:49.209
 any 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.209
 ok our last 104 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.069
 but I told you the food is 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.200
 super super basic to achieve your 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.420
 objectives either for the loss of 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.549
 fat or for mass gain 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.849
 muscle is equally important 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:09.610
 that you do not eat like what you eat, so 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.799
 here we are going to eliminate the food that 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.780
 you really do not need or that you do not 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.760
 help for nothing in fat loss 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.590
 a clear food kahn that goes 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.100
 designed according to the challenge of each 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:24.400
 person but really something basic that 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.919
 I do not always tell you, it's because 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.810
 example eliminate dairy you can 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:32.889
 consume dairy but only the 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:35.289
 low fat is the last we ok 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.810
 2 we are going to eliminate the meats that are not 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:40.120
 are bad like the flesh of the body or the 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.849
 meat that have a lot of fat is the 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.129
 lean meat is one that really 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:47.190
 you have a fiber like chicken 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:50.320
 red meat as bishops 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.200
 the fish the salmon 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.050
 and the third as you always know and 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.800
 eliminate flours the sugars the 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:02.410
 cookies pastries cultures 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.690
 but that is full of sugar the 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.420
 processed foods what I 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:11.240
 I recommend increasing your diet are the 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:15.500
 meat proteins lean meats 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:21.139
 you can consume chicken sugar chicken 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:25.099
 salmon tuna fish is excellent 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:27.219
 let's increase the consumption of vegetables 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:30.999
 mainly the fruits of the forest 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:30.999
 a lot more antioxidants 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.449
 let's avoid the fruits a little 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.020
 tropical that have a lot more sugar 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:42.760
 like the mango the papaya the watermelon and 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.289
 it has a little more sugar and you do not 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.240
 helps also loss objectives 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:50.149
 I also highly recommend the consumption of 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:54.020
 seeds and nuts characters 

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:55.849
 while these are excellent for those 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.759
 small cleaning for the little ones 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:01.759
 saints between meals you can eat some 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:04.789
 ten walnuts to avoid cravings and 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:06.889
 have a very good source of protein 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:09.139
 and antioxidants and finally the 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.449
 starches such as sweet potato or rice 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:12.919
 white steamed this is a very 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.349
 good source of carbohydrates and 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:17.270
 starches another tip and something that I in what 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:19.580
 personal is by far the coconut water 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.740
 with protein this helps us a lot 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.839
 transport the amino acids more 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.210
 quick to our muscles and this we 

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:30.680
 helps to have a recovery 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:33.740
 faster and prevent loss of 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.169
 good meals that debate that after 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:39.680
 let's talk I recommend that they be 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:41.330
 approximately every three hours 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.699
 so much space 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.340
 on an empty stomach and every meal 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:49.490
 added between 25 and 30 grams of 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.969
 proteins I recommend maximum 30 for 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.969
 be able to facilitate 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.319
 and other additional issue is that we're going to 

00:06:54.319 --> 00:07:00.050
 talk later is feeding 

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:01.840
 is in a debate for there are doctors of 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.460
 consume what you should not 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.160
 but we're going to talk about this later 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.699
 since they should touch more according 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.699
 to your goals 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:17.490
 really apply them to your daily routine 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:20.189
 and you'll see what you're going to see results with 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:22.680
 really self Rome was not built 

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:24.360
 from night to morning you see 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.509
 building your body 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.759
 - improving rider and really up 

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:31.650
 good especially for today 

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:33.599
 remember to subscribe reminds leave 

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:36.150
 meters comments here below you 

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:39.680
 would like us to talk and well see you 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.680
 until the next session
