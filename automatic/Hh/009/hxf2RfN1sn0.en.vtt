00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
one being 30 because I wanted some color

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.930 
one being 30 because I wanted some color
for<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.570> summer<00:02:54.780> let<00:02:55.530> me<00:02:55.680> zoom<00:02:55.950> in<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:56.910> you

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
for the summer let me zoom in so you

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:04.300 
for the summer let me zoom in so you
guys<00:02:57.240> can't<00:02:57.960> see<00:02:59.720> the<00:03:00.720> color<00:03:02.480> okay

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
guys can't see the color okay

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:11.600 
guys can't see the color okay
maybe<00:03:05.310> too<00:03:05.610> much<00:03:07.280> okay<00:03:08.840> so<00:03:09.840> here's<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.650> nice

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
maybe too much okay so here's a nice

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
maybe too much okay so here's a nice
strip<00:03:12.270> of<00:03:12.420> color<00:03:12.750> in<00:03:13.740> the<00:03:14.460> wig<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.420> back

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
strip of color in the wig and the back

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.810 
strip of color in the wig and the back
has<00:03:16.020> I<00:03:16.350> mean<00:03:16.500> it's<00:03:16.710> color<00:03:16.950> all<00:03:17.220> throughout<00:03:17.640> it

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
has I mean it's color all throughout it

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.390 
has I mean it's color all throughout it
so<00:03:18.690> it<00:03:18.840> just<00:03:19.020> depends<00:03:19.470> on<00:03:19.680> where<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.190> light

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
so it just depends on where the light

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.660 
so it just depends on where the light
hits<00:03:21.210> the<00:03:21.540> wig<00:03:21.720> itself<00:03:22.320> but<00:03:22.920> you<00:03:23.040> guys<00:03:23.220> can<00:03:23.490> see

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
hits the wig itself but you guys can see

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.260 
hits the wig itself but you guys can see
the<00:03:23.820> texture<00:03:24.420> of<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.780> wig<00:03:24.960> as<00:03:25.230> well<00:03:25.730> it<00:03:26.730> looks

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
really really good it's really

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.260

26<00:04:06.480> even<00:04:07.050> and<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.890> also<00:04:08.160> like<00:04:08.580> that<00:04:08.730> it<00:04:08.880> kind<00:04:09.120> of

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
26 even and I also like that it kind of

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.370 
26 even and I also like that it kind of
came<00:04:09.620> a<00:04:10.620> little<00:04:11.040> bit<00:04:11.340> later<00:04:11.880> you<00:04:12.360> see<00:04:12.570> how<00:04:12.780> the

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
came a little bit later you see how the

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.380 
came a little bit later you see how the
front<00:04:13.740> has<00:04:14.070> these<00:04:14.400> layers<00:04:14.910> going<00:04:16.910> you<00:04:17.910> know<00:04:18.090> in

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390
