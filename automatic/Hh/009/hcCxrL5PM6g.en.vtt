00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:06.880
 hi youtubers she loves you and i'm going to 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:10.900
 teach how to decipher wifi keys 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.720
 of the cool networks lan and four 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.500
 characters 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.640
 first to have this application 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.430
 we have to have the iphone with 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.600
 jailbreak if we do not have it we can not 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.640
 do 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.180
 because this application has to be 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.820
 download of extendable 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.820
 well first we have to go to our 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.610
 let's go to 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.610
 cydia 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:55.090
 and the program that we will have to 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.090
 download is this 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.880
 is this 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.660
 I think before we will have to download 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.660
 this source 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:30.360
 the dotcom monk phoneme that we will have 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:35.020
 to go in edit add 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:38.710
 and we will have to add hello 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.900
 the repo there is a source that today will leave in 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.130
 the description of the video what is 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.130
 it's down here 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.450
 I will be here 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.320
 We wait for the data to be downloaded 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.570
 And it is 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.070
 I was here to expose myself 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.710
 together with garré 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:09.570
 to leave it in the description as it 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:13.490
 said before once here is not repo 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:16.420
 we have to go to web chrome 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.420
 through here 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:24.430
 there web you will have to go here once 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:29.280
 here where I have you modify 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.280
 you will have to install you give to install 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.840
 then you will get a new icon in 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.040
 the desk that is this one here 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.040
 there is body 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:51.550
 and I think it also works for the wild 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:55.420
 and with two with two numbers or with the 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.489
 external characters but to nu but 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.010
 they have many options and that's why they cost 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.560
 more blood 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.200
 but I what but I what they were taught 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.829
 are these here dance them and four 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.829
 characters 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.040
 once in the inch we will have to 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.040
 activate it 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.330
 we will go first in the idea here up 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.330
 is there 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.879
 and here we will have to go activate 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.879
 application 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.810
 then I will leave this this code in 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:41.040
 the description of the video that will serve 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:44.340
 to activate that copy is this code 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.460
 here on the bust iphone slider and you 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.580
 you will give in valid license and then 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:55.310
 will have this and be activated and you can already 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:57.590
 to decode wifi passwords 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.140
 to decode sweet contractions 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.900
 you will have that it was in our network that the 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:06.709
 good in the network that you want to decipher 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.239
 the password for example this same one 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.330
 at the moment it's the only one I have in the 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:17.190
 reach with four digits after 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:19.650
 wyman and we will give you here on the forehead 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.880
 hites when giving here checking password 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.420
 paraguay the web 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.730
 and already in connection made with good 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:33.220
 response time and confirmation of 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:35.800
 router to while and win 8 fsc more good 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.060
 has been copied the death papers him 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:43.090
 we will give in phoenix 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.090
 and we will be connected up here 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:49.639
 we would be connected 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:53.219
 automatically if you are not connected 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:56.639
 it's probably because not yet because 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:59.219
 network is not something not familiar to the 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.979
 iphone and you will have to copy the 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:03.590
 password that is for example what 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.510
 I do again 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.910
 and as an addition here there are only two 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.650
 possible password after that os 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:13.360
 I will teach the other 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.639
 in continuous 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.689
 and as you see here the password tells you 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:21.699
 the copies are already put more 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:23.650
 general adjustments 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:28.690
 wifi settings 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:31.500
 wifi hosting we select the network of the 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.500
 copies and you're done 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.730
 well now I show you what it is that 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.000
 I say that is because the dance and two 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.820
 digits not the 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.160
 can I decipher for example are 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:49.420
 here the wild and 90 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.420
 let's click 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.380
 I look 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.639
 to the budgies we will have what I think 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:01.480
 yes 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:04.720
 the remains the name of the network 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.670
 then it begins as you see here 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.060
 I'm going to send to expand because I'm going to 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.060
 best 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:20.379
 yes, better 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:23.740
 the router gualán 90 have 4 thousand 996 

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:25.550
 possible password is what makes you 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.850
 in 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:32.450
 which also makes a lot of time in 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:37.210
 to be able to do it I think you can 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:39.470
 to do the only thing is that you already know 4 2900 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.940
 password comes the time now that 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:47.480
 I have only done it have checked 9/10 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:50.630
 can as I can you can think of you see 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.409
 that will take a long time and also the 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.989
 pain 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:57.520
 they were coded with water they were with 

00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:59.860
 four digits 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.730
 Well this is all I hope you have 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.890
 served 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:08.790
 If you have questions, accept the program or 

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:12.320
 something like that you can ask me what has 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.320

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:27.539
