00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.949
 very well 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.180
 what's up kids today we went and this is 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.160
 fifa 14 we return with our canterano 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.660
 favorite our far right we're going to 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.460
 see how these three parties are doing 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.960
 two league matches and one cup match 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.610
 king that comments because no 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.960
 should be played should not be played 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.620
 we go there first match against the 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.309
 Numancia team that good keeps 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.830
 there are years that go up years that when 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.230
 is up then returns to second is a 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.390
 team that good does not have a budget 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.760
 very big that you can say that you do 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.900
 good they do what they can but the truth 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.180
 is that 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.000
 they do good things from time to time and 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.470
 comes the first time and surprised 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.150
 on many occasions good so here 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.490
 you have the best plays of the game 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.820
 I will take advantage to tell you things that are not 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.300
 I liked fifa during this case 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.390
 does not arrive even a month these three weeks of 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.490
 game that I have with him and say that I do not 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.620
 He has done a lot of grace as you know good 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.830
 I had thought to have made a series 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.480
 of ultimate team I started with a team of 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.030
 the German league which wove them a 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.369
 video of my players and that is to say that 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.840
 I left it there I was playing some 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.090
 seasons to see if I could do something 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.730
 but which way to take out not having 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.520
 played the center 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:37.230
 there was no way because I do not know other years 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.990
 in fifa in the lower divisions because no 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.780
 it used to be difficult for you to win games and 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.550
 this year I found that matches 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.100
 that he won, they won very tight and 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.650
 the parties he lost he lost with 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.720
 very much that they miss me about 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.160
 everything among other things because their faces 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.100
 here that was there that they are not left 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.390
 grow and heal that in real life what 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.670
 is doing pretty well with the barça 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.620
 b is marking pretty damn if you're 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.380
 helping the team a lot and that here 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.110
 well here is a nice guy like he 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.350
 usually say anything that as I already 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.580
 commenting 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.350
 there has been a failure an advantage that has 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.650
 taken out everyone I remember that 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.420
 when I made the video of the ultimate and 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.260
 Some of you told me to play the 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.210
 center is wrong that you take advantage of a 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.700
 game style tag and I did not know very 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.040
 well why because I from fifa11 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.540
 fifa10 was already playing centering 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.810
 gallons of entrance balls very from time to time 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.050
 when and the truth is that I was surprised that 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.810
 tell me how good what 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.280
 because he played so he was taking advantage 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:48.400
 that tells us to know how to play well 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.440
 and of course this because they tell me there is no 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.030
 that the first game ends the next 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.460
 party is against the córdoba let's see 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.260
 How are we given here I leave you the 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.380
 classification as we see new rooms 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.700
 but I do not think we have much in there like that 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.880
 how good are we going to see how 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.980
 I will continue counting this game 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.660
 for that that I was surprised that I 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.940
 they said then I realized when they were 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.470
 happening the games in ultimate and I gave 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.910
 mind that he was referring 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.770
 because then the game and that the teams 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.050
 they played to run around the band but 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.940
 run exaggeratedly for the band that 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.060
 there were no ways to catch him with a 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.340
 side came and focused and on track 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.680
 some of each center that arrives is goal 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.290
 and it's something that I did not like anything 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.550
 to me of course it has been there almost 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.970
 pass 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:43.060
 I have been very very unhappy with 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.880
 this fifa for that reason because you already 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.400
 promises there is that occasion that good and it 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.770
 will finish the first part promise each 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.390
 every year that the game is more complicated 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.870
 that they have not played today that 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:59.200
 change there is always looking for that because that's not 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.620
 It is not easy to mark that there is no 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.450
 type of play to score a goal but for 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.910
 much that they have polished to fix in the 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.180
 Wow repeat what piece of cannon 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.500
 much that other years have come and 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.410
 you have had to continue shooting at 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.260
 first stick that if such this year they have 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.090
 fatal fatal fatal fatal event when you give 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.340
 a pass overlooked the defense stays 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.110
 looking at the ball and practically that is 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.760
 that you stay alone and apart from that already 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.470
 focusing all the shots go to goal 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.300
 almost everyone is very difficult for a goalkeeper 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.950
 and that's honestly what I like about 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.180
 do as I said a series of ultimate and 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.240
 then change the league team 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.670
 German by a national team 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.950
 Brazilian and remained the same so I already 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.790
 in that sense I have surrendered I am now 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.800
 in a virtual club pro and passes 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.540
 exactly the same thing we try to play at 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.490
 touch we play touch we move a lot 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.979
 and when the moment of truth arrives 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.630
 they always mark us the same or a team 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:59.150
 that maybe it does not do anything to fix that 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.009
 fails and please that we go in part from 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.419
 how do you fail that what you are saying does not 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.729
 so unbridgeable that in the game as there 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:07.160
 he does everything he should do and nothing 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:08.840
 and the second league match ends and 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.500
 now we go with the cup game of the 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.030
 king and I will tell you there you have the 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.590
 requirements the objectives that asked me 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.599
 to fulfill them all as you have been able 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.810
 see and here you have the king's cup because 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:22.819
 the cup of the king can not be or because 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.099
 this match is impossible because I do not know 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:26.659
 can because this can not exist 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:29.030
 this match 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:32.419
 Well, simply because the 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:36.680
 subsidiary teams the style barça ve 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:38.900
 villarreal real madrid castilla 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.650
 in reality the Spanish federation does not 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.630
 lets play everything goes back to the year 1980 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.850
 when the branch of Real Madrid was 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:50.060
 faced Real Madrid 'same in the 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:54.310
 final was 6-1 and I will not enter man 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:56.870
 I honestly do not know if it 's true 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.509
 I really have not read anything that is 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.150
 let go to another man after understanding 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:03.469
 if it is the first team against 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.749
 second brass edition the first team 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:07.969
 it has to be superior yes or yes 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:11.569
 with which which then for that same 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:13.340
 reason they arrived in 90 10 years later 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:15.470
 approximately 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.770
 and they released the rule that teams 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.930
 Finals could not play 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.849
 also not only because of the case that of the 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.520
 final but because it could be given as 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:26.540
 better a barça against a bar to know then 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.550
 say no then 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.440
 you let the barça lose by you pass a 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.780
 eliminatory easily or the same for 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.090
 the madrid the team wants an athletic 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.550
 madrid could be if he had a team 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.800
 competitive in the second wiki division 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.450
 top and head and nothing and that's why 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.220
 same reason then the affiliated teams 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.780
 are not allowed then this 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.230
 party should not have played this 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:51.860
 party exists in virtual reality 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:54.050
 which is assembled fifa or other 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.180
 stop that the release of panthers and 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.770
 here in the minute 74 you are going to see they are going to 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.850
 try to take value and as not the 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.780
 pressure of which I have always told you 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.550
 what I do 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.560
 there you take me the ball the floor a 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.630
 little bit come in come come in come 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.420
 enter and man strip and the door and 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.890
 check which chicharro that arrived is taken out 

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.960
 for the entire squad 

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:15.590
 johann steal if I remember correctly 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.180
 he entered from the bench and as he places 

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.010
 that ball has been waiting for you 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.290
 you set there was to have entered before 

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:22.640
 but that's not why he's going to tell me what 

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.710
 I'm going to get in like I'm going to score 

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.060
 for the entire squad with which we 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.610
 will allow good here you have another 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:31.120
 play that I pay attention to, I'm leaving 

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:35.090
 for the band I'm running I'm running 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:37.310
 for a little bit I'm leaving I'll go back to the 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.550
 race and see how I go in the second 

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:42.229
 stick there was no way to finish that ball 

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:44.000
 and well, that's not what it was going 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:46.190
 commenting that I did not like anything 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.720
 this fifa I hope that with future patches 

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.729
 fix that from the centers and the 

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.380
 head shots and here ends the 

00:07:49.729 --> 00:07:53.300
 match we passed the tie this 

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.650
 eliminator went to a match already to 

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.840
 from the next are going to be two 

00:07:54.650 --> 00:08:00.520
 matches and I hope you liked it 

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.520
 See you next
