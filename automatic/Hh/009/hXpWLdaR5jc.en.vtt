00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.350
 cables need not prove it we 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.600
 you need those big table that the cable 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.220
 power supply of the xbox so 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.120
 normally this one you have it 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.160
 automatically 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.060
 it's a college or once I had 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:01.900
 bought the xbox you will receive it then 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:05.379
 so you need a hdmi cable so a 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:08.830
 azimov side and the other side 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.900
 this is also beautiful miss 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.600
 new cayenne you need an xbox 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.630
 but your here we are all going to start 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:22.570
 at the month so stuck cable nor fight the 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:29.260
 plug in months that's where it takes and we go 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:33.270
 so plugged in like that I resume the 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.270
 fable the bronze 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:41.020
 here like these power and you my arms 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:46.830
 the other side that I'm going to plug 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:48.790
 directly on the iphone like these 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.960
 was leaving well he was well plugged 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:57.690
 then I will resume the cable 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:01.710
 hdmi officiating could take it 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.490
 plugging in one side does not bring 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.240
 any 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:11.009
 and France and the branch exactly 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.009
 on the xbox is missing here 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:19.109
 you my good side and that's very 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.989
 important I'm doing well he would lend 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:25.230
 well plugged could so for actually 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:32.239
 the second side excused means do not see 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:34.909
 there and the m here so on the pike so 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:38.519
 on your computer 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:40.200
 yes I know he is very very 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:45.079
 well plugged otherwise it will not work 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.230
 it's just excuse me wait here 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.689
 here 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.220
 if it's not big at home 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.099
 can already say that it's fucked that does not 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.530
 will not walk then the most important 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:59.459
 in this video it's this cable that 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.049
 is called cap dsm iv which is so there 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.930
 that they would have gone there not believe 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.389
 that they were not coming back to 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.629
 the screen here it is call is very 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:12.150
 important so you have to remove it because 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:15.120
 that basically it connects 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.010
 tower information on the screen and 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.799
 So that's basically if you have to 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.409
 plug in a cable 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.139
 convalescents the information from the 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.299
 tour as well as xbox information 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.340
 this will not work 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.859
 here you're bothering this cable for a 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.310
 times everything after me I have another 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:38.190
 cable yet which is so what connected 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.609
 by an internet cable that allows me 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.900
 to connect or live box but it 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:46.349
 it's not important it depends on you 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.790
 messier is not is not that's it 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.229
 not important for this video the 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.549
 most important is the hdmi cable 

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:55.680
 the cab the par-4 feeding of 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.489
 livebox is breakable it takes 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.549
 unplug 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:05.310
 Once again, all that is done 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:07.259
 so can animate your screen we could 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.790
 parentheses it seems to me that I the same 

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:15.829
 go gotta screen and you turn on so 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:17.799
 your xbox once this is done 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:23.600
 you could not 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:29.450
 because to keep those walking here and 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:30.730
 here is our xbox is plugged on the screen 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.550
 from your computer 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:38.060
 so it 's not a fail to 1 as it 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.800
 there is a lot on youtube here is 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.150
 so said the keyboard even the tower here 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.389
 it's really on the computer screen 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:47.870
 it's big, it's less true so 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:49.910
 so I hope this little tutorial will have you 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.190
 more and you 'll have to help if you have 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.440
 the slightest problem 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.630
 tell me in the messages and I 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.990
 will answer to the east is everybody has 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.990
 very quickly
