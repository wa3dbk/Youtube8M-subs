00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 and there are good players among the players 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.859
 this is the video answer for alex 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.019
 sandro he asked me on youtube 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.400
 how did you set up a machine? 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.130
 which generates a is generator if through 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.840
 jec good if you put together such a system 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.359
 which is what everyone would put 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.119
 rechargeable batteries here on the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.580
 automatic work and also the generator 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.140
 taken the weight scheme is not on the table 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.380
 automatic work that happens to you 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.290
 try to create what will happen but 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.570
 always say that there is missing a 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.879
 battery even though he knows how to 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.829
 create the battery and all the material 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.780
 necessary that he will always say that 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.789
 is missing a battery as solve 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.100
 this problem with this is a recent book 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.710
 It seems that I actually think that since 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.910
 the following version of 1.245 good for 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.420
 solve what will do you the following 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.059
 place a chest on top of the part that 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.399
 generates the generator're seeing where it goes 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.030
 use battery and will do the following 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.650
 will put a satellite that the jeep okay 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.000
 put this thesis is that now it is going 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.369
 associate the id for it 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.140
 beauty and here in the bottom you go 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.330
 need the battery only that not any 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.710
 French battery pack created by 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.909
 jeep, like this 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.430
 I asked him to create me here. 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.920
 Battery what he will be able to create 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.799
 Battery power will now take this 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.689
 battery will replace here in the part that 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.400
 I wanted to battery you exchange the latter. 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.159
 Where do you pick it up and boot? 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.930
 Ok you took it now you put beauty on 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.909
 put on the altitude you will put 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.189
 here in our land means in this 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.650
 part that generates the generator 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.619
 Just take the battery from here and it will put 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.259
 beauty satellite 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.869
 done that for the next match you 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.310
 Go and change that battery from here ok you 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.899
 Did not realize but I changed I had a 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.750
 different partnership I played for this 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.640
 Okay, okay, now we can do it. 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.130
 requests at will that he will 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.930
 get the parent 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.880
 I do not know why you give this bug because 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.770
 they are very similar things 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.780
 on these batteries but has a property 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.579
 different she has no meta date 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.039
 different has something to do with 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.599
 I do not know what to do, I do not know 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.720
 difference but it's probably a bit 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.720
 of
