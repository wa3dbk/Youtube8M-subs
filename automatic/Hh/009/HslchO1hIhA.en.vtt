so<00:01:45.960> um<00:01:46.909> it<00:01:47.909> blocks<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.350> light<00:01:49.530> switches

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
so um it blocks the the light switches

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.389 
so um it blocks the the light switches
which<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.280> kind<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.759> need<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:52.070> basically<00:01:53.070> I

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
which I kind of need so basically I

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.429 
which I kind of need so basically I
decided<00:01:53.670> as<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.689> as<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:54.960> probably<00:01:55.229> have

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
decided as you can as you probably have

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.639 
decided as you can as you probably have
guessed<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.860> decided<00:01:56.520> I'm<00:01:56.729> going<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.380> take<00:01:58.380> all

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
guessed I decided I'm going to take all

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.730 
guessed I decided I'm going to take all
the<00:01:58.860> parts<00:01:59.130> out<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.579> and<00:02:00.439> put<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.469> in<00:02:01.649> a

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
the parts out of this and put it in a

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.459 
the parts out of this and put it in a
really<00:02:02.310> really<00:02:03.270> tiny<00:02:03.540> case<00:02:03.869> now<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.320> course

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
really really tiny case now of course

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.359 
really really tiny case now of course
that<00:02:04.680> means<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.920> had<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.159> buy<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.280> new

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
that means I had to buy a new

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.280 
that means I had to buy a new
motherboard<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.840> one<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.229> I

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
motherboard and this is the one that I

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.809 
motherboard and this is the one that I
picked<00:02:07.710> mostly<00:02:08.220> because<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:09.119> went<00:02:09.479> with<00:02:09.690> the

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
picked mostly because it went with the

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.850 
picked mostly because it went with the
i7<00:02:12.770> 2600

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
i7 2600

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.650 
i7 2600
okay<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.400> in<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:14.760> thing<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.300> think

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
okay that is in this thing I think

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.450 
okay that is in this thing I think
that's<00:02:15.900> what<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.170> is<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.590> it's<00:02:16.950> it's<00:02:17.160> an<00:02:17.280> it's

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
that's what it is and it's it's an it's

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.050 
that's what it is and it's it's an it's
an<00:02:17.610> old<00:02:17.990> model<00:02:18.990> of<00:02:19.200> processor<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.100> so<00:02:20.640> rather

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
an old model of processor and so rather

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.520 
an old model of processor and so rather
than<00:02:21.180> buy<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.300> new<00:02:21.510> one<00:02:21.690> which<00:02:21.900> I'm<00:02:22.050> not<00:02:22.200> going

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
than buy a new one which I'm not going

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.100 
than buy a new one which I'm not going
to<00:02:22.710> I<00:02:22.920> just<00:02:23.250> decide<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.760> buy<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.300> cheap

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
to I just decide to buy a cheap

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.530 
to I just decide to buy a cheap
motherboard<00:02:25.770> well<00:02:26.150> relatively<00:02:27.150> think<00:02:27.360> was<00:02:27.480> a

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
motherboard well relatively think was a

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.480 
motherboard well relatively think was a
100<00:02:27.870> something<00:02:28.020> dollars<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.890> go<00:02:29.010> with<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.370> and

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
100 something dollars to go with it and

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.120 
100 something dollars to go with it and
then<00:02:30.120> everything<00:02:30.900> else<00:02:31.080> we're<00:02:31.680> taking<00:02:31.980> out<00:02:32.100> of

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
then everything else we're taking out of

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.310 
then everything else we're taking out of
this<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.610> putting<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:33.600> here<00:02:33.870> so<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.170> only

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
this and putting in here so the only

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.360 
this and putting in here so the only
things<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.680> bought<00:02:34.890> is<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.130> new

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
things that I bought is a new

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.810 
things that I bought is a new
motherboard<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.750> actual<00:02:37.020> new<00:02:37.230> case<00:02:37.820> so

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
motherboard and the actual new case so

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.110 
motherboard and the actual new case so
as<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.180> can<00:02:39.300> see<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.720> is<00:02:39.810> open<00:02:40.140> now<00:02:41.120> processors

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
as you can see it is open now processors

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.210 
as you can see it is open now processors
have<00:02:42.240> been<00:02:42.330> removed<00:02:42.510> graphics<00:02:43.080> card<00:02:43.350> is<00:02:44.040> there

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
have been removed graphics card is there

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.520 
have been removed graphics card is there
I'm<00:02:44.340> trying<00:02:44.490> to<00:02:44.610> hold<00:02:44.700> on<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.530> water

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
I'm trying to hold on to it water

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.710 
I'm trying to hold on to it water
cooling<00:02:47.070> look<00:02:47.550> how<00:02:47.700> dusty<00:02:48.030> this<00:02:48.330> thing<00:02:48.540> is

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
cooling look how dusty this thing is

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.340 
cooling look how dusty this thing is
it's<00:02:49.200> seen<00:02:49.380> better<00:02:49.590> days<00:02:49.650> but<00:02:50.180> uh<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:52.110> case

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
it's seen better days but uh this case

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.510 
it's seen better days but uh this case
held<00:02:52.560> up<00:02:52.650> pretty<00:02:52.770> well<00:02:52.890> if<00:02:53.070> you<00:02:53.160> looking<00:02:53.310> for<00:02:53.370> a

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
held up pretty well if you looking for a

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.720 
held up pretty well if you looking for a
case<00:02:53.989> this<00:02:54.989> HAF<00:02:55.530> one<00:02:55.770> is<00:02:55.920> pretty<00:02:56.400> awesome<00:02:57.110> but

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
case this HAF one is pretty awesome but

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.250 
case this HAF one is pretty awesome but
now<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.790> fun<00:03:00.120> part<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.630> sticking<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.020> all

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
now the fun part of sticking it all

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.680 
now the fun part of sticking it all
inside<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:02.310> how<00:03:03.030> this<00:03:03.330> thing<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.480> going<00:03:03.600> to

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
inside and how this thing is going to

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.620 
inside and how this thing is going to
fit<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:03.930> little<00:03:04.170> case<00:03:04.320> we'll<00:03:04.560> find<00:03:04.770> out<00:03:05.630> who

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
fit that little case we'll find out who

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.729 
fit that little case we'll find out who
it<00:03:06.810> is<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.080> main<00:03:07.200> experiment<00:03:07.800> so<00:03:08.550> this<00:03:09.030> is

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
it is the main experiment so this is

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.930 
it is the main experiment so this is
what<00:03:10.739> happens<00:03:11.160> when<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.489> take<00:03:11.700> everything

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
what happens when you take everything

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.380 
what happens when you take everything
inside<00:03:12.540> of<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:12.870> computer<00:03:12.989> that<00:03:13.230> big<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:14.390> then

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
inside of a computer that big and then

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.650 
inside of a computer that big and then
into<00:03:16.230> a<00:03:16.260> computer<00:03:16.560> this<00:03:16.830> way<00:03:17.120> that<00:03:18.120> is<00:03:18.360> some

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
into a computer this way that is some

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.050 
into a computer this way that is some
cable<00:03:19.380> management<00:03:19.680> we've<00:03:20.640> got<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:21.060> gtx<00:03:21.690> 680

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
cable management we've got the gtx 680

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.009 
cable management we've got the gtx 680
got<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.150> fan<00:03:24.450> we<00:03:25.170> could<00:03:25.380> not<00:03:25.560> use<00:03:26.750> this<00:03:27.750> bad

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
got the fan we could not use this bad

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.699 
got the fan we could not use this bad
