today I'm going to be talking to you
about<00:00:06.870> how<00:00:07.200> I<00:00:07.440> learn<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.710> new<00:00:07.980> piece<00:00:08.130> of<00:00:08.189> music<00:00:08.370> I

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.019 
about how I learn a new piece of music I

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.650 
about how I learn a new piece of music I
always<00:00:10.019> start<00:00:10.320> with<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.500> clean<00:00:10.800> part<00:00:11.099> with<00:00:11.660> no

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
always start with a clean part with no

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.299 
always start with a clean part with no
editors<00:00:13.200> markings<00:00:13.650> if<00:00:13.799> possible<00:00:14.190> and

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
editors markings if possible and

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.730 
editors markings if possible and
definitely<00:00:14.670> no<00:00:14.849> previous<00:00:15.269> markings<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.929> find

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
definitely no previous markings I find

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.380 
definitely no previous markings I find
it<00:00:16.890> much<00:00:17.039> easier<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.609> come<00:00:17.970> up<00:00:18.060> with<00:00:18.180> my<00:00:18.359> own

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
it much easier to come up with my own

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.599 
it much easier to come up with my own
ideas<00:00:18.660> about<00:00:18.869> how<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.350> want<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.770> play<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.220> piece

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
ideas about how I want to play the piece

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.730 
ideas about how I want to play the piece
if<00:00:20.670> there<00:00:21.240> are<00:00:21.330> no<00:00:21.420> previous<00:00:21.810> influences<00:00:22.560> in

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
if there are no previous influences in

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.920 
if there are no previous influences in
my<00:00:22.890> part<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.430> also<00:00:23.970> try<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.390> stay<00:00:24.750> away<00:00:24.900> from

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
my part I also try to stay away from

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.859 
my part I also try to stay away from
recordings<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.430> piece<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.849> if<00:00:27.630> it's<00:00:27.810> a

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
recordings of the piece and if it's a

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.330 
recordings of the piece and if it's a
new<00:00:27.990> piece<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.199> music<00:00:28.349> that's<00:00:28.769> not<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.039> problem

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
new piece of music that's not a problem

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.400 
new piece of music that's not a problem
but<00:00:30.000> if<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.420> more<00:00:30.599> well-known<00:00:31.019> piece<00:00:31.289> of

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
but if it's a more well-known piece of

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.620 
but if it's a more well-known piece of
music<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.920> really<00:00:32.340> try<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.910> make<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.149> point<00:00:33.450> of

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
music I really try to make a point of

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.240 
music I really try to make a point of
not<00:00:33.809> listening<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> recording<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
not listening to a recording of the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.880 
not listening to a recording of the
piece<00:00:35.399> while<00:00:35.850> I'm<00:00:36.030> learning<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.649> the<00:00:37.649> first

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
piece while I'm learning it the first

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.160 
piece while I'm learning it the first
most<00:00:38.100> important<00:00:38.670> thing<00:00:38.700> for<00:00:39.059> me<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.989> find

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
most important thing for me is to find

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.319 
most important thing for me is to find
the<00:00:40.620> best<00:00:40.770> possible<00:00:41.070> fingering<00:00:41.790> for<00:00:41.940> every

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
the best possible fingering for every

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.720 
the best possible fingering for every
passage<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:42.930> every<00:00:43.170> phrase<00:00:43.440> both<00:00:43.829> musically

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
passage in every phrase both musically

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.819 
passage in every phrase both musically
and<00:00:44.910> technically<00:00:45.329> speaking<00:00:45.829> everybody's

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
and technically speaking everybody's

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.740 
and technically speaking everybody's
hands<00:00:47.039> are<00:00:47.219> very<00:00:47.399> different<00:00:47.670> which<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.390> why<00:00:48.690> I

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
hands are very different which is why I

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.380 
hands are very different which is why I
think<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.500> need<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.879> find<00:00:50.879> out<00:00:51.059> and

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
think that you need to find out and

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.150 
think that you need to find out and
learn<00:00:51.600> what<00:00:51.840> really<00:00:52.020> works<00:00:52.379> well<00:00:52.770> for<00:00:53.010> you

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
learn what really works well for you

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.860 
learn what really works well for you
rather<00:00:53.340> than<00:00:53.489> copying<00:00:54.059> someone<00:00:54.809> else's

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
rather than copying someone else's

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.860 
rather than copying someone else's
fingerings<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:56.000> don't<00:00:57.000> actually<00:00:57.270> write<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
fingerings I don't actually write in the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.709 
fingerings I don't actually write in the
fingerings<00:00:58.289> right<00:00:58.530> away<00:00:58.770> but<00:00:58.829> rather<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.789> try

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
fingerings right away but rather I try

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.529 
fingerings right away but rather I try
to<00:01:00.780> see<00:01:01.260> if<00:01:01.350> time<00:01:01.649> after<00:01:01.980> time<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.640> gravitate

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
to see if time after time I gravitate

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.679 
to see if time after time I gravitate
towards<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.199> same<00:01:04.379> fingerings<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.100> if<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:06.119> do

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
towards the same fingerings and if I do

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.149 
towards the same fingerings and if I do
them<00:01:06.840> for<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:07.020> few<00:01:07.200> days<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.560> row<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.950> they

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
them for a few days in a row and they

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.440 
them for a few days in a row and they
seem<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.400> work<00:01:08.520> while<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.880> write<00:01:09.150> them<00:01:09.330> in

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
seem to work while I write them in

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.940 
seem to work while I write them in
because<00:01:09.810> once<00:01:10.080> they're<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> part<00:01:10.740> it's

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
because once they're in the part it's

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.520 
because once they're in the part it's
human<00:01:11.520> nature<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.240> them<00:01:12.420> most<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
human nature to do them most of the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.140 
human nature to do them most of the
practice<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.100> do<00:01:14.220> both<00:01:14.880> when<00:01:15.060> I'm

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
practice that I do both when I'm

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.880 
practice that I do both when I'm
learning<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.509> piece<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.869> otherwise<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.500> slow

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
learning a piece and otherwise is slow

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.460 
learning a piece and otherwise is slow
practice<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:18.270> way<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.720> find<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.290> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
practice that way I find that the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.859 
practice that way I find that the
passages<00:01:20.009> really<00:01:20.159> become<00:01:20.610> ingrained<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.420> my

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
passages really become ingrained in my

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.480 
passages really become ingrained in my
muscle<00:01:22.259> memory<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.619> by<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.070> time<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
muscle memory so by the time of the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.730 
muscle memory so by the time of the
performance<00:01:24.030> they<00:01:24.600> feel<00:01:24.840> very<00:01:25.140> familiar<00:01:25.409> and

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
performance they feel very familiar and

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.070 
performance they feel very familiar and
very<00:01:26.040> second<00:01:26.490> nature<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.030> I'm<00:01:27.360> really<00:01:27.930> able

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
very second nature and I'm really able

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.690 
very second nature and I'm really able
to<00:01:28.350> focus<00:01:28.530> on<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.520> music<00:01:30.320> sometimes<00:01:31.320> though

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
to focus on the music sometimes though

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.800 
to focus on the music sometimes though
what<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.790> think<00:01:33.030> might<00:01:33.150> be<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.299> clever<00:01:33.600> are

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
what you think might be a clever are

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.780 
what you think might be a clever are
fingering<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.380> slow<00:01:34.560> tempo<00:01:34.799> may<00:01:35.400> not<00:01:35.579> work

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
fingering in a slow tempo may not work

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.460 
fingering in a slow tempo may not work
when<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.090> get<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.360> up<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.570> speed<00:01:36.689> or<00:01:36.990> even<00:01:37.320> when

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
when you get it up to speed or even when

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.020 
when you get it up to speed or even when
you<00:01:37.530> put<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.799> together<00:01:37.920> with<00:01:38.400> your<00:01:38.579> costura

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
you put it together with your costura
