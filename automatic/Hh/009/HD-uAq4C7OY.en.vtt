00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.759
 hello everyone so I'm back 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.290
 today for a video 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.700
 so it's not a video tutorial actually 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.349
 it's to show you the box and 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.139
 explosion that I realized for 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.109
 my mom's birthday 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:19.289
 so I'm just going to make you a little 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.970
 little round the box 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.650
 if some of you are 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.539
 interested in a tutorial it's a rather 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.150
 that I found on youtube that writes in 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.179
 english from a demo this time pin up 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.160
 but I could give you link or 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.570
 so if you want me to 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.489
 make 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.110
 there are no worries you tell me 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.960
 in comment and then I squeezed you 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:45.570
 do a little tutorial say this so here 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.410
 the box that I made for 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.309
 my mom's birthday 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.100
 so this is the first time I have 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.550
 make a pretense little proud of me I 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.890
 think she's nice so the hall 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.270
 and in shades of brown and green anise 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.650
 for exteriors 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.729
 I specify for the exteriors what 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.619
 you will see inside 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.510
 the benefits of an explosion box 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:16.310
 is that we can really have fun with 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.310
 a small overview of the top 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.870
 here 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.870
 I hope the picture is going to be beautiful 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.960
 in the end 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.790
 so I'm going to open it 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:43.860
 yu so that's how it looks 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.860
 so hop 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.430
 like these as is a 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:56.440
 birthday of course I realized 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:59.940
 a small cake under my watch 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.940
 next few if you want to see 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.640
 so we're still in the 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:10.690
 same green-brown tones so I added 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.660
 of the oranje in fact I remained in the 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.830
 paper tones like this one so 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.410
 there you see it's small 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.209
 pouches on each she will be able 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:27.310
 add photos in fact I leave 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:30.069
 free choice for my mom to do that 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.580
 it is the drive to the top of top inept 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.140
 for those who know who was cutting 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.700
 who at the same time humps at least one 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.700
 little bit it's big kids 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.940
 here it is the same I cut dry 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.810
 mapic schatz and felt 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:53.620
 many equestrian and 2 courses 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.920
 so the gemmi I installed small 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.329
 butterflies on rodeo ide actually that 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:07.780
 I passed below like that they 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:13.840
 stay here it's in pony and beauce 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:16.450
 is a beautiful stamp that I bought 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:22.260
 on a used sales site on 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.260
 internet here 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.180
 so I tried to make a symmetry 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.459
 perfect every time between the side there 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.910
 and the one opposite and so on 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.730
 what 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:38.560
 and after I just alternated 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:41.349
 with the other layers here is where 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.450
 it's a second part with the same 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:47.799
 a class and from there it's foam 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.720
 know as the foam for the one who me 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:56.260
 follow I used to lÃ© 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:59.590
 little bear so with a system of like 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:04.349
 it's the same, we find a small map 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.349
 to be able to put a picture on it 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.959
 then here then there are these 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.389
 butterflies the same from this final time 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:19.180
 the paper seems it's just a people 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:24.310
 that is the orange as it dustan 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:26.350
 pineapp this one is boeny and the 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.889
 macaroon I do not remember anymore 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.440
 verify sent symmetry we have the same 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.919
 opposite thing 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:38.130
 then well, it's with so that's it 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:45.190
 the cover if you prefer it 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:46.690
 so a little stadium I will stay 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.830
 really in the colors I tried 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.520
 to make it simple I did not want too much 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.250
 overload 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.530
 this is my first have only them but I 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:57.010
 am still proud of me she is 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.620
 really nice here and there I 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.990
 reproduced on its sides the this system of 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.460
 rhodoÃ¯d with the same butterfly it is 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.810
 home this time as the pinup 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:13.110
 alas giant work with a plate of a 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.110
 che me face to you me to you so 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.639
 here 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:23.900
 so here is my pretty little box for 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.280
 my mom's birthday 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.050
 I hope she will make him happy 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.910
 so I had some 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.710
 photos exceptional thing at home 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.600
 because as I already said I 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.370
 do not know if you know it but actually 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.139
 I never made scrap pages 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.350
 still I find myself very bad 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.940
 photographers but I was told that even 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.560
 with bad pictures I could 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.600
 succeed in achieving something 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.190
 nice so there I started I did 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.970
 develop photos so I can can 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:54.780
 to be trying to make a page is here 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:56.610
 so if it suits me I love everything 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.810
 what you do at a page level 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.070
 but it's true that I myself 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.449
 never tried for the simple and good 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.970
 reason that I find that my photos are 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:06.630
 really not good quality so but 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.280
 I will try here so I hope 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.130
 sincerely that you liked it 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:14.900
 the cdu a and this sticker that shines in 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:18.600
 do it here and on the box 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.120
 in fact everything that shines like that there 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.590
 you see I did some small details 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:28.110
 at the flower level I do not know if you 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:29.880
 go see too closely it shines a little 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.620
 in fact I took crack she accepts 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.810
 so to engrave callac sum I 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:37.169
 back on my video I had made a 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:39.270

 Am amused to order 2 at least 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.580
 I believe 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:45.000
