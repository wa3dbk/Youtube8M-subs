so<00:00:00.599> then<00:00:00.870> during<00:00:01.350> my<00:00:01.500> afternoon<00:00:01.709> shift<00:00:02.370> I

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
so then during my afternoon shift I

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.430 
so then during my afternoon shift I
spilled<00:00:02.909> an<00:00:03.060> entire<00:00:03.120> tray<00:00:03.780> of<00:00:03.810> drinks<00:00:04.080> on

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
spilled an entire tray of drinks on

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.030 
spilled an entire tray of drinks on
myself

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
myself

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.700 
myself
that's<00:00:05.609> awful<00:00:06.120> not<00:00:06.690> really<00:00:06.899> my<00:00:07.350> shirt<00:00:07.560> was

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
that's awful not really my shirt was

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.200 
that's awful not really my shirt was
soaking<00:00:07.950> wet<00:00:08.099> I<00:00:08.250> got<00:00:08.370> like<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.730> biggest<00:00:08.849> tip

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
soaking wet I got like the biggest tip

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.839 
soaking wet I got like the biggest tip
of<00:00:09.330> my<00:00:09.480> life<00:00:12.349> so<00:00:13.349> listen<00:00:13.830> do<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:14.759> remember

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
of my life so listen do you remember

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.700 
of my life so listen do you remember
when<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.269> said<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.809> similarities<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.470> the

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
when I said the similarities of the

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.380 
when I said the similarities of the
equations<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.369> general<00:00:17.430> relativity<00:00:17.760> and

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
equations of general relativity and

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.779 
equations of general relativity and
hydrodynamics<00:00:18.990> suggest<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.980> could<00:00:20.310> find<00:00:20.670> the

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
hydrodynamics suggest you could find the

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.970 
hydrodynamics suggest you could find the
equivalent<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.420> Unruh<00:00:21.960> radiation<00:00:21.990> in<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.800> large

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.460 
equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large
body<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.340> water<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.960> thought<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:24.990> said<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.260> to

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
body of water I thought I said that to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:33.410 
body of water I thought I said that to
you<00:00:30.710> anyway<00:00:31.710> Stephen<00:00:32.430> Hawking's<00:00:32.969> team<00:00:33.059> is

you anyway Stephen Hawking's team is

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.870 
you anyway Stephen Hawking's team is
looking<00:00:33.719> into<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.469> I've<00:00:35.219> been<00:00:35.489> invited

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
looking into that and I've been invited

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.459 
looking into that and I've been invited

ship in the North Sea on a ship
aren't<00:00:58.320> they<00:00:58.410> afraid<00:00:58.590> Hawking<00:00:59.070> will<00:00:59.160> just

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
aren't they afraid Hawking will just

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.370 
aren't they afraid Hawking will just
roll<00:00:59.489> overboard

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.020 

he's<00:01:03.980> not<00:01:04.190> gonna<00:01:04.339> be<00:01:04.489> there<00:01:04.610> he's<00:01:04.820> just

he's not gonna be there he's just
sending<00:01:05.750> a<00:01:05.930> team<00:01:06.200> to<00:01:06.230> research<00:01:06.740> his<00:01:06.950> theory<00:01:07.310> oh

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
sending a team to research his theory oh

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.410 
sending a team to research his theory oh
sure

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
sure

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.330

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
like when you send me to kill spiders in

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.969 
like when you send me to kill spiders in
your<00:01:10.400> bathtub<00:01:10.640> oh<00:01:14.680> okay

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
your bathtub oh okay

your bathtub oh okay
for<00:01:16.729> months<00:01:17.380> yeah<00:01:18.400> and<00:01:19.510> I'm<00:01:20.510> a<00:01:20.600> little<00:01:20.869> worried

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
for months yeah and I'm a little worried

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.900 
for months yeah and I'm a little worried
because<00:01:21.350> things<00:01:21.890> between<00:01:22.100> us<00:01:22.310> have<00:01:22.550> been<00:01:22.580> so

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
because things between us have been so

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.060 
because things between us have been so
great<00:01:23.240> and<00:01:23.270> I'd<00:01:24.260> hate<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:24.410> do<00:01:24.590> anything<00:01:24.860> that

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
great and I'd hate to do anything that

Oh sweetie if you're gonna screw things

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.530 
Oh sweetie if you're gonna screw things
up<00:01:28.130> it's<00:01:28.340> gonna<00:01:28.490> be<00:01:28.550> while<00:01:28.850> you're<00:01:29.000> here<00:01:29.330> not

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
up it's gonna be while you're here not

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:37.420 
up it's gonna be while you're here not
while<00:01:29.690> you're<00:01:29.810> away<00:01:35.320> no<00:01:36.320> I<00:01:36.530> mean<00:01:36.710> look<00:01:37.009> you<00:01:37.220> you

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
while you're away no I mean look you you

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.830 
while you're away no I mean look you you
have<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:37.850> go<00:01:37.970> it<00:01:38.180> sounds<00:01:38.360> like<00:01:38.540> an<00:01:38.660> amazing

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
have to go it sounds like an amazing

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.900 
have to go it sounds like an amazing
opportunity<00:01:39.110> and<00:01:40.009> I'm<00:01:40.160> just<00:01:40.369> basing<00:01:40.759> that<00:01:40.850> on

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
sure Sheldon's nervous about me leaving

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:56.820 
sure Sheldon's nervous about me leaving
just<00:01:55.700> keep<00:01:55.850> an<00:01:56.000> eye<00:01:56.090> on<00:01:56.119> him<00:01:56.420> while<00:01:56.450> I'm<00:01:56.600> gone
