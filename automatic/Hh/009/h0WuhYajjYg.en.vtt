00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:11.330
 dear friends of all a little in the 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.820
 today we are going to play a very 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.640
 interesting that has everything to do with 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.800
 our health section definitely 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.050
 science and medical advances all 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.839
 the days lead us to have more skin 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.669
 pretty more careful keep this 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.560
 secret of eternal youth what 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:30.050
 important is to choose which is the best 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.090
 treatment depending on the case and the 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.079
 skin type today we're going 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.450
 to talk about a procedure that 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.070
 called the microdermabrasion and the doctor 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.270
 Monica Zapata who is already a doctor 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.879
 dermatologist will be in charge of 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.070
 tell us step by step and why 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.640
 a procedure as its name says 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.170
 it is micro of remembrance means I 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.870
 I imagine him call it and I've already 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.530
 done and I'm in the procedure in 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.870
 the process that should be like as a 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.699
 stimulus that is being given to the skin 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.579
 so that he can produce all those 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.070
 cells that have died and remove by 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.350
 of course those that are no longer useful 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:10.189
 exactly that is the word is 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.800
 abrasion the prayer is to remove is to withdraw 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.290
 and the procedure that is performed 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.210
 formerly it is called derma prayer but 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.880
 it was a very painful procedure that 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.920
 generates a very large disability there was 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.080
 what to do with anesthesia and 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.520
 performed for deep scars to 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.180
 patients with very bad acne scars 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.280
 severe but more or less in 1960 the 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.280
 Chinese and Orientals began to 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.720
 use it and they called it 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.790
 microdermabrasion and they made her a 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.060
 modification and what you want to say is a 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.700
 simple procedure easy to do not 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.190
 generates no disability does not generate 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.300
 redness and it's very versatile because 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.290
 Serves for aging for spots 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.900
 obviously accompanying treatments 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.950
 Topical for acne scars for 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.290
 other surgical scars 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.360
 traumatic or just for whom I 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.310
 he says I have the pretty ones very open and I 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.020
 I want to improve the quality of skin me 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.869
 I want to refresh her I want to see her more 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.470
 cute we can also do it there are two 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.390
 classes one is with crystals that is a lot 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.030
 stronger is a much more abrasion 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.440
 deep and one without crystals that is 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.910
 much softer 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.590
 also for patients that although 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.980
 they require a strong procedure not what 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.200
 they tolerate them hurts they annoy you can 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.930
 do anywhere on the body in 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.170
 the face in the neck in the hands by 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.880
 example in scars on the body not 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.380
 they have no contraindication because 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.070
 we are not using any medication 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.510
 we are not applying any substance 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.790
 then everyone can do it 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.850
 the important care is not having 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.430
 solar exposure is long I'm leaving 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.640
 vacation I'm going for a ride that 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.050
 yes it should not be done and a big advantage 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.880
 as soon as I finish the procedure 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.530
 I can make up and I can continue with 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.500
 my normal activities and nothing happens 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.720
 Dr. Monica, I'm in the process of 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.640
 microdermabrasion but I would like 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.320
 share with viewers what is 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.660
 that step by step 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.460
 what is the beginning and the end of a 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.800
 good maturation micro session is 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.230
 very simple the patient arrives the des 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.870
 we make up totally except the eyes 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.760
 that in our eyes we do not work and 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.890
 after having the face very well 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.460
 clean we start with the process 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.880
 when we are going to work with crystals 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.770
 let's go first a simple pass 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.520
 construction the suction that makes 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:35.470
 stimulates circulation and that stimulates 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.600
 new generation of collagen then 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.730
 we are regenerating collagen improving 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.830
 the microvasculature making the skin 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.020
 it gets nicer and later 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.090
 we added the crystals and with that 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.250
 we make the strong abrasion that is the 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.590
 part as of exfoliation to withdraw 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.110
 Dead cells improve the 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.870
 scars because text that textually 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.020
 they are smoothed but can also be used in 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.630
 stretch marks and then we finish 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.810
 the procedure we apply a water 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.390
 special a thermal water and a mask 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.070
 cool to tone the skin and close the 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.200
 pores and the procedure was finished 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.510
 female doctor several 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.100
 sessions or with a single session of micro 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.530
 Maturation will be the results 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.150
 expected depends what I depend 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.680
 want to do if it's a skin like yours 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.750
 it's a pretty skin with no fresh scars 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.150
 maybe one session every two or three 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.460
 months a maintenance but if I 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.090
 I have for example in stretch marks 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.060
 acne scars 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.400
 it's a deep big scar I les 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.680
 programmed more or less a five pack 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.690
 or six sessions one each month and of 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.449
 according to the evolution we decide if 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.639
 we follow or accompany with another 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.990
 obvious procedure when I do a 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.669
 treatment scheme of several 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.729
 sessions I need additionally 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:53.290
 medical treatment my famous cremitas 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.419
 and most importantly because they are 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.770
 important because they make me last in 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.780
 time what I am doing here 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.610
 that was my next doctor question 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.010
 Monica how to get a treatment 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.360
 like microdermabrasion but hard in 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.240
 time I know that you should do a 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.380
 Support every 2-3 months but 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.630
 I also understand that it is good 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.000
 important food and preserve 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.680
 that outline of the formula that you 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.040
 will prescribe as treatments 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.600
 Topicals also clear the creams at home 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.090
 the most important thing and the foreheads tell me 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.740
 that does not help that if it works and we see it 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.120
 caring lady who applies everything 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.310
 the days a creampie has a skin 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.990
 different and better why because I with 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.470
 a cream I'm applying vitamin c 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.960
 glycolic acid retinoic acid retinol 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.580
 a lot of resveratrol substances that 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.689
 they will benefit the skin and they will 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.330
 nourish 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:43.299
 of all the normal lessons of the day 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.849
 the grease the sweat the makeup but 

00:05:43.299 --> 00:05:48.099
 additionally the internal part and it is 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:50.199
 effectively one reflects in your body 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:53.110
 what does not have the part internally 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:56.249
 nutritious of a good water feed 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.449
 fruits exercise all that helps us 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:00.309
 Dr. Monica Zapata today 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:03.129
 we learned a new term from the 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:04.209
 dermatology the microdermabrasion was 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:06.249
 in a treatment that serves 

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:08.319
 definitely to improve our 

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:10.149
 skin but what is really important is 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:13.509
 that you have a good advice 

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:15.219
 know exactly how many sessions and 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:17.559
 how to keep it they are the last 

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:19.989
 medical tricks that the doctor gave us 

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:21.729
 Monica Zapata always welcome to all 

00:06:19.989 --> 00:06:22.569
 a little and thank you for inviting me this 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:26.489
 so special space 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:26.489
 thank you very much always welcome
