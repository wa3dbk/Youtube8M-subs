00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 so people welcome back to the display 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:11.000
 from black ops 2 online this time with a 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.000
 team deathmatch and ice and water 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.330
 clearly yes I find neither of maps 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.439
 really good 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.510
 that will be much better the folk in after 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:38.219
 I'm not so good at it though 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:39.440
 the fair better just because of it 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:51.690
 respect, think highly of 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:54.629
 Well, that's me, that's me 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.980
 although I assume that 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:03.030
 real I 've been against me 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:11.250
 played and from the profile the noble that 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:15.330
 I like yeah I know that really weird 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.430
 is real punishment to me 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.110
 you are real you can like one 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.640
 preview team after relocation would be further 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.640
 down blablabla you do not take any 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:31.049
 responsibility that already played 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:35.159
 I will kill him but he does not 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.810
 it would have looked more from where it stands 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.799
 my name where does my name stand 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.759
 at least parts of it loaded as witnesses 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:48.710
 but quite cool yes against the sun a beer 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.710
 to play an infamous among others 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.520
 So is a lot like you 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.020
 that's that's really bad that was 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.160
 is that that's how I'm going myself 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.420
 is not that was not because 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.650
 I ignored that completely but 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.510
 No 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:13.300
 yes, if I'm so specific about it 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:14.770
 nobody should have been able to think 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.220
 you're somehow so had a few 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.209
 but do it 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.600
 I can of course not always 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.380
 do 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.260
 it's bad when he works more 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:31.480
 work work from the sea more work 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.800
 okay what's good that's that was that 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.950
 a bad game 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:40.270
 that is that's my that's my best 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.600
 sports play that's right for me 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.600
 the beginning is 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.959
 I'm sure the saying was true 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.019
 very different but still that was yes 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.040
 also very different 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.750
 but it makes it so clear 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.750
 well i'm a bit too offensive again 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.760
 from Zambia went out 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:17.099
 good grades made this clear I have to 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.849
 At the same time, this is what God is 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:25.489
 a recoil things rather that there is 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.489
 yes not at all there is not there 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:39.349
 daniel Dickopf we can win 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:41.819
 In any case , I liked that badly 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:46.290
 actually played what is that? 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:49.980
 somehow it will be fine 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.329
 Someday what you that for strange mines 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.940
 the nerves in the 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:04:00.000
 they sadly make me so sad 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:11.780
 play comes right at the moment is yes 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:16.290
 in the head against a very bad feeling 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.570
 So I really do not come here like this 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.220
 not at all like me I come back completely 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.940
 a bit too bad because the 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.940
 more because I'm pretty cool 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.720
 Corner then the opponent dies 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:43.210
 I can not do it because it's nothing 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.210
 nice vector with all the trimmings 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:58.009
 I can not find anyone but I can see them 

00:04:56.149 --> 00:05:15.969
 on the map and I think here was 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:22.429
 Never get out of a police no patents is dead 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:23.959
 also good the holy shit I have there 

00:05:22.429 --> 00:05:29.019
 saved you 

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:29.019
 you have to get out of there 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.210
 what was that 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.210
 No 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:54.229
 thanks for the info a77 who 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.879
 that was 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:09.930
 na as well as killed 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:16.210
 ok I have to go back first 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:22.480
 why not this here but they are running 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:24.930
 also all with mp 7 would like to do 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.930
 Me too 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:46.630
 No why should I then times to invite 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.680
 if somehow now against why we 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.830
 we are always opposed to it 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.540
 do not let up 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.030
 That is a legitimate question that can 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:59.410
 I do not answer 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:07:02.200
 seriously says oh so new is that things 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:04.180
 even more bearable is even 100 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.780
 opponent 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:11.320
 yes clearly way too much harm the 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:13.960
 Opponents Rhine look for everything is so 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.350
 game is running that may not be so 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.350
 serious 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:26.610
 Unbelievable here because they are an ice cream 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.610
 out 

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:37.930
 the wars award was good so bad yes so 

00:07:36.219 --> 00:07:39.969
 as human as I think I was 

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:46.419
 even he just bad one 

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:49.620
 only one gets everyone jumps in and 

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:51.999
 nice connection interrupted 

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:54.089
 if that's what you do until the next one 

00:07:51.999 --> 00:07:54.089
 times
