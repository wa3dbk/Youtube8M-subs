00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
like that was a little bit underhanded

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.840 
like that was a little bit underhanded
and<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.979> really<00:01:32.250> like<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.460> when<00:01:32.549> free-to-play

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
and I really like it when free-to-play

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.280 
and I really like it when free-to-play

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
games give us things that we can

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.810 
games give us things that we can
purchase<00:01:34.439> rather<00:01:34.860> than<00:01:35.070> take<00:01:35.310> away<00:01:35.549> things

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820

purchase rather than take away things
that<00:01:36.060> really<00:01:36.270> should<00:01:36.570> just<00:01:36.750> be<00:01:37.049> there<00:01:37.259> anyways

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
that really should just be there anyways

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.069 
that really should just be there anyways
well<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.460> game<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.880> social<00:01:39.360> based<00:01:39.570> it's

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.359 
well the game is social based it's
actually<00:01:40.350> tragic<00:01:40.650> for<00:01:40.799> me<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.950> see<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.100> most

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
actually tragic for me to see that most

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.219 
actually tragic for me to see that most
of<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.520> stuff<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.850> can<00:01:41.970> craft<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.659> do

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
of the stuff that you can craft and do

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.770 
of the stuff that you can craft and do
is<00:01:43.680> focused<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.250> combat<00:01:44.820> which<00:01:45.240> would<00:01:45.450> be<00:01:45.570> fine

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
is focused on combat which would be fine

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.420 
is focused on combat which would be fine
if<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.020> combat<00:01:46.350> was<00:01:46.380> at<00:01:46.590> all<00:01:46.680> enjoyable<00:01:47.220> its

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
if the combat was at all enjoyable its

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.429 
if the combat was at all enjoyable its
stance<00:01:47.850> though<00:01:48.030> combat<00:01:48.360> with<00:01:48.600> no<00:01:48.930> real<00:01:49.110> combo

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
stance though combat with no real combo

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.380 
stance though combat with no real combo
system<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.189> visual<00:01:50.460> graphics<00:01:50.820> pretty

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
system and the visual graphics pretty

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.090 
system and the visual graphics pretty
much<00:01:51.509> non-existent<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.530> there<00:01:52.890> are<00:01:52.920> other

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
much non-existent so there are other

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.590 
much non-existent so there are other
games<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.579> do<00:01:53.700> social<00:01:54.000> engineering<00:01:54.329> better

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
games that do social engineering better

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.240 
games that do social engineering better
since<00:01:54.899> they<00:01:55.020> have<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> plethora<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.590> mini<00:01:56.009> games

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
since they have a plethora of mini games

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.969 
since they have a plethora of mini games
such<00:01:56.729> as<00:01:56.759> Guild<00:01:57.119> Wars<00:01:57.270> 2<00:01:57.390> or<00:01:57.750> Wizards<00:01:58.229> 101<00:01:58.649> but

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
such as Guild Wars 2 or Wizards 101 but

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.709 
such as Guild Wars 2 or Wizards 101 but
this<00:01:59.100> game<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.430> at<00:01:59.729> least<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.969> good<00:02:00.119> attempt<00:02:00.540> and

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
this game is at least a good attempt and

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.480 
this game is at least a good attempt and
I<00:02:01.290> think<00:02:01.409> perfectly<00:02:01.829> worthy<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.219> someone's

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
I think perfectly worthy of someone's

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.670 
I think perfectly worthy of someone's
first<00:02:02.610> MMO<00:02:02.969> experience<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.380> would<00:02:04.469> even

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
first MMO experience and it would even

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.350 
first MMO experience and it would even
be<00:02:04.770> enjoyable<00:02:05.130> for<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.430> chaperone<00:02:05.939> because<00:02:06.270> of

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
be enjoyable for a chaperone because of

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.240 
be enjoyable for a chaperone because of
the<00:02:06.420> comfortable<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.020> cute<00:02:07.380> graphics<00:02:07.590> so
