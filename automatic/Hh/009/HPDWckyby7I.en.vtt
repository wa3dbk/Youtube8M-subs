00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.499
 - Two years ago a dimensional door opened, the US Army sent 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:18.650
 to several people at the scene of the event. From there, contact with 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.840
 they and the satellites that tried to observe the place, fell. 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:32.619
 -None of the units sent back did not even know it was theirs. 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:44.079
 -Two years later. -Are you OK? 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:01:02.879
 -Yes. -What happened? 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:13.970
 -I think the generator has been turned off. -Gus up. 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.170
 -What happen? -Just the generator again? 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.050
 - Yes, but it is rare that at this point we have a generator. 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.750
 - Been two weeks failing. - Yes, but it happened two years ago already. 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.170
 -Well, we'll watch the windows. -Luck. 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.100
 - Do we have to go down again? -That seems ... No grace of darkness 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:35.220
 at night. -I think the lantern is shutting down. 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:43.030
 -Fuck. -It has been turned off. Let's go!. 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:02:19.019
 -It does not look like shit, man. -The truth is that I do not see anything, if I had 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.599
 here one of those things was going to give us strong and loose. 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:35.379
 -The generator is around here. - Here it is, cover me. 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:03:06.659
 -I'm going to see if everything is quiet. -Have come back in. Let's get out of here. Let's go 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:19.170
 run. -Are you OK? What happened? 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.680
 -We've found another one. -Joder, but how do they come in? 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:39.319
 -I do not know. We will have to revise the entire area again. 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.319
 -What a remedy? -We should rest. 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.120
 -You are right. - I ask the first guard. 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:04:03.240
 At least you call. - Come up! 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:05:18.620
 -There is a huge group out there, you have to help me, come wake up. 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:27.650
 -Dan, we have to wait for them to pass and then we will annihilate the rest. 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.390
 -Gabriel, now open the door and kill the rest. 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:06:35.990
 -We are surrounded. -Shit. 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:07:07.050
 - The generator again? -Yes again. (Laughter) 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:14.799
 -I like to fuck.
