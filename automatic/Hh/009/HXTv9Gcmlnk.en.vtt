00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
that's that's one of them you know we

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.479 
that's that's one of them you know we
turn<00:02:19.319> one<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.530> those<00:02:19.650> guys<00:02:19.800> free<00:02:20.069> thinks<00:02:20.430> he

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
that's what they want to do and then we

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.510 
that's what they want to do and then we
can<00:02:23.910> hit<00:02:24.000> them<00:02:24.060> like<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:25.430> we<00:02:26.430> have

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
can hit them like that and so we have

lots<00:02:26.670> of<00:02:26.819> ways<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.000> do<00:02:27.239> it<00:02:27.360> depends<00:02:28.050> on<00:02:28.110> the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
lots of ways to do it depends on the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.420 
lots of ways to do it depends on the
scheme<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.620> stuff<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:28.980> just<00:02:29.010> worked<00:02:29.280> out

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
scheme and stuff and it just worked out

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.070 
scheme and stuff and it just worked out
you<00:02:29.940> know<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.150> scheme<00:02:30.390> was<00:02:30.420> against<00:02:30.900> these

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
you know the scheme was against these

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.440 
you know the scheme was against these
guys<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.590> we<00:02:31.680> could<00:02:31.830> run<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.100> in<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.700> yard

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
guys that we could run that in the yard

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.509 
guys that we could run that in the yard
our<00:02:33.989> goal<00:02:34.260> is<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.590> get<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.860> touchdown<00:02:35.070> you<00:02:35.430> know

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
that's what we wanted we thought we'd

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.960 
that's what we wanted we thought we'd
get<00:02:36.750> man<00:02:36.930> coverage<00:02:37.370> once<00:02:38.370> we<00:02:38.519> threw<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.790> fade

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
get man coverage once we threw the fade

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.729 
get man coverage once we threw the fade
and<00:02:39.120> got<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.390> touchdown<00:02:39.630> on<00:02:39.840> there<00:02:40.140> on<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:40.620> one

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
and got a touchdown on there on that one

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.410 
and got a touchdown on there on that one
of<00:02:40.830> their<00:02:40.920> corners<00:02:41.280> they<00:02:41.820> went<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.060> cover<00:02:42.209> two

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
of their corners they went to cover two

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.479 
of their corners they went to cover two
so<00:02:42.660> we<00:02:43.140> know<00:02:43.260> we<00:02:43.380> had<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.590> run<00:02:43.709> it<00:02:43.800> in<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.100> so

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
so we know we had to run it in and so

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.430
