front of me

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:46.430 
front of me
this<00:00:39.030> one<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:42.320> true<00:00:44.629> if<00:00:45.629> my<00:00:45.899> camera<00:00:46.289> will

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
this one is a true if my camera will

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:56.420 
this one is a true if my camera will
focus<00:00:48.410> it<00:00:49.410> grew<00:00:50.180> and<00:00:51.199> it's<00:00:52.199> primo<00:00:54.559> but<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:56.190> can

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
focus it grew and it's primo but you can

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.380

that the tan colors and white are

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.179 
that the tan colors and white are
already<00:02:32.209> pretty<00:02:32.420> soft<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.590> this<00:02:33.739> is<00:02:33.920> pretty

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:34.189 
already pretty soft so this is pretty

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.360 
already pretty soft so this is pretty
soft<00:02:34.519> so<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:34.849> just<00:02:35.000> want<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.739> not<00:02:36.739> really<00:02:37.129> need

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
soft so you just want to not really need

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.940 
soft so you just want to not really need
it<00:02:37.519> too<00:02:37.760> much<00:02:37.989> just<00:02:38.989> a<00:02:39.170> little<00:02:39.230> bit<00:02:39.560> and

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
it too much just a little bit and

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:47.849 
it too much just a little bit and

to go ahead and knead it and it's okay

to go ahead and knead it and it's okay
to<00:04:33.690> touch<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:35.310> oils<00:04:36.300> I<00:04:36.510> think<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:37.050> only

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
to touch the oils I think the only

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.370 
to touch the oils I think the only
reason<00:04:37.500> that<00:04:37.710> they<00:04:38.010> say<00:04:38.310> you<00:04:39.180> know<00:04:39.300> not<00:04:39.540> to<00:04:39.810> use

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.660 

your<00:04:43.460> hands<00:04:44.460> is<00:04:44.640> because<00:04:45.090> your<00:04:45.720> hands<00:04:46.140> absorb

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
your hands is because your hands absorb

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.130 
your hands is because your hands absorb
everything<00:04:47.670> like<00:04:47.910> lotions<00:04:48.480> and<00:04:48.660> stuff<00:04:48.840> like

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
everything like lotions and stuff like

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.740 
everything like lotions and stuff like
that<00:04:52.070> so<00:04:53.070> yeah<00:04:53.430> your<00:04:53.670> hands<00:04:53.970> will<00:04:54.210> just<00:04:54.240> smell

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
that so yeah your hands will just smell

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.090 
that so yeah your hands will just smell
like<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:55.230> oil<00:04:55.500> for<00:04:56.310> quite<00:04:56.790> a<00:04:56.820> while<00:04:58.040> so<00:04:59.040> I've

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
like the oil for quite a while so I've

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.400 
like the oil for quite a while so I've
needed<00:04:59.430> it<00:04:59.700> a<00:04:59.880> little<00:05:00.120> bit<00:05:00.330> now<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:00.990> thing

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
needed it a little bit now the thing

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.690 
needed it a little bit now the thing
with<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:02.160> sense<00:05:02.460> is<00:05:02.790> if<00:05:03.030> you<00:05:03.180> add<00:05:03.390> too<00:05:04.020> much

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
with the sense is if you add too much

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.050 
with the sense is if you add too much
scent<00:05:05.700> then<00:05:06.800> your<00:05:07.800> clay<00:05:08.070> can<00:05:08.280> become<00:05:08.610> really

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
scent then your clay can become really

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.440 
scent then your clay can become really
gooey<00:05:09.330> I<00:05:09.510> guess<00:05:09.930> and<00:05:10.400> break<00:05:11.400> and<00:05:11.820> crack<00:05:12.120> when

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
gooey I guess and break and crack when

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.900 
gooey I guess and break and crack when
you<00:05:13.430> put<00:05:14.430> it<00:05:14.520> in<00:05:14.880> the<00:05:15.800> oven<00:05:16.800> to<00:05:17.100> bake<00:05:17.250> but<00:05:17.880> I

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
you put it in the oven to bake but I

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.240 
you put it in the oven to bake but I
haven't<00:05:18.210> really<00:05:18.450> had<00:05:18.630> a<00:05:18.690> problem<00:05:18.960> and<00:05:19.380> to<00:05:19.860> me<00:05:20.040> I

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
haven't really had a problem and to me I

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.030 
haven't really had a problem and to me I
actually<00:05:20.520> use<00:05:20.970> quite<00:05:21.090> a<00:05:21.300> bit<00:05:21.830> because<00:05:22.830> I

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
actually use quite a bit because I

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.500 
actually use quite a bit because I
really<00:05:23.520> like<00:05:23.730> them<00:05:24.360> to<00:05:24.570> smell<00:05:24.810> strong<00:05:25.400> so<00:05:26.510> I've

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
really like them to smell strong so I've

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.710 
really like them to smell strong so I've
needed<00:05:28.350> it<00:05:28.620> and<00:05:28.800> flatten<00:05:29.100> it<00:05:29.340> out<00:05:29.430> again<00:05:29.760> and

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
needed it and flatten it out again and

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.530 
needed it and flatten it out again and
I'm<00:05:31.110> just<00:05:31.140> gonna<00:05:31.440> take<00:05:33.020> whatever<00:05:34.020> I<00:05:34.140> have<00:05:34.470> left

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
I'm just gonna take whatever I have left

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:43.429 
I'm just gonna take whatever I have left
on<00:05:36.540> the<00:05:36.780> q-tip<00:05:37.320> and<00:05:37.650> add<00:05:38.280> some<00:05:38.880> more

00:05:43.429 --> 00:05:43.439 

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:48.109 

don't<00:05:44.039> and<00:05:44.249> set<00:05:44.519> it<00:05:44.669> on<00:05:44.819> your<00:05:45.389> paper<00:05:46.669> towel<00:05:47.669> or

00:05:48.109 --> 00:05:48.119 
don't and set it on your paper towel or

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:50.959 
don't and set it on your paper towel or
toilet<00:05:48.300> paper<00:05:49.399> so<00:05:50.399> you<00:05:50.459> don't<00:05:50.699> have<00:05:50.819> oil

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:50.969 
toilet paper so you don't have oil

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:51.559 
toilet paper so you don't have oil
everywhere

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:51.569 
everywhere

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:57.730 
everywhere
and<00:05:51.809> then<00:05:51.899> just<00:05:52.289> need<00:05:52.830> it

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.530 

now<00:05:58.310> I've<00:05:58.550> never<00:06:00.520> used<00:06:01.520> scented<00:06:02.030> clay<00:06:02.270> in<00:06:02.420> a

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
now I've never used scented clay in a

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:08.860 
now I've never used scented clay in a
mold<00:06:02.810> so<00:06:03.230> I<00:06:03.260> don't<00:06:03.650> know<00:06:03.890> if<00:06:04.280> it<00:06:07.630> makes<00:06:08.630> the

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
mold so I don't know if it makes the

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.500 
mold so I don't know if it makes the
mold<00:06:09.110> smell<00:06:09.470> or<00:06:09.740> anything<00:06:10.040> but<00:06:10.670> I<00:06:10.910> will<00:06:10.970> find

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
mold smell or anything but I will find

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:19.360 
mold smell or anything but I will find
out<00:06:11.720> and<00:06:12.730> keep<00:06:13.730> you<00:06:13.880> updated<00:06:17.500> so<00:06:18.500> we<00:06:18.980> have<00:06:19.220> that

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370 
out and keep you updated so we have that

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.030 
out and keep you updated so we have that
and<00:06:19.580> usually<00:06:20.120> how<00:06:20.390> I<00:06:20.420> tell<00:06:20.840> if<00:06:21.350> I<00:06:21.980> think

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:22.040 
and usually how I tell if I think

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.890 
and usually how I tell if I think
there's<00:06:22.430> enough<00:06:22.730> scent<00:06:23.060> on<00:06:23.240> it<00:06:23.270> I<00:06:23.600> actually

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
there's enough scent on it I actually

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.610 
there's enough scent on it I actually
smell<00:06:24.290> it<00:06:24.470> and<00:06:25.400> you<00:06:25.460> can<00:06:26.390> smell<00:06:27.200> it<00:06:27.260> pretty

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
smell it and you can smell it pretty

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.920 
smell it and you can smell it pretty
good<00:06:27.860> but<00:06:28.250> it's<00:06:28.400> not<00:06:28.580> so<00:06:29.030> like<00:06:29.270> what<00:06:29.570> I<00:06:29.600> like

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
good but it's not so like what I like

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.180 
good but it's not so like what I like
because<00:06:30.050> I<00:06:30.200> like<00:06:30.230> them<00:06:30.560> others<00:06:30.860> like<00:06:31.130> and<00:06:31.820> see

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
because I like them others like and see

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:38.470 
because I like them others like and see
it's<00:06:34.190> still<00:06:34.730> pretty<00:06:36.340> stretchy<00:06:37.340> so<00:06:38.150> I'm<00:06:38.240> just

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:38.480 
it's still pretty stretchy so I'm just

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.250 
it's still pretty stretchy so I'm just
gonna<00:06:38.600> take<00:06:39.020> the<00:06:39.920> q-tip<00:06:40.340> again<00:06:40.570> with<00:06:41.570> the<00:06:42.050> oil

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:42.260 
gonna take the q-tip again with the oil

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.050 
gonna take the q-tip again with the oil
because<00:06:42.560> you<00:06:42.590> can<00:06:42.830> see<00:06:43.100> just<00:06:43.490> that<00:06:43.640> one<00:06:43.910> little

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
because you can see just that one little

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.200 
because you can see just that one little
dip<00:06:44.390> that<00:06:44.540> we<00:06:44.690> did<00:06:45.040> the<00:06:46.040> q-tip<00:06:46.670> is<00:06:46.850> still

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210 
dip that we did the q-tip is still

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:52.120 
dip that we did the q-tip is still
really<00:06:48.130> covered<00:06:49.150> in<00:06:50.150> oil<00:06:50.710> so<00:06:51.710> you<00:06:51.770> don't

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.130 
really covered in oil so you don't

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.740 
really covered in oil so you don't
really<00:06:53.050> use<00:06:54.050> that<00:06:54.080> much<00:06:55.420> so<00:06:56.420> then<00:06:56.540> we're<00:06:56.720> just

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:56.750 
really use that much so then we're just

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:04.960 
really use that much so then we're just
gonna<00:06:57.020> knead<00:06:57.740> it<00:06:57.920> again

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:04.970 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.610 

and<00:07:05.980> smell<00:07:06.980> it<00:07:07.190> you<00:07:08.120> like<00:07:08.570> it's<00:07:08.750> hard<00:07:08.990> to<00:07:09.170> smell

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:09.620 
and smell it you like it's hard to smell

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.430 
and smell it you like it's hard to smell
it<00:07:10.340> because<00:07:10.970> clay<00:07:11.360> does<00:07:11.630> have<00:07:11.840> like<00:07:11.990> a<00:07:12.050> scent

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:12.440 
it because clay does have like a scent

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:18.040 
it because clay does have like a scent
to<00:07:12.710> it<00:07:12.860> so<00:07:13.700> just<00:07:14.090> keep<00:07:14.360> adding<00:07:16.150> the<00:07:17.150> oils<00:07:17.600> to<00:07:17.900> it

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.050 
to it so just keep adding the oils to it

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.390 
to it so just keep adding the oils to it
until<00:07:18.710> you<00:07:19.160> like<00:07:19.520> how<00:07:20.510> strong<00:07:20.930> it<00:07:21.230> smells<00:07:21.590> but

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 
until you like how strong it smells but

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.880 
until you like how strong it smells but
keep<00:07:22.760> an<00:07:22.970> eye<00:07:23.150> on<00:07:23.180> the<00:07:23.960> clay<00:07:24.200> to<00:07:24.260> make<00:07:24.590> sure

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:24.890 
keep an eye on the clay to make sure

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.680 
keep an eye on the clay to make sure
it's<00:07:25.100> not<00:07:25.280> too<00:07:25.640> gooey<00:07:25.910> like<00:07:26.180> where<00:07:26.450> when<00:07:26.600> you

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:26.690 
it's not too gooey like where when you

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.630 
it's not too gooey like where when you
pull<00:07:26.960> it<00:07:27.110> apart<00:07:27.170> it<00:07:27.650> just<00:07:27.890> changed<00:07:28.160> apartment

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:28.640 
pull it apart it just changed apartment

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.100 
pull it apart it just changed apartment
at<00:07:28.880> least<00:07:28.940> make<00:07:29.450> sure<00:07:29.480> it<00:07:29.690> still<00:07:29.930> has<00:07:30.080> some

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:30.110 
at least make sure it still has some

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:36.450 
at least make sure it still has some
less<00:07:31.070> tissa<00:07:31.790> t<00:07:32.920> so<00:07:33.920> this<00:07:34.100> is<00:07:34.690> part<00:07:35.690> one<00:07:35.930> of

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:36.460 
less tissa t so this is part one of

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:41.290 
less tissa t so this is part one of
setting<00:07:37.460> polymer<00:07:37.820> clay<00:07:39.790> so<00:07:40.790> be<00:07:41.150> on<00:07:41.240> the

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:41.300 
setting polymer clay so be on the

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.200 
setting polymer clay so be on the
lookout<00:07:41.630> for<00:07:41.690> part<00:07:42.050> two
