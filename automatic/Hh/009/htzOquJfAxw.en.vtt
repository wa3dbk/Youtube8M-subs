play<00:03:48.480> books<00:03:48.720> in<00:03:48.930> my<00:03:49.110> opinion<00:03:49.470> we<00:03:50.160> got<00:03:50.310> Flores

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
play books in my opinion we got Flores

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.820 
play books in my opinion we got Flores
the<00:03:51.270> head<00:03:51.630> coach<00:03:51.900> he<00:03:52.140> gets<00:03:52.290> plus<00:03:52.590> two

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
the head coach he gets plus two

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.830 
the head coach he gets plus two
acceleration<00:03:53.730> for<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.120> whole<00:03:54.300> team<00:03:54.540> so<00:03:54.810> that

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
acceleration for the whole team so that

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.870 
acceleration for the whole team so that
helps<00:03:55.380> out<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.620> little<00:03:55.830> bit<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.190> one<00:03:56.700> of<00:03:56.730> the

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
helps out a little bit and one of the

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.760 
helps out a little bit and one of the
best<00:03:57.060> defenses<00:03:57.630> in<00:03:57.660> my<00:03:58.020> opinion<00:03:58.440> is<00:03:58.740> the

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
best defenses in my opinion is the

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.760 
best defenses in my opinion is the
Buccaneers<00:03:59.460> defense<00:03:59.910> if<00:04:00.570> you're<00:04:00.840> new<00:04:01.140> to<00:04:01.440> mud

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
Buccaneers defense if you're new to mud

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.770 
Buccaneers defense if you're new to mud
this<00:04:02.460> is<00:04:02.640> definitely<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.120> playbook<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.630> go

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780
