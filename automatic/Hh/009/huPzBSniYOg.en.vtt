or<00:02:32.950> stronger<00:02:33.820> paper<00:02:34.090> tower<00:02:34.300> actually<00:02:34.630> right

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
or stronger paper tower actually right

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.220 
or stronger paper tower actually right
to<00:02:35.770> do<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.340> you<00:02:36.430> just<00:02:36.460> twist<00:02:37.210> it<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:38.050> you

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
to do that and you just twist it and you

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.449 
to do that and you just twist it and you
twist<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:39.640> into<00:02:39.940> like<00:02:40.570> the<00:02:40.830> string<00:02:41.830> or<00:02:42.160> wake

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459

oil okay so so we'll cover maybe you
know<00:03:30.040> this<00:03:30.250> much<00:03:30.459> amount<00:03:30.790> of<00:03:31.030> oil<00:03:31.739> and<00:03:32.739> then

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
know this much amount of oil and then

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.790 
know this much amount of oil and then
you<00:03:33.670> can<00:03:33.970> see<00:03:34.120> that<00:03:34.330> okay<00:03:34.660> so<00:03:34.840> don't<00:03:35.260> overflow

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
you can see that okay so don't overflow

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.180 
you can see that okay so don't overflow
it<00:03:36.040> and<00:03:36.310> then<00:03:36.940> just<00:03:37.840> light<00:03:38.050> the<00:03:38.290> of<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:39.010> wig

it and then just light the of the wig

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.910 
it and then just light the of the wig
and<00:03:39.430> it<00:03:40.060> should<00:03:40.239> burn<00:03:40.420> quite<00:03:41.050> well<00:03:41.320> for<00:03:41.590> and

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
and it should burn quite well for and

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.009 
and it should burn quite well for and
for<00:03:42.580> this<00:03:42.670> case<00:03:42.880> for<00:03:43.120> about<00:03:43.180> thirty<00:03:43.660> to<00:03:43.870> fifty

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
for this case for about thirty to fifty

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.170 
for this case for about thirty to fifty
milliliter<00:03:44.620> it<00:03:44.800> could<00:03:44.920> last<00:03:45.100> you<00:03:45.250> for<00:03:45.459> at

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
milliliter it could last you for at

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.090 
milliliter it could last you for at
least<00:03:46.330> four<00:03:46.690> to<00:03:46.840> five<00:03:47.110> hour<00:03:47.320> maybe<00:03:47.530> longer<00:03:47.890> I

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
least four to five hour maybe longer I

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.710 
least four to five hour maybe longer I
haven't<00:03:48.370> actually<00:03:48.489> test<00:03:49.150> how<00:03:49.299> long<00:03:49.480> it<00:03:49.660> will

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
haven't actually test how long it will

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.190 
haven't actually test how long it will
last<00:03:49.780> but<00:03:50.320> the<00:03:51.310> last<00:03:51.459> time<00:03:51.700> I<00:03:51.760> lighted<00:03:52.330> for<00:03:53.019> up

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
last but the last time I lighted for up

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.830 
last but the last time I lighted for up
to<00:03:53.380> two<00:03:53.560> hours<00:03:54.269> there<00:03:55.269> was<00:03:55.360> still<00:03:55.510> a<00:03:55.570> lot<00:03:55.810> of

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
to two hours there was still a lot of

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.830 
to two hours there was still a lot of
waste<00:03:56.799> vegetable<00:03:57.100> oil<00:03:57.430> so<00:03:58.090> I<00:03:58.180> suspect<00:03:58.780> that

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
waste vegetable oil so I suspect that

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.070 
waste vegetable oil so I suspect that
just<00:03:59.140> tiny<00:03:59.860> amount<00:04:00.280> of<00:04:00.540> wasted<00:04:01.540> vegetable<00:04:01.900> oil

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
just tiny amount of wasted vegetable oil

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.080 
just tiny amount of wasted vegetable oil
will<00:04:02.260> last<00:04:02.440> me<00:04:02.620> at<00:04:02.709> least<00:04:02.890> ten<00:04:03.070> hours<00:04:03.430> all

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
will last me at least ten hours all

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.320 
will last me at least ten hours all
right<00:04:04.170> okay<00:04:05.170> let's<00:04:05.380> give<00:04:05.830> it<00:04:05.920> a<00:04:06.010> try<00:04:06.220> now<00:04:06.330> okay

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
right okay let's give it a try now okay

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.369 
right okay let's give it a try now okay
let's<00:04:07.510> let<00:04:07.720> it

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.819 

there<00:04:12.379> we<00:04:12.500> go<00:04:13.150> beautiful<00:04:14.180> okay<00:04:14.810> you<00:04:15.500> notice

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
there we go beautiful okay you notice

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.189 
there we go beautiful okay you notice
that<00:04:15.980> it<00:04:16.160> been<00:04:16.370> quite<00:04:17.299> efficiently<00:04:17.840> there's

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
that it been quite efficiently there's

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.430 
that it been quite efficiently there's
no<00:04:18.759> black<00:04:19.759> residue<00:04:20.359> that<00:04:20.870> comes<00:04:21.139> out<00:04:21.289> of<00:04:21.320> that

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
no black residue that comes out of that

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.730 
no black residue that comes out of that
and<00:04:21.799> there<00:04:22.639> we<00:04:22.759> go<00:04:22.910> we<00:04:23.090> have<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.560> simplest<00:04:24.560> I

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
and there we go we have the simplest I

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.830 
and there we go we have the simplest I
would<00:04:24.889> say<00:04:25.009> the<00:04:25.130> most<00:04:25.340> simplest<00:04:25.789> way<00:04:26.509> to<00:04:26.539> make

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
would say the most simplest way to make

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.840 
would say the most simplest way to make
candle<00:04:27.470> out<00:04:27.590> of<00:04:27.620> your<00:04:27.889> wasted<00:04:28.340> vegetable<00:04:28.699> oil

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
candle out of your wasted vegetable oil

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.710 
candle out of your wasted vegetable oil
and<00:04:29.830> it'll<00:04:30.830> last<00:04:31.039> for<00:04:31.340> a<00:04:31.370> long<00:04:31.639> long<00:04:32.090> period<00:04:32.630> of

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
and it'll last for a long long period of

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:39.969 
and it'll last for a long long period of
time<00:04:32.930> especially<00:04:33.970> have<00:04:36.520> this<00:04:38.289> material<00:04:39.289> so<00:04:39.770> he

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
time especially have this material so he

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:45.610 
time especially have this material so he
imagined<00:04:40.520> how<00:04:41.419> much<00:04:42.820> candles<00:04:43.820> burning<00:04:44.630> would

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
imagined how much candles burning would

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.820 
imagined how much candles burning would
take<00:04:45.800> completely<00:04:46.960> used<00:04:47.960> it<00:04:48.139> all<00:04:48.259> up<00:04:48.289> so<00:04:48.680> I

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
take completely used it all up so I

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.080 
take completely used it all up so I
would<00:04:48.949> say<00:04:49.220> I<00:04:49.280> had<00:04:49.490> enough<00:04:50.410> candles<00:04:52.090> were

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
would say I had enough candles were

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.629 
would say I had enough candles were
laughing<00:04:53.509> months<00:04:54.169> maybe<00:04:54.320> years<00:04:54.710> just<00:04:55.460> from

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
laughing months maybe years just from

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.499 
laughing months maybe years just from
you<00:04:56.150> know<00:04:56.180> about<00:04:56.599> 2<00:04:57.320> 2<00:04:57.889> liter<00:04:58.160> of<00:04:58.970> these

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
you know about 2 2 liter of these

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:11.040 
you know about 2 2 liter of these
vegetable<00:04:59.990> oil<00:05:00.199> ok<00:05:01.479> there<00:05:02.479> we<00:05:02.539> go

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.110 

you
