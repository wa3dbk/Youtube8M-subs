 command to achieve this look 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.870
 romantic characterized by sweet eyes 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.540
 intense skin that looks like porcelain and 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.330
 the pro sells finished and to find out how 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.750
 make it and the products used 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.750
 follow the tutorial 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.660
 so first I have to go to 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.390
 make the face base by recreating a 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.800
 perfect complexion to do so 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.100
 I will use the new foundation more 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.079
 corrector duo total perfection of 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.360
 collistar that on the cap also the 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.910
 corrector but I go first spread the 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.769
 foundation on the whole face and I go 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.960
 then heat it well 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.790
 on the skin using fingers like 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.449
 you can see immediately after a quick 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.790
 application of the embodied foundation appears 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:56.059
 decidedly more homogeneous without 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.369
 imperfections and redness later 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.470
 I'm also going to cover my dark circles and 

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:02.269
 so I'm going to use the concealer 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.119
 present within this 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:08.750
 foundation and as you can see in this too 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.060
 case still returning to correct mine 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.080
 dark circles imperfections but anxiety will go 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.080
 to illuminate the area 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.880
 all around the eyes then use 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.400
 this corrector also to correct 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.020
 illuminate the various areas of the face that 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.490
 appear imperfect 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.520
 finally, I fix everything with powder 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.560
 compact washed silk effect spread 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.820
 first with a little sponge 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.000
 especially in areas where I want 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.940
 more opacity and where I want also 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.430

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.350
 when dyed and then washed 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.270
 just to blend with the brush afterwards 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.890
 having completed my base face step 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.409

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.780
 as for the eyes and uses 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.520
 a black pencil to define the 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.710
 outline I go to outline two lines 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.300
 starting from half eye to the corner 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.159
 outside at the top of 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.430

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.310

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:37.730
