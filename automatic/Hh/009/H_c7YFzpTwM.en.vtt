00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
homeostasis what does it mean something

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.599 
homeostasis what does it mean something
about<00:00:14.480> regulation<00:00:15.480> within<00:00:16.039> internal<00:00:17.039> within

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
about regulation within internal within

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.370 
about regulation within internal within
regulation<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.660> an<00:00:18.750> internal<00:00:19.170> environment

regulation of an internal environment

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.290 
regulation of an internal environment
within<00:00:19.859> narrow<00:00:20.699> limits<00:00:21.320> something<00:00:22.320> like<00:00:22.470> that

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
within narrow limits something like that

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.279 
within narrow limits something like that
we<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.330> finished<00:00:24.630> talking<00:00:24.869> about<00:00:25.170> the

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
we just finished talking about the

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.339 
we just finished talking about the
nervous<00:00:25.590> system<00:00:26.359> now<00:00:27.359> we<00:00:27.420> have<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.750> endocrine

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
nervous system now we have the endocrine

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.810 
nervous system now we have the endocrine
system<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:28.949> we're<00:00:29.039> moving<00:00:29.130> through<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.550> lot<00:00:29.730> of

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
system so we're moving through a lot of

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.310 
system so we're moving through a lot of
different<00:00:30.060> systems<00:00:30.300> we<00:00:30.630> have<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.810> Deitz<00:00:31.019> we

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
different systems we have the Deitz we

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.680 
different systems we have the Deitz we
had<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.560> digestive<00:00:32.250> system<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.940> circulatory

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
had the digestive system the circulatory

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.850

the respiratory system the nervous
system<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.790> now<00:00:39.030> we're<00:00:39.180> looking<00:00:39.270> at<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
system and now we're looking at the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.299 
system and now we're looking at the
endocrine<00:00:40.230> system<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.770> endocrine<00:00:41.250> system

endocrine system the endocrine system

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.580 
endocrine system the endocrine system
doesn't<00:00:41.850> get<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> lot<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.360> attention<00:00:42.629> until<00:00:43.230> you

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
doesn't get a lot of attention until you

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.069 
doesn't get a lot of attention until you
start<00:00:43.829> thinking<00:00:44.190> about<00:00:45.079> hormones

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
start thinking about hormones

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.270 
start thinking about hormones
specifically<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.100> here's<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.870> disproportion

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
specifically so here's a disproportion

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.069 
specifically so here's a disproportion
drawing<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.579> I've<00:00:50.730> made<00:00:50.969> here<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.510> there

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
drawing that I've made here and there

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.450 
drawing that I've made here and there
are<00:00:52.170> various<00:00:52.500> things<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.890> are<00:00:52.980> pointed<00:00:53.340> out

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
are various things that are pointed out

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.100 
are various things that are pointed out
not<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.879> typical<00:00:54.120> things<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.989> would

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
not the typical things that you would

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.799 
not the typical things that you would
ask<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.559> child<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:56.399> identify<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.300> diagram

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
ask a child to identify in a diagram

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.420 
ask a child to identify in a diagram
normally<00:00:58.320> you're<00:00:58.500> maybe<00:00:58.770> for<00:00:59.070> stomach

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
normally you're maybe for stomach

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.130 
normally you're maybe for stomach
whatever<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.300> what<00:01:00.480> are<00:01:00.570> all<00:01:00.690> these<00:01:00.870> things

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
whatever so what are all these things

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.930 
whatever so what are all these things
here<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.859> should<00:01:02.100> be<00:01:02.219> able<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.399> recognize<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
here you should be able to recognize a

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.020 
here you should be able to recognize a
few<00:01:03.210> but<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.070> endocrine<00:01:05.549> system<00:01:05.909> and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
few but this is the endocrine system and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.090 
few but this is the endocrine system and
it's<00:01:06.210> responsible<00:01:06.479> for<00:01:07.110> producing<00:01:07.470> and

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
it's responsible for producing and

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.100 
it's responsible for producing and
secreting<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.909> lot<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.180> hormones<00:01:09.689> into<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
secreting a lot of hormones into the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.609

they're physically above the kidneys the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.899 
they're physically above the kidneys the
pancreas<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.590> probably<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> most<00:01:26.310> well<00:01:26.880> known

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
pancreas is probably the most well known

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.830 
pancreas is probably the most well known
and<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.840> pancreas<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.470> also<00:01:28.950> involved<00:01:29.460> in

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
and the pancreas is also involved in

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.219 
and the pancreas is also involved in
digestion

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
digestion

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.560 
digestion
you<00:01:31.530> have<00:01:31.710> learned<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.100> little<00:01:32.189> bit<00:01:32.369> but<00:01:32.729> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
you have learned a little bit but the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.569 
you have learned a little bit but the
pancreas<00:01:33.990> has<00:01:34.140> dual<00:01:34.439> role<00:01:34.619> here<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.070> also<00:01:35.189> fits

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
pancreas has dual role here it also fits

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.550 
pancreas has dual role here it also fits
in<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.880> endocrine<00:01:36.630> system<00:01:36.689> because<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
in the endocrine system because of the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.249 
in the endocrine system because of the
hormones<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.220> produces<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.810> gonads

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
hormones it produces and the gonads

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.620 
hormones it produces and the gonads
which<00:01:40.590> would<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.250> ovaries<00:01:42.060> or<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
which would be the ovaries or the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.399 
which would be the ovaries or the
testicles<00:01:43.500> if<00:01:43.770> you're<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.070> woman<00:01:44.460> or<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.880> man<00:01:45.409> so

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
testicles if you're a woman or a man so

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.039 
testicles if you're a woman or a man so
these<00:01:46.560> hormones<00:01:47.210> that<00:01:48.210> are<00:01:48.270> produced<00:01:48.420> by

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
these hormones that are produced by

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.359 
these hormones that are produced by
these<00:01:49.110> various<00:01:49.680> glands<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.159> we're<00:01:50.280> only

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
these various glands and we're only

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.880 
these various glands and we're only
going<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.579> focus<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> few<00:01:51.420> here<00:01:52.110> they<00:01:52.649> get

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
going to focus on a few here they get

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.800 
going to focus on a few here they get
secreted<00:01:53.430> into<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.909> blood<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.420> they're<00:01:54.630> like

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
secreted into the blood and they're like

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.420 
secreted into the blood and they're like
chemical<00:01:55.350> messengers<00:01:55.860> which<00:01:56.100> will<00:01:56.280> move

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
chemical messengers which will move

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.160 
chemical messengers which will move

things<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.190> one<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.849> most<00:02:09.090> important

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
things and one of the most important

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.320 
things and one of the most important
ones<00:02:09.810> we're<00:02:09.959> going<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.110> talk

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
ones we're going to talk

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.860 
ones we're going to talk
about<00:02:10.540> in<00:02:10.690> this<00:02:10.900> particular<00:02:11.670> unit<00:02:12.670> for<00:02:13.540> IB

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
about in this particular unit for IB

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.440 
about in this particular unit for IB
biology<00:02:14.490> are<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:16.000> hormones<00:02:16.180> that<00:02:16.390> are

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
biology are the hormones that are

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.420 
biology are the hormones that are
produced<00:02:16.570> by<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.050> pancreas<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:17.980> they<00:02:18.160> help

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
produced by the pancreas and they help

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.850 
produced by the pancreas and they help
us<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.820> regulate<00:02:19.150> blood<00:02:19.630> sugar<00:02:19.810> levels<00:02:20.650> so

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
us to regulate blood sugar levels so

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.680 
us to regulate blood sugar levels so
diabetes<00:02:21.430> is<00:02:21.580> also<00:02:21.730> going<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.090> be<00:02:22.270> discussed

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
diabetes is also going to be discussed

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.450 
diabetes is also going to be discussed
here<00:02:23.380> and<00:02:23.590> that's<00:02:24.130> just<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.520> cool-looking

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
here and that's just a cool-looking

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.410 
here and that's just a cool-looking
tattoo<00:02:27.460> I<00:02:27.700> don't<00:02:27.880> think<00:02:28.030> that's<00:02:28.150> real<00:02:30.420> maybe

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
tattoo I don't think that's real maybe

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.850 
tattoo I don't think that's real maybe
not<00:02:32.580> so<00:02:33.580> homeostasis<00:02:34.480> we're<00:02:35.230> gonna<00:02:35.320> jump<00:02:35.590> into

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
not so homeostasis we're gonna jump into

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.830 
not so homeostasis we're gonna jump into
what<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.340> definition<00:02:36.790> of<00:02:36.850> homeostasis<00:02:37.420> is

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
what the definition of homeostasis is

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.670 
what the definition of homeostasis is
and<00:02:38.080> using<00:02:38.530> this<00:02:38.740> example<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.550> a<00:02:39.790> bath<00:02:40.650> when<00:02:41.650> I

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
and using this example of a bath when I

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.990 
and using this example of a bath when I
moved<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.010> Japan<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.370> was<00:02:42.610> so<00:02:42.760> impressed

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
moved to Japan I was so impressed

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.940 
moved to Japan I was so impressed
because<00:02:43.630> I<00:02:43.840> can<00:02:44.050> actually<00:02:44.470> adjust<00:02:44.560> the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
because I can actually adjust the

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.820 
because I can actually adjust the
temperature<00:02:45.280> of<00:02:45.490> my<00:02:45.820> bath<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.510> I<00:02:47.170> think<00:02:47.680> it's

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
temperature of my bath and I think it's

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.050 
temperature of my bath and I think it's
pretty<00:02:48.040> accurate<00:02:48.220> I've<00:02:48.610> never<00:02:48.850> actually

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
pretty accurate I've never actually

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.940 
pretty accurate I've never actually
tested<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:49.900> should<00:02:50.320> borrow<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.590> thermometer

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
tested it I should borrow a thermometer

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.250 
tested it I should borrow a thermometer
from<00:02:51.280> school<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:51.730> test<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.420> see<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.630> accuracy

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
from school to test to see the accuracy

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.130 
from school to test to see the accuracy
of<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.830> entire<00:02:54.070> thing<00:02:54.480> but<00:02:55.480> basically<00:02:55.840> what

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
of the entire thing but basically what

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.220 
of the entire thing but basically what
it<00:02:56.260> does<00:02:56.290> is<00:02:56.830> I<00:02:57.190> can<00:02:57.550> set<00:02:57.790> my<00:02:58.000> temperature<00:02:58.600> to

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
it does is I can set my temperature to

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.560 
it does is I can set my temperature to
be<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.980> comfortable<00:03:00.400> 40<00:03:00.850> degrees<00:03:01.180> for<00:03:01.450> example

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
be a comfortable 40 degrees for example

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.100 
be a comfortable 40 degrees for example
if<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.890> temperature<00:03:03.250> gets<00:03:04.150> higher<00:03:04.480> than<00:03:04.780> 40

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
if the temperature gets higher than 40

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.130 
if the temperature gets higher than 40
degrees<00:03:05.470> then<00:03:05.860> my<00:03:06.250> SuperDuper<00:03:06.910> bathtub<00:03:07.690> robot

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
degrees then my SuperDuper bathtub robot

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.000 
degrees then my SuperDuper bathtub robot
will<00:03:08.790> detect<00:03:09.790> this<00:03:10.240> temperature<00:03:10.930> rise<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:11.650> it

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
will detect this temperature rise and it

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.530 
will detect this temperature rise and it
will<00:03:12.160> turn<00:03:12.340> off<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.700> heater<00:03:12.940> or<00:03:13.209> stop

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
will turn off the heater or stop

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.479 
will turn off the heater or stop
producing<00:03:14.020> hot<00:03:14.170> water<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:15.340> temperature

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
producing hot water and the temperature

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.690 
producing hot water and the temperature
will<00:03:15.910> fall<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.450> return<00:03:17.019> back<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.860> my<00:03:18.340> desired

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
will fall and return back to my desired

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.580 
will fall and return back to my desired
temperature<00:03:19.030> 40<00:03:19.450> degrees<00:03:19.720> that's<00:03:20.200> pretty

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
temperature 40 degrees that's pretty

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.190 
temperature 40 degrees that's pretty
smart<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:22.150> temperature<00:03:22.450> falls<00:03:22.720> it<00:03:22.930> starts<00:03:22.959> to

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
smart the temperature falls it starts to

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.620 
smart the temperature falls it starts to
get<00:03:23.320> cold<00:03:23.620> fall<00:03:24.430> asleep<00:03:24.730> in<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:24.970> bathtub<00:03:25.120> now

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
get cold fall asleep in the bathtub now

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.229 
get cold fall asleep in the bathtub now
the<00:03:25.690> water<00:03:26.410> temperature<00:03:26.950> dips<00:03:27.190> down<00:03:27.430> to<00:03:27.610> 36

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
the water temperature dips down to 36

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.390 
the water temperature dips down to 36
starting<00:03:28.840> to<00:03:28.930> get<00:03:29.019> a<00:03:29.080> little<00:03:29.260> bit<00:03:29.470> chilly<00:03:30.190> here

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
starting to get a little bit chilly here

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.040 
starting to get a little bit chilly here
because<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:30.970> heat<00:03:31.209> from<00:03:31.390> my<00:03:31.450> body<00:03:31.600> is

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
because the heat from my body is

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.140 
because the heat from my body is
dissipating<00:03:32.739> into<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:33.130> water

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
dissipating into the water

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.630 
dissipating into the water
well<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.840> thermostat<00:03:35.410> detects<00:03:35.860> it<00:03:36.070> and<00:03:36.250> says

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
well the thermostat detects it and says

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.330 
well the thermostat detects it and says
okay<00:03:37.150> let's<00:03:37.420> bring<00:03:37.630> it<00:03:37.780> back<00:03:37.810> to<00:03:38.140> his<00:03:38.920> desired

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
okay let's bring it back to his desired

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.729 
okay let's bring it back to his desired
temperature<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.900> heaters<00:03:41.230> switched<00:03:41.530> on

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
temperature and the heaters switched on

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.320 
temperature and the heaters switched on
or<00:03:41.920> more<00:03:42.070> hot<00:03:42.280> water<00:03:42.519> is<00:03:42.670> produced<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:43.239> a

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
or more hot water is produced and a

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.000 
or more hot water is produced and a
temperature<00:03:43.690> rises<00:03:44.050> that's<00:03:44.290> pretty<00:03:44.650> basic

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
temperature rises that's pretty basic

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.640 
temperature rises that's pretty basic
simple<00:03:45.970> idea<00:03:46.360> and<00:03:46.540> that's<00:03:47.050> exactly<00:03:47.350> what

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
simple idea and that's exactly what

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.009 
simple idea and that's exactly what
homeostasis<00:03:48.160> is<00:03:48.640> if<00:03:49.209> we're<00:03:49.690> talking<00:03:49.959> about

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
homeostasis is if we're talking about

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.590 
homeostasis is if we're talking about
body<00:03:50.290> temperature<00:03:50.620> or<00:03:51.100> blood<00:03:51.519> glucose<00:03:52.209> level

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
body temperature or blood glucose level

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.940 
body temperature or blood glucose level
or<00:03:53.040> yeah<00:03:54.180> blood<00:03:55.180> pH<00:03:55.600> level<00:03:56.050> or<00:03:56.230> blood<00:03:56.530> carbon

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
or yeah blood pH level or blood carbon

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.560 
or yeah blood pH level or blood carbon
dioxide<00:03:57.430> level<00:03:57.790> or<00:03:57.910> any<00:03:58.030> of<00:03:58.150> these<00:03:58.269> things

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
dioxide level or any of these things

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.530

they're<00:03:59.260> all<00:03:59.620> regulated<00:04:00.310> in<00:04:00.790> this<00:04:00.970> way<00:04:01.269> and

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
they're all regulated in this way and

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.840 
they're all regulated in this way and
some<00:04:01.989> part<00:04:02.410> of<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.590> body<00:04:02.739> is<00:04:03.070> detecting<00:04:03.730> that

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
some part of the body is detecting that

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.759 
some part of the body is detecting that
something's<00:04:04.239> weird<00:04:04.450> and<00:04:04.780> causing<00:04:05.470> certain

so<00:04:24.850> homeostasis<00:04:25.389> is<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:26.230> maintenance<00:04:26.919> of<00:04:27.130> the

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
so homeostasis is the maintenance of the

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.460 
so homeostasis is the maintenance of the

here is negative feedback right here so

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.379 
here is negative feedback right here so

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
something will actually go back and

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.930 
something will actually go back and
regulate<00:05:29.280> the<00:05:30.280> mechanism<00:05:30.910> to<00:05:31.210> actually

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
regulate the mechanism to actually

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.060 
regulate the mechanism to actually
decrease<00:05:33.940> to<00:05:34.360> do<00:05:34.479> the<00:05:34.600> opposite<00:05:35.050> effect<00:05:35.440> so<00:05:35.979> if

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
decrease to do the opposite effect so if

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.770 
decrease to do the opposite effect so if
you<00:05:36.190> end<00:05:36.370> up<00:05:36.520> with<00:05:36.669> too<00:05:36.850> much<00:05:37.030> sugar<00:05:37.300> at<00:05:37.630> the

end too much sugar then that too much

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.450 
end too much sugar then that too much
sugar<00:05:40.660> should<00:05:41.050> feed<00:05:41.320> back<00:05:41.560> and<00:05:41.770> then<00:05:42.160> tell<00:05:42.340> the

there's too little sugar - if that's

the opposite effect positive feedback is

the opposite effect positive feedback is

increasing the effect so that's called

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.210 
increasing the effect so that's called
