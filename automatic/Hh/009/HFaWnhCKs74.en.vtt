it'll tell you the temperature up here
in<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.530> big<00:00:58.739> number<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.250> if<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.670> tap<00:00:59.910> on

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
in this big number and if you tap on

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.569 
in this big number and if you tap on
that<00:01:00.260> it<00:01:01.260> will<00:01:01.320> give<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> humidity<00:01:02.340> so

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
that it will give you the humidity so

it's pretty humid in minooka ninety
percent<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:05.489> chance<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.909> rain<00:01:05.970> fifty<00:01:06.659> two

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
percent the chance of rain fifty two

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.080 
percent the chance of rain fifty two
percent<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.500> seems<00:01:08.490> like<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.760> hundred<00:01:08.939> percent

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
percent it seems like a hundred percent

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.560 
percent it seems like a hundred percent
from<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.689> view<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:09.960> okay<00:01:10.850> wind<00:01:11.850> 80<00:01:12.240> miles

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
from this view but okay wind 80 miles

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.190 
from this view but okay wind 80 miles
per<00:01:12.659> hour<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.619> feels<00:01:13.860> like<00:01:13.979> temperature

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
per hour and the feels like temperature

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.080 
per hour and the feels like temperature
ok<00:01:16.700> now<00:01:17.810> down<00:01:18.810> here<00:01:19.460> we<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:20.670> more<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.970> an

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
ok now down here we have more of an

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.109 
ok now down here we have more of an
hourly<00:01:21.630> view<00:01:22.229> but<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.710> also<00:01:22.890> tells<00:01:23.220> us<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
hourly view but it also tells us the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.080 
hourly view but it also tells us the
chance<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.509> rain<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:25.380> forecast<00:01:26.220> temperature

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
chance of rain the forecast temperature

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.249 
chance of rain the forecast temperature
and<00:01:27.299> when<00:01:28.369> sunset<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.880> then<00:01:30.090> sunrise<00:01:30.900> over

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
and when sunset is and then sunrise over

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.160 
and when sunset is and then sunrise over
here<00:01:31.670> so<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.850> exact<00:01:33.210> times<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.750> sunset<00:01:34.140> and

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
here so the exact times the sunset and

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.219 
here so the exact times the sunset and
sunrise<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:35.189> be<00:01:35.280> found<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.729> here<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.810> then<00:01:37.140> we

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
sunrise can be found in here and then we

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.230 
sunrise can be found in here and then we
have<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.439> high<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.799> low<00:01:37.829> temperature<00:01:38.369> 73<00:01:38.880> and

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
have the high and low temperature 73 and

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.340 
have the high and low temperature 73 and
57<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.460> then<00:01:41.460> down<00:01:41.700> here<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.689> more<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.229> a

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
57 and then down here is a more of a

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.179 
57 and then down here is a more of a
week<00:01:43.530> view<00:01:43.799> we<00:01:44.640> get<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.350> whoops<00:01:46.350> we<00:01:46.890> get<00:01:47.009> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
week view we get the whoops we get the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.539 
week view we get the whoops we get the
forecast<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.560> temperatures<00:01:49.560> high<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.310> low

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
forecast and temperatures high and low

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.569 
forecast and temperatures high and low
now<00:01:51.390> if<00:01:51.509> we<00:01:51.659> hit<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.290> or<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:53.220> could<00:01:53.369> pinch

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
now if we hit this I or we could pinch

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.130 
now if we hit this I or we could pinch
out<00:01:53.990> maybe<00:01:54.990> but<00:01:55.259> may<00:01:56.219> crashed<00:01:56.869> beta<00:01:57.869> software

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
out maybe but may crashed beta software

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.010 
out maybe but may crashed beta software
okay<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.189> if<00:01:59.310> we<00:01:59.430> pinch<00:01:59.700> out<00:01:59.909> we<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.810> get<00:02:00.960> a

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
okay so if we pinch out we can get a

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.590 
okay so if we pinch out we can get a
view<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.439> all<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.670> cities<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.270> we<00:02:03.390> have

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
view of all of the cities that we have

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.830 
view of all of the cities that we have
stored<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.140> here<00:02:04.380> at<00:02:05.159> one<00:02:05.340> time<00:02:05.579> including<00:02:06.540> the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
stored in here at one time including the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.359 
stored in here at one time including the
live<00:02:07.049> backgrounds<00:02:07.439> which<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:07.979> kind<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.250> neat

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
live backgrounds which is kind of neat

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.999 
live backgrounds which is kind of neat
so<00:02:08.580> we<00:02:08.670> still<00:02:08.879> get<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.149> animated<00:02:09.720> stuff<00:02:10.009> still

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
so we still get the animated stuff still

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.770 
so we still get the animated stuff still
thundering<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.790> lightning<00:02:12.209> and

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
thundering and lightning and

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.830 
thundering and lightning and
minooka<00:02:13.560> but<00:02:14.400> we<00:02:14.490> get<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:14.910> quick<00:02:15.209> glance<00:02:15.390> at<00:02:15.720> the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
minooka but we get a quick glance at the

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.059 
minooka but we get a quick glance at the
temperatures<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.470> all<00:02:16.560> these<00:02:16.680> cities<00:02:17.040> and

temperatures in all these cities and
even<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.550> time<00:02:17.850> so<00:02:18.209> it<00:02:18.270> can<00:02:18.390> act<00:02:18.569> kind<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:18.930> as<00:02:19.050> a

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
even the time so it can act kind of as a

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.320 
even the time so it can act kind of as a
world<00:02:19.410> clock<00:02:19.740> and<00:02:20.069> then<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.880> add<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.060> location

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
world clock and then to add a location

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.449 
world clock and then to add a location
there's<00:02:22.020> this<00:02:22.170> plus<00:02:22.440> button<00:02:22.470> down<00:02:22.950> here<00:02:22.980> and

there's this plus button down here and

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.640 
there's this plus button down here and

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
then we can change our units from

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.210 
then we can change our units from
Celsius<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.790> Fahrenheit<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.930> then<00:02:28.920> again

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
Celsius and Fahrenheit and then again

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.350 
Celsius and Fahrenheit and then again
