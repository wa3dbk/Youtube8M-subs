know denture pace underneath and I'm

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.279 
know denture pace underneath and I'm
keeping<00:02:06.400> them<00:02:06.730> in<00:02:06.910> the<00:02:07.030> place<00:02:07.240> that<00:02:07.540> way<00:02:07.720> but

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
keeping them in the place that way but

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.430 
keeping them in the place that way but
that's<00:02:08.649> not<00:02:09.240> what<00:02:10.240> we<00:02:10.360> do<00:02:10.570> right<00:02:10.780> now<00:02:11.020> and<00:02:11.260> what

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
that's not what we do right now and what

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.290 
that's not what we do right now and what
we<00:02:11.590> suggest<00:02:11.770> and<00:02:12.340> that's<00:02:12.880> not<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.060> standard

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
we suggest and that's not the standard

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.390 
we suggest and that's not the standard
of<00:02:13.540> care<00:02:13.780> anymore<00:02:14.020> we<00:02:14.470> tell<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.040> patients

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
of care anymore we tell the patients

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.360 
of care anymore we tell the patients
there<00:02:15.550> is<00:02:15.640> another<00:02:15.850> way<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:16.120> fix<00:02:16.960> that<00:02:17.230> and

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
there is another way to fix that and

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.890 
there is another way to fix that and
regain<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.550> retention<00:02:18.970> that<00:02:19.240> we<00:02:19.390> need<00:02:19.660> and

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
regain the retention that we need and

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.930 
regain the retention that we need and
the<00:02:19.990> lower<00:02:20.170> jaw<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.740> keep<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.430> danger<00:02:21.760> in<00:02:21.850> the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
the lower jaw to keep the danger in the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.550 
the lower jaw to keep the danger in the
place<00:02:22.150> you're<00:02:22.660> looking<00:02:22.930> at<00:02:23.050> a<00:02:23.080> series<00:02:23.500> of

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
place you're looking at a series of

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.050 
place you're looking at a series of
pictures<00:02:23.860> here<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.400> guess<00:02:24.550> starting<00:02:24.940> with

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
pictures here and I guess starting with

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.170 
pictures here and I guess starting with
the<00:02:25.180> upper<00:02:25.480> upper<00:02:26.230> left<00:02:26.470> one<00:02:26.680> here<00:02:27.180> that's

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
the upper upper left one here that's

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.390 
the upper upper left one here that's
what<00:02:28.330> we<00:02:28.450> call<00:02:28.630> implants<00:02:29.200> yes<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:29.920> that<00:02:30.160> is

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
what we call implants yes and that is

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.570 
what we call implants yes and that is
well<00:02:31.330> it's<00:02:31.510> not<00:02:31.690> brand<00:02:32.020> new<00:02:32.080> technology<00:02:32.830> it

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
well it's not brand new technology it

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.310 
well it's not brand new technology it
was<00:02:33.940> certainly<00:02:34.150> something<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.540> you<00:02:34.840> hadn't

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
was certainly something that you hadn't

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.290 
was certainly something that you hadn't
approached<00:02:36.070> and<00:02:36.310> thought<00:02:36.430> about<00:02:36.459> joy<00:02:36.850> wrecked

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
approached and thought about joy wrecked

machine that i have in my office the
panoramic<00:03:08.110> x-ray<00:03:08.380> i<00:03:08.440> could<00:03:08.739> measure<00:03:09.010> her<00:03:09.310> bone

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
panoramic x-ray i could measure her bone

panoramic x-ray i could measure her bone
and<00:03:09.940> see<00:03:10.150> exactly<00:03:10.450> where<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.230> implants<00:03:11.709> they

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
and see exactly where the implants they

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.370 
and see exactly where the implants they
need<00:03:12.100> to<00:03:12.220> be<00:03:12.340> placed<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:13.030> that's<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:14.080> and<00:03:14.260> then

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
need to be placed and that's it and then

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.140 
need to be placed and that's it and then
we<00:03:14.530> are<00:03:14.620> putting<00:03:14.799> two<00:03:15.340> attachments<00:03:15.970> on<00:03:16.060> the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
we are putting two attachments on the

locking onto these two posts and that's

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.250 
locking onto these two posts and that's
it<00:03:20.380> okay<00:03:21.070> so<00:03:21.760> we<00:03:22.750> don't<00:03:22.870> want<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.049> get<00:03:23.140> too

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
it okay so we don't want to get too

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.750 
it okay so we don't want to get too
graphic<00:03:23.440> here<00:03:23.769> but<00:03:23.890> basically<00:03:24.010> this<00:03:24.700> is
