think makes them similar to the eggs

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.049 
think makes them similar to the eggs
that<00:00:43.110> would<00:00:43.379> have<00:00:43.469> been<00:00:43.680> transitional<00:00:44.640> forms

probably<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:50.629> most<00:00:50.780> exciting<00:00:51.469> moment<00:00:51.890> of<00:00:51.920> my

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
probably the most exciting moment of my

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.939 
probably the most exciting moment of my
career<00:00:52.100> so<00:00:52.489> far<00:00:52.520> was<00:00:53.270> one<00:00:53.780> night<00:00:54.050> out<00:00:54.620> of<00:00:54.680> the

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
career so far was one night out of the

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.610 
career so far was one night out of the
pond<00:00:55.190> here<00:00:55.520> in<00:00:55.610> Gamboa<00:00:56.090> I<00:00:56.480> was<00:00:57.110> out<00:00:57.260> studying

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
pond here in Gamboa I was out studying

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.920 
pond here in Gamboa I was out studying
these<00:00:58.399> Hourglass<00:00:58.940> tree<00:00:59.149> frogs<00:00:59.420> and<00:00:59.660> at<00:00:59.780> that

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
these Hourglass tree frogs and at that

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.080 
these Hourglass tree frogs and at that
point<00:01:00.230> I<00:01:00.470> knew<00:01:00.710> what<00:01:01.430> everyone<00:01:01.730> else<00:01:01.879> knew

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
point I knew what everyone else knew

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.880 
point I knew what everyone else knew
which<00:01:02.300> was<00:01:02.480> that<00:01:02.660> they<00:01:02.930> laid<00:01:03.170> eggs<00:01:03.500> on<00:01:03.649> leaves

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
which was that they laid eggs on leaves

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.910 
which was that they laid eggs on leaves
and<00:01:04.600> I'm<00:01:05.600> out<00:01:05.840> in<00:01:05.869> the<00:01:06.080> middle<00:01:06.320> you<00:01:06.530> know<00:01:06.590> chest

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
and I'm out in the middle you know chest

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.889 
and I'm out in the middle you know chest
deep<00:01:07.130> in<00:01:07.310> this<00:01:07.490> pond<00:01:07.820> and<00:01:08.180> here's<00:01:08.420> a<00:01:08.479> pair<00:01:08.780> of

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
deep in this pond and here's a pair of

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.810 
deep in this pond and here's a pair of
the<00:01:09.020> frogs<00:01:09.320> and<00:01:09.680> they're<00:01:10.220> laying<00:01:10.460> eggs

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
the frogs and they're laying eggs

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.020 
the frogs and they're laying eggs
directly<00:01:11.600> into<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.050> water<00:01:12.259> and<00:01:13.250> my<00:01:13.700> advisor

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
directly into the water and my advisor

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.690 
directly into the water and my advisor
was<00:01:14.330> with<00:01:14.509> me<00:01:14.690> at<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:14.930> time<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:15.530> we<00:01:16.250> both<00:01:16.430> kind

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
was with me at the time and we both kind

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.570 
was with me at the time and we both kind
of<00:01:16.850> saw<00:01:17.119> this<00:01:17.360> and<00:01:17.720> had<00:01:17.869> this<00:01:18.080> this<00:01:18.920> moment<00:01:19.369> of

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
of saw this and had this this moment of

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.450 
of saw this and had this this moment of
I<00:01:19.909> don't<00:01:20.630> think<00:01:21.170> anyone's<00:01:21.830> ever<00:01:21.979> seen<00:01:22.310> this

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
I don't think anyone's ever seen this

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.400 
I don't think anyone's ever seen this
before<00:01:22.520> and<00:01:23.509> I<00:01:23.570> think<00:01:23.780> this<00:01:23.929> might<00:01:24.110> be<00:01:24.200> kind<00:01:24.380> of

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
before and I think this might be kind of

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.550 
before and I think this might be kind of
a<00:01:24.530> big<00:01:24.710> deal<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.700> it<00:01:25.910> turns<00:01:26.149> out<00:01:26.360> we<00:01:27.140> were<00:01:27.350> the

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
a big deal and it turns out we were the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.060 
a big deal and it turns out we were the
first<00:01:27.740> ones<00:01:28.039> to<00:01:28.310> ever<00:01:28.490> actually<00:01:29.030> see<00:01:29.479> this<00:01:29.690> I

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
first ones to ever actually see this I

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.480 
first ones to ever actually see this I
grew<00:01:31.070> up<00:01:31.130> in<00:01:31.399> Central<00:01:32.000> Oregon<00:01:32.210> and<00:01:32.830> I<00:01:33.830> don't

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
grew up in Central Oregon and I don't

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.080 
grew up in Central Oregon and I don't
know<00:01:35.000> really<00:01:35.539> at<00:01:36.259> what<00:01:36.440> point<00:01:36.830> I<00:01:37.160> knew<00:01:37.880> that<00:01:37.910> I

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
know really at what point I knew that I

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.450 
know really at what point I knew that I
wanted<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:38.509> be<00:01:38.750> a<00:01:39.020> biologist<00:01:39.350> but<00:01:40.100> I<00:01:40.160> know<00:01:40.220> it

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
wanted to be a biologist but I know it

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.060 
wanted to be a biologist but I know it
was<00:01:40.610> very<00:01:40.850> long<00:01:41.090> ago<00:01:41.679> essentially<00:01:42.679> because<00:01:43.039> of

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
was very long ago essentially because of

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.340 
was very long ago essentially because of
records<00:01:43.520> that<00:01:43.700> my<00:01:43.820> parents<00:01:44.060> have<00:01:44.360> kept<00:01:44.659> I<00:01:45.140> mean

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
records that my parents have kept I mean

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.590 
records that my parents have kept I mean
they<00:01:45.440> have<00:01:45.530> a<00:01:45.560> drawing<00:01:46.429> that<00:01:46.610> I<00:01:46.759> made<00:01:46.850> in<00:01:47.300> third

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070

an<00:02:10.130> undergraduate<00:02:10.549> I<00:02:11.000> studied<00:02:11.510> abroad<00:02:12.320> for<00:02:12.440> a

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
an undergraduate I studied abroad for a

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.240 
an undergraduate I studied abroad for a
semester<00:02:12.769> in<00:02:13.220> North<00:02:13.850> Australia<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:15.200> that<00:02:16.160> was

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
semester in North Australia and that was

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.580 
semester in North Australia and that was
my<00:02:16.340> first<00:02:16.579> exposure<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.329> tropics<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:18.049> I

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
my first exposure to the tropics and I

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.500 
my first exposure to the tropics and I
just<00:02:18.860> fell<00:02:19.190> in<00:02:19.280> love<00:02:19.459> with<00:02:19.549> it<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.880> diversity

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
just fell in love with it the diversity

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.650 
just fell in love with it the diversity
plants<00:02:21.079> the<00:02:21.200> animals

plants the animals

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.910 
plants the animals
and<00:02:22.990> that<00:02:23.230> really<00:02:23.440> led<00:02:24.220> me<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.490> where<00:02:24.640> I<00:02:24.670> am<00:02:24.880> now
