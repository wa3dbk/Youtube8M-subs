00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.560
 people you know that surely you have 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.850
 only a few factors at the beginning 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.109
 pick and wanted a few 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.889
 minerals forms 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:14.880
 but he goes into a cave and what 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.830
 you do not find anything and therefore cordially 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.630
 Welcome to a new motto view and 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.210
 Although today I show you a lot 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.640
 useful and in my opinion 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.080
 namely the so-called x-ray murder the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.609
 one or the other may already know 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.349
 what that man means 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.619
 pretty well one of my opinion 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.370
 for the best mods and if you are 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.860
 Now press the button 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.110
 what do we see we see all minerals 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.829
 and it is a murder of all 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.050
 other blocks and materials from 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.570
 doctors and lava and water fades out 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.160
 and yes, this murder is pretty useful 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.739
 because now I know for example that 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.100
 here behind this wall is the same chronicle 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.100
 is 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.450
 this motto for you personally 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.810
 quite useful has an effectiveness 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.950
 which is very useful because otherwise would have 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.240
 I, for example, not that here 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.240
 coal and iron is 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.190
 This mod can also be different 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.200
 be quite useful 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.600
 for example when you look at yourself 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.640
 including where you do not know where 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.700
 you are now direct you can just 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.730
 press the button and you have the 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.440
 coordinates on which one stands straight 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:33.820
 but now fades in to 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.560
 installation until then so people 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.840
 Welcome to the installation 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.760
 First, you go for the installation 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.140
 on the minecraft forum page of the 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.030
 of course also in the source code 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.610
 description linked and here you see 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.920
 already download for exporting her 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.760
 either go to petra or zip that is 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.950
 absolutely not important 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.900
 he is a version with mucus 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.760
 Of course you can do that too 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.740
 it does not matter how much you download 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.990
 Of course you also have 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.820
 the fly version with it although the 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.430
 yes, usually already and 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.040
 Creative mode through the extremely modern 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.920
 also includes so here you see 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.770
 again briefly the functions which 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.320
 key remaining must work for which 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.450
 and yes, after I have you over any 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.519
 download you can do it on the 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.470
 desktop we pull open then we open it 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.050
 short times you see her a few glass 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.390
 files now to the actual 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:31.930
 installation you give here a percent 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.519
 ap / dpa then percent from data percent then 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.890
 Do you see a roaming folder? 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.830
 this click years and then you see 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.190
 mostly at the top the point minecraft 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.739
 in this you go in opens the 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.370
 inside folders and then you see here 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.690
 a minecraft 13.2 so the must have 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.989
 you can not necessarily exist 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.640
 but and that is not with you as 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.340
 winrar archive probably displayed 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.690
 be but as a normal file the 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.299
 they are called minecraft 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.540
 points he goes to right click and 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:06.280
 then open with winrar i have the same 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.769
 set that it is default 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.720
 with winrar opens and then we go 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.690
 up there 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.830
 Now we are in the point of minecraft 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.200
 usually you still have it here 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.610
 you do not have any other muslims one 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.860
 to demand meta in 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.780
 this is capitalized so hardly too 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.840
 If you overlook this, please delete it 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.270
 otherwise there I take the mods 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.700
 thus blocking everything you do now 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.620
 Now go to the ex baywatch so 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.290
 once say what once the point 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.860
 minecraft pulls all these files here 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.970
 then confirm with ok 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.920
 and then you have the murder actually 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.660
 already installed it should be with you 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.730
 it does not work either 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.080
 because you installed other mods 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.040
 do not you have that with this murder 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.470
 is compatible 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.860
 since you have solved the tenant in front 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:57.670
 or yes, otherwise I would have to 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.140
 everything must work that be careful 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.080
 you really synonymous exactly this file 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.610
 otherwise you wish you much fun 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.070
 with the market until the next model 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.940
 view until then does not say lukas of 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.940
 germany ev
