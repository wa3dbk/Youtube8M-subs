by single player rules and stick which
is<00:02:57.269> great<00:02:57.569> but<00:02:58.110> it<00:02:58.500> just<00:02:58.680> lets<00:02:58.890> them<00:02:59.069> flex

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
is great but it just lets them flex

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.039 
is great but it just lets them flex
their<00:02:59.670> designer<00:03:00.030> muscles<00:03:00.510> it's<00:03:00.780> not<00:03:00.989> just

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
snowmobile race we have some really

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.500 
snowmobile race we have some really
awesome<00:03:04.980> surprises<00:03:05.790> for<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.000> players<00:03:06.239> out

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
awesome surprises for the players out

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.390 
awesome surprises for the players out
there<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.959> spec<00:03:07.410> up<00:03:07.590> somewhat<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:07.950> think<00:03:08.250> are

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
there and spec up somewhat I think are

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.770 
there and spec up somewhat I think are
just<00:03:08.430> completely<00:03:08.760> unique<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.599> call<00:03:09.750> of

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
just completely unique to the call of

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.520 
just completely unique to the call of
duty<00:03:10.910> as<00:03:11.910> far<00:03:12.090> as<00:03:12.180> DLC<00:03:12.569> goes<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:13.019> does<00:03:13.230> seem

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
duty as far as DLC goes it does seem

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.250 
duty as far as DLC goes it does seem
logical<00:03:13.950> that<00:03:14.330> spec<00:03:15.330> off<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.690> just<00:03:15.780> perfect

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
logical that spec off is just perfect

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.120 
logical that spec off is just perfect
for<00:03:16.380> that<00:03:16.470> type<00:03:16.680> of<00:03:16.709> stuff<00:03:18.590> modern<00:03:19.590> warfare<00:03:19.769> 2
