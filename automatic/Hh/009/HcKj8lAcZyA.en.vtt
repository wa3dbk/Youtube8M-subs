in<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.030> while<00:02:22.180> though<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.960> fact<00:02:23.170> that

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
in a while though to the fact that

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.520 
in a while though to the fact that
they're<00:02:24.070> constantly<00:02:24.760> wing<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:26.140> they've<00:02:26.500> got

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
they're constantly wing and they've got

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.960 
they're constantly wing and they've got
a<00:02:26.740> lot<00:02:27.100> more<00:02:27.160> space<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.700> go<00:02:27.940> around<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:30.160> they

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
a lot more space to go around and they

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.590 
a lot more space to go around and they
tend<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.630> be<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:32.640> almost<00:02:33.640> impossible<00:02:34.210> ahead<00:02:34.390> to

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
tend to be a almost impossible ahead to

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.580 
tend to be a almost impossible ahead to
the<00:02:34.720> fact<00:02:34.960> that<00:02:35.020> you<00:02:35.140> have<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.320> hit<00:02:35.410> them

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
the fact that you have to hit them

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.200 
the fact that you have to hit them
certainly<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.130> I<00:02:36.190> just<00:02:36.340> get<00:02:36.490> into<00:02:36.700> six<00:02:36.970> levels
