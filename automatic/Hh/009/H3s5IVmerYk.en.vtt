London<00:00:13.990> England<00:00:14.110> I<00:00:15.990> trained<00:00:16.990> as<00:00:17.170> a<00:00:17.200> fully

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
London England I trained as a fully

London England I trained as a fully
qualified<00:00:18.010> architects<00:00:18.490> and<00:00:19.000> set<00:00:19.210> up<00:00:19.300> a

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 
qualified architects and set up a

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.830 
qualified architects and set up a
practice<00:00:19.510> here<00:00:19.990> in<00:00:20.140> London<00:00:20.500> in<00:00:20.619> 2000<00:00:21.340> and

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
practice here in London in 2000 and

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.450 
practice here in London in 2000 and
worked<00:00:22.840> on<00:00:23.080> bridges<00:00:23.590> and<00:00:23.710> buildings<00:00:23.830> all<00:00:24.400> over

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
worked on bridges and buildings all over

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.120 
worked on bridges and buildings all over
the<00:00:24.759> world<00:00:24.939> and<00:00:25.390> then<00:00:25.990> in<00:00:26.080> 2006<00:00:26.770> I<00:00:26.860> came<00:00:26.890> up

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
the world and then in 2006 I came up

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.800 
the world and then in 2006 I came up
with<00:00:27.160> an<00:00:27.310> idea<00:00:27.400> for<00:00:27.610> a<00:00:27.820> shoe<00:00:28.000> and<00:00:28.450> it<00:00:28.540> took<00:00:28.660> me

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
with an idea for a shoe and it took me

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.260 
with an idea for a shoe and it took me
in<00:00:28.869> a<00:00:28.900> totally<00:00:29.200> different<00:00:29.259> direction<00:00:29.470> I<00:00:30.270> was

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
in a totally different direction I was

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.690 
in a totally different direction I was
thinking<00:00:31.750> about<00:00:31.869> a<00:00:32.470> number<00:00:33.370> of<00:00:33.430> different

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
thinking about a number of different

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.569 
thinking about a number of different
projects<00:00:34.060> that<00:00:34.300> I<00:00:34.450> thought<00:00:34.810> had<00:00:35.170> as<00:00:35.579> designs

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
projects that I thought had as designs

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.850 
projects that I thought had as designs
had<00:00:36.760> stopped<00:00:37.030> evolving<00:00:37.270> I<00:00:37.780> thought<00:00:38.230> that<00:00:38.470> they

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
had stopped evolving I thought that they

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.020 
had stopped evolving I thought that they
had<00:00:39.100> reached<00:00:39.280> the<00:00:39.460> point<00:00:39.610> in<00:00:39.760> their<00:00:39.910> own

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
had reached the point in their own

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.670 
had reached the point in their own
tradition<00:00:40.510> where<00:00:40.810> they<00:00:40.930> just<00:00:41.110> became<00:00:41.320> repeats

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
tradition where they just became repeats

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.860 
tradition where they just became repeats
of<00:00:41.860> things<00:00:42.040> before<00:00:42.250> I<00:00:42.640> so<00:00:43.450> rather<00:00:43.630> than

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
of things before I so rather than

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.290 
of things before I so rather than
innovate<00:00:44.230> there<00:00:44.650> was<00:00:44.740> too<00:00:44.920> much<00:00:45.300> repetition

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
innovate there was too much repetition

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.310 
innovate there was too much repetition
and<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.980> was<00:00:48.220> thinking<00:00:48.430> how<00:00:49.210> could<00:00:49.480> a<00:00:49.750> shoe<00:00:50.140> have

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
and I was thinking how could a shoe have

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.930 
and I was thinking how could a shoe have
evolved<00:00:50.710> in<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:50.890> way<00:00:50.980> it<00:00:51.100> did<00:00:51.280> is<00:00:51.520> it<00:00:51.640> was<00:00:51.790> it<00:00:51.880> a

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
evolved in the way it did is it was it a

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.490 
evolved in the way it did is it was it a
natural<00:00:52.060> progression<00:00:52.480> was<00:00:52.900> it<00:00:53.020> limited<00:00:53.170> by

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
natural progression was it limited by

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.280 
natural progression was it limited by
its<00:00:53.620> materials<00:00:54.100> or<00:00:54.250> technology<00:00:55.080> that<00:00:56.080> was<00:00:56.200> the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
its materials or technology that was the

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.380 
its materials or technology that was the
last<00:00:56.500> one<00:00:56.650> in<00:00:56.710> my<00:00:56.890> studio<00:00:57.280> it's<00:00:57.880> quite<00:00:58.090> late<00:00:58.240> at

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
last one in my studio it's quite late at

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.890 
last one in my studio it's quite late at
night<00:00:58.570> and<00:00:59.370> I<00:01:00.370> had<00:01:01.120> little<00:01:01.420> garden<00:01:01.750> outside

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
night and I had little garden outside

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.510 
night and I had little garden outside
the<00:01:02.170> office<00:01:02.470> with<00:01:02.680> some<00:01:02.860> mint<00:01:03.040> in<00:01:03.190> it<00:01:03.280> so<00:01:03.490> I

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
the office with some mint in it so I

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.940 
the office with some mint in it so I
made<00:01:03.730> myself<00:01:03.940> a<00:01:04.600> mini<00:01:05.080> to--they<00:01:05.470> drink<00:01:05.710> and

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
made myself a mini to--they drink and

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.609 
made myself a mini to--they drink and
just<00:01:06.820> sat<00:01:07.330> down<00:01:07.360> and<00:01:07.600> relaxed<00:01:07.990> and<00:01:08.110> thought<00:01:08.290> I

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
just sat down and relaxed and thought I

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.100 
just sat down and relaxed and thought I
wonder<00:01:09.250> if<00:01:09.490> a<00:01:09.909> shoe<00:01:10.450> looks<00:01:10.720> the<00:01:10.869> way<00:01:10.960> it<00:01:10.990> does

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
wonder if a shoe looks the way it does

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.950 
wonder if a shoe looks the way it does
because<00:01:11.860> that's<00:01:12.280> what<00:01:12.430> it<00:01:12.490> was

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
because that's what it was

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.870 
because that's what it was
so<00:01:14.560> I<00:01:14.590> thought<00:01:14.860> about<00:01:15.190> the<00:01:15.280> footprint<00:01:15.670> in<00:01:15.790> the

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
so I thought about the footprint in the

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.300 
so I thought about the footprint in the
sand<00:01:16.120> and<00:01:16.390> how<00:01:17.020> that<00:01:17.410> shows<00:01:17.710> me<00:01:18.010> where<00:01:18.280> the

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
sand and how that shows me where the

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.960 
sand and how that shows me where the
load<00:01:18.760> of<00:01:18.910> the<00:01:18.970> body<00:01:19.150> goes<00:01:19.390> when<00:01:19.600> he<00:01:19.690> walk<00:01:20.970> so

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
load of the body goes when he walk so

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.240 
load of the body goes when he walk so
you<00:01:22.030> have<00:01:22.350> print<00:01:23.350> for<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.560> foot<00:01:23.800> like<00:01:24.220> a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
you have print for the foot like a

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.770 
you have print for the foot like a
little<00:01:24.520> kind<00:01:24.760> of<00:01:24.790> cat<00:01:25.030> print<00:01:25.300> and<00:01:25.480> then<00:01:25.660> you

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
little kind of cat print and then you

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.480 
little kind of cat print and then you
have<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:25.990> heel<00:01:26.140> pad<00:01:26.410> and<00:01:27.070> there's<00:01:27.220> not<00:01:27.340> much

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
have the heel pad and there's not much

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.940 
have the heel pad and there's not much
load<00:01:27.760> in<00:01:27.910> the<00:01:27.970> middle<00:01:28.440> but<00:01:29.440> then<00:01:29.560> if<00:01:29.650> the<00:01:29.770> foot

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
load in the middle but then if the foot

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.610 
load in the middle but then if the foot
was<00:01:30.070> elevated<00:01:30.610> like<00:01:30.820> a<00:01:30.850> high<00:01:31.090> heel<00:01:31.360> is<00:01:31.960> there

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
was elevated like a high heel is there

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.950 
was elevated like a high heel is there
any<00:01:32.740> load<00:01:32.950> in<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.130> middle<00:01:33.340> at<00:01:33.400> all<00:01:33.550> so<00:01:34.479> how<00:01:34.900> can

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
any load in the middle at all so how can

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.770 
any load in the middle at all so how can
I<00:01:35.170> create<00:01:36.130> a<00:01:36.280> shoe<00:01:36.520> which<00:01:36.760> can<00:01:37.000> protect<00:01:37.510> the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
I create a shoe which can protect the

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.980 
I create a shoe which can protect the
front<00:01:38.020> hold<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.740> heel<00:01:38.940> so<00:01:39.940> I<00:01:39.990> stopped

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
front hold the heel so I stopped

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.490 
front hold the heel so I stopped
thinking

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
thinking

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.810 
thinking
and<00:01:41.650> decided<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.460> start<00:01:42.910> making<00:01:44.550> so<00:01:45.550> we<00:01:45.640> did<00:01:45.790> a

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
and decided to start making so we did a

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.999 
and decided to start making so we did a
lot<00:01:45.970> of<00:01:46.000> research<00:01:46.660> and<00:01:46.930> testing<00:01:47.680> of<00:01:47.950> different

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
lot of research and testing of different

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.590 
lot of research and testing of different
machines<00:01:48.490> and<00:01:49.090> we<00:01:49.149> were<00:01:49.210> looking<00:01:49.300> for

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
machines and we were looking for

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.359 
machines and we were looking for
something<00:01:49.750> that<00:01:49.899> could<00:01:50.140> give<00:01:50.320> us<00:01:50.440> that<00:01:51.070> blend

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
something that could give us that blend

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.920 
something that could give us that blend
of<00:01:51.520> a<00:01:51.610> heated<00:01:51.910> build<00:01:52.090> so<00:01:52.479> it<00:01:52.600> was<00:01:52.720> gonna<00:01:52.810> be

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
of a heated build so it was gonna be

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.260 
of a heated build so it was gonna be
very<00:01:53.050> stable<00:01:53.380> there's<00:01:54.220> gonna<00:01:54.310> be<00:01:54.460> fast<00:01:54.729> and<00:01:55.149> it

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
very stable there's gonna be fast and it

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.719 
very stable there's gonna be fast and it
was<00:01:55.360> gonna<00:01:55.450> have<00:01:55.600> a<00:01:55.630> big<00:01:55.840> build<00:01:56.140> volume<00:01:56.729> we

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
was gonna have a big build volume we

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.430 
was gonna have a big build volume we
found<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.149> Ultimaker<00:01:58.690> to<00:01:59.110> be<00:01:59.200> a<00:01:59.259> brilliant

it's<00:02:14.380> a<00:02:14.500> fantastic<00:02:15.040> machine<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.520> have<00:02:15.670> in<00:02:15.880> the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
it's a fantastic machine to have in the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.060 
it's a fantastic machine to have in the
studio<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.510> it's<00:02:16.630> it<00:02:17.350> enables<00:02:17.709> you<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:17.830> do

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
studio and it's it enables you to do

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.979 
studio and it's it enables you to do
very<00:02:18.549> very<00:02:18.610> quick<00:02:19.000> proof<00:02:19.209> of<00:02:19.390> concepts<00:02:19.870> like

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
very very quick proof of concepts like

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.820 
very very quick proof of concepts like
down<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.170> this<00:02:20.380> size<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:20.830> in<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:21.549> few<00:02:21.760> minutes

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
down to this size and in a few minutes

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.770 
down to this size and in a few minutes
so<00:02:23.830> that<00:02:24.160> I<00:02:24.880> think<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.150> key<00:02:25.330> difference<00:02:25.360> with

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
so that I think the key difference with

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.960 
so that I think the key difference with
an<00:02:26.170> architectural<00:02:26.709> approach<00:02:27.070> is<00:02:27.340> that<00:02:27.760> I

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
an architectural approach is that I

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.210 
an architectural approach is that I
started<00:02:28.780> from<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.930> foot<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.739> body<00:02:29.920> and

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
started from the foot and the body and

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.220 
started from the foot and the body and
the<00:02:30.420> biomechanics<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.510> how<00:02:31.660> you<00:02:31.720> walk<00:02:31.959> how

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
the biomechanics and how you walk how

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.960 
the biomechanics and how you walk how
the<00:02:32.290> load<00:02:32.650> comes<00:02:32.920> then<00:02:33.549> I<00:02:33.580> looked<00:02:33.790> at<00:02:33.880> the

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
the load comes then I looked at the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.990 
the load comes then I looked at the
material<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.750> process<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.820> then<00:02:36.820> the

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
material and the process and then the

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.120 
material and the process and then the
design<00:02:37.299> is<00:02:37.480> kind<00:02:37.780> of<00:02:37.870> comes<00:02:38.410> from<00:02:38.650> those<00:02:38.860> two

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
design is kind of comes from those two

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.170 
design is kind of comes from those two
things<00:02:39.519> together

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
things together

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.479 
things together
I<00:02:40.209> didn't<00:02:41.140> start<00:02:41.380> by<00:02:41.650> wanting<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.340> make<00:02:42.459> a

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
I didn't start by wanting to make a

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.910 
I didn't start by wanting to make a
twisty<00:02:42.880> shape<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:44.230> way<00:02:44.350> it<00:02:44.440> looks<00:02:44.620> is<00:02:44.799> the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
twisty shape the way it looks is the

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.100 
twisty shape the way it looks is the
result<00:02:45.250> of<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.400> process<00:02:45.610> and<00:02:46.390> that's<00:02:46.660> as

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
result of the process and that's as

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.170 
result of the process and that's as
simple<00:02:47.380> as<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.590> could<00:02:47.709> be

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
simple as it could be

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.319 
simple as it could be
the<00:02:49.049> good<00:02:49.319> design<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:50.060> process<00:02:51.060> shouldn't

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
the good design and process shouldn't

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.330 
the good design and process shouldn't
cost<00:02:51.599> more<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.959> can<00:02:52.140> be<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.530> can<00:02:52.590> be<00:02:52.739> cheaper<00:02:52.980> it

there and not all of them work and then

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.119 
there and not all of them work and then
used<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.170> choose<00:03:19.379> the<00:03:19.530> one<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.799> it<00:03:19.890> wins<00:03:20.040> the

competition that's great and the ones

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.160 
competition that's great and the ones
that<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:22.829> try<00:03:23.220> that<00:03:23.639> don't<00:03:23.849> work<00:03:24.090> give<00:03:25.049> you

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
that you try that don't work give you

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.379 
that you try that don't work give you
clues<00:03:25.530> as<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:25.950> ones<00:03:26.099> that<00:03:26.310> will<00:03:26.459> work<00:03:26.670> and

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
clues as to the ones that will work and

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.569 
clues as to the ones that will work and
so<00:03:27.569> the<00:03:27.659> moment<00:03:27.870> I<00:03:28.139> did<00:03:28.319> this<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.859> knew<00:03:29.400> there's

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
so the moment I did this I knew there's

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.180 
so the moment I did this I knew there's
something<00:03:29.819> special
