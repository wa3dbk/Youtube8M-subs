00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.180 
and look at it you kind of hold it still
and<00:04:10.840> if<00:04:11.080> you<00:04:11.110> see<00:04:11.350> the<00:04:11.440> boil<00:04:11.620> you<00:04:11.740> count<00:04:11.980> three

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
and if you see the boil you count three

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.850 
and if you see the boil you count three
seconds<00:04:12.900> you<00:04:13.900> do<00:04:13.990> a<00:04:14.020> directional<00:04:14.470> change<00:04:14.710> or

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
seconds you do a directional change or

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.140 
seconds you do a directional change or
you<00:04:14.950> just<00:04:15.100> kind<00:04:15.250> of<00:04:15.310> you<00:04:15.700> kick<00:04:15.910> it<00:04:16.030> in<00:04:16.120> gear

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
you just kind of you kick it in gear

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.940 
you just kind of you kick it in gear
just<00:04:16.540> enough<00:04:16.840> and<00:04:17.019> that<00:04:17.080> usually<00:04:17.350> triggers

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
just enough and that usually triggers

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.140 
just enough and that usually triggers
them<00:04:18.100> up<00:04:18.250> to<00:04:18.400> commit<00:04:18.760> on<00:04:18.880> it<00:04:19.080> all<00:04:20.080> right<00:04:20.109> it

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
them up to commit on it all right it

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.310 
them up to commit on it all right it
it's<00:04:22.150> kind<00:04:22.330> of<00:04:22.360> a<00:04:22.480> weird<00:04:22.660> game<00:04:22.930> it's<00:04:23.170> like<00:04:23.230> a

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
it's kind of a weird game it's like a

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.710 
it's kind of a weird game it's like a
little<00:04:23.530> cat-and-mouse<00:04:23.860> game<00:04:24.430> but<00:04:25.180> once<00:04:25.630> you

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
little cat-and-mouse game but once you

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.440 
little cat-and-mouse game but once you
figure<00:04:25.990> out<00:04:26.020> that<00:04:26.290> that<00:04:26.530> little<00:04:26.950> pattern<00:04:27.450> you

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
figure out that that little pattern you

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.910 
figure out that that little pattern you
start<00:04:28.690> putting<00:04:28.840> some<00:04:29.050> big<00:04:29.260> fish<00:04:29.560> on<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.770> boat

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
start putting some big fish on the boat

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.090 
start putting some big fish on the boat
quick

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
that Sun breaks a little bit over that

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
from open water it's going to suck them

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.520 
from open water it's going to suck them
in<00:04:40.770> a<00:04:40.800> little<00:04:40.920> bit<00:04:41.070> me<00:04:42.170> see<00:04:43.170> a<00:04:43.200> little<00:04:43.350> bit<00:04:43.470> more

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
in a little bit me see a little bit more

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.680 
in a little bit me see a little bit more
boils<00:04:44.040> right<00:04:44.220> when<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.430> Sun<00:04:44.490> come<00:04:44.820> comes<00:04:45.540> up
