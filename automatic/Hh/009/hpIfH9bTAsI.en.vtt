00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.540 
made for sort for carp fishing yeah yeah
and<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.170> noticed<00:00:55.500> on<00:00:55.590> here<00:00:55.800> as<00:00:55.949> well<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.129> MIDI

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
and I noticed on here as well that MIDI

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.680 
and I noticed on here as well that MIDI
you've<00:00:56.640> got<00:00:56.789> quite<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.059> unique<00:00:57.420> way<00:00:57.570> of

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
you've got quite a unique way of

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.360 
you've got quite a unique way of
attaching<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.500> band's<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:59.039> taught<00:00:59.250> me

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
attaching the band's just taught me

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.260 
attaching the band's just taught me
through<00:00:59.520> what<00:00:59.670> they've<00:00:59.789> done<00:00:59.940> there

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
through what they've done there

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.700 
through what they've done there
I've<00:01:00.359> actually<00:01:00.629> twisted<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.109> lime<00:01:01.320> except

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
I've actually twisted the lime except

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.500 
I've actually twisted the lime except
richer<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.609> makes<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> bit<00:01:03.149> stiffer

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
richer and it makes it a bit stiffer

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.509 
richer and it makes it a bit stiffer
stop<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.470> from<00:01:04.619> wrapping<00:01:04.949> around<00:01:05.070> your<00:01:05.309> hook

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
stop it from wrapping around your hook

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.510 
stop it from wrapping around your hook
and<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:06.600> aids<00:01:06.750> as<00:01:06.990> well<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.320> night<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.950> car

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
and it aids as well in night and the car

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.030 
and it aids as well in night and the car
projects<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.150> debate<00:01:09.750> helps<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.590> hook<00:01:10.770> stick

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
projects the debate helps a hook stick

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.500 
projects the debate helps a hook stick
in<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.220> mail<00:01:11.400> yeah<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.670> noticed<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.360> bait

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
in the mail yeah I noticed that the bait

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.880 
in the mail yeah I noticed that the bait
because<00:01:12.990> it's<00:01:13.140> on<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.350> band<00:01:13.530> there<00:01:13.710> can

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
because it's on the band there can

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.320 
because it's on the band there can
actually<00:01:14.130> pivot<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> hair<00:01:14.880> like<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.210> say

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
actually pivot on the hair like you say

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.999 
actually pivot on the hair like you say
giving<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.689> little<00:01:15.900> bit<00:01:16.020> more<00:01:16.170> freedom<00:01:16.409> almost

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
giving a little bit more freedom almost

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.830 
giving a little bit more freedom almost
like<00:01:17.189> sort<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.700> specimen<00:01:18.299> car<00:01:18.479> traps<00:01:18.720> that

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
like sort of the specimen car traps that

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.960 
like sort of the specimen car traps that

drilled pellet that's set I mean quite
often<00:01:35.100> people<00:01:35.369> think<00:01:35.600> abandoned<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.689> only<00:01:36.869> for

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
often people think abandoned is only for

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.630 
often people think abandoned is only for
pellets<00:01:37.500> but<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:37.829> not<00:01:38.009> like<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.400> can<00:01:38.490> use

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
pellets but it's not like so you can use

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.190 
pellets but it's not like so you can use
it<00:01:38.729> for<00:01:38.880> there's<00:01:39.210> massive<00:01:39.720> amount<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.020> baits

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
it for there's massive amount of baits

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.380 
it for there's massive amount of baits
you<00:01:40.380> can<00:01:40.530> use<00:01:40.770> with<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:41.939> can<00:01:42.150> pull<00:01:42.299> it

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
you can use with it like you can pull it

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.960 
you can use with it like you can pull it
through<00:01:42.570> me<00:01:42.810> pull<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.590> through<00:01:43.770> corn<00:01:44.070> get<00:01:44.700> even

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
through me pull it through corn get even

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.730 
through me pull it through corn get even
people<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.659> fishing<00:01:46.020> bread<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.619> can

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
people like fishing bread and you can

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.350 
people like fishing bread and you can
actually<00:01:46.829> stretch<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.579> band<00:01:47.790> around<00:01:48.060> bread

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
actually stretch to band around bread

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.719 
actually stretch to band around bread
now<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.750> popped<00:01:48.990> up<00:01:49.110> off<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.380> bottom<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.829> then

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
now it popped up off the bottom and then

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.330 
now it popped up off the bottom and then
there's<00:01:50.880> endless<00:01:51.000> uses<00:01:51.360> there's<00:01:52.079> no<00:01:52.340> nobody

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
there's endless uses there's no nobody

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.429 
there's endless uses there's no nobody
really<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.880> can't<00:01:54.090> usually<00:01:54.329> bun<00:01:54.780> okay

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
really that you can't usually bun okay

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.490 
really that you can't usually bun okay
so<00:01:56.399> at<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.270> end<00:01:57.600> just<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.840> clarify<00:01:58.049> was<00:01:58.380> got<00:01:58.469> a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
so at this end just to clarify was got a

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.170 
so at this end just to clarify was got a
nice<00:01:58.649> figure<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.040> eight<00:01:59.130> loop<00:01:59.369> ultra-strong

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
nice figure of eight loop ultra-strong

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.240 
nice figure of eight loop ultra-strong
yeah<00:02:00.509> which<00:02:00.810> brings<00:02:00.990> us<00:02:01.259> nicely<00:02:01.619> onto<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
yeah which brings us nicely onto the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.920 
yeah which brings us nicely onto the
shorter<00:02:02.640> versions<00:02:03.060> which<00:02:03.240> don't<00:02:03.780> actually

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
shorter versions which don't actually

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.690 
shorter versions which don't actually
have<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.259> loop<00:02:04.469> at<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.680> end<00:02:04.740> they've<00:02:05.490> got<00:02:05.670> a

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
have a loop at the end they've got a

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.550 
have a loop at the end they've got a
special<00:02:05.969> little<00:02:06.210> attachment<00:02:07.079> clip<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.380> just

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
special little attachment clip so just

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.260 
special little attachment clip so just
taught<00:02:07.740> me<00:02:07.860> through<00:02:08.069> thought<00:02:08.910> behind<00:02:09.149> this

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
taught me through thought behind this

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.119 
taught me through thought behind this
please<00:02:09.479> great<00:02:09.720> what<00:02:10.259> they<00:02:10.410> these<00:02:10.709> ones<00:02:10.979> are

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
please great what they these ones are

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.190 
please great what they these ones are

cast down and I can see one of the
benefits<00:02:37.640> of<00:02:37.730> these<00:02:37.819> straight<00:02:38.150> aways<00:02:38.420> that<00:02:38.450> a

want to see think that that sort of that

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.300 
want to see think that that sort of that
range<00:02:47.840> of<00:02:48.019> movement<00:02:48.470> just<00:02:48.769> definitely<00:02:49.099> get

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
range of movement just definitely get

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.160 
range of movement just definitely get
you<00:02:49.400> more<00:02:49.549> bite<00:02:49.760> it's<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.510> lot<00:02:50.630> more<00:02:50.750> flexible

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
you more bite it's a lot more flexible

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.170 
you more bite it's a lot more flexible
you<00:02:51.260> ain't<00:02:51.380> go<00:02:51.500> tight<00:02:51.769> a<00:02:52.099> tight<00:02:52.250> loop<00:02:52.819> there

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
you ain't go tight a tight loop there

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.569 
you ain't go tight a tight loop there
and<00:02:53.470> scruff<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.500> spring<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.130> out<00:02:55.280> of<00:02:55.430> your

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
method feeder as well and is really

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.559 
method feeder as well and is really
flexible<00:02:58.310> especially<00:02:58.970> in<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.120> car<00:02:59.299> potato

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569
