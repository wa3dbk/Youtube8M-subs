00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 hello everyone with you roof in this video i 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.300
 presenting my new build build 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.040
 version 1.2 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.009
 this assembly is basically different from 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.279
 previous versions of what's here 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.119
 many technical mods added 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:22.949
 various addons 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.619
 industrial kraft build craft from well, let 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.199
 mostly technical bias is already underway 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.460
 they lpg 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.960
 let's go through the mods and here 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.329
 sixty nine pieces and first 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.559
 Initially there were more than 80 but I decided 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.870
 some delete the way if you compare 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.050
 previous build then i deleted the mod 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.660
 lonking for me because a few people 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.000
 said he was somehow off topic 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.030
 delete it if you want in the folder 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.230
 mods just bake so most 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.110
 mods updated 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.390
 but some still I did not 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.129
 update to latest versions by 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.070
 for some reason I will say 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.920
 delete and so optifine I did not update 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.310
 to the latest version since it is exactly 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.619
 the optifine version is fairly stable 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.990
 lag practically does not occur at all 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.049
 everything works fine so I did not 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.229
 update in order to avoid any new 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.200
 lag increase bugs that can 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.670
 happen because of the new version so but 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.909
 tones oh there with of course treecapitator 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.100

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.990
 gives but I think it's okay that their 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.780
 probably added only some 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.770
 useful new machines for industrial 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.950
