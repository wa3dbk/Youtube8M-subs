00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 hey paul sticks get the means 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:10.380
 that's what stefan raab was about 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.599
 is to watch TV on this year, the 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.700
 means significantly less teeth in the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.859
 Watch TV and that's why we have to join 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.289
 old four games significantly more teeth 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.939
 show by playing a game with 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.970
 stefan raab at main or in the where was 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:30.240
 because that was polar because that was 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.450
 polar alarm a game based on tv 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.230
 totally from the year 2000 on mine 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:42.930
 completely real screen you see 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:45.120
 anything else will keep you welcome 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.870
 to talk about cola and the game to tv 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.950
 That's it 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.079
 much more pleasant 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.940
 this is my christmas present to all 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.680
 tv total fans so you know about the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.890
 Holidays can do even more per country 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.420
 stefan raab so far so surely believe 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.030
 you that he really said that 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.589
 is a real cite maybe has 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:11.060
 it is the developers with it 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:13.680
 enrollment arrest be mate ok 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.900
 ok start okay that's that's one 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.850
 known tv-moderator of the other well 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.420
 makes junk and somehow he huge 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.420
 pine and he looks at 400,000 years 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.430
 Immediately I believe he so in the world 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.720
 he always came clearly from gÃ¼nther 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.950
 Yes, yes, everyone knows and now 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.650
 you have to be in front of santa and 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.000
 other things flee and that 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.710
 most important in the world we do 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.920
 Drink naturally and there is there 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.920
 beer 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.700
 disappears cordially or a beer drinks 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:54.220
 You can drink more , you always have to 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:56.170
 One drink as dots but I believe 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.120
 in order to get into the level you have to 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.110
 Always drink a beer and every box 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.760
 that 's actually basically that 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.760
 whole game there comes just one 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.920
 gimmick added so you explore a few 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:15.690
 level has to find out where the whole 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.690
 beer bottles are and survive 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:27.430
 now comes now really good comes 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.510
 music now you have to land and the 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.770
 Christmas and there I find pure and 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.480
 kill tight but I did it 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:36.130
 I have a lot of santa clauses 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.780
 the holidays he is on the go 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.860
 it's not warm outside people 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.100
 It is warm Christmas 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.270
 the game is also from 18 because that 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.920
 urinate in public 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.330
 glorified yes but fortunately there was 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.010
 no usk when we came out 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.019
 otherwise you are terribly right 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.750
 does not belong in the 30s zone because you want 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:59.640
 we do not clean 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:02.170
 I think you can even kill dead animals 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.430
 So you can water us pink I have 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.070
 but you can also from these things 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.930
 from that angle because you can not even 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.910
 swimmer man stefan raab can not 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.830
 swim 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.239
 yes but that's boring we go 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.440
 just to go to the toilet 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:25.350
 We are watching TV at the moment 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:27.120
 his own broadcast actually that 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.710
 right we still get it so I have 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.170
 also with believe I have also one 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.280
 a little bit afraid of it as in outdated tv 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.420
 clips how to believe myself today 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.610
 still can do quite well except 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.590
 if they somehow also something 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.940
 Current is because then you have the 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:45.060
 temporal context not otherwise yes 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.250
 you let yourself do it as the game 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.930
 came out too young to tv totally too 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.820
 look and or understand that 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:56.040
 chopped chain link fence i have 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:02.220
 he read the broadcast 16 years ago 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:03.990
 long had 16 years ok and then he has 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.870
 still a lot of other stuff made in the 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.580
 watch TV and elsewhere 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.190
 There was, for example, very often 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.930
 a loo I think at ship and 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.850
 he also had a lot to do with music 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.700
 and the phone tells something 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.160
 Invented the book raw material and 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.450
 has patented and the patent 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.540
 I did not exactly have him on 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.919
 to change every case developed with him 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.980
 had was perhaps the idea of 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:31.370
 made to do a shower room and that 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.370
 was it 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:36.990
 yes that will probably have been 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.939
 because then he grinned again and has 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.860
 presented his huge jaw and 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:42.240
 he had with this weird paddy of 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.080
 somehow an interview or togo 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.789
 the other way 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.259
 or has annoyed him so annoyed that 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:48.449
 I think I 'm not quite happy anymore 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:51.770
 sure if that was the ship of 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.639
 a pillow i do not think so but me 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.259
 still does not know 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:05:02.039
 I still have to pee quietly 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:03.659
 died this is really bad here 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.340
 staff if you are not I had 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:07.919
 no idea 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.110
 You can also angle this can 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.870
 you do not do it 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:18.210
 beauty in it yes what he was just one 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:22.050
 Fin the 30s zone I am very happy 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:24.719
 that you did not run stock is me 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.199
 would rather go over and 3000 mark 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:27.360
 on 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:32.330
 or what 4000 is on the fourth 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:35.960
 version has iron fist for the fist 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.960
 I need every fist 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:49.830
 So it may bother him is matthias 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:51.270
 kurth is with what's priorities 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:55.740
 actually this is the game here 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:57.479
 all fall all the boxes once 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.139
 In addition, puller can drink alone 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.139
 form 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:06.020
 it's because the lights green on the 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:06.020
 other side is 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:26.189
 There are five points highest time limit 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:26.189
 yes but that was worth it 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:35.840
 you have to make the santa men 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:43.819
 sometimes the beer wadding in the ears 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:49.789
 stuck or not lucky 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:58.099
 that's magical maybe that 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:07:00.050
 last bottle around bottle of vodka all 

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:01.520
 guest BlÃ¤ttel printed and that the 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:17.690
 you can manage level 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:21.849
 ok mouse double in the nose rest in 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.849
 peace stefan raab rest in peace 

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:29.710
 he has a huge jaw I have to 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.710
 cola 

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.110
 save the cut we save out 

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.520
 stefan raab
