00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
deformations along the arm what we're

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.220 
deformations along the arm what we're
going<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.429> fix<00:00:38.699> that<00:00:38.910> with<00:00:39.059> smart<00:00:39.390> bones<00:00:39.600> I'm

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
going to fix that with smart bones I'm

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.840 
going to fix that with smart bones I'm
going<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.469> undo<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.859> and<00:00:41.129> make<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.339> level

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
going to undo that and make that level

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.150 
going to undo that and make that level
here<00:00:42.059> but<00:00:42.660> smart<00:00:42.989> bones<00:00:43.170> has<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> process<00:00:44.039> you

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
here but smart bones has a process you

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.349 
here but smart bones has a process you
need<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.399> go<00:00:44.519> to<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.910> want<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.120> be<00:00:45.210> very

need to go to and I want to be very

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:47.270 
need to go to and I want to be very
clear<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.109> as<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.499> get<00:00:46.620> into<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.100> and

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
clear on that as we get into it and

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.399 
clear on that as we get into it and
there's<00:00:47.670> also<00:00:47.789> an<00:00:48.059> added<00:00:48.539> benefit<00:00:49.019> of<00:00:49.079> working

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
there's also an added benefit of working

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:51.380 
there's also an added benefit of working
with<00:00:49.620> smart<00:00:50.010> bones<00:00:50.249> and<00:00:50.519> I<00:00:50.879> wish<00:00:51.089> more

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
with smart bones and I wish more

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.360 
with smart bones and I wish more
programs<00:00:51.960> had<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.379> ability<00:00:52.769> to<00:00:52.800> do<00:00:53.100> what

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
programs had the ability to do what

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.459 
programs had the ability to do what
anime<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:53.999> to<00:00:54.089> do<00:00:54.210> here<00:00:54.570> when<00:00:55.319> we

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
anime is going to do here when we

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.079 
anime is going to do here when we
actually<00:00:55.649> flex<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.280> arm<00:00:56.460> you'll<00:00:56.730> notice<00:00:56.969> that

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
actually flex the arm you'll notice that

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.209 
actually flex the arm you'll notice that
I've<00:00:57.239> got<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.749> gradient<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.589> it<00:00:58.739> if<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.920> select

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
I've got a gradient in it if I select

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.049 
I've got a gradient in it if I select
the<00:00:59.339> arm<00:00:59.550> layer<00:00:59.819> itself<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.659> switch<00:01:01.379> tools

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
the arm layer itself and switch tools

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.610 
the arm layer itself and switch tools
we've<00:01:03.059> got<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.329> gradient<00:01:03.749> so<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.409> dark

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
we've got this gradient so it's a dark

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.200 
we've got this gradient so it's a dark
near<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.860> edge<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.400> lighter<00:01:05.610> towards<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
near the edge and lighter towards the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.840 
near the edge and lighter towards the
center<00:01:06.600> then<00:01:07.380> come<00:01:07.680> back<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.070> select<00:01:08.220> my<00:01:08.550> bone

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
center then come back and select my bone

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.890 
center then come back and select my bone
layer<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.450> Z<00:01:10.380> when<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.710> flex<00:01:11.160> this<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.900> release

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
layer and Z when I flex this and release

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.890 
layer and Z when I flex this and release
the<00:01:13.440> gradient<00:01:13.920> bends<00:01:14.370> along<00:01:14.550> with<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.600> shape

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
the gradient bends along with the shape

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.260 
the gradient bends along with the shape
and<00:01:16.200> that's<00:01:16.410> just<00:01:16.740> such<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.100> fantastic<00:01:17.400> way<00:01:18.210> to

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
and that's just such a fantastic way to

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.630 
and that's just such a fantastic way to
not<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:19.020> reanimate<00:01:19.440> or<00:01:19.680> do<00:01:19.830> some<00:01:20.130> more

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
not have to reanimate or do some more

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.330 
not have to reanimate or do some more
detail<00:01:21.330> types<00:01:21.690> of<00:01:21.960> shape<00:01:22.680> creation<00:01:23.250> when

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
detail types of shape creation when

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.700 
detail types of shape creation when
you're<00:01:23.490> working<00:01:23.850> let's<00:01:24.630> move<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:25.020> with<00:01:25.410> these

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
you're working let's move on with these

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.800 
you're working let's move on with these
smart<00:01:25.980> bones<00:01:26.280> right<00:01:26.610> here<00:01:26.640> first<00:01:27.510> thing<00:01:27.690> I'll

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
smart bones right here first thing I'll

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.080 
smart bones right here first thing I'll
do<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.200> rename<00:01:28.770> my<00:01:28.980> layer<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:29.850> keep<00:01:29.970> it

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
do is rename my layer so I can keep it

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.700 
do is rename my layer so I can keep it
organized<00:01:30.510> now<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:30.780> only<00:01:31.020> have<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.230> single<00:01:31.410> arm

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
organized now we only have a single arm

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.340 
organized now we only have a single arm
here<00:01:32.010> but<00:01:32.190> for<00:01:32.460> due<00:01:32.850> process<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.750> diligence

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
here but for due process and diligence

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.710 
here but for due process and diligence
it's<00:01:34.500> always<00:01:34.950> wise<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.250> name<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.270> layers<00:01:36.480> in

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
it's always wise to name the layers in

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.830 
it's always wise to name the layers in
this<00:01:37.350> case<00:01:37.620> I'm<00:01:37.860> going<00:01:37.980> to<00:01:38.160> name<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.340> arm<00:01:38.780> left

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
this case I'm going to name it arm left

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.109 
this case I'm going to name it arm left
and<00:01:40.929> this<00:01:41.200> is<00:01:41.380> a<00:01:41.530> character<00:01:42.280> as<00:01:42.460> you<00:01:42.670> look<00:01:42.939> at

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
and this is a character as you look at

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.310 
and this is a character as you look at
it<00:01:43.149> really<00:01:43.570> important<00:01:43.929> to<00:01:44.020> keep<00:01:44.140> that

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
it really important to keep that

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.660 
it really important to keep that
straight<00:01:44.649> especially<00:01:45.310> if<00:01:45.399> you're<00:01:45.549> working

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
straight especially if you're working

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.660 
straight especially if you're working
with<00:01:45.939> some<00:01:46.090> other<00:01:46.210> folks<00:01:46.950> now<00:01:47.950> on<00:01:48.189> the<00:01:48.460> layer

this left arm bone
of<00:01:56.170> course<00:01:56.770> we<00:01:56.950> don't<00:01:57.070> have<00:01:57.190> to<00:01:57.820> do<00:01:57.940> this<00:01:58.150> but

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
of course we don't have to do this but

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.510 
of course we don't have to do this but
keeping<00:01:59.290> things<00:01:59.440> organized<00:02:00.010> just<00:02:00.250> makes<00:02:00.400> it

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
keeping things organized just makes it

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.580 
keeping things organized just makes it
easier<00:02:01.060> as<00:02:01.180> you<00:02:01.210> start<00:02:01.570> working<00:02:01.750> with<00:02:02.200> more

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
easier as you start working with more

easier as you start working with more
complex<00:02:02.950> characters<00:02:03.870> now<00:02:04.870> I'll<00:02:05.110> come<00:02:05.320> back<00:02:05.500> to

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
automatically named bones as you work

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.610 
automatically named bones as you work
and<00:02:21.910> that's<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.300> great<00:02:22.600> time-saver<00:02:22.900> but<00:02:23.470> it's

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
and that's a great time-saver but it's

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.290 
and that's a great time-saver but it's
kind<00:02:23.920> of<00:02:24.070> meaningless<00:02:24.459> when<00:02:24.820> you<00:02:24.940> get<00:02:25.090> into

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
kind of meaningless when you get into

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.790 
kind of meaningless when you get into
more<00:02:25.450> complex<00:02:25.870> rigs<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.470> have<00:02:26.620> multiple

more complex rigs that have multiple

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.070 
more complex rigs that have multiple
bones<00:02:27.220> but<00:02:28.030> we<00:02:28.239> need<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.510> pay<00:02:28.660> attention<00:02:28.690> to

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
bones but we need to pay attention to

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.470 
bones but we need to pay attention to
something<00:02:29.350> right<00:02:29.800> here<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.430> that<00:02:30.790> is<00:02:31.060> that

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
something right here and that is that

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.150 
something right here and that is that
the<00:02:31.690> actions<00:02:32.380> that<00:02:32.500> we're<00:02:32.770> going<00:02:32.890> to<00:02:32.980> create

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
the actions that we're going to create

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.460 
the actions that we're going to create
for<00:02:33.280> smart<00:02:33.700> bones<00:02:33.910> have<00:02:34.300> to<00:02:34.510> match<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:35.200> name

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
for smart bones have to match the name

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.080 
for smart bones have to match the name
of<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.920> bone<00:02:36.130> exactly

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
of the bone exactly

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.600 
of the bone exactly
so<00:02:37.870> this<00:02:38.380> bone<00:02:38.800> right<00:02:38.830> here<00:02:39.070> I'm<00:02:39.400> going<00:02:39.550> to

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
so this bone right here I'm going to

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.040 
so this bone right here I'm going to
come<00:02:39.790> up<00:02:39.910> here<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.180> click<00:02:40.420> in<00:02:40.540> this<00:02:40.630> area<00:02:40.780> and

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
come up here and click in this area and

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.560 
come up here and click in this area and
simply<00:02:41.560> say<00:02:41.770> arm<00:02:42.780> left<00:02:43.780> lower<00:02:44.709> and<00:02:45.570> accept

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
simply say arm left lower and accept

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.930 
simply say arm left lower and accept
that<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:46.989> next<00:02:47.800> bone<00:02:48.130> I'll<00:02:48.610> highlight

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
that and the next bone I'll highlight

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.730 
that and the next bone I'll highlight
that

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
that

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.530 
that
and<00:02:51.280> go<00:02:51.400> arm<00:02:51.760> left<00:02:52.690> upper<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:55.030> can<00:02:55.180> name<00:02:55.390> them

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
and go arm left upper you can name them

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.240 
and go arm left upper you can name them
whatever<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:55.990> want<00:02:56.200> there's<00:02:56.590> no<00:02:56.740> magical

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
whatever you want there's no magical

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.100 
whatever you want there's no magical
routine<00:02:57.880> for<00:02:58.180> this<00:02:58.330> really<00:02:58.870> it's<00:02:58.990> whatever

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
routine for this really it's whatever

routine for this really it's whatever
makes<00:02:59.410> sense<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.950> you<00:03:00.100> I'll<00:03:00.450> select<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.660> arm

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
makes sense to you I'll select the arm

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.140 
makes sense to you I'll select the arm
bone<00:03:02.350> lower<00:03:02.740> here<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:03.340> we'll<00:03:03.670> open<00:03:03.880> our

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
bone lower here and we'll open our

bone lower here and we'll open our
actions<00:03:04.720> palette

with that open right now we are going to

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.190 
with that open right now we are going to
go<00:03:08.890> ahead<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.490> create<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:10.300> smart<00:03:10.690> bomb<00:03:10.900> and

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
go ahead and create a smart bomb and

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.260 
go ahead and create a smart bomb and
what<00:03:11.740> I'll<00:03:11.830> do<00:03:12.010> with<00:03:12.220> this<00:03:12.400> bone<00:03:12.730> selected

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
what I'll do with this bone selected

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.000 
what I'll do with this bone selected
right<00:03:13.420> here<00:03:13.660> is<00:03:13.810> come<00:03:14.020> over<00:03:14.230> here<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.650> where<00:03:14.680> we

right here is come over here to where we

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.040 
right here is come over here to where we
just<00:03:15.250> named<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.550> and<00:03:15.730> highlight<00:03:16.510> everything

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
just named it and highlight everything

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.650 
just named it and highlight everything
and<00:03:17.260> copy<00:03:17.560> that<00:03:17.740> command<00:03:18.340> C<00:03:18.640> or<00:03:18.670> control<00:03:19.360> C

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
program will actually automatically sort

program will actually automatically sort
these<00:03:29.140> but<00:03:29.470> I<00:03:29.560> always<00:03:29.740> like<00:03:29.890> to<00:03:29.920> just<00:03:30.250> make

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
get elbow and where the shoulder region

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.190 
get elbow and where the shoulder region
would<00:04:44.340> be<00:04:44.550> and<00:04:44.790> look<00:04:45.480> the<00:04:45.660> gradient<00:04:46.110> is

kind of fake view of where the arm would

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.450 
kind of fake view of where the arm would

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
for our manipulation tool

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.230 
for our manipulation tool
well<00:05:03.060> let's<00:05:03.570> select<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:03.960> bone<00:05:04.170> layer<00:05:04.470> first<00:05:05.240> Z

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
well let's select the bone layer first Z

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.560 
well let's select the bone layer first Z
for<00:05:06.510> manipulate<00:05:06.960> and<00:05:07.640> we<00:05:08.640> see<00:05:08.820> a<00:05:08.850> nice<00:05:09.060> flex

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
for manipulate and we see a nice flex

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:10.820 
for manipulate and we see a nice flex
there<00:05:09.840> but<00:05:10.050> what<00:05:10.200> if<00:05:10.290> we<00:05:10.380> want<00:05:10.560> to<00:05:10.590> go<00:05:10.710> the

there but what if we want to go the

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.040 
there but what if we want to go the
other<00:05:10.980> way<00:05:11.250> with<00:05:11.670> the<00:05:11.700> arm<00:05:12.060> well<00:05:12.750> we'll<00:05:12.930> need

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050
