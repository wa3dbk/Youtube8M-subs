the shadow of the earth and passes

the shadow of the earth and passes
through<00:00:29.710> it<00:00:30.180> the<00:00:31.180> shadow<00:00:31.480> of<00:00:31.570> the<00:00:31.780> earth<00:00:31.810> is

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
through it the shadow of the earth is

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.800 
through it the shadow of the earth is
projected<00:00:32.770> onto<00:00:32.980> the<00:00:33.190> full<00:00:33.489> moon<00:00:33.760> and<00:00:34.030> turns

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:34.810 
projected onto the full moon and turns

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.440 
projected onto the full moon and turns
it<00:00:34.960> into<00:00:35.110> a<00:00:35.200> crescent<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:36.670> ancient<00:00:36.910> Greece

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
it into a crescent in ancient Greece

during<00:00:38.170> an<00:00:38.410> eclipse<00:00:38.620> the<00:00:39.280> restoral<00:00:39.790> noticed

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
during an eclipse the restoral noticed

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.240 
during an eclipse the restoral noticed
the<00:00:40.390> curve<00:00:40.629> of<00:00:40.780> the<00:00:40.900> shadow<00:00:41.140> on<00:00:41.379> the<00:00:41.440> moon<00:00:41.739> it

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
the curve of the shadow on the moon it

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.119 
the curve of the shadow on the moon it
was<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.030> proof<00:00:43.300> he<00:00:43.510> was<00:00:43.660> looking<00:00:43.960> for<00:00:44.200> only<00:00:44.770> an

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
was the proof he was looking for only an

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.010 
was the proof he was looking for only an
enormous<00:00:45.700> round<00:00:45.940> object<00:00:46.570> could<00:00:46.750> throw<00:00:46.989> a

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
enormous round object could throw a

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.710 
enormous round object could throw a
round<00:00:47.350> shadow<00:00:47.770> on<00:00:48.010> the<00:00:48.040> moon<00:00:48.160> the<00:00:48.879> earth<00:00:49.120> was

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
round shadow on the moon the earth was

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.590 
round shadow on the moon the earth was
round

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.540 

during<00:00:54.350> an<00:00:54.440> eclipse<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:54.949> shadow<00:00:55.280> of<00:00:55.399> the

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
during an eclipse the shadow of the

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.020 
during an eclipse the shadow of the
earth<00:00:55.579> advances<00:00:56.390> and<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:57.140> moon<00:00:57.379> darkens<00:00:58.030> but

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
earth advances and the moon darkens but

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.240 
earth advances and the moon darkens but
at<00:00:59.149> the<00:00:59.239> same<00:00:59.510> time<00:00:59.839> it<00:01:00.379> takes<00:01:00.589> on<00:01:00.859> strange

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
at the same time it takes on strange

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.850 
at the same time it takes on strange
colors<00:01:01.730> this<00:01:02.629> is<00:01:02.809> because<00:01:03.110> of<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.320> sun's<00:01:03.559> rays

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
colors this is because of the sun's rays

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.350 
colors this is because of the sun's rays
passing<00:01:04.309> through<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:04.850> Earth's<00:01:05.030> atmosphere

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
passing through the Earth's atmosphere

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.789 
passing through the Earth's atmosphere
like<00:01:06.110> a<00:01:06.170> sunset<00:01:08.470> astronauts<00:01:09.470> on<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:09.710> moon

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
like a sunset astronauts on the moon

during<00:01:10.250> an<00:01:10.460> eclipse<00:01:10.670> would<00:01:11.030> see<00:01:11.180> this<00:01:11.360> sunset

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
during an eclipse would see this sunset

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:21.859 
during an eclipse would see this sunset
followed<00:01:12.590> shortly<00:01:12.830> afterwards<00:01:13.520> by<00:01:13.789> a<00:01:13.820> sunrise

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
the next full moon won't pass through

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.660 
the next full moon won't pass through
the<00:01:25.090> Earth's<00:01:25.270> shadow<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:27.070> will<00:01:27.310> go<00:01:27.460> by
