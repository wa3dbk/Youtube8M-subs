00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.920
 we are with alex fiorio leagues of 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.470
 rally world in 1987 which explains the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.080
 functioning the peculiarities of the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.310
 maserati ghibli q4 braico alex then 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.859
 now let's try all the setups 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.529
 of electronics and we are in the first set 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.480
 up because the hiv aids the car 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.890
 absolutely very safe it changes gear 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.510
 very quickly because it also serves for 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.030
 save on gasoline then 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.219
 immediately put in a gear there were not 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.350
 the exact chelsea medicine bourgeois holds 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.960
 hands the other so that anyway 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.670
 when there is slippery ground it is too 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.829
 even better because you never have one 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.300
 big skidding and for example this 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.660
 He returned within one's own trend and 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.070
 what was the characteristic in your opinion 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.930
 more beautiful than this traction system 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.910
 integral moderates but look at that 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.550
 the attraction moves really is 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.600
 very quickly between the rear 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.100
 the front in 100 milliseconds and then 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.450
 really the moment you have 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.640
 need traction on 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.800
 on the front and you immediately have it 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.810
 with the other he will explain that he is watching us 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.090
 we are on an ice rink a 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.960
 icicle noises in cervinia with 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.570
 latches designed place to allow 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.369
 motor skills exactly 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.110
 in fact I know from the past they have passed 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.970
 in normal mode now 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.460
 we will try to stop in the middle of the 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.780
 climb and you'll see that on the restart la 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:40.390
 car do not have a minimum 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:42.700
 skating is an already beautiful climb 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.530
 steep will at least we stop a 20 for 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.240
 one hundred we stop completely 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.790
 we leave again without any bargaining 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.369
 the car life or on the team 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.830
 exception I have selected the form 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.840
 which makes me see how the couple goes between 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.080
 front and back so we started 50 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.869
 50 and changes continuously changes 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.240
 It contains the pilot piada this 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.760
 let's say linearity in the passage of 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.540
 couple 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.220
 but look it's a pass you copy is a 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.260
 very fluid torque design then 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.060
 so it allows you to drive the 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.440
 car as you like in a manner 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.090
 exactly how you want to drive but with 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.890
 maximum traction in each 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.690
 moment therefore also we are in man and that 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.270
 so we now have the highest of 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.520
 aggressiveness of the responses an engine of 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.140
 couple still manageable even on 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.000
 ice absolutely has me now 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.800
 put on sport with sport 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.140
 electronics intervenes a little more 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.000
 late so you have to start 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.820
 work a little with the steering because 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.120
 however the machine if you put it down 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.360
 he swerves slightly so you need to 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.590
 however say the understeer oversteer 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.750
 stone the oversteer with the 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.680
 counter-steering see that you need to 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.800
 to counter-position a little but then 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.500
 electronics intervenes immediately if irons 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.260
 over 100 when you have it be certain 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.140
 corner helps you immediately now 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.880
 we detach that is we keep we keep it 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.819
 sport of the ma disconnect completely 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.159
 the electronics then we remove the sp 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.409
 the car in this case yes 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:16.469
 but also here with this transfer 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:19.680
 immediate torque between the rear 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:21.780
 front becomes very easy because you 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.760
 helps the moment i amy too 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.019
 oversteer that brings more traction 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.269
 on the front as in this case 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.750
 we have more traction on the front and 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:33.510
 then return to the back 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.400
 if you have some oversteer and 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.469
 understeer keeps you on the other hand 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.950
 on the back then it helps a lot 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:43.439
 and it's a really great system 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.109
 smart so if it lets you 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:48.650
 drive the car a little bit so 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:51.150
 sportsman on these slippery terrains 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.439
 compared to a rear wheel drive 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.909
 there than in most customers 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:56.609
 in the world 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:58.680
 in these power levels it goes to 4 4 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.590
 you are having fun anyway you are having fun 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.590
 however, it must be said that the machine 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.480
 it is very very safe we â€‹â€‹remember we have 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.790
 four 110 horses 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.640
 you want to turbo and so it's enough 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.860
 awesome as a car of the 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.640
 generally be manoeuvrable under conditions 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.820
 low to arezzo 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.180
 thank you very much alex thanks to you at 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.870
 next 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.870
 then yes thank you
