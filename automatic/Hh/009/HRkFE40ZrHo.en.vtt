about the new year maybe a little higher

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.230 
about the new year maybe a little higher
and<00:00:15.929> they<00:00:16.109> are<00:00:16.289> connected<00:00:16.770> by<00:00:17.190> Bungie<00:00:17.789> which

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
and they are connected by Bungie which

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.769 
and they are connected by Bungie which
course<00:00:18.930> gives<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.320> its<00:00:19.470> name<00:00:20.180> the<00:00:21.180> bungee<00:00:21.539> runs

through<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.020> small<00:00:22.199> pulley<00:00:22.680> that's<00:00:22.980> connected

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
through a small pulley that's connected

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.970 
through a small pulley that's connected
to<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.760> chest<00:00:24.029> harness<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.720> as<00:00:24.960> he<00:00:25.199> lifts<00:00:25.560> one

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
to the chest harness and as he lifts one

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.210 
to the chest harness and as he lifts one
leg<00:00:26.279> or<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.580> other<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.630> ascender<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.439> raised

leg or the other that ascender is raised

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.020 
leg or the other that ascender is raised
by<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.609> bungee<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.590> takes<00:00:31.590> up<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.949> slack<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
by the bungee and takes up the slack the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.110 
by the bungee and takes up the slack the
ascender<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.719> his<00:00:34.200> left<00:00:34.530> hand<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.100> going<00:00:35.850> to

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
ascender in his left hand is going to

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:44.240 
ascender in his left hand is going to
attach<00:00:36.630> his<00:00:36.930> saddle<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.649> rope<00:00:42.770> on<00:00:43.770> any

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
attach his saddle to the rope on any

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.360 
attach his saddle to the rope on any
rope<00:00:44.579> Walker<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.180> takes<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.660> stroke<00:00:46.020> or<00:00:46.200> two<00:00:46.440> to

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
rope Walker it takes a stroke or two to

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.310 
rope Walker it takes a stroke or two to
get<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.700> Rope<00:00:47.960> feeding<00:00:48.960> through

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
get the Rope feeding through

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.920 
get the Rope feeding through
so<00:00:50.829> it'd<00:00:51.010> be<00:00:51.250> a<00:00:51.280> little<00:00:51.820> bit<00:00:52.090> slow<00:00:52.420> to<00:00:52.480> start

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
so it'd be a little bit slow to start

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.870 
so it'd be a little bit slow to start
with<00:00:53.200> but<00:00:53.440> then<00:00:53.680> he'll<00:00:53.920> who<00:00:54.340> get<00:00:54.520> the<00:00:54.670> rope

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
with but then he'll who get the rope

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:04.320 
with but then he'll who get the rope
feeding<00:00:55.329> and<00:00:55.450> take<00:00:55.989> off

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.010 

pantene<00:01:05.320> he's<00:01:05.650> using<00:01:06.100> that's<00:01:06.480> not<00:01:07.480> feeding

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
pantene he's using that's not feeding

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.510 
pantene he's using that's not feeding
and<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:08.380> reason<00:01:08.710> is<00:01:08.860> there's<00:01:09.070> no<00:01:09.250> weight<00:01:09.490> on

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
and the reason is there's no weight on

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.690 
and the reason is there's no weight on
the<00:01:09.790> rope<00:01:10.230> but<00:01:11.230> as<00:01:11.380> he<00:01:11.530> gets<00:01:11.740> up<00:01:11.920> higher<00:01:12.220> it'll

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
the rope but as he gets up higher it'll

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:27.490 
the rope but as he gets up higher it'll
start<00:01:13.060> feeding<00:01:14.340> he'll<00:01:15.340> be<00:01:15.550> taking<00:01:15.970> off

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:36.020 

there<00:01:27.980> it<00:01:28.160> is

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:02:05.480 

British<00:01:36.750> move

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.429 

and<00:02:05.909> then<00:02:06.060> pretty<00:02:06.390> close<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.049> thigh<00:02:07.380> in

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
and then pretty close to the thigh in

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:46.450 
and then pretty close to the thigh in
porn

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.540 

nicely<00:02:47.360> done
