00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:08.790
 Hello Veronica Kravchuk with you 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.130
 I promised earlier I created my video blog in 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.799
 which I will share with you secrets 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.809
 beauty is not only external but also internally 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.539
 Perhaps today I will make an introductory part 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.439
 I will tell you more about what will happen in 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.150
 my blogs 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.460
 I will divide my blog into several parts 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.269
 each of which will have its own separate 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.640
 theme 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.279
 I think it's important to focus on something. 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.219
 certain than interfere with everything in a bunch 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.950
 I will focus on drying the body because 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.969
 it is not enough for a woman to lose weight 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.550
 I want to save 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.129
 body relief lined up and at the same time 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.190
 toned up recently I dried my 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.469
 the organism and instead of the three that I set 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.800
 months of hard work on myself i 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.960
 did it in just 4 weeks so 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.230
 tell you about my technique 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.449
 but a little body drying is complicated 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.570
 a process that can be performed no more 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.510
 twice a year as she is very dangerous 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.240
 if you follow certain rules than 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.090
 it is different from normal weight loss 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.689
 using diets starting to dry at first 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.659
 turn 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.869
 actively monitor the fact that how much and how 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.909
 we eat the basic rule eats need 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.390
 five times a day in small portions 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.170
 the size of your fist can't starve like 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.759
 during the diet squirrels fats carbohydrates and so 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.500
 next we will have certain 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.900
 periods of time must necessarily 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.909
 attend sport for those who do not 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.430
 allows health or maybe time 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.310
 they will have to do it every day 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.950
 gain strength to devote time 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.939
 sports at least 3 times a week 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.560
 also need to follow the aquatic diet 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.079
 depending on growth and build drink 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.200
 enough water for your 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.899
 organism on average is two and a half 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.710
 three liters a day probably with this 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.630
 global theme I'll start the water the most 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.210
 habitual substance on earth which 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.060
 accompanies each 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.940
 the line of our life four years ago I 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.229
 got a prize on 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.160
 Scientific Practical Conference on Chemistry 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.450
 this very topic of mine was water 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.300
 labs I studied different water 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.050
 starting from distilled and ending 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.420
 melt water 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.380
 which allows me to do certain 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.450
 scientific conclusions what kind of water do I need to drink 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.700
 I'm afraid without nightly terms of stories about 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.040
 the fact that water from the memory that it is generally for 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.560
 such a substance bearing physical and 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.530
 chemical character will tell you only about 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.470
 that we drink every day and 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.180
 what water is really useful water from 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.500
 under the crane 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.590
 David is the worst thing that seems to you 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.390
 at first glance, but the water is purified almost 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.519
 distilled which sell in 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.980
 big bottles total dead she 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.470
 empty you are watered with such water and they 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.870
 stop growing this experiment i 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.030
 spent three months in that time flower 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.160
 scorching this water did not rise by a centimeter 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.350
 while flower by this ordinary 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.480
 tap water rose by two 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.640
 centimeter 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.590
 flower watered thawed grew by four 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.540
 centimeter 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.260
 what is melt water is that substance 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:18.019
 which is from solid aggregate 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.090
 states goes into liquid I would 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.950
 called such water magical she would 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.160
 could cure my stomach in due time 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.790
 don't believe you can make sure yourself and 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.709
 magical properties of freezing 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.200
 mineral water without putting there 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.360
 small product with 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.769
 silver ribs kill harmful 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:41.650
 microorganisms if you take plain water i 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:45.370
 it is advised to drink only a few species it 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.069
 evian or tel for someone this water 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.010
 it may seem expensive but believe me 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.980
 what you beat at times more important than what you 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.680
 eat water take part in all 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.560
 biochemical processes in the body and 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.989
 pour dead water or water 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.110
 chlorine and so on, just apply 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.239
 harm to your body's natural water 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.239
 contains the necessary composition 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.790
 trace elements while in normal 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.720
 bottle water add them 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.310
 artificially 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:21.310
 who needs extra chemistry comparability than 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.340
 you fill the car your cars 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.979
 better and faster will drive on gasoline 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.960
 or diesel than diesel so 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.330
 start with water go for what you 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.570
 drink and drink in the morning 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.910
 a glass of water with a slice of lemon it 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.270
 slightly increase your acidity 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:43.870
 Stomach Lemon Vitamin 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:46.930
 c is a powerful antioxidant and 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.810
 immunoregulator but about what and how much 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.039
 need to eat i will tell you next 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.590
 your blog 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.610
 and with you I was Veronica Kravchuk 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.389
 observe 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.389
 water diet
