attack stuff he was absolutely at the

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.770 
attack stuff he was absolutely at the

electronic textures and how he
manipulates<00:02:12.510> sound<00:02:12.840> uses<00:02:13.380> or<00:02:13.530> something

nisha<00:02:13.980> performance<00:02:14.640> as<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:14.940> starter<00:02:15.140> maybe<00:02:16.140> we

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
nisha performance as a starter maybe we

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.559 
nisha performance as a starter maybe we
record<00:02:16.890> this<00:02:17.100> twice<00:02:17.580> as<00:02:17.790> fast<00:02:18.030> so<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:18.390> we

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
record this twice as fast so that we

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.600 
record this twice as fast so that we
could<00:02:18.690> slow<00:02:19.020> it<00:02:19.050> all<00:02:19.440> down<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:20.069> pitch<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.430> down

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
could slow it all down and pitch it down

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.130 
could slow it all down and pitch it down
then<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.880> will<00:02:20.970> be<00:02:21.090> live<00:02:21.270> orchestra<00:02:21.750> at<00:02:21.990> Abbey

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
then it will be live orchestra at Abbey

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.160 
then it will be live orchestra at Abbey
