00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.510
 the other friend or the floor of the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.460
 people who lose their heads a little 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.100

 all faults a little two - step 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.229
 that obviously have the old one 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.270
 way to face a topic that could 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.070
