00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.670
 ae 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:20.710
 the nokia lumia 1020 or nokia lumia 1520 a 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.890
 It's simple, no, it's not any of that. 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.259
 I have been there for three weeks with nokia lumia 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.760
 1521 already has a node that illuminates 1020 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.529
 I asked for the advice from nokia me 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.910
 Send me to see if I could answer 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:36.010
 to that doubt and see if I see my 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.129
 1,020 to count 1520 after three 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.580
 weeks I'm still in serious doubt 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.589
 because the nokia lumia 1.020 it has a 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.570
 more compact size and gives it to you 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:49.120
 hold calmly with one hand 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.659
 it has a camera that is phenomenal is 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.360
 best mobile camera that already exists 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:57.460
 nokia lumia 1520 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.250
 He's big I like cell phones. 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.939
 big only he can not 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.979
 operate it with one hand and with ease 

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:09.729
 it has a quad-core processor 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:12.220
 while the 1,020 has one of the then occurs 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.110
 probably it will receive updates 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.200
 for longer than having a 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.200
 better performance in heavier games 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.869
 being that you want to do the tip then 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.939
 It's if you want a camera above everything. 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.850
 nokia lumia 1020 if you want one 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.999
 more powerful smartphone with big screen 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.770
 and giving up a camera not so 

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:34.920
 excellent but a good first nokia 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.479
