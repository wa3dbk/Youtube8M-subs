00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.189

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.189

 what is a new graphical engine 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.510
 to simplify for those who do not know 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.909

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.560
 what is it like a predator son I 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.579
 think you understood the the the 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.590
 graphics card i believe she did not 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:53.260
 changed since mb2i sipa / west-france 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.569
 there is also beating 4 1 which will come out in 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.540
 2013 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:01.870
 From what else she had 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.470
 full of players who had built with 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.270
 spit on the black hawks of the coast 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.220
 montauban pq cause of the graphics engine 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.810
 then to raw milk he had believed he 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.310
 was going to change in fact we did not change 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.410
 so there on the budget 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:18.269
 they changed that I think they have 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:20.790
 changed here we have no information 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.370
 we just know maybe it will be a 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.010
 trilogy so she too her three 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.920
 different campaigns but that you know 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.600
 not even at all so we do not have 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.140
 too much information will give you more 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.260
 information about water flow 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.560
 next 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.480
 this is not much to tell you 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.000
 apart from the well made heads by a 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.220
 player from the same country so he had to 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.720
 hold five this game I could talk five 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.910
 minutes perfectly this is a 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.010
 petrocco the information that I have but 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.520
 here I have a little anyway for 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.919
 you talk about 2004 I think the law 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.129
 laws you just have to type on google 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:01.199
 she wanted 4 and I think that 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:03.509
 and more information you go 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.840
 also ask to look at pictures but 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:08.480
 most sites are 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.460
 but offered him the good French 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.820
 production puts a little boring I think 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.650
 that all misdeeds not that's what 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:19.310
 can the translations only work 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.680
 not so good what is not the nose 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.620
 is prefaced by a super good score 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.290
 it was just as well here please 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.830
 video excitement state this is it's 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.380
 good 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.150
 we were still brancion of 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.980
 league 2 for a good life 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.320

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.030
 interest but here is a lot 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.730
 Interest in play is someone of 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:45.230
 background of 42 received those good impossible but 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:46.820
 in addition some 75 king it's really 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.050
 hard to make an absurd law on this 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.300
 hair more and more his friends 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.070
 quiet the video ends in 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.430
 it is to have given this video 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.849
 an associative map because of the business 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.199
 of ten of the eleven horatio go 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:01.929

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:05.279
 comment go there but we end up 

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:05.279
