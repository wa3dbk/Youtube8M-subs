00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.700
 paints enamels accessories this is 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.230
 just an idea and a simple quickie 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.160
 What am I doing to you? 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:13.440
 jars before using them open blogs 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.150
 so that air was discharged because if not 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.860
 they can exploit them 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.930
 that's a bone was what they told me 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.600
 lots of the buy so the 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.880
 they share that set with you too 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.530
 the rinses and try to remove the 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.240
 sticker but how are we going to put it? 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.880
 to decorate it then we are not going to 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.860
 fill in study facilitate what we are going to 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.610
 to do is fill it 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.970
 rabbit boy kate himself is not 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.970
 cleansed 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.579
 and you can not fill out I would need 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.579
 like 34 laps of these 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.170
 and now what I'm going to do is paste the 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.260
 heart 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.720
 with the gun 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.260
 and we only see where the sticker is 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.260
 okay 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.760
 Just like that 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:16.049
 and there is super cool is the lid 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.970
 Now what I'm going to do is I just 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:22.500
 cut a little ribbon and measure it and 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.560
 of the size of the lid vial 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.250
 and we are going to paste 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.250
 all this way around 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.909
 and as you can see this is a 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:47.450
 research putting the bar for 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:52.129
 all sides around rather I put two 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.690
 times and with desire and brick to 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.140
 to be able to paste what has just burned 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.140
 fingers 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.849
 then we will have something like that 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.320
 something like that 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:11.130
 super easy and fast so they are not 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.250
 move ribbon you can put all 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.990
 I explain them 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.209
 with sweet anything that was 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:22.070
 a flow of fruits can even make 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.070
 shakes on this 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:35.730
 and ready the cover this magazine can 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:38.380
 decorate the food you wish 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:41.550
 if you prefer like this you see course 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:44.100
 for me and it 's like that 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.360
 now if you do not want it or the 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.360
 they want to decorate 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.180
 like at the fusion table or have a dinner 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:57.449
 romantic or that seven for the kids 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.449
 can put facts as decoration 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.630
 and be a filter 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.160
 and what I 'm going to do is put 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.160
 hearts everywhere 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:21.389
 and well well now from our jars 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:25.680
 we have a few I do not know if the lid 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:28.230
 if you prefer and this is another idea 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:33.600

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:35.850

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:57.000
 he just put the inside part in the 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:00.090
 bottom part there is cotton because since 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.730

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:06.180
