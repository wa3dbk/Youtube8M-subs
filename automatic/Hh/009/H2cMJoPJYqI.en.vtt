00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 
so it can last forever

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.250 
so it can last forever
well<00:00:33.520> maybe<00:00:33.760> not<00:00:34.030> forever<00:00:34.300> but<00:00:34.750> I'm<00:00:34.870> trying<00:00:35.170> to

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
well maybe not forever but I'm trying to

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.810 
well maybe not forever but I'm trying to
get<00:00:35.440> a<00:00:35.470> million<00:00:35.950> miles<00:00:36.190> out<00:00:36.520> of<00:00:36.640> my<00:00:36.760> toyota<00:00:38.820> now

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
get a million miles out of my toyota now

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.280 
get a million miles out of my toyota now
the<00:00:39.910> first<00:00:40.210> critical<00:00:40.480> maintenance<00:00:40.840> is

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
the first critical maintenance is

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.020 
the first critical maintenance is
changing<00:00:41.739> your<00:00:41.860> engine<00:00:42.220> oil<00:00:42.430> and<00:00:42.610> filter

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
changing your engine oil and filter

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.900 
changing your engine oil and filter
regularly<00:00:43.239> now<00:00:44.230> I<00:00:44.260> use<00:00:44.590> conventional<00:00:44.980> oil<00:00:45.610> in

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
regularly now I use conventional oil in

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.000 
regularly now I use conventional oil in
my<00:00:46.330> engine<00:00:46.690> when<00:00:46.809> I<00:00:46.870> change<00:00:47.200> it<00:00:47.410> so<00:00:47.530> I<00:00:47.559> do<00:00:47.710> it

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
my engine when I change it so I do it

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.170 
my engine when I change it so I do it
every<00:00:48.220> 3,000<00:00:48.970> miles<00:00:49.120> or<00:00:49.450> twice<00:00:49.990> a<00:00:50.200> year

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
every 3,000 miles or twice a year

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.030 
every 3,000 miles or twice a year
engines<00:00:52.180> are<00:00:52.300> very<00:00:52.330> expensive<00:00:53.170> but<00:00:53.590> oil<00:00:53.920> is

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
engines are very expensive but oil is

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.030 
engines are very expensive but oil is
pretty<00:00:54.220> cheap<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.780> with<00:00:56.050> modern<00:00:56.440> variable

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
pretty cheap and with modern variable

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.680 
pretty cheap and with modern variable
valve<00:00:57.280> timing<00:00:57.430> engines<00:00:58.120> it's<00:00:58.300> even<00:00:58.540> more

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
valve timing engines it's even more

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.350 
valve timing engines it's even more
important<00:00:59.200> to<00:00:59.290> keep<00:00:59.410> the<00:00:59.590> oil<00:00:59.740> clean<00:01:00.190> if<00:01:01.120> you

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
important to keep the oil clean if you

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.210 
important to keep the oil clean if you
let<00:01:01.540> the<00:01:01.690> oil<00:01:01.720> get<00:01:02.110> dirty<00:01:02.410> and<00:01:02.620> clog<00:01:02.829> up<00:01:03.040> these

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
let the oil get dirty and clog up these

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.550 
let the oil get dirty and clog up these
variable<00:01:03.820> valve<00:01:04.030> timing<00:01:04.150> cams<00:01:04.780> it's<00:01:05.380> gonna

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
variable valve timing cams it's gonna

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.440 
variable valve timing cams it's gonna
cost<00:01:05.800> you<00:01:06.009> thousands<00:01:06.550> of<00:01:06.670> dollars<00:01:07.060> to<00:01:07.240> fix

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
cost you thousands of dollars to fix

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.719 
cost you thousands of dollars to fix
them<00:01:07.890> now<00:01:08.890> if<00:01:09.040> you<00:01:09.130> want<00:01:09.340> to<00:01:09.430> go<00:01:09.490> further

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
them now if you want to go further

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.910 
them now if you want to go further
between<00:01:10.149> oil<00:01:10.300> changes<00:01:10.479> you<00:01:11.290> can<00:01:11.410> use<00:01:11.560> fully

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
between oil changes you can use fully

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.940 
between oil changes you can use fully
synthetic<00:01:12.250> oil<00:01:13.290> then<00:01:14.290> you<00:01:14.320> can<00:01:14.590> go<00:01:14.710> eight

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
synthetic oil then you can go eight

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.440 
synthetic oil then you can go eight
thousand<00:01:15.460> miles<00:01:15.640> in<00:01:15.880> between<00:01:15.910> the<00:01:16.300> oil

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
thousand miles in between the oil

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.590 
thousand miles in between the oil
changes<00:01:17.700> synthetic<00:01:18.700> oils<00:01:19.030> your<00:01:19.149> excellent

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
changes synthetic oils your excellent

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.210 
changes synthetic oils your excellent
oils<00:01:19.840> but<00:01:20.050> realize<00:01:20.380> that<00:01:20.410> costs<00:01:20.920> three<00:01:21.070> to

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
oils but realize that costs three to

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.760 
oils but realize that costs three to
four<00:01:21.429> times<00:01:21.670> as<00:01:21.850> much<00:01:22.030> as<00:01:22.210> regular<00:01:22.660> oil<00:01:22.690> so<00:01:23.440> the

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
four times as much as regular oil so the

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.150 
four times as much as regular oil so the
choice<00:01:23.979> is<00:01:24.220> yours<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.530> when<00:01:26.649> it<00:01:26.740> comes<00:01:26.950> to

choice is yours and when it comes to
what<00:01:27.310> wait<00:01:27.580> oil<00:01:27.910> to<00:01:28.030> use<00:01:28.179> just<00:01:28.600> use<00:01:28.750> it<00:01:28.990> all

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
what wait oil to use just use it all

what wait oil to use just use it all
that<00:01:29.350> your<00:01:29.530> engine<00:01:29.830> suggests<00:01:30.280> in<00:01:30.520> this<00:01:30.670> case

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
that your engine suggests in this case

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.620 
that your engine suggests in this case
it's<00:01:31.720> 10w30<00:01:32.520> all<00:01:33.520> owners<00:01:33.940> manual<00:01:34.360> tell<00:01:34.539> you

what kind of oil to use now the second
most<00:01:37.720> important<00:01:38.289> thing<00:01:38.319> is<00:01:38.679> servicing<00:01:39.610> your

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
most important thing is servicing your

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.540 
most important thing is servicing your
automatic<00:01:40.060> transmission<00:01:41.100> now<00:01:42.100> this<00:01:42.280> is<00:01:42.429> an

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
automatic transmission now this is an

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.240 
automatic transmission now this is an
older<00:01:42.850> car<00:01:43.030> 294<00:01:43.690> Celica<00:01:44.259> too<00:01:44.649> good<00:01:44.800> idea<00:01:45.100> to

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
older car 294 Celica too good idea to

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.529 
older car 294 Celica too good idea to
change<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.789> fluid<00:01:46.000> in<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.390> transmission

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
change the fluid in the transmission

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.180 
change the fluid in the transmission
every<00:01:47.319> 30,000<00:01:48.100> miles<00:01:49.530> being<00:01:50.530> a<00:01:50.649> Toyota<00:01:51.100> I

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
every 30,000 miles being a Toyota I

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.040 
every 30,000 miles being a Toyota I
really<00:01:51.459> don't<00:01:51.640> have<00:01:51.789> a<00:01:51.910> filter<00:01:52.149> in<00:01:52.420> it<00:01:52.450> so<00:01:52.990> you

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
really don't have a filter in it so you

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.480 
really don't have a filter in it so you
don't<00:01:53.229> have<00:01:53.289> to<00:01:53.440> change<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:53.740> filter<00:01:54.190> but<00:01:54.399> if

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
don't have to change the filter but if

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.340 
don't have to change the filter but if
your<00:01:54.610> car<00:01:54.850> is<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:55.060> filter<00:01:55.509> change<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:55.990> filter

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
your car is a filter change the filter

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.520 
your car is a filter change the filter
too<00:01:57.360> but<00:01:58.360> if<00:01:58.450> you<00:01:58.569> have<00:01:58.660> a<00:01:58.750> later<00:01:58.959> model<00:01:59.229> car

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
too but if you have a later model car

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.550 
too but if you have a later model car
like<00:01:59.709> this<00:01:59.920> 2007<00:02:00.880> Toyota<00:02:01.420> Camry<00:02:01.899> check<00:02:02.380> this

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
like this 2007 Toyota Camry check this

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.639 
like this 2007 Toyota Camry check this
out<00:02:02.800> it<00:02:03.640> uses<00:02:04.030> fully<00:02:04.300> synthetic<00:02:04.599> fluid<00:02:05.170> as<00:02:05.380> it

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
out it uses fully synthetic fluid as it

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.570 
out it uses fully synthetic fluid as it
says<00:02:05.890> no<00:02:06.729> need<00:02:07.030> to<00:02:07.270> change<00:02:07.539> a<00:02:07.869> TF<00:02:08.369> under<00:02:09.369> normal

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
says no need to change a TF under normal

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.809 
says no need to change a TF under normal
driving<00:02:09.789> conditions<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:12.190> unless<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.610> live<00:02:12.790> in

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
driving conditions so unless you live in

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.760 
driving conditions so unless you live in
