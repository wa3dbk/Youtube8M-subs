00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.960 
what that does alright so that only did
half<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.720> heart<00:01:09.960> as<00:01:10.530> usual<00:01:11.250> that's<00:01:11.760> usually

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
half a heart as usual that's usually

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.510 
half a heart as usual that's usually
what<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.330> does<00:01:12.710> but<00:01:13.710> once<00:01:13.950> again<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.189> can't

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
what it does but once again you can't

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.340 
what it does but once again you can't
attack<00:01:14.670> other<00:01:15.090> people<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.689> I've<00:01:16.140> already

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
attack other people and I've already

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.289 
attack other people and I've already
gotten<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.860> some<00:01:17.070> combat<00:01:17.430> situations<00:01:18.119> with

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
gotten in some combat situations with

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.450 
gotten in some combat situations with
this<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.930> works<00:01:19.110> really<00:01:19.439> well<00:01:19.619> because

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
this and it works really well because

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.630 
this and it works really well because
you<00:01:20.880> can<00:01:21.060> hit<00:01:21.270> them<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.750> then<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:23.070> just<00:01:23.280> shift

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
you can hit them and then you just shift

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.730 
you can hit them and then you just shift
they<00:01:24.330> might<00:01:24.630> be<00:01:24.780> trying<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.140> hit<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.650> you

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
they might be trying to hit you and you

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.560 
they might be trying to hit you and you
can<00:01:25.890> kind<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:26.280> go<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:26.939> out<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.119> shift

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
can kind of just go in and out of shift

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.380 
can kind of just go in and out of shift
mode<00:01:27.869> like<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.619> attack<00:01:28.950> them<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:30.150> only

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
mode like that and attack them the only

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.789 
mode like that and attack them the only
thing<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.720> can't<00:01:31.049> really<00:01:31.200> chase<00:01:31.560> after

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
thing is you can't really chase after

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.800 
thing is you can't really chase after
them<00:01:32.100> while<00:01:32.280> you're<00:01:32.430> shifting<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.600> yeah

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
them while you're shifting but yeah

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.719 
them while you're shifting but yeah
overall<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.320> think<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.619> kid<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:34.890> pretty<00:01:35.280> good

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
overall I think this kid is pretty good

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.609 
overall I think this kid is pretty good
I<00:01:35.970> just<00:01:36.509> want<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.720> see<00:01:36.900> going<00:01:37.140> hit<00:01:37.380> me<00:01:37.500> with

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
I just want to see going hit me with

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.899

that<00:01:37.650> iron<00:01:37.950> sword<00:01:38.310> once<00:01:38.520> again<00:01:40.280> yeah<00:01:41.280> only<00:01:41.549> one

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
that iron sword once again yeah only one

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.330 
that iron sword once again yeah only one
heart<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.570> would<00:01:43.170> test<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.530> out<00:01:43.649> on<00:01:43.710> diamond

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
heart so I would test it out on diamond

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.249 
heart so I would test it out on diamond
but<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.640> course<00:01:44.850> will<00:01:45.540> not<00:01:45.689> be<00:01:45.840> able<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.079> find

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
but of course will not be able to find

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.920 
but of course will not be able to find
that<00:01:46.470> until<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.829> feast<00:01:47.040> but<00:01:47.700> yeah<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.240> my

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
that until the feast but yeah so my

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.710 
that until the feast but yeah so my
conclusion<00:01:49.170> for<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.670> pretty<00:01:51.119> good<00:01:51.420> kit

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
conclusion for this is a pretty good kit

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.499 
conclusion for this is a pretty good kit
only<00:01:52.439> taking<00:01:52.829> one<00:01:53.250> heart<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.670> damage<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.180> great

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
only taking one heart of damage is great
