I've<00:00:33.000> had<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.239> camera<00:00:33.630> for<00:00:33.780> roughly<00:00:34.079> about<00:00:34.260> a

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
I've had this camera for roughly about a

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
it takes wonderful pictures one of the

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.619 
it takes wonderful pictures one of the
main<00:00:40.050> reasons<00:00:40.410> why<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.620> got<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:41.219> along<00:00:42.059> with<00:00:42.360> the

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
main reasons why I got it along with the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.840 
main reasons why I got it along with the
fact<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.290> will<00:00:45.920> shoot<00:00:46.920> such<00:00:47.219> clarity<00:00:47.550> and

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
fact that it will shoot such clarity and

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.510 
fact that it will shoot such clarity and
the<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.390> screen<00:00:48.719> itself<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.320> extremely<00:00:50.070> clear

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
the the screen itself is extremely clear

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.060 
the the screen itself is extremely clear
is<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.239> fact<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.570> one<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.289> can<00:00:52.469> add<00:00:52.680> an

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
is the fact that one you can add an

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.970 
is the fact that one you can add an
external<00:00:53.670> flash<00:00:53.910> um<00:00:54.329> if<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:55.020> ever<00:00:55.170> feel<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
external flash um if I ever feel the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.350 
external flash um if I ever feel the
need<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.160> do<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.760> on<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> point-and-shoot

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
need to do that on a point-and-shoot

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.779 
need to do that on a point-and-shoot
very<00:00:58.109> rare<00:00:58.350> since<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.649> do<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.070> Canon<00:00:59.340> 50d

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789

very rare since I do have the Canon 50d
that<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.059> normally<00:01:00.120> use<00:01:00.539> for<00:01:00.570> photos<00:01:01.160> is<00:01:02.160> also

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
that I normally use for photos is also

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.429 
that I normally use for photos is also
the<00:01:02.550> fact<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:03.030> little<00:01:03.840> thing<00:01:04.140> can<00:01:04.350> also

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
the fact that this little thing can also

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.160 
the fact that this little thing can also
shoot<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.010> wrong<00:01:05.600> which<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:06.810> any

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
as a hobby or as a profession knows that

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.719 
as a hobby or as a profession knows that
raw<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.119> one<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.450> greater<00:01:13.610> formats<00:01:14.610> that

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
raw is one of the greater formats that

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.460 
raw is one of the greater formats that
you<00:01:14.939> shoot<00:01:15.210> with<00:01:15.360> because<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.049> has<00:01:16.140> greater

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
you shoot with because it has greater

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.740 
you shoot with because it has greater
editing<00:01:17.009> capabilities<00:01:17.670> instead<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.630> just

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
editing capabilities instead of just

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.550 
editing capabilities instead of just
shooting<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.110> regular<00:01:19.409> JPEG<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.310> my<00:01:20.490> opinion

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
shooting in regular JPEG in my opinion

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.310

once you power it up it comes out like
that<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:51.540> screen<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.590> swivel<00:01:53.159> screen<00:01:53.220> you

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
that the screen is a swivel screen you

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.920 
that the screen is a swivel screen you
pop<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.939> up<00:01:54.000> like<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.420> then<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.810> can

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
pop it up like this and then you can

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.510 
pop it up like this and then you can
swivel<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.860> can't<00:01:56.100> leave<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.340> like<00:01:56.490> that

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
swivel it you can't leave it like that

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.800 
swivel it you can't leave it like that
or<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.689> can<00:01:58.909> and<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.090> ends<00:02:00.329> up<00:02:00.420> being<00:02:00.479> just

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
or you can and it ends up being just

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.480 
or you can and it ends up being just
like<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.110> normal<00:02:01.469> camera<00:02:01.710> with<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.219> screen

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
like a normal camera with the screen

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.190 
like a normal camera with the screen
that<00:02:02.969> was<00:02:03.119> one<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.420> big<00:02:03.570> additions<00:02:03.990> from

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
that was one of the big additions from

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.130 
that was one of the big additions from
the<00:02:04.380> canon<00:02:04.710> g10<00:02:05.119> up<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.450> g11<00:02:06.600> was<00:02:07.049> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
the canon g10 up to the g11 was the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.040 
the canon g10 up to the g11 was the
swivel<00:02:07.439> screen<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:08.429> megapixel<00:02:09.300> resolution

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050

10 I believe was a 13 or 14 megapixel
this<00:02:14.330> is<00:02:14.480> actually<00:02:14.930> a<00:02:15.110> 10<00:02:15.500> megapixel<00:02:16.300> camera

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
this is actually a 10 megapixel camera
