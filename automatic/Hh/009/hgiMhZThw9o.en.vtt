year the only way we can really combat
that<00:01:17.950> is<00:01:18.040> by<00:01:18.160> having<00:01:18.340> a<00:01:18.520> Siemens<00:01:18.880> product<00:01:19.210> that

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.969 
that is by having a Siemens product that
is<00:01:19.479> tightly<00:01:19.780> integrated<00:01:20.350> from<00:01:20.800> one

is tightly integrated from one
department<00:01:21.100> to<00:01:21.430> the<00:01:21.520> neck<00:01:21.759> this<00:01:21.910> means<00:01:22.210> that

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
department to the neck this means that

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.969 
department to the neck this means that
all<00:01:22.780> those<00:01:22.930> departments<00:01:23.259> can<00:01:23.560> share<00:01:23.830> that

all those departments can share that

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.040 
all those departments can share that
data<00:01:24.190> and<00:01:24.640> so<00:01:25.030> it<00:01:25.090> will<00:01:25.210> work<00:01:25.450> to<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:25.869> same

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.389 
manufacture and test the parts will then
appear<00:02:08.200> in<00:02:08.260> the<00:02:08.380> race<00:02:08.619> phase<00:02:08.920> where<00:02:09.250> they'll

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
appear in the race phase where they'll

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.310 
appear in the race phase where they'll
be<00:02:09.459> assembled<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:10.540> that's<00:02:10.720> ultimately<00:02:10.869> where

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
be assembled and that's ultimately where

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.940 
be assembled and that's ultimately where
final<00:02:11.770> car<00:02:11.980> assembly<00:02:12.370> happens<00:02:13.709> well<00:02:14.709> from<00:02:14.830> an

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
final car assembly happens well from an

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.710 
final car assembly happens well from an
engineering<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.520> technical<00:02:15.910> perspective<00:02:16.240> a

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
engineering and technical perspective a

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.660 
engineering and technical perspective a
Formula<00:02:17.080> One<00:02:17.110> car<00:02:17.380> is<00:02:17.530> basically<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:18.100> prototype

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
Formula One car is basically a prototype

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.850 
Formula One car is basically a prototype
so<00:02:18.880> at<00:02:19.000> each<00:02:19.120> corn<00:02:19.420> free<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.930> car<00:02:20.170> is<00:02:20.470> never<00:02:20.709> in

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
so at each corn free the car is never in

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.670 
so at each corn free the car is never in
the<00:02:20.980> same<00:02:21.160> configuration<00:02:21.550> twice<00:02:22.240> so<00:02:22.660> we<00:02:23.530> have

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
the same configuration twice so we have

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.080 
the same configuration twice so we have
to<00:02:23.830> keep<00:02:24.010> evolving<00:02:24.190> we<00:02:24.640> have<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.940> keep

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
to keep evolving we have to keep

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.820 
to keep evolving we have to keep
developing<00:02:25.209> to<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.870> different<00:02:26.230> demands<00:02:26.709> of

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
developing to the different demands of

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.580 
developing to the different demands of
different<00:02:27.300> your<00:02:28.300> requirements<00:02:29.050> of<00:02:29.170> each<00:02:29.260> corn

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
different your requirements of each corn

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.100 
different your requirements of each corn
Prix<00:02:29.770> circuit<00:02:30.010> have<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:31.270> then<00:02:31.420> if<00:02:31.660> you<00:02:31.870> work

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
Prix circuit have and then if you work

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.620 
Prix circuit have and then if you work
collectively<00:02:32.860> you<00:02:33.220> know<00:02:33.610> to<00:02:33.700> deliver

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
collectively you know to deliver

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.280 
collectively you know to deliver
solutions<00:02:34.989> then<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:37.150> can<00:02:37.330> succeed<00:02:37.750> I<00:02:38.050> think

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
solutions then you can succeed I think

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.260 
solutions then you can succeed I think
local<00:02:38.410> racing<00:02:38.950> has<00:02:39.100> been<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.340> classic<00:02:39.910> example
