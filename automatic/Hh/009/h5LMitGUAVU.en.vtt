00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.810 
will hold it a little bit better but
it's<00:00:42.690> usually<00:00:42.899> not<00:00:43.110> necessary<00:00:43.800> but<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.550> case

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.560

and then I'm going to take about the
same<00:01:53.600> amount<00:01:53.900> of<00:01:54.290> hair<00:01:57.490> that<00:01:58.490> I<00:01:58.550> did<00:01:58.850> on<00:01:59.000> the

so<00:02:25.680> I'm<00:02:25.740> going<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:25.980> use<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.280> biggest

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
so I'm going to use the biggest

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.050 
so I'm going to use the biggest
extension<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.300> will<00:02:27.420> come<00:02:27.630> in<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.140> pack<00:02:28.350> on

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
extension that will come in the pack on

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.950 
extension that will come in the pack on
this<00:02:30.060> third<00:02:30.360> row

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.760

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.250 

that<00:02:41.400> way<00:02:41.520> if<00:02:41.670> your<00:02:41.790> client<00:02:42.210> back<00:02:42.690> combs<00:02:42.990> her

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260

that way if your client back combs her
hair<00:02:43.320> at<00:02:43.590> all<00:02:43.710> that<00:02:44.190> she<00:02:44.940> won't<00:02:45.120> touch<00:02:45.360> this

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
extension when she styling him then I'm

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.720 
extension when she styling him then I'm
going<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.470> take<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.890> next<00:02:53.160> section<00:02:53.490> but<00:02:53.700> I

and I'm gonna be using the medium

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.850 
and I'm gonna be using the medium
extension<00:03:36.190> on<00:03:36.370> this<00:03:36.550> part<00:03:37.110> not<00:03:38.110> it's<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.590> little

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
extension on this part not it's a little

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.710 
extension on this part not it's a little
bit<00:03:38.980> smaller<00:03:39.310> than<00:03:39.520> the<00:03:39.670> biggest<00:03:40.090> piece<00:03:42.720> I'm

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
bit smaller than the biggest piece I'm

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:53.780 
bit smaller than the biggest piece I'm
just<00:03:43.930> gonna<00:03:44.050> clip<00:03:44.380> it<00:03:44.410> on

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.730

and<00:03:57.270> obviously<00:03:58.270> you<00:03:58.420> would<00:03:58.510> match<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:58.930> colors

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
and obviously you would match the colors

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.050 
and obviously you would match the colors
a<00:03:59.350> lot<00:03:59.650> better<00:03:59.890> than<00:04:00.130> we<00:04:00.280> have<00:04:00.490> but<00:04:00.700> this<00:04:00.850> way

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
a lot better than we have but this way

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.720 
a lot better than we have but this way
you're<00:04:01.240> able<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.570> see<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:03.100> hair<00:04:03.280> extensions

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
you're able to see the hair extensions

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.920 
you're able to see the hair extensions
applied<00:04:04.060> in<00:04:04.210> the<00:04:04.360> hair<00:04:06.480> so<00:04:07.480> now<00:04:07.630> I'm<00:04:07.750> going<00:04:07.840> to

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.450 
applied in the hair so now I'm going to
go<00:04:08.080> to<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.380> side<00:04:09.300> and<00:04:10.710> I<00:04:11.710> want<00:04:11.950> my<00:04:12.070> next
