00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.510 
woman in 1946 and that is one of the big
aspects<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> show<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.830> sexism<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
aspects of the show the sexism of the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.830 
aspects of the show the sexism of the
time<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.970> how<00:01:09.060> she<00:01:09.119> has<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.390> prove<00:01:09.540> everyone

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
time and how she has to prove everyone

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.300

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.020 
you can see where Tony Stark cards
attitude<00:01:56.219> from<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.670> while<00:01:56.759> you're<00:01:56.909> watching

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
attitude from and while you're watching

attitude from and while you're watching
it<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.360> think<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.140> what<00:01:58.320> Tony<00:01:58.560> Stark

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
it you think this is what Tony Stark

00:01:58.829 --> 00:01:59.929 
it you think this is what Tony Stark
would<00:01:58.950> have<00:01:59.040> been<00:01:59.130> like<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.549> 40s

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
would have been like in the 40s

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.580 
would have been like in the 40s
speaking<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.299> which<00:02:00.479> for<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.990> most<00:02:01.170> part<00:02:01.380> I

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
speaking of which for the most part I

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.990 
speaking of which for the most part I
really<00:02:01.860> liked<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.159> style<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.610> show<00:02:02.790> and

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
really liked the style of the show and

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.969 
really liked the style of the show and
by<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.329> mean<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.750> 40<00:02:04.079> setting<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.560> music

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
by that I mean the 40 setting the music

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.950 
by that I mean the 40 setting the music
the<00:02:05.250> colors<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.880> was<00:02:05.939> cool<00:02:06.180> although<00:02:06.479> some

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
the colors it was cool although some

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.270 
the colors it was cool although some
parts<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.320> show<00:02:07.500> did<00:02:07.799> seem<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.069> little

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
parts of the show did seem a little

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.160 
parts of the show did seem a little
goofy<00:02:08.819> or<00:02:08.940> cartoony<00:02:09.450> but<00:02:09.599> those<00:02:09.810> were<00:02:09.929> only<00:02:10.020> a

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
goofy or cartoony but those were only a

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.690 
goofy or cartoony but those were only a
couple<00:02:10.440> scenes<00:02:10.619> other<00:02:10.950> things<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.340> know<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
couple scenes other things to know the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.350 
couple scenes other things to know the
action<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.239> action<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.599> good

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
action the action is good

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.700 
action the action is good
I wasn't<00:02:13.600> that<00:02:13.810> impressed<00:02:13.960> with<00:02:14.320> it<00:02:14.440> however

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
I wasn't that impressed with it however

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.810 
I wasn't that impressed with it however
I'm<00:02:15.010> pretty<00:02:15.040> sure<00:02:15.370> that's<00:02:15.490> because<00:02:15.790> I

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
I'm pretty sure that's because I

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.550 
I'm pretty sure that's because I
recently<00:02:16.060> watched<00:02:16.420> daredevil<00:02:16.990> in<00:02:17.170> which<00:02:17.380> the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
recently watched daredevil in which the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.080 
recently watched daredevil in which the
action<00:02:17.800> is<00:02:17.890> incredible<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:18.580> comparing<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.060> to

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
action is incredible so comparing it to

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.850 
action is incredible so comparing it to
that<00:02:19.330> this<00:02:19.660> is<00:02:19.780> quite<00:02:19.990> a<00:02:20.020> step<00:02:20.200> down<00:02:20.410> but<00:02:20.710> if

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
that this is quite a step down but if

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.260 
that this is quite a step down but if
I'm<00:02:20.980> just<00:02:21.160> looking<00:02:21.310> at<00:02:21.550> it<00:02:21.670> as<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.820> standalone

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
I'm just looking at it as a standalone

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.970 
I'm just looking at it as a standalone
thing<00:02:22.390> then<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.020> action<00:02:23.350> is<00:02:23.440> pretty<00:02:23.650> good

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
thing then the action is pretty good

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.740 
thing then the action is pretty good
also<00:02:24.280> on<00:02:24.520> that<00:02:24.640> daredevil<00:02:24.970> comparison<00:02:25.600> this

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
also on that daredevil comparison this

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.300 
also on that daredevil comparison this
feels<00:02:25.990> a<00:02:26.110> lot<00:02:26.260> more<00:02:26.320> like<00:02:26.500> a<00:02:26.740> Marvel<00:02:27.160> Cinematic

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
feels a lot more like a Marvel Cinematic

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.340 
feels a lot more like a Marvel Cinematic
Universe<00:02:27.580> thing<00:02:28.090> than<00:02:28.300> daredevil<00:02:28.840> or<00:02:29.020> even

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
Universe thing than daredevil or even

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.660 
Universe thing than daredevil or even
agents<00:02:29.710> of<00:02:29.800> shield<00:02:29.830> I'm<00:02:30.250> not<00:02:30.430> saying<00:02:30.610> that

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
agents of shield I'm not saying that

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.370 
agents of shield I'm not saying that
makes<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.060> better<00:02:31.210> but<00:02:31.570> just<00:02:31.600> tone<00:02:31.990> and<00:02:32.170> style

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
makes it better but just tone and style

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.140 
makes it better but just tone and style
wise<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:33.070> fits<00:02:33.340> in<00:02:33.460> a<00:02:33.520> lot<00:02:33.700> better<00:02:33.910> with<00:02:34.060> the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
wise this fits in a lot better with the

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.000 
wise this fits in a lot better with the
universe<00:02:34.510> it's<00:02:34.840> very<00:02:35.050> fun<00:02:35.320> there's<00:02:35.710> lots<00:02:35.890> of
