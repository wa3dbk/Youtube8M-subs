00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.719
 the displacement of the player under the ball during the pass 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.120
 in this topic we will look at 5 different 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.219
 ball offset options in the first 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.870
 the second and third options we will consider 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.180
 displacement of the player under the ball which 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.699
 located on the lower mustache or forehead post 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.650
 the fourth option we will analyze where 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.289
 shift player playing tomorrow 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.359
 puchkov lines under 40 transmitted them 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.000
 in the last 5 we will consider 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.949
 displacement of the player who is in the corner of 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.780
 pass time all five options 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.989
 displacement under the ball in a month for 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.370
 convenience on 5 separate videos let's 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.520
 we will sort a cat 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.989
 players must move under the ball 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.760
 attacking players without a sword must 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.670
 shift under the ball when the player with the ball 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.430
 penetrates the information zone or beat 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.500
 your opponent why because 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.149
 defense players will also shift to 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.370
 side of the ball to stop 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.170
 pass ring player with a ball or 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.870
 help your partner who was 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.879
 beaten by the attacker in this case 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.790
 an attacker without a sword must shift to 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.979
 place where the player with the ball can find 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.189
 using a pass to attack the end or 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.799
 further development of attack bias 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.810
 player under the ball playing on the lower mustache 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.850
 on the weak side 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.009
 player number one passes 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.520
 in the front line in this case the player without 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.409
 swords 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.500
 will also shift to the middle of the three-second 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.009
 zones as shown in the diagram let's 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.840
 Consider this situation but only protection 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.930
 player at number one beat your 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.430
 quarterback face line 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.119
 quarterback number five should 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.890
 stop the attacker with the ball in the area 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:44.130
 left lower mustache to not give it 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.320
 score a lighter two points as we see on 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.110
 the following diagram is the most optimal place 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.420
 for receiving and attacking the ring for the player under 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.540
 number five is the middle of a three-second 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.729
 zone if soil number five 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.770
 has a high jump with us 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.280
 there is an option to play threw on 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.950
 ring 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.120
 only in this case he does not need 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.640
 shift in a strong and three-second zone 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.640
 she got on the right side of the end
