00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.220 
looking at saving a list or library as a
template<00:00:05.310> so<00:00:05.640> that<00:00:05.670> it<00:00:05.850> can<00:00:06.000> be<00:00:06.180> used<00:00:06.930> to

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
template so that it can be used to

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.709 
template so that it can be used to
create<00:00:07.560> new<00:00:07.950> list<00:00:08.250> or<00:00:08.460> libraries<00:00:09.030> by<00:00:09.269> yourself

framework<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:19.800> be<00:00:19.980> created<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.850> would

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
framework to be created so that it would

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.730 
framework to be created so that it would
save<00:00:21.180> others<00:00:21.510> time<00:00:21.810> not<00:00:22.109> having<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.500> create

those lists from scratch as well at the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.200 
those lists from scratch as well at the
same<00:00:25.500> respect<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.220> may<00:00:26.490> have<00:00:26.670> created<00:00:27.090> a

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
same respect you may have created a

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.019 
same respect you may have created a
document<00:00:27.660> library<00:00:28.410> with<00:00:28.650> many<00:00:29.029> metadata

fields that you wouldn't have to want to

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.040 
fields that you wouldn't have to want to
have<00:00:32.579> someone<00:00:32.880> else<00:00:33.030> recreate<00:00:33.600> from<00:00:33.780> scratch

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
have someone else recreate from scratch

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.620 
have someone else recreate from scratch
either<00:00:34.350> let's<00:00:35.010> take<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.219> look<00:00:35.430> at<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.030> for

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
either let's take a look at that and for

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.110 
either let's take a look at that and for
instance<00:00:36.750> let's<00:00:37.110> go<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.380> IT<00:00:37.620> Help<00:00:38.070> Desk<00:00:38.129> we

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
instance let's go to the IT Help Desk we

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.580 
instance let's go to the IT Help Desk we
use<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.829> ITF<00:00:40.829> aqs<00:00:41.430> list<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.030> create<00:00:42.590> earlier

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
use the ITF aqs list to create earlier

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.069 
use the ITF aqs list to create earlier
as<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.800> custom<00:00:44.340> list<00:00:44.579> then<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:45.480> modified<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
as a custom list then we modified the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.369 
as a custom list then we modified the
actual<00:00:46.800> views<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.399> be<00:00:47.520> grouped<00:00:47.960> by<00:00:48.960> category

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
actual views to be grouped by category

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.250 
actual views to be grouped by category
so<00:00:50.190> if<00:00:50.460> you'll<00:00:50.670> just<00:00:51.360> bear<00:00:51.480> with<00:00:51.660> me<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:52.079> will

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
so if you'll just bear with me this will

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.750 
so if you'll just bear with me this will
refresh<00:00:52.559> your<00:00:52.800> memory<00:00:53.100> how<00:00:53.219> we've<00:00:53.399> got<00:00:53.579> this

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
refresh your memory how we've got this

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.900 
refresh your memory how we've got this
view<00:00:54.120> created<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.340> notice<00:00:56.340> we've<00:00:56.520> got<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
view created and notice we've got the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.840 
view created and notice we've got the
all<00:00:57.030> items<00:00:57.480> view<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:58.309> which<00:00:59.309> just<00:00:59.609> shows<00:00:59.670> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
all items view to which just shows the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.639 
all items view to which just shows the
question<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.750> answers<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.410> then<00:01:01.500> what

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
question the answers and then what

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.939 
question the answers and then what
category<00:01:02.270> they<00:01:03.270> belong<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.870> but<00:01:04.650> from<00:01:04.799> any

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
list or library that you want to create

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.899 
list or library that you want to create
and<00:01:07.020> save<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.650> as<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> template<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.670> used

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
and save this as a template to be used

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.940 
and save this as a template to be used
in<00:01:09.090> other<00:01:09.210> places<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:10.500> go<00:01:10.530> over<00:01:10.680> to

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
in other places you can go over to

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.969 
in other places you can go over to
settings<00:01:12.229> list<00:01:13.229> settings<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:15.770> then<00:01:16.770> under

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
settings list settings and then under

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.310 
settings list settings and then under
the<00:01:17.100> permissions<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.790> management<00:01:18.330> field<00:01:18.840> you

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
the permissions and management field you

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.620 
the permissions and management field you
can<00:01:19.530> say<00:01:19.799> save<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.790> list<00:01:21.060> as<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> template<00:01:22.520> and

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
can say save this list as a template and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.030 
can say save this list as a template and
this<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.750> pretty<00:01:24.960> straightforward<00:01:25.350> but<00:01:25.860> we're

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
this is pretty straightforward but we're

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.560 
this is pretty straightforward but we're
just<00:01:26.159> going<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.340> call<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:27.470> FAQ<00:01:28.470> template

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
just going to call this the FAQ template

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.330 
just going to call this the FAQ template
I'm<00:01:30.570> going<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.840> give<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.079> same<00:01:31.380> name<00:01:31.590> here

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.969 

and<00:01:35.540> we<00:01:36.540> have<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.720> choice<00:01:36.990> at<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> bottom<00:01:37.799> to

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
and we have a choice at the bottom to

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.550 
and we have a choice at the bottom to
include<00:01:38.369> content<00:01:39.150> or<00:01:39.299> not<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.720> what<00:01:40.439> this

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
include content or not and what this

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.770 
include content or not and what this
would<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.130> if<00:01:41.369> i<00:01:41.790> choose<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.360> check<00:01:42.600> this

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
would do is if i choose to check this

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.270 
would do is if i choose to check this
box<00:01:42.990> it'll<00:01:43.350> actually<00:01:43.560> bring<00:01:43.920> over<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
box it'll actually bring over the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.120 
box it'll actually bring over the
questions<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.000> answers<00:01:45.530> for<00:01:46.530> me<00:01:46.680> what<00:01:47.100> i
