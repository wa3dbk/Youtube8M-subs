00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.520
 I wanted to send it Sunday this pack 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.950

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.719
 recording for the video that was 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.760
 expected today normally it's a 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.829
 season mode that I had prepared for you 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.620
 as I said in the previous 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.760
 video it was planned normally 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.809
 unfortunately it's not that I have not 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.629
 wanted is that I actually had a 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.129
 hardware problem and suddenly I 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.260
 lost the files actually here I have 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.149
 I started the season mode so in 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.680
 division say a season word it changes 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.739
 a little bit of falls especially you 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.390
 were many to agree and I 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.550
 started the matches I won the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.199
 division 10 I had to do one or two 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.330
 matches in division 9 and in fact when 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.490
 I wanted to recover my file but 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.500
 simply my capture software 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.820
 to plant just so I have 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.439
 could not get my file so from 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.750
 I had played in red and played for 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.460
 anything so it made me a little bah ah it 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.439
 go a little disgusted necessarily I lost 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.759
 a little while, I've done 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.070
 I played well and more 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.750
 and suddenly I'll put it back 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.330
 Sunday think to finish here I have it all 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.350
 just swap the videos and at the 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.079
 basis they were planned for 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.280
 Sunday this one and suddenly I you 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.680
 send it today so I hope that 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.119
 it does not bother you anyway 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.560
 did not really bother to open his 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.450
 easter since it went well 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.439
 as often in my pack opening it 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.130
 becomes a habit 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.299
 I opened I opened for 500 miles 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.100
 easter credit so actually yeah 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.869
 here I opened 20 easter at 25k so 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.030
 so we're good it's good five 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.409
 hundred thousand credit and as you go the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.689
 see how you already have a little bit 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.280
 seen in this video it's happening rather 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.240
 well 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.090
 why did not I comment them the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.710
 simply because because 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.170
 that I have not thought it's true that 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.899
 the breakdowns usually I them or as 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.330
 that it takes me and I do not think actually 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.649
 put my microphone it's true that 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.319
 it's a little pity but good 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.510
 here after I do not have either 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.370
 player I have not had players over 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.859

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.689
 no longer the master stroke live so 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.980
