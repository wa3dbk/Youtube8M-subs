00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 the daily staff of the player in the air and 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.660
 in this video I'm going to make a participation 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.490
 in the channel chain alexandre lima 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.530
 alexandre br 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.750
 in his channel link description he 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.360
 started a few weeks ago one 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.340
 current with the theme what is the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.690
 best weapon for best weapon defense 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.520
 caliber for defense 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.560
 already when he started to chain the channel 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.910
 still did not exist he met in the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.289
 internet channel 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.000
 I found it interesting to ask if I 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.189
 wanted to join the chain and 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.219
 obviously I gladly accepted as 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.559
 obtain and had opened the possibility 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.300
 in his video of him indicate other 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.340
 people in the future he indicated then here 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.379
 making my contribution as long as 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.020
 the group of 20 cents there for this 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.750
 debate is then the rules of the current 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.670
 It had to be a short gun, and I 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.570
 could stay up to two guns two 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.800
 Calibers is a short portable devil, right? 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.250
 defense right 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.219
 so I'll start the video then 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.070
 addressing the aspects of my choice 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.080
 In Brazil, and then I'll move on to 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.049
 my choice if we had a country 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.680
 free, then I will address these 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.210
 two sides 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.780
 so my choice in brazil 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.430
 First there is here in Brazil I speak 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.170
 with people who want to look for a 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.210
 gun to difficult with her in the world then 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.049
 you have to ask yourself what you are going 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.229
 Defend what kind of person you are. 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.009
 your profile and is against whom you want 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.710
 defend 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.560
 What is my reality, so it's good, I? 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.640
 I'm a marketer so I have two 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.090
 weapons for defense 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.829
 I leave one in the trade a company and 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.990
 leave a home 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.909
 So, because the ones I chose to 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.759
 each of these situations are here 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.979
 inside the company I have mine. 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.659
 defense registered at that address and 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.250
 here within the goal limits of my 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.200
 I company as company administrator 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.570
 can endure there then I had to 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.180
 to choose a weapon that is light 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.579
 was small that it was easy to deport 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.610
 that was easy to hide and that 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.799
 have a stopping power is adequate 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.810
 for the defense situation then the option 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:12.540
 What I did was mine. 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.800
 the titanium work is there video of him 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.800
 There's video review of him. 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.070
 on the channel and I use more expansive ammunition 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.440
 p of cbc and in trade for those who 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.670
 The merchant who owns a store is the 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.680
 You know the difference is 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.670
 defending your company against whom you 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.380
 is defending 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.690
 you are usually advocating the greatest 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.740
 sometimes it's being a burglar an 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.600
 or two at most I'm going to go in there 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.090
 against a furious customer something 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.190
 so you find 112 rather than entering your 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.960
 shop with a knife something like that 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.810
 these would be the possibilities for this 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.700
 I think the revolver because it has only 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.040
 five shots and back but the year with more 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.960
 pilots in the body 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.450
 If I need to, I have another mission. 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.290
 I think five shots is suitable for 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.270
 defense 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.410
 I find it very light, very comfortable, can I? 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.620
 stay here working in the office 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.810
 time and he's here with me and 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.190
 Do not bother me Do not hurt Do not bother 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.900
 regardless of the clothing you are wearing 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.570
 he will serve 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.340
 I can bear on the waist is in a court 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.500
 Internal I can bear he agreed 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.590
 outer jacket with a jacket a 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.360
 up and I can bear it is inside the 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.860
 pocket in the holster suitable for the purse 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.300
 depending on the clothes I have wearing 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.750
 after supporting it anyway is very 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.890
 small very light and very very easy 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.720
 to use revolver 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.300
 the time revolts because here in the company 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.459
 where I have a greater risk of suffering 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.930
 Attempt something so invasion is 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.350
 here in the company and I wanted a 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.209
 reliable and that you do not need 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.150
 worry about solving breads and such I 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.880
 I also think 38 a caliber that has a 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.650
 stop power greater than the 380 goes 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.590
 do their job well I hope never 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.950
 need to use but if you need 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.380
 do his job well, I'm at home. 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.060
 I bought the granpal the next I finished 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.580
 giving up the granpal for the defense 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.330
 He tried to substitute it for a glock 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.830
 I'm going to spend Father's Day tomorrow 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.080
 retaliates and also when I have to 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.760
 block I'm going to review it as well 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.019
 I bought everything, it's okay, I'll make the 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.440
 transfer from my friend who was 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:16.320
 selling and I will leave glock at home for 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.600
 the defense and the great power goes to practice 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.100
 because I would also choose 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.560
 glock would be my second choice in 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.419
 Brazil because now that is a pistol 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.210
 also carry a good capacity of one 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.690
 extremely reliable mission and she 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.100
 tried 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.900
 the appropriate safety devices 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.370
 To keep her safe at home, I'm going 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.440
 leave it equipped with a flashlight. 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.540
 all the time in the house I do not need 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.950
 a longer dwelling in an apartment 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:48.180
 then those would be my two 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.680
 Choices are there in Brazil but 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.360
 the second scenario so if I had 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.830
 really a free country if I had a 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.340
 country like the united states 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.540
 Well, the option is immense, right? 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.570
 probably in these circumstances not 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.370
 I would opt for a revolver, I would not go 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.020
 really agree with the people who 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.880
 capacity is an interesting thing 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.310
 because I have other gauges not 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.560
 caliber 380 is not a good caliber is the 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.580
 best way to defend but in a country 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.040
 free in the United States for example 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.240
 would have access to nine millimeters and 19 years 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.580
 nowadays you have a variety 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.430
 ammunition including ammunition 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.730
 that has as much stop paulo as one to 40 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.490
 for example it compares very well with 40 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.770
 so I'll choose nine millimeters if 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.180
 I had been united to step 1965 is 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.450
 a very cheap disc very easy to find 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.580
 there is a lot of choice and you can train with 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.630
 it will and has many will 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.490
 choose a pistol that has the 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.430
 possibility of accessories in it 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.040
 have leather sights options for you 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.310
 to replace and opted for the 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.080
 sig sauer of 2022 is because it is a 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.850
 Little story is to follow salt is the 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.950
 my favorite brand of pistol 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.140
 there in the states it was in the state 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.300
 favorite brand of pistol is a person 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.820
 very trustworthy so I was not going to 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.140
 concern about good ammunition, and it is only for 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.990
 like a pistol 10 in the morning till 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:06.030
 the concern of failing to have any 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.150
 Such a problem is very rare to happen. 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.100
 then it would be like that for a pistol 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.800
 now will only meet any evaluation 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.810
 This is very important in my 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:20.280
 opinion that our defense has action 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:22.860
 then choose the double-T 22 ok ACIG 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.680
 and as a second weapon could choose a 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.730
 glock 40 could be a great choice for 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.470
 who makes that choice 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.140
 but I will choose a different thing 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.240
 would be the .45 caliber and I'll make a 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.040
 choice just to fill the same video will 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.650
 speak not only the ball show 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:41.520
 It is actually a pistol a revolver that 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:43.770
 is the smith wesson 625 team is a revolver 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.870
 with that system of one 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.430
 clip that comes ready, he thinks 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.370
 beautiful, beautiful resolve 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:53.610
 ah if it was an armadillo that is not not 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:56.699
 would be my case would not be the kind of 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.169
 who carried a 45 to but I 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:00.030
 would choose the essential because he is 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:02.430
 Gorgeous simply because only because I 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.229
 I liked it to continue the 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.659
 current and such I will indicate a channel 

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:09.030
 survival 'list is but I know 

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:10.650
 that the channel administrator likes to 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.280
 water has also made some videos about the 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.930
 Water 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.110

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:18.210

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:22.800

 so what's the best and best weapon?
