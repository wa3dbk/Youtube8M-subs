what<00:04:51.709> the<00:04:51.800> machine<00:04:52.039> can<00:04:52.069> do<00:04:52.339> let's<00:04:52.550> take<00:04:52.639> a

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
what the machine can do let's take a

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.969 
what the machine can do let's take a
look<00:04:52.909> at<00:04:53.029> the<00:04:53.179> internals<00:04:53.689> is<00:04:54.469> a<00:04:54.529> passive

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
look at the internals is a passive

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.070 
look at the internals is a passive
couple<00:04:55.249> on<00:04:55.520> top<00:04:55.699> this<00:04:55.939> one<00:04:56.119> moves<00:04:56.330> nice<00:04:56.899> thing

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
couple on top this one moves nice thing

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.869 
couple on top this one moves nice thing
is<00:04:57.229> you<00:04:57.259> can<00:04:57.469> actually<00:04:57.740> fill<00:04:58.580> your<00:04:58.759> water

00:04:58.869 --> 00:04:58.879 
is you can actually fill your water

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:00.399 
is you can actually fill your water
reservoir<00:04:59.389> through<00:04:59.569> this<00:04:59.689> hole<00:04:59.899> or<00:05:00.139> you<00:05:00.169> can

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:00.409 
reservoir through this hole or you can

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:02.589 
reservoir through this hole or you can
actually<00:05:00.529> move<00:05:00.860> the<00:05:00.919> entire<00:05:01.369> thing<00:05:01.669> I'll<00:05:01.849> fill

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.599 
actually move the entire thing I'll fill

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.600 
actually move the entire thing I'll fill
it<00:05:02.719> that<00:05:02.899> way<00:05:03.050> yeah<00:05:03.349> but<00:05:03.409> here's<00:05:03.679> your<00:05:03.830> co2<00:05:04.009> it

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
it that way yeah but here's your co2 it

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.579 
it that way yeah but here's your co2 it
comes<00:05:04.849> with<00:05:05.029> a<00:05:05.119> big<00:05:05.569> particle<00:05:05.990> filter<00:05:06.319> on<00:05:06.469> the

00:05:06.579 --> 00:05:06.589 
comes with a big particle filter on the

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:08.559 
comes with a big particle filter on the
end<00:05:06.740> and<00:05:07.009> there<00:05:07.580> is<00:05:07.789> the<00:05:07.909> return<00:05:08.059> line<00:05:08.240> from

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:08.569 
end and there is the return line from

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:10.059 
end and there is the return line from
the<00:05:08.689> OPV<00:05:09.169> valve<00:05:09.379> correct

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:10.069 
the OPV valve correct

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:11.949 
the OPV valve correct
do<00:05:10.309> you<00:05:10.369> have<00:05:10.520> your<00:05:10.669> water<00:05:10.849> reservoir<00:05:11.360> 90

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:11.959 
do you have your water reservoir 90

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:14.320 
do you have your water reservoir 90
ounces<00:05:12.080> has<00:05:12.800> the<00:05:13.069> float<00:05:13.729> in<00:05:13.909> there<00:05:14.029> where<00:05:14.240> the

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
ounces has the float in there where the

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.549 
ounces has the float in there where the
electrical<00:05:14.749> sensor<00:05:15.080> will<00:05:15.229> show<00:05:15.349> you<00:05:15.439> in<00:05:15.529> a

00:05:15.549 --> 00:05:15.559 
electrical sensor will show you in a

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:17.290 
electrical sensor will show you in a
second<00:05:15.979> what<00:05:16.069> it<00:05:16.159> does<00:05:16.339> we<00:05:16.939> run<00:05:17.089> out<00:05:17.179> of<00:05:17.240> water

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
second what it does we run out of water

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.199 
second what it does we run out of water
it<00:05:17.629> actually<00:05:17.929> kills<00:05:18.199> every<00:05:18.589> element<00:05:19.209> today

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:20.209 
it actually kills every element today

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:21.609 
it actually kills every element today
you're<00:05:20.449> not<00:05:20.569> going<00:05:20.839> to<00:05:20.929> have<00:05:21.259> your<00:05:21.379> heating

00:05:21.609 --> 00:05:21.619 
you're not going to have your heating

00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:23.019 
you're not going to have your heating
element<00:05:21.889> out<00:05:21.949> in<00:05:22.099> the<00:05:22.189> water<00:05:22.399> and<00:05:22.580> the<00:05:22.669> boiler

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:23.029 
element out in the water and the boiler

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:25.959 
element out in the water and the boiler
you'll<00:05:23.659> see<00:05:23.809> that<00:05:23.929> is<00:05:24.110> right<00:05:24.289> here<00:05:24.789> this<00:05:25.789> is

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:25.969 
you'll see that is right here this is

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:28.329 
you'll see that is right here this is
hunter<00:05:26.300> yep<00:05:26.749> also<00:05:27.110> on<00:05:27.199> the<00:05:27.259> internal<00:05:27.800> was

00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:28.339 
hunter yep also on the internal was

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:30.070 
hunter yep also on the internal was
unique<00:05:28.729> about<00:05:28.879> this<00:05:29.029> machine<00:05:29.209> is<00:05:29.419> the<00:05:29.569> GOC

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
unique about this machine is the GOC

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.040 
unique about this machine is the GOC
control<00:05:30.409> and<00:05:31.009> what<00:05:31.159> that<00:05:31.339> does<00:05:31.639> is<00:05:32.050> it

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
control and what that does is it

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.980 
control and what that does is it
monitors<00:05:33.229> the<00:05:33.649> water<00:05:33.860> level<00:05:34.219> in<00:05:34.369> the<00:05:34.490> boiler

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
monitors the water level in the boiler

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.929 
monitors the water level in the boiler
and<00:05:35.990> it<00:05:36.139> says<00:05:36.740> less<00:05:36.979> than<00:05:37.129> a<00:05:37.219> half<00:05:37.459> an<00:05:37.580> amp<00:05:37.729> to

00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:37.939 
and it says less than a half an amp to

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:39.009 
and it says less than a half an amp to
the<00:05:38.029> pressure<00:05:38.269> stat<00:05:38.569> so<00:05:38.749> there's<00:05:38.899> no

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:39.019 
the pressure stat so there's no

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:40.480 
the pressure stat so there's no
electrical<00:05:39.409> arcing<00:05:39.769> it<00:05:40.189> actually

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
electrical arcing it actually

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.040 
electrical arcing it actually
dramatically<00:05:40.969> increases<00:05:41.569> the<00:05:41.599> life<00:05:41.839> of<00:05:41.990> the

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
dramatically increases the life of the

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.559 
dramatically increases the life of the
pressure<00:05:42.289> set<00:05:42.619> also<00:05:43.129> an<00:05:43.219> opp<00:05:43.669> valve<00:05:43.939> yep<00:05:44.419> you

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:44.569 
pressure set also an opp valve yep you

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.189 
pressure set also an opp valve yep you
do<00:05:44.689> have<00:05:44.809> your<00:05:44.929> high<00:05:45.050> limit<00:05:45.379> time<00:05:46.189> limits<00:05:46.459> here

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 
do have your high limit time limits here

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:49.779 
do have your high limit time limits here
and<00:05:48.199> the<00:05:48.289> pressure<00:05:48.499> stats<00:05:48.860> are<00:05:49.099> yep<00:05:49.399> it<00:05:49.729> is

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789 
and the pressure stats are yep it is

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:52.149 
and the pressure stats are yep it is
nice<00:05:50.089> to<00:05:50.119> that<00:05:50.629> alterna<00:05:51.349> Liz<00:05:51.619> all<00:05:51.800> copper

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
nice to that alterna Liz all copper

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.359 
nice to that alterna Liz all copper
boiling<00:05:52.610> it's<00:05:53.539> cutemon<00:05:53.839> copper<00:05:54.559> doing

00:05:55.359 --> 00:05:55.369 
boiling it's cutemon copper doing

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:57.339
