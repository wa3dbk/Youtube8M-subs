so it means we've got hot and cold water

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.730 
so it means we've got hot and cold water
which<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.150> great<00:00:12.269> we've<00:00:13.230> got<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.440> washing

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
which is great we've got a washing

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.470 
which is great we've got a washing
machine<00:00:13.889> standpipe<00:00:14.700> right<00:00:15.030> here

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
machine standpipe right here

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.689 
machine standpipe right here
now<00:00:15.870> this<00:00:16.020> standpipe<00:00:16.560> comes<00:00:16.859> down<00:00:17.070> here<00:00:17.550> and

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
now this standpipe comes down here and

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.450 
now this standpipe comes down here and
goes<00:00:17.910> down<00:00:18.180> into<00:00:18.510> our<00:00:19.080> drain<00:00:19.560> now<00:00:20.160> at<00:00:20.310> this

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
goes down into our drain now at this

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.820 
goes down into our drain now at this
point<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.240> water<00:00:21.449> goes<00:00:21.810> down<00:00:22.050> into<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.619> drain

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
point the water goes down into the drain

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.650 
point the water goes down into the drain
from<00:00:23.070> at<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.400> point<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.850> above<00:00:24.119> though<00:00:24.359> this

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
from at this point and above though this

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.359 
from at this point and above though this
pipe<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.170> vent<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.740> that's<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.949> really<00:00:26.279> good

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
pipe is a vent and that's a really good

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.800 
pipe is a vent and that's a really good
thing<00:00:26.609> we<00:00:26.789> often<00:00:26.970> don't<00:00:27.269> see<00:00:27.390> this<00:00:27.630> in

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
thing we often don't see this in

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.540 
thing we often don't see this in
basement<00:00:28.260> applications<00:00:28.890> what's<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.189> vent<00:00:29.400> -

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
basement applications what's a vent -

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.669 
basement applications what's a vent -
well<00:00:30.060> without<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.630> vent<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.199> drain<00:00:31.500> would

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
well without that vent this drain would

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.650 
well without that vent this drain would
gurgle<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.279> what<00:00:32.430> happens<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.120> breaks<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
gurgle so what happens is it breaks the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.780 
gurgle so what happens is it breaks the
vacuum<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:34.829> water<00:00:35.219> will<00:00:35.340> go<00:00:35.460> down<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
vacuum so that water will go down the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.160 
vacuum so that water will go down the
drain<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.180> it's<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.390> really<00:00:36.809> good<00:00:36.899> thing<00:00:37.079> that's

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
drain so it's a really good thing that's

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.160 
drain so it's a really good thing that's
there<00:00:37.440> one<00:00:37.920> thing<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.100> did<00:00:38.309> notice<00:00:38.750> this<00:00:39.750> drain

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
there one thing I did notice this drain

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.729 
there one thing I did notice this drain
is<00:00:40.379> about<00:00:40.620> 26<00:00:41.370> inches<00:00:41.550> off<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.450> ground<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.620> I

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
is about 26 inches off the ground and I

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.260 
is about 26 inches off the ground and I
look<00:00:43.950> over<00:00:44.219> here<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.059> set<00:00:45.300> time<00:00:45.920> this<00:00:46.920> is

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
look over here and this set time this is

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.619 
look over here and this set time this is
what<00:00:48.270> about<00:00:48.660> 18<00:00:49.200> inches<00:00:49.440> okay<00:00:50.280> now<00:00:50.969> if<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.390> just

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
what about 18 inches okay now if I just

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.350 
what about 18 inches okay now if I just
cut<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> fitting<00:00:52.379> like<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.270> just<00:00:54.270> a

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
cut a fitting like this and just a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.510 
cut a fitting like this and just a
little<00:00:54.480> bit<00:00:54.660> lower<00:00:54.809> down<00:00:54.930> at<00:00:55.199> 18<00:00:55.620> now

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
little bit lower down at 18 now

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.369 
little bit lower down at 18 now
technically<00:00:56.969> from<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.539> point<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.260> this

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
technically from this point to this

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.260 
technically from this point to this
point<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.770> no<00:00:58.980> longer<00:00:59.250> event<00:00:59.640> because<00:01:00.030> there's

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
point is no longer event because there's

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.090 
point is no longer event because there's
a<00:01:00.359> drain<00:01:00.629> coming<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.050> above<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:01.890> what<00:01:02.010> I've

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
here references the center of the drain

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.420 
here references the center of the drain
coming<00:01:24.240> from<00:01:24.659> our<00:01:24.900> utility<00:01:25.439> sink<00:01:25.680> now<00:01:26.280> we've

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
coming from our utility sink now we've

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.940 
coming from our utility sink now we've
added<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.880> line<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.020> pipe<00:01:28.290> right<00:01:28.320> here

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
added that line to this pipe right here

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.880 
added that line to this pipe right here
and<00:01:29.159> I've<00:01:29.610> extended<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.659> line<00:01:30.930> over<00:01:31.229> here<00:01:31.619> so

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
and I've extended that line over here so

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.719 
and I've extended that line over here so
we<00:01:32.040> need<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.460> line<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:33.119> line<00:01:33.420> with<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.170> at

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
we need to line this line with that at

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.980 
we need to line this line with that at
the<00:01:35.729> bottom<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.270> where<00:01:36.420> we<00:01:36.509> cut<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:36.900> we

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
the bottom is where we cut it and we

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.170 
the bottom is where we cut it and we
have<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.259> allow<00:01:37.530> for<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.829> pipe<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.700> fit<00:01:38.909> inside

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
have to allow for the pipe to fit inside

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.690 
have to allow for the pipe to fit inside
of<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.229> fitting<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.250> mark<00:01:41.520> would<00:01:41.670> be

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
of that fitting and that mark would be

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.819 
of that fitting and that mark would be

with that knife just deburr the inside
of<00:02:08.570> the<00:02:08.630> pipe<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:08.869> want<00:02:09.140> to<00:02:09.200> get<00:02:09.290> rid<00:02:09.410> of<00:02:09.500> all

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
of the pipe you want to get rid of all

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.310 
of the pipe you want to get rid of all
the<00:02:09.800> shavings<00:02:10.250> from<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.460> cutting<00:02:10.850> good<00:02:11.600> now

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
the shavings from the cutting good now

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.530 
the shavings from the cutting good now
here's<00:02:12.890> our<00:02:13.100> double<00:02:13.490> Y<00:02:13.640> fitting<00:02:14.090> now<00:02:14.420> I'm

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
here's our double Y fitting now I'm

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.350 
here's our double Y fitting now I'm
going<00:02:14.690> to<00:02:14.750> dry<00:02:15.050> fit<00:02:15.110> everything<00:02:15.970> but<00:02:16.970> now<00:02:17.150> I've

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
going to dry fit everything but now I've

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.910 
going to dry fit everything but now I've
got<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.540> pipe<00:02:17.810> right<00:02:18.080> here<00:02:18.290> that's<00:02:18.470> in<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.740> way

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
got a pipe right here that's in the way

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.910 
got a pipe right here that's in the way
so<00:02:18.980> in<00:02:19.610> order<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:20.000> get<00:02:20.120> around<00:02:20.240> that<00:02:20.810> I<00:02:21.080> can

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
so in order to get around that I can

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.980 
so in order to get around that I can
actually<00:02:22.280> spin<00:02:23.260> this<00:02:24.260> 45<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:26.600> I<00:02:26.660> can<00:02:26.840> add

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
actually spin this 45 and I can add

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.330 
actually spin this 45 and I can add
another<00:02:27.140> one<00:02:28.510> right<00:02:29.510> over<00:02:29.540> here<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.340> that'll

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
another one right over here and that'll

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.040 
another one right over here and that'll
allow<00:02:31.520> me<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.790> bring<00:02:32.209> my<00:02:32.270> wash<00:02:32.660> machine

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
allow me to bring my wash machine

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.010 
allow me to bring my wash machine
draining<00:02:33.500> right<00:02:33.740> here<00:02:34.040> and<00:02:34.280> on<00:02:35.209> this<00:02:35.450> side<00:02:35.750> I

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
draining right here and on this side I

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.680 
draining right here and on this side I
can<00:02:36.170> put<00:02:36.320> a<00:02:36.350> 90<00:02:36.770> degree<00:02:37.040> Bend<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.640> that's<00:02:38.420> my

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
can put a 90 degree Bend and that's my

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.140 
can put a 90 degree Bend and that's my
dream<00:02:38.930> for<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.170> utility<00:02:39.560> sink<00:02:39.850> and<00:02:40.850> now<00:02:40.970> I'm

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
dream for the utility sink and now I'm

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.990 
dream for the utility sink and now I'm
going<00:02:41.330> to<00:02:41.390> measure<00:02:41.570> this<00:02:41.990> piece<00:02:42.350> right<00:02:42.740> here

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
going to measure this piece right here

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.640 
going to measure this piece right here
all<00:02:44.000> right<00:02:44.060> so<00:02:44.270> here's<00:02:44.810> our<00:02:45.050> piece<00:02:45.350> that's

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
all right so here's our piece that's

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.570 
all right so here's our piece that's
going<00:02:45.770> to<00:02:45.860> go<00:02:46.040> from<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.459> double<00:02:46.700> Y<00:02:47.920> now<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:49.370> make

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
going to go from a double Y now to make

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.190 
going to go from a double Y now to make
up<00:02:49.760> this<00:02:49.940> last<00:02:50.270> connection<00:02:50.750> they<00:02:51.020> make<00:02:51.170> a

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
up this last connection they make a

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.530 
up this last connection they make a
special<00:02:51.440> coupling<00:02:52.190> called<00:02:52.550> a<00:02:52.730> slip<00:02:53.120> coupling

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
special coupling called a slip coupling

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.320 
special coupling called a slip coupling
also<00:02:54.320> called<00:02:54.590> a<00:02:54.680> repair<00:02:55.010> coupling<00:02:55.430> so<00:02:56.150> this

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
also called a repair coupling so this

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.300 
also called a repair coupling so this
can<00:02:56.540> come<00:02:56.690> right<00:02:56.870> down<00:02:57.140> bring<00:02:57.980> this<00:02:58.100> together

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
can come right down bring this together

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.699 
can come right down bring this together
and<00:02:59.110> then<00:03:00.110> bring<00:03:00.380> it<00:03:00.440> right<00:03:00.500> back<00:03:00.650> up<00:03:00.980> again

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
and then bring it right back up again

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.870 
and then bring it right back up again
now<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:03.800> purpose<00:03:04.070> of<00:03:04.160> drive<00:03:04.400> fitting<00:03:04.760> is<00:03:04.820> to

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
now the purpose of drive fitting is to

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.340 
now the purpose of drive fitting is to
be<00:03:04.970> sure<00:03:05.150> that<00:03:05.330> it<00:03:05.600> all<00:03:05.750> fits<00:03:05.780> together<00:03:06.140> and

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
be sure that it all fits together and

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.840 
be sure that it all fits together and
the<00:03:06.530> angles<00:03:06.950> are<00:03:07.040> correct<00:03:07.310> so<00:03:07.459> just<00:03:07.640> make<00:03:07.820> a

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
the angles are correct so just make a

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.580 
the angles are correct so just make a
series<00:03:08.300> of<00:03:08.330> witness<00:03:08.810> marks<00:03:09.140> a<00:03:09.230> reference

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
series of witness marks a reference

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.020

recreate<00:03:11.420> everything<00:03:11.750> perfectly<00:03:12.200> when<00:03:12.350> we

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
recreate everything perfectly when we

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.949 
recreate everything perfectly when we
glue<00:03:12.590> it<00:03:12.709> all<00:03:12.800> together

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
glue it all together

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.180 
glue it all together
first<00:03:14.959> we<00:03:15.080> need<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:15.260> clean<00:03:15.410> it<00:03:15.650> take<00:03:16.070> the

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
first we need to clean it take the

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.340 
first we need to clean it take the
purple<00:03:16.550> can<00:03:16.820> right<00:03:17.060> there<00:03:17.239> clean<00:03:18.230> the

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
purple can right there clean the

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.789 
purple can right there clean the
vertical<00:03:18.890> stick<00:03:19.220> it<00:03:19.310> up<00:03:23.500> alright<00:03:24.500> so<00:03:24.560> now

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
vertical stick it up alright so now

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.520 
vertical stick it up alright so now
we're<00:03:24.950> ready<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.160> glue<00:03:25.400> it<00:03:26.140> applied<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.170> the
