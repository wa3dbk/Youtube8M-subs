timeline<00:01:36.150> it's<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.020> timing<00:01:37.350> mechanism<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:38.299> want

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
timeline it's a timing mechanism I want

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.850 
timeline it's a timing mechanism I want
the<00:01:39.450> video<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.750> pause<00:01:40.049> right<00:01:40.530> when<00:01:40.770> this

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
the video to pause right when this

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.580 
the video to pause right when this
rectangle<00:01:41.460> appears<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.840> timeline<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.560> I

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
rectangle appears on the timeline so I

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.520 
rectangle appears on the timeline so I
add<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.860> trigger<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.490> rectangle<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.060> says

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
add a trigger to the rectangle that says

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.719 
add a trigger to the rectangle that says
pause<00:01:46.530> media<00:01:47.360> this<00:01:48.360> video<00:01:48.810> when<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.070> timeline

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
pause media this video when the timeline

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.060 
pause media this video when the timeline
starts<00:01:51.299> for<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:51.899> rectangle<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.860> here's

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
starts for this rectangle so here's

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.380 
starts for this rectangle so here's
what's<00:01:53.220> going<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.369> happen<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.970> rectangle

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
what's going to happen the rectangle

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.480 
what's going to happen the rectangle
appears<00:01:54.689> on<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.899> timeline<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.560> it's<00:01:56.280> going

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
appears on the timeline and it's going

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.569 
appears on the timeline and it's going
to<00:01:56.640> pause<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.869> video<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.680> if<00:01:58.799> we<00:01:58.950> preview<00:01:59.460> this

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
to pause the video so if we preview this

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.190 
to pause the video so if we preview this
sure<00:02:00.000> enough<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.780> behavior<00:02:00.930> that

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
sure enough this is the behavior that

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.340 
sure enough this is the behavior that
we'll<00:02:01.469> see<00:02:02.180> chef<00:02:03.180> lays<00:02:03.420> down<00:02:03.600> some<00:02:03.659> oil<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
we'll see chef lays down some oil in the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.200 
we'll see chef lays down some oil in the
saucier<00:02:04.740> pan<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.820> popping<00:02:06.030> out<00:02:06.090> of

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
saucier pan I just popping out of

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.340 
saucier pan I just popping out of
saucier<00:02:06.540> pan<00:02:06.719> it's<00:02:06.840> not<00:02:06.960> deep<00:02:07.079> enough

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
saucier pan it's not deep enough

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.290 
saucier pan it's not deep enough
probably<00:02:07.740> just<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.920> saucepan<00:02:08.429> but<00:02:08.849> hey<00:02:08.970> his

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
probably just a saucepan but hey his

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.880 
probably just a saucepan but hey his
hand<00:02:09.569> just<00:02:09.690> paused<00:02:09.989> hot<00:02:10.379> that's<00:02:10.679> what<00:02:10.770> we

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
hand just paused hot that's what we

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.820 
hand just paused hot that's what we
wanted<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.160> have<00:02:11.340> happen<00:02:12.140> perfect<00:02:13.140> so

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
wanted to have happen perfect so

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.170 
wanted to have happen perfect so
now<00:02:13.980> we've<00:02:14.190> got<00:02:14.310> our<00:02:14.430> first<00:02:14.700> step<00:02:14.970> we've

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
now we've got our first step we've

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.900 
now we've got our first step we've
paused<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.900> video<00:02:16.160> now<00:02:17.160> we<00:02:17.220> need<00:02:17.670> some

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
paused the video now we need some

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.790 
paused the video now we need some
mechanism<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.540> play<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.140> video<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.410> start<00:02:19.650> it

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
mechanism to play the video to start it

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.370 
mechanism to play the video to start it
back<00:02:19.980> up<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.820> do<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.090> we<00:02:21.630> know<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:21.930> we<00:02:22.200> want

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
back up to do that we know that we want

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.230 
back up to do that we know that we want
them<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.560> click<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.310> pepper<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:24.030> we're<00:02:24.150> going

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
them to click the pepper so we're going

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.810 
them to click the pepper so we're going
to<00:02:24.330> add<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.510> hotspot<00:02:25.320> right<00:02:25.590> over<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.580> top<00:02:26.790> of

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
to add a hotspot right over the top of

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.330 
to add a hotspot right over the top of
those<00:02:27.150> peppers<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:28.470> playhead<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.100> still

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
those peppers the playhead is still

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.370 
those peppers the playhead is still
right<00:02:29.700> there<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:30.210> we<00:02:30.330> want<00:02:30.510> this<00:02:30.690> hotspot<00:02:30.900> to

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
right there so we want this hotspot to

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.680 
right there so we want this hotspot to
appear<00:02:31.710> right<00:02:31.980> when<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.280> rectangle<00:02:32.820> does<00:02:33.000> ok

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
appear right when the rectangle does ok

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.770 
appear right when the rectangle does ok
so<00:02:33.750> it's<00:02:34.170> they<00:02:34.980> can't<00:02:35.250> click<00:02:35.520> on<00:02:35.550> it<00:02:35.700> until<00:02:36.000> the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
so it's they can't click on it until the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.290 
so it's they can't click on it until the
rectangle<00:02:37.290> -<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.470> video<00:02:37.710> pauses<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.400> on<00:02:39.120> this

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
rectangle - the video pauses and on this

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.050 
rectangle - the video pauses and on this
hotspot<00:02:39.510> we're<00:02:40.050> going<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.530> add<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.730> trigger

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
hotspot we're going to add the trigger

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.680 
hotspot we're going to add the trigger
to<00:02:42.510> play<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.560> medium<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.160> was<00:02:44.400> paused<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.330> now

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
to play the medium it was paused and now

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.170 
to play the medium it was paused and now
the<00:02:45.750> hotspot<00:02:46.410> will<00:02:46.680> pick<00:02:47.460> it<00:02:47.580> back<00:02:47.700> up<00:02:47.760> and

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
the hotspot will pick it back up and

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.090 
the hotspot will pick it back up and
begin<00:02:48.420> playing<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:48.930> again<00:02:49.020> when<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.920> user

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
begin playing it again when the user

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.340 
begin playing it again when the user
clicks<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.760> hotspot<00:02:51.600> so<00:02:51.780> we've<00:02:51.900> got<00:02:52.050> our<00:02:52.170> two

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
clicks the hotspot so we've got our two

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.900 
clicks the hotspot so we've got our two
pieces<00:02:52.380> that's<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.220> simple<00:02:53.580> underlying

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
pieces that's the simple underlying

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.480 
pieces that's the simple underlying
mechanism<00:02:54.810> we<00:02:55.320> use<00:02:55.440> an<00:02:55.560> off-screen<00:02:55.860> object<00:02:56.400> to

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
mechanism we use an off-screen object to

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.910 
mechanism we use an off-screen object to
pause<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.880> video<00:02:57.170> hotspot<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.350> begin<00:02:58.620> playing

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
pause the video hotspot to begin playing

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.790 
pause the video hotspot to begin playing
it<00:02:59.130> again<00:02:59.220> however<00:03:00.090> there's<00:03:00.480> one<00:03:00.800> slight

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
it again however there's one slight

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
things up for us that's not what we want

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.900 
things up for us that's not what we want
to<00:03:21.120> have<00:03:21.300> happen<00:03:21.510> behaviorally<00:03:22.640> so<00:03:23.640> what<00:03:23.820> we

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
to have happen behaviorally so what we

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.540 
to have happen behaviorally so what we
need<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.300> do<00:03:24.510> is<00:03:24.750> disallow<00:03:25.739> that<00:03:25.769> we<00:03:26.250> need<00:03:26.400> to

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
need to do is disallow that we need to

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.979 
need to do is disallow that we need to
not<00:03:26.700> allow<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.030> learner<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:27.570> click<00:03:27.780> on<00:03:27.900> the

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
not allow the learner to click on the

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.250 
not allow the learner to click on the
video<00:03:29.180> really<00:03:30.180> is<00:03:30.360> what<00:03:30.660> we<00:03:30.810> want<00:03:30.989> here<00:03:31.200> so

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
video really is what we want here so

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.449 
video really is what we want here so
what<00:03:31.530> we're<00:03:31.650> going<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:31.800> do<00:03:31.950> in<00:03:32.130> keeping<00:03:32.430> with

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
what we're going to do in keeping with

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.710 
what we're going to do in keeping with
the<00:03:32.670> cooking<00:03:32.880> metaphor<00:03:33.420> is<00:03:33.480> we're<00:03:33.570> going<00:03:33.660> to

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
the cooking metaphor is we're going to

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.630 
the cooking metaphor is we're going to
saran<00:03:34.140> wrap<00:03:34.380> this<00:03:34.620> thing<00:03:34.890> we're<00:03:35.400> going<00:03:35.489> to<00:03:35.580> put

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
saran wrap this thing we're going to put

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.430 
saran wrap this thing we're going to put
a<00:03:35.760> protective<00:03:36.330> barrier<00:03:36.630> in<00:03:36.959> this<00:03:37.080> case<00:03:37.290> a

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
a protective barrier in this case a

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.610 
a protective barrier in this case a
hotspot<00:03:38.040> between<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:39.360> video<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:40.019> the

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
hotspot between the video and the

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.350 
hotspot between the video and the
learners<00:03:40.950> Mouse<00:03:41.220> I'm<00:03:41.730> going<00:03:41.910> to<00:03:41.970> cover<00:03:42.150> the

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
learners Mouse I'm going to cover the

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.810 
learners Mouse I'm going to cover the
entire<00:03:42.390> timeline<00:03:43.290> with<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.590> as<00:03:43.739> well<00:03:43.980> what

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
entire timeline with that as well what

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.220 
entire timeline with that as well what
will<00:03:44.940> happen<00:03:45.180> now<00:03:45.540> is<00:03:45.780> when<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.050> learner

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
will happen now is when the learner

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.830 
will happen now is when the learner
comes<00:03:46.530> out<00:03:46.709> here<00:03:47.070> when<00:03:47.400> they<00:03:47.550> click<00:03:47.880> it's<00:03:48.600> not

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
comes out here when they click it's not

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.720 
comes out here when they click it's not
going<00:03:49.140> to<00:03:49.260> pause<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:50.100> video<00:03:50.220> they're

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
going to pause the video they're

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.520 
going to pause the video they're
clicking<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.180> hotspot<00:03:51.660> they<00:03:52.080> don't<00:03:52.230> see<00:03:52.410> it

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
clicking the hotspot they don't see it

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.550 
clicking the hotspot they don't see it
but<00:03:52.769> it's<00:03:52.950> there<00:03:53.750> now<00:03:54.750> what<00:03:54.959> we<00:03:55.110> all<00:03:55.230> we<00:03:55.410> have

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
but it's there now what we all we have

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.800 
but it's there now what we all we have
to<00:03:55.709> do<00:03:55.890> is<00:03:56.190> take<00:03:56.519> our<00:03:56.670> little<00:03:56.700> hotspot<00:03:57.390> that<00:03:57.420> we

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
to do is take our little hotspot that we

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.630 
to do is take our little hotspot that we
do<00:03:58.019> want<00:03:58.230> them<00:03:58.320> to<00:03:58.380> click<00:03:58.620> move<00:03:58.920> it<00:03:59.070> to<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.430> top

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
do want them to click move it to the top

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.270 
do want them to click move it to the top
so<00:03:59.940> it<00:04:00.060> is<00:04:00.150> above<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:01.200> big<00:04:01.650> protective

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
so it is above the big protective

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.460 
so it is above the big protective
hotspot<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:02.940> now<00:04:03.570> this<00:04:03.870> is<00:04:04.080> really<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:04.440> only

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
hotspot and now this is really the only

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.140 
hotspot and now this is really the only
thing<00:04:04.800> that's<00:04:05.160> going<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.340> cause<00:04:05.550> any<00:04:05.580> action

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
thing that's going to cause any action

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.390 
thing that's going to cause any action
to<00:04:06.209> take<00:04:06.360> place<00:04:06.420> on<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:07.260> screen<00:04:07.620> so<00:04:08.370> we

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
to take place on the screen so we

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.789 
to take place on the screen so we
preview<00:04:08.910> this<00:04:09.030> once<00:04:09.300> again<00:04:09.660> videos<00:04:10.530> going<00:04:10.709> to

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
preview this once again videos going to

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.539 
preview this once again videos going to

it's<00:04:15.540> going<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:15.959> pause<00:04:16.200> and<00:04:17.120> then<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.150> learner

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
it's going to pause and then the learner

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.940 
it's going to pause and then the learner
can<00:04:18.630> click<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:18.959> peppers<00:04:19.290> to<00:04:19.320> get<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:19.709> play

once again that's the underlying

adding<00:04:25.110> an<00:04:25.200> extra<00:04:25.440> hotspot<00:04:26.010> giving<00:04:26.490> some

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
adding an extra hotspot giving some

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.890 
adding an extra hotspot giving some
feedback<00:04:26.669> with<00:04:27.180> layer

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
feedback with layer

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.560

that's<00:04:28.200> easy<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:28.710> add<00:04:28.860> in<00:04:29.190> but<00:04:30.120> this<00:04:30.300> is<00:04:30.360> the

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
that's easy to add in but this is the

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.540 
that's easy to add in but this is the
underlying<00:04:30.840> functionality<00:04:31.560> and<00:04:31.980> there's<00:04:32.220> so

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
underlying functionality and there's so

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.800 
underlying functionality and there's so
many<00:04:32.790> different<00:04:33.150> things<00:04:33.240> that<00:04:33.330> you<00:04:33.480> can<00:04:33.600> do
