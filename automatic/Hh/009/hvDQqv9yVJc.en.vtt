00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.219
 salvation has both revealed are for 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:14.589
 a new video rather an ad a 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.699
 little bit it's been a long time since I have not 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.080
 found a video that pretty much 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:21.220
 finally that I have not post videos 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.720
 sorry it's going to be two weeks late 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.880
 of week and the last video I have 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.150
 posted it had to be I believe that 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.810
 it was sure attack of the new world or 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.610
 something like that 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.860
 and so that's why do I have 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.930
 not seen this video simply because 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.250
 I had a little problem with my boxing 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.510
 ie in fact she who is 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.770
 dead wholesale to play the banks and 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.660
 fix all that but it is not that of 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.930
 post a video here I could turn 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.060
 but not to the sides and suddenly that's so 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.040
 I pass you the little video for you 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.420
 ask several questions and you 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.940
 explain a little bit what will happen 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.320
 then go on my channel so 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.440
 as you know I turn a lot 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.510
 mainly even tutorials so 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.860
 you should the modern etc 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:09.210
 and I also have my series that started 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:13.030
 his name is called 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.700
 attack like that is talking to us so I wanted 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.570
 actually ask you a little bit 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.760
 what do you want me to do 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.280
 so I will continue to 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.650
 attack again - that's for sure but 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.150
 what do we do so maybe I wanted 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.060
 to get started in building a 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.100
 town so far let's train a little tutorial 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.830
 little do you see so by doing a little 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.229
 every building we could approach 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.640
 all that with modern houses and 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.260
 thus aiming warning if you can 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.920
 I really like the ultra modern style 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:45.250
 modern so building a city 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.530
 like that and but slowing down a 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.650
 little bit but episodes on the road because of 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.360
 of double maybe not finally the 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.420
 slowing down what does not know it yet 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.799
 how much but slowing down I'm 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.630
 dropped in when slowing them down and 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.860
 then here and then maybe also towards 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.840
 multiplayer videos like I did 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.820
 before with other characters of 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.700
 characters with others if others 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.700
 people per month they described 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.220
 upper 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.260
 and especially if you want me 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.730
 make another game I can donate 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.440
 for example think especially of league of 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.730
 legends game often right now so 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.010
 here I can make videos league of 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.810
 legends if you want I can do some 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.190
 videos so on building a 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.870
 life so tell me a little bit and tutorial 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.190
 you want all that so regroup me 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.130
 all this in the comments 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.330
 do you really need to go to 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.610
 bottom nor your comments since there 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.870
 I honestly admit that I know more 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.040
 too much what to do on my youtube channel 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.849
 here I always want to continue 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.470
 youtube videos and all that 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.640
 I'm still interested so much there's no 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.130
 worries it'll more I too 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.769
 of ideas because you level touba I 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.239
 did I still did a lot of 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.560
 late tutorials I was and I really wanted 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.440
 my goal was to do a little more 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.209
 early that have not been done except that low 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.040
 on youtube are a lot of things that get 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.450
 do and everything and I think I've done in 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.360
 the modern in any case at least in this 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.430
 that I know how to do a lot of things have 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.090
 been done after I can do some 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.829
 reproductions of other reproductions 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.810
 games see if you saw like me 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.269
 things you do not get to do I 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.030
 do not know it's a bit of you to see 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:13.090
 give me really things about 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.049
 very modern games 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.340
 for example modern fighting games 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.540
 so the pressure I have no idea but 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.980
 I do not know any ships if there was 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.959
 vessels you took you back the 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.850
 things like that do not hesitate to tell me 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.620
 in the comments of this video 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.239
 did report me with the inter if I 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.100
 take it all 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.630
 and so here is after next video 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.420
 I do not know maybe an attack video 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.769
 as it is us attack of the new booba 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.180
 we'll have a little bit so I'll get you 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.500
 launches now i would tell you that this 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.019
 we're going to do I wish I could 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.600
 explore the tropics rapt mode 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.549
 so here we are going to listen to friends 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.540
 I hope this video in this 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.790
 video you're going to put a lot of 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.260
 comments after them but these are these 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.260
 anosy videos is not much 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.849
 to say the word about what friends we suffer 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.250
 for a next video so surely 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.120
 on attack of the double recognition 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.810
 move well 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.810
 charles everyone
