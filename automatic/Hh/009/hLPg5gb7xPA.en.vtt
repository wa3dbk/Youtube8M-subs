00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
tea kettle in my move but I do recommend

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.640 
tea kettle in my move but I do recommend
using<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.850> tea<00:00:18.060> kettle<00:00:18.270> instead<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.350> why<00:00:19.590> I

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
using a tea kettle instead this is why I

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.290 
using a tea kettle instead this is why I
have<00:00:19.830> two<00:00:20.039> cups<00:00:20.310> because<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.699> have<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.090> start

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
have two cups because you have to start

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.179 
have two cups because you have to start
off<00:00:21.480> with<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.750> small<00:00:22.020> amount<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.350> water<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:23.130> I

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
off with a small amount of water so I

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.939 
off with a small amount of water so I
just<00:00:23.400> pour<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:24.150> little<00:00:24.689> bit<00:00:24.930> into<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.439> different

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
just pour a little bit into a different

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.690 
just pour a little bit into a different
cup<00:00:26.359> to<00:00:27.439> get<00:00:28.439> started<00:00:31.340> so<00:00:32.340> then<00:00:32.489> you're<00:00:32.610> going

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
cup to get started so then you're going

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.430 
cup to get started so then you're going
to<00:00:32.790> just<00:00:32.969> put<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.149> teaspoon<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.170> tea<00:00:34.320> in

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
to just put a teaspoon of the tea in

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.020 
to just put a teaspoon of the tea in
there<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.739> by<00:00:34.829> teaspoon<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.340> mean<00:00:35.489> actually<00:00:36.000> a

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
there and by teaspoon I mean actually a

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.869 
there and by teaspoon I mean actually a
Japanese<00:00:36.660> tea<00:00:36.870> spoon<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.260> believe<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:37.649> called

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
Japanese tea spoon I believe it's called

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.090 
Japanese tea spoon I believe it's called
not<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.239> full<00:00:39.660> teaspoon<00:00:39.870> like<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.530> right<00:00:40.770> here

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
not a full teaspoon like this right here

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.950 
not a full teaspoon like this right here
that's<00:00:41.579> way<00:00:41.850> too<00:00:41.879> much<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.450> think<00:00:42.690> that's<00:00:42.840> why

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
that's way too much I think that's why

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.869 
that's way too much I think that's why
people<00:00:43.140> like<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.440> tasted<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.129> gross<00:00:44.489> they<00:00:44.700> put

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
people like it tasted so gross they put

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.299 
people like it tasted so gross they put
way<00:00:45.120> too<00:00:45.149> much<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.780> their<00:00:46.079> water<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.100> then<00:00:47.190> it

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
way too much in their water and then it

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.770 
way too much in their water and then it
does<00:00:47.489> taste<00:00:47.730> kind<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:48.059> gross<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.450> it's<00:00:48.600> just

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
does taste kind of gross and it's just

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.279 
does taste kind of gross and it's just
weird

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
weird

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.170 
weird
so<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.489> amount<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.879> should<00:00:51.120> be

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
so that is the amount that you should be

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.250 
so that is the amount that you should be
using<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.809> your<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.170> your<00:00:52.230> water<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:54.020> this<00:00:55.020> mug

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
using in your in your water and this mug

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.920 
using in your in your water and this mug
is<00:00:55.410> about<00:00:55.590> 16<00:00:56.100> ounces<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.640> think<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.449> little

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
is about 16 ounces I think so a little

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.959 
is about 16 ounces I think so a little
goes<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> long<00:00:58.559> way<00:00:58.829> then<00:00:59.489> you're<00:00:59.609> just<00:00:59.699> going

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
goes a long way then you're just going

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.119 
goes a long way then you're just going
to<00:01:00.000> take<00:01:00.180> your<00:01:00.329> electric<00:01:00.719> mixer<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.320> mix<00:01:01.829> it

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
to take your electric mixer and mix it

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.240 
to take your electric mixer and mix it
up<00:01:02.870> which<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.049> highly<00:01:04.500> recommend<00:01:04.949> getting<00:01:05.070> one

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
up which I highly recommend getting one

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.740 
up which I highly recommend getting one
of<00:01:05.369> these<00:01:05.519> because<00:01:05.850> mixing<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.510> with<00:01:06.570> a

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
of these because mixing this with a

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.050 
of these because mixing this with a
whisk<00:01:07.020> or<00:01:07.229> something<00:01:07.530> else<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.860> just<00:01:08.040> too<00:01:08.790> long

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
whisk or something else is just too long

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.929 
whisk or something else is just too long
too<00:01:09.659> tedious<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.560> ain't<00:01:11.070> nobody<00:01:11.340> got<00:01:11.670> time

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
too tedious and ain't nobody got time

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.080 
too tedious and ain't nobody got time
for<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:13.590> want<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.040> just<00:01:14.220> get<00:01:14.909> one<00:01:15.060> of

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
for that so you want to just get one of

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.910 
for that so you want to just get one of
these<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:15.570> 17<00:01:15.990> bucks<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.409> think<00:01:16.470> it's<00:01:16.710> worth

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
these it's 17 bucks I think it's worth

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.520 
these it's 17 bucks I think it's worth
it<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.280> battery-operated<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.509> get<00:01:18.930> your

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530

money's<00:01:19.920> worth<00:01:19.950> for<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.509> just<00:01:21.689> mix<00:01:21.869> it

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
money's worth for it and you just mix it

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.840 
money's worth for it and you just mix it
up<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.380> then<00:01:22.439> you're<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.340> going<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.549> end<00:01:23.700> up

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
up and then you're just going to end up

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.130

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
pouring the rest of the water into this

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.230 
pouring the rest of the water into this
cup<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.409> then<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.979> have<00:01:29.189> your<00:01:29.340> cup<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.880> green
