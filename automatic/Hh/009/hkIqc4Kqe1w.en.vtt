want to do it in the microwave for 30
seconds<00:01:17.549> yeah<00:01:17.850> take<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.150> out<00:01:18.330> stirred<00:01:18.630> then<00:01:18.990> 20

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
seconds yeah take it out stirred then 20

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.929 
seconds yeah take it out stirred then 20
seconds<00:01:19.740> stir<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.250> then<00:01:20.400> 10<00:01:20.580> seconds

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
seconds stir it and then 10 seconds

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.399 
seconds stir it and then 10 seconds
start<00:01:21.150> because<00:01:21.600> if<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.810> just<00:01:21.990> microwave<00:01:22.350> it

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
start because if you just microwave it

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.960 
start because if you just microwave it
for<00:01:22.470> 60<00:01:22.799> seconds<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.250> going<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.520> burn<00:01:23.729> and

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
for 60 seconds it's going to burn and

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.520 
for 60 seconds it's going to burn and
it'll<00:01:24.119> be<00:01:24.210> too<00:01:24.390> hot<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.780> pop<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.200> balloon<00:01:25.380> and

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
it'll be too hot and pop the balloon and

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.960 
it'll be too hot and pop the balloon and
that'll<00:01:25.740> make<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> mess<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.369> your<00:01:26.400> kitchen<00:01:26.520> and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
that'll make a mess of your kitchen and

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.969 
that'll make a mess of your kitchen and
don't<00:01:27.119> worry<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:28.259> now<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.680> think<00:01:28.710> I've

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
don't worry so now that I think I've

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.550 
don't worry so now that I think I've
talked<00:01:29.220> enough<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.729> cooled<00:01:30.439> so<00:01:31.439> we're

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
talked enough this is cooled so we're

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.710 
talked enough this is cooled so we're
gonna<00:01:31.650> take<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.040> little<00:01:32.340> bit<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.119> green<00:01:33.329> and

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
gonna take a little bit of the green and

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.819 
gonna take a little bit of the green and
actually<00:01:34.170> trace<00:01:34.290> if<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.470> want<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.650> hold<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
actually trace if you want to hold the

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.969 
actually trace if you want to hold the
balloon<00:01:35.990> will<00:01:36.990> not<00:01:37.200> get<00:01:37.380> chocolate<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.829> you

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
balloon will not get chocolate on you

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.190 
balloon will not get chocolate on you
it's<00:01:38.250> there<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:39.210> there<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.540> some<00:01:39.750> method<00:01:39.930> to

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
it's there so there is some method to

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.870 
it's there so there is some method to
this<00:01:40.320> too<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.680> was<00:01:41.159> just<00:01:41.310> gonna<00:01:41.369> take<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.729> bowl

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
this too I was just gonna take the bowl

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.370 
this too I was just gonna take the bowl
and<00:01:42.030> throw<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.299> on<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.630> can't<00:01:42.899> do<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.290> I

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
and throw it on you can't do that and I

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.539 
and throw it on you can't do that and I
also<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.619> really<00:01:43.799> easy<00:01:43.979> way<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.250> doing<00:01:44.430> these

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
also a really easy way of doing these

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.249 
also a really easy way of doing these
once<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.880> just<00:01:45.060> dip<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.390> into<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.780> large<00:01:45.990> size

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
once you just dip it into the large size

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.780 
once you just dip it into the large size
Bowl<00:01:46.530> put<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.009> out<00:01:47.070> put<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.369> on<00:01:47.460> parchment

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
Bowl put it out put it on parchment

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.460 
Bowl put it out put it on parchment
paper<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.360> put<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.720> freezer<00:01:48.869> for<00:01:49.229> 20

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
paper and put it in the freezer for 20

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.230 
paper and put it in the freezer for 20
minutes<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.829> voila<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.759> one<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> little

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
minutes and voila this one is a little

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.490 
minutes and voila this one is a little
bit<00:01:51.420> more<00:01:51.509> complicated<00:01:51.840> because<00:01:52.079> we've<00:01:52.380> got

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
bit more complicated because we've got

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.310 
bit more complicated because we've got
the<00:01:52.619> color<00:01:52.799> striation<00:01:53.430> going<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.930> right<00:01:54.930> we're

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
the color striation going on right we're

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.580 
the color striation going on right we're
gonna<00:01:55.409> do<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> little<00:01:56.899> drop<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.469> middle

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
gonna do a little drop in the middle

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.170 
gonna do a little drop in the middle
just<00:01:58.950> like<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.579> does<00:01:59.909> have<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.090> be

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
just like that it does have to be

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.770 
just like that it does have to be

home I did a sheet of plywood so that I
didn't<00:05:49.110> have<00:05:49.229> to<00:05:49.320> glue<00:05:49.470> it<00:05:49.590> onto<00:05:49.710> the<00:05:49.830> wall

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
didn't have to glue it onto the wall

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.710 
didn't have to glue it onto the wall
yeah<00:05:50.370> in<00:05:50.729> this<00:05:50.880> case<00:05:51.120> she's<00:05:51.570> obviously

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
yeah in this case she's obviously

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.120 
yeah in this case she's obviously
applied<00:05:52.080> them<00:05:52.200> to<00:05:52.290> the<00:05:52.350> wall<00:05:52.500> but<00:05:52.830> I<00:05:52.919> think

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
applied them to the wall but I think

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.590 
applied them to the wall but I think
she's<00:05:53.250> done<00:05:53.370> such<00:05:53.610> an<00:05:53.700> exceptional<00:05:54.240> job<00:05:54.270> and

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
she's done such an exceptional job and

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.820 
she's done such an exceptional job and
the<00:05:54.660> accessorizing<00:05:55.110> and<00:05:55.350> everything<00:05:55.680> is<00:05:55.800> just

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
the accessorizing and everything is just

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.580 
the accessorizing and everything is just
so<00:05:56.610> perfect<00:05:56.850> but<00:05:57.270> what<00:05:57.720> she<00:05:57.930> has<00:05:58.140> done<00:05:58.169> which

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
so perfect but what she has done which

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:59.719
