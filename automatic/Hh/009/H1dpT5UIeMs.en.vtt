00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
the boom will actually turn off so it's

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.730 
the boom will actually turn off so it's
like<00:04:16.360> a<00:04:16.390> wireless<00:04:16.780> remote<00:04:16.959> and<00:04:17.350> I<00:04:17.410> find<00:04:17.680> this

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:17.740 
like a wireless remote and I find this

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.620 
like a wireless remote and I find this
to<00:04:17.860> be<00:04:17.890> pretty<00:04:18.130> cool<00:04:18.459> if<00:04:19.150> we<00:04:19.209> wait<00:04:19.450> a<00:04:19.540> couple

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
to be pretty cool if we wait a couple

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.540 
to be pretty cool if we wait a couple
more<00:04:19.990> seconds<00:04:20.500> you'll<00:04:20.650> see<00:04:20.830> that<00:04:20.950> their<00:04:21.040> power

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:21.550 
more seconds you'll see that their power

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.400 
more seconds you'll see that their power
button<00:04:21.790> will<00:04:22.000> return<00:04:22.330> and<00:04:22.960> we<00:04:23.050> can<00:04:23.170> turn<00:04:23.290> the

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
button will return and we can turn the

device<00:04:23.530> on<00:04:23.860> now<00:04:24.160> it'll<00:04:25.120> turn<00:04:25.270> on<00:04:25.330> with<00:04:25.660> this

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
device on now it'll turn on with this

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.330 
device on now it'll turn on with this
sound<00:04:25.990> and<00:04:26.350> they'll<00:04:26.500> give<00:04:26.770> us<00:04:26.890> the<00:04:27.010> pairing

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
sound and they'll give us the pairing

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.330 
sound and they'll give us the pairing
sound<00:04:27.640> as<00:04:27.880> well<00:04:28.410> once<00:04:29.410> it's<00:04:29.590> paired<00:04:29.830> that

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
sound as well once it's paired that

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.890 
sound as well once it's paired that
power<00:04:30.880> button<00:04:31.120> will<00:04:31.270> be<00:04:31.390> available<00:04:31.780> once

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
power button will be available once

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.440 
power button will be available once
again<00:04:32.320> so<00:04:33.160> the<00:04:33.340> app<00:04:33.490> doesn't<00:04:33.760> have<00:04:34.000> too<00:04:34.270> much

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
again so the app doesn't have too much

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.960 
again so the app doesn't have too much
going<00:04:34.690> on<00:04:34.930> besides<00:04:35.380> that<00:04:35.620> double<00:04:36.310> up<00:04:36.430> if<00:04:36.670> you

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
have two booms an equaliser for

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.310 
have two booms an equaliser for

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
and jump into a music test to see how

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:24.070 
and jump into a music test to see how
this<00:04:55.240> thing<00:04:55.450> performs<00:04:55.870> all<00:04:56.590> right

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.350 

all<00:05:25.080> right<00:05:25.380> so<00:05:25.620> that<00:05:25.800> is<00:05:25.980> the<00:05:26.010> UE<00:05:26.370> boom<00:05:26.760> I

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
all right so that is the UE boom I

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.240 
all right so that is the UE boom I
pretty<00:05:28.050> much<00:05:28.170> recovered<00:05:28.410> everything<00:05:29.010> there's

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
pretty much recovered everything there's

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.500 
pretty much recovered everything there's
just<00:05:29.370> a<00:05:29.460> few<00:05:29.580> other<00:05:29.790> things<00:05:29.850> I<00:05:30.180> wanted<00:05:30.450> to

just a few other things I wanted to

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.900 
just a few other things I wanted to
mention<00:05:30.720> as<00:05:31.020> a<00:05:31.080> bit<00:05:31.380> of<00:05:31.470> a<00:05:31.560> wrap-up<00:05:31.830> first<00:05:32.670> vlog

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
mention as a bit of a wrap-up first vlog

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.240 
mention as a bit of a wrap-up first vlog
that's<00:05:33.210> mentioned<00:05:33.720> that<00:05:33.870> there<00:05:34.050> is<00:05:34.080> a<00:05:34.320> 50-foot

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
that's mentioned that there is a 50-foot

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.870 
that's mentioned that there is a 50-foot
range

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
range

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.140 
range
according<00:05:36.540> to<00:05:36.570> Altima<00:05:37.530> tears<00:05:37.860> however<00:05:38.820> from

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
according to Altima tears however from

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.180 
according to Altima tears however from
my<00:05:39.210> experience<00:05:40.110> I<00:05:40.260> think<00:05:40.620> it's<00:05:40.800> a<00:05:40.860> little<00:05:41.070> bit

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
my experience I think it's a little bit

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.430 
my experience I think it's a little bit
less<00:05:41.520> than<00:05:41.700> that<00:05:41.810> especially<00:05:42.810> if<00:05:42.960> you<00:05:43.050> cover

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
less than that especially if you cover

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.230 
less than that especially if you cover
it<00:05:43.620> a<00:05:43.800> little<00:05:43.860> bit<00:05:44.130> with<00:05:44.250> your<00:05:44.370> body<00:05:44.670> you're

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240

connection does break up and you do have
a<00:05:48.990> few<00:05:49.260> issues<00:05:49.470> however<00:05:50.310> if<00:05:50.820> there<00:05:51.090> is<00:05:51.270> a<00:05:51.300> clear

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
a few issues however if there is a clear

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.740 
a few issues however if there is a clear
sight<00:05:52.170> up<00:05:52.620> to<00:05:52.920> the<00:05:53.100> boom<00:05:53.430> I<00:05:53.640> would<00:05:53.850> say<00:05:54.000> 50<00:05:54.420> feet

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
sight up to the boom I would say 50 feet

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.380 
sight up to the boom I would say 50 feet
also<00:05:55.710> I<00:05:55.740> was<00:05:56.010> incorrect<00:05:56.520> in<00:05:56.610> saying<00:05:56.880> that<00:05:57.120> a<00:05:57.210> 10

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
also I was incorrect in saying that a 10

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.290 
also I was incorrect in saying that a 10
hour<00:05:57.570> battery<00:05:57.600> life<00:05:57.900> is<00:05:58.080> actually<00:05:58.530> 15<00:05:59.310> so<00:05:59.970> an

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
hour battery life is actually 15 so an

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.300 
hour battery life is actually 15 so an
extra<00:06:00.750> five<00:06:00.900> hours<00:06:01.230> for<00:06:01.440> you<00:06:01.530> there<00:06:01.740> it<00:06:02.130> makes

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
extra five hours for you there it makes

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.750 
extra five hours for you there it makes
it<00:06:02.430> even<00:06:02.520> better<00:06:02.730> of<00:06:03.270> advice<00:06:03.720> in<00:06:03.960> my<00:06:04.110> opinion

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760
