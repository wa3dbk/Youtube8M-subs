00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
having half chances and i think the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.930 
having half chances and i think the
closest<00:02:49.140> they<00:02:49.260> came<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.769> scoring<00:02:50.069> was<00:02:50.700> when

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
closest they came to scoring was when

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.789 
closest they came to scoring was when
they<00:02:51.060> had<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.209> corner<00:02:51.720> go<00:02:51.959> be<00:02:52.019> a<00:02:52.109> bongo<00:02:52.590> whore

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
they had a corner go be a bongo whore

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.770 
they had a corner go be a bongo whore
headed<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.549> to<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.790> top<00:02:54.000> corner<00:02:54.269> but<00:02:54.569> our

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
headed it to the top corner but our

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.410 
headed it to the top corner but our
sergio<00:02:55.410> romero<00:02:55.739> grabbed<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.489> and<00:02:56.519> now<00:02:56.849> i<00:02:57.030> think

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
sergio romero grabbed it and now i think

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.000 
sergio romero grabbed it and now i think
that<00:02:57.569> was<00:02:57.720> their<00:02:57.959> only<00:02:58.200> shot<00:02:58.379> for<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.829> whole

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
that was their only shot for the whole

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.490 
that was their only shot for the whole
game<00:02:59.280> if<00:03:00.060> i'm<00:03:00.239> mistaken<00:03:00.390> it<00:03:01.079> was<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.290> bit

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
game if i'm mistaken it was a bit

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.440 
game if i'm mistaken it was a bit
worrying<00:03:01.890> her<00:03:02.010> in<00:03:02.129> that<00:03:02.250> time<00:03:02.519> for<00:03:02.940> me<00:03:03.060> the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
worrying her in that time for me the

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.750 
worrying her in that time for me the
most<00:03:03.599> critical<00:03:03.930> part<00:03:04.230> of<00:03:04.590> this<00:03:04.709> game<00:03:05.010> is<00:03:05.220> when

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
most critical part of this game is when

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.670 
most critical part of this game is when

in<00:03:39.030> this<00:03:39.269> team<00:03:39.510> in<00:03:39.660> my<00:03:39.750> opinion<00:03:40.109> Rooney<00:03:40.950> he

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
in this team in my opinion Rooney he

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.039 
in this team in my opinion Rooney he
wasn't<00:03:41.669> the<00:03:41.730> best<00:03:41.970> you<00:03:42.209> can<00:03:42.329> say<00:03:42.540> but<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.810> think

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
wasn't the best you can say but I think

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.629 
wasn't the best you can say but I think
it's<00:03:43.169> more<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.470> chance<00:03:43.799> I'm<00:03:44.069> sorry<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:44.459> think

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
it's more the chance I'm sorry I think

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.159 
it's more the chance I'm sorry I think
it's<00:03:44.760> more<00:03:44.819> the<00:03:45.060> reason<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.389> we're<00:03:45.930> not<00:03:46.049> even

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
it's more the reason that we're not even

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:47.599 
it's more the reason that we're not even
creating<00:03:46.590> chances<00:03:46.829> so<00:03:47.190> if<00:03:47.250> we're<00:03:47.400> not<00:03:47.489> even

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
creating chances so if we're not even

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.939 
creating chances so if we're not even
created<00:03:47.970> chanting<00:03:48.389> our<00:03:48.750> chances<00:03:49.290> how<00:03:49.470> is<00:03:49.769> he

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
created chanting our chances how is he

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:52.280 
created chanting our chances how is he
meant<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.400> score<00:03:50.849> so<00:03:51.419> I<00:03:51.449> guess<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:51.989> could<00:03:52.109> say

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
meant to score so I guess you could say

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.629 
meant to score so I guess you could say
you<00:03:52.349> could<00:03:52.590> put<00:03:52.739> it<00:03:52.799> down<00:03:52.919> to<00:03:53.129> that<00:03:53.280> that<00:03:53.489> was

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
you could put it down to that that was

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.520 
you could put it down to that that was
the<00:03:53.790> exact<00:03:54.090> same<00:03:54.299> starting<00:03:54.930> eleven<00:03:55.290> as<00:03:55.410> the

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
the exact same starting eleven as the

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.559 
the exact same starting eleven as the
Tottenham<00:03:55.889> game<00:03:56.069> except<00:03:56.819> that<00:03:57.030> Adnan<00:03:57.299> januzaj

Tottenham game except that Adnan januzaj

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.140 
Tottenham game except that Adnan januzaj

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
higher in there the let's played in a

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.100 
higher in there the let's played in a
World<00:05:29.650> Cup<00:05:30.000> final<00:05:31.000> he's<00:05:31.360> used<00:05:31.690> to<00:05:31.840> the<00:05:31.930> big

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
games and he's not really getting tested

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.240 
games and he's not really getting tested
so<00:05:34.389> we<00:05:34.510> can't<00:05:34.750> really<00:05:34.960> make<00:05:35.470> a<00:05:35.530> decision<00:05:36.130> on

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
so we can't really make a decision on

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740

chances<00:05:45.370> but<00:05:45.610> I'm<00:05:46.120> just<00:05:46.449> nitpicking<00:05:46.960> if<00:05:47.199> I'm

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
chances but I'm just nitpicking if I'm

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.990 
chances but I'm just nitpicking if I'm
telling<00:05:47.500> the<00:05:47.680> truth<00:05:47.770> so<00:05:48.190> anyway<00:05:48.490> says<00:05:48.699> we<00:05:48.820> got

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000
