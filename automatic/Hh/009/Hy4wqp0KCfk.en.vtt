different funny movement steps like this

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.430 
different funny movement steps like this
to<00:00:10.740> make<00:00:10.980> this<00:00:11.250> you<00:00:11.490> need<00:00:11.670> one<00:00:12.000> lr44<00:00:12.540> battery

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
to make this you need one lr44 battery

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.680 
to make this you need one lr44 battery

so<00:00:22.529> shoulder<00:00:22.920> all<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.269> components<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.390> series

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
so shoulder all the components in series

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:33.020 
so shoulder all the components in series
connection<00:00:25.500> after<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:26.220> cut<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.820> extra<00:00:27.029> PCB

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.240 

now<00:00:34.030> put<00:00:34.300> the<00:00:34.450> lr44<00:00:34.900> you<00:00:35.470> can<00:00:35.710> see<00:00:35.950> the<00:00:36.070> motor

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
now put the lr44 you can see the motor

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.350 
now put the lr44 you can see the motor
is<00:00:36.460> rotating<00:00:36.610> you<00:00:37.540> need<00:00:37.840> a<00:00:38.670> aluminum<00:00:39.670> metal

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:16.170 

and<00:01:09.750> bend<00:01:10.750> it<00:01:12.930> then<00:01:13.930> take<00:01:14.440> a<00:01:14.470> glue<00:01:14.890> stick<00:01:15.180> from

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
and bend it then take a glue stick from

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
and bend it then take a glue stick from
the<00:01:16.240> stick<00:01:16.720> cut<00:01:17.400> our<00:01:18.400> one<00:01:18.970> centimeter<00:01:19.720> long

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
the stick cut our one centimeter long

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.440 
the stick cut our one centimeter long
glue<00:01:21.190> stay<00:01:22.030> push<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.740> aluminum<00:01:24.640> plate<00:01:24.910> there

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
glue stay push the aluminum plate there

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.760 
glue stay push the aluminum plate there
and<00:01:25.830> glue<00:01:26.830> it<00:01:26.980> on<00:01:27.220> the<00:01:27.550> other<00:01:27.670> side<00:01:28.500> punch<00:01:29.500> a

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
and glue it on the other side punch a

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.070 
and glue it on the other side punch a
hole<00:01:30.070> using<00:01:30.640> a<00:01:30.910> pin

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.720 

and<00:01:35.400> then<00:01:36.400> push<00:01:36.940> it<00:01:37.120> in<00:01:37.770> if<00:01:38.770> you<00:01:38.950> switch<00:01:39.220> on<00:01:39.460> you

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
and then push it in if you switch on you

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.020 
and then push it in if you switch on you
can<00:01:39.910> see<00:01:40.150> the<00:01:40.480> tool<00:01:41.350> is<00:01:41.500> rotating<00:01:42.040> but<00:01:42.550> to<00:01:42.820> make

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
can see the tool is rotating but to make

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.360 
can see the tool is rotating but to make
the<00:01:43.210> legs<00:01:43.420> you<00:01:43.750> need<00:01:44.140> thick<00:01:44.650> copper<00:01:44.920> words

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
the legs you need thick copper words

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.830 
the legs you need thick copper words
like<00:01:45.700> this<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:47.140> can<00:01:47.320> easily<00:01:47.470> minium<00:01:48.070> wire<00:01:48.840> to

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
like this you can easily minium wire to

00:01:49.840 --> 00:02:04.420 
like this you can easily minium wire to
make<00:01:50.050> a<00:01:50.290> loop<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:55.230> turn<00:01:56.230> it<00:01:56.980> around<00:01:57.370> the<00:01:58.120> motor

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.259 

another<00:02:05.430> side<00:02:05.789> make<00:02:06.060> one<00:02:06.420> more<00:02:06.719> leg<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:08.269> then

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
another side make one more leg and then

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.800 
another side make one more leg and then
I<00:02:09.509> feed<00:02:10.500> another<00:02:11.069> leg<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.940> other<00:02:12.019> three<00:02:13.019> legs

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
I feed another leg the other three legs

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.880 
I feed another leg the other three legs
clue<00:02:15.810> them<00:02:16.260> with<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.890> mortar<00:02:17.760> body<00:02:18.680> put<00:02:19.680> the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
clue them with a mortar body put the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.509 
clue them with a mortar body put the
weight<00:02:20.280> again<00:02:21.650> now<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.709> have<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.069> set<00:02:23.310> the

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
weight again now you have to set the

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.410 
weight again now you have to set the
angle<00:02:23.760> of<00:02:24.299> different<00:02:24.989> leg

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
angle of different leg

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.840 
angle of different leg
so<00:02:26.990> that<00:02:27.140> it<00:02:27.230> doesn't<00:02:27.620> fall<00:02:27.860> down

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.580 

and<00:02:32.850> now<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.330> not<00:02:33.480> falling<00:02:33.960> it<00:02:34.050> is<00:02:34.080> moving

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
and now it is not falling it is moving

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.760 
and now it is not falling it is moving
around

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.430 

by<00:02:39.730> changing<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.570> angle<00:02:40.780> of<00:02:42.630> different<00:02:43.630> legs

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
by changing the angle of different legs

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.430 
by changing the angle of different legs
you<00:02:45.070> can<00:02:45.340> have<00:02:45.690> different<00:02:46.690> kind<00:02:46.960> of<00:02:47.080> funny

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
you can have different kind of funny

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.900 
you can have different kind of funny
movement<00:02:48.100> of<00:02:48.280> this<00:02:48.460> toy<00:02:50.220> see<00:02:51.220> isn't<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.210> cool

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
movement of this toy see isn't it cool

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.450 
movement of this toy see isn't it cool
hope<00:02:54.910> you<00:02:55.240> like<00:02:55.690> it

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
hope you like it

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:03.460 
hope you like it
make<00:02:57.460> your<00:02:57.670> own<00:02:57.850> toy

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.200 

thanks<00:03:04.220> for<00:03:04.400> watching<00:03:04.610> see<00:03:05.360> you<00:03:05.480> again<00:03:05.510> bye
