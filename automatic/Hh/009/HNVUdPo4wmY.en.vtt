this record you know I mean so that was

this record you know I mean so that was
my<00:01:55.690> whole<00:01:55.960> basis<00:01:56.410> so<00:01:56.560> any<00:01:56.800> song<00:01:57.100> that<00:01:57.130> I

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.760 

any<00:02:00.789> song<00:02:01.149> that<00:02:01.179> I<00:02:01.479> like<00:02:01.780> he<00:02:02.259> told<00:02:02.530> that<00:02:02.679> i

any song that I like he told that i
think<00:02:02.829> is<00:02:03.420> because<00:02:04.420> of<00:02:04.749> how<00:02:05.619> he<00:02:05.920> looked<00:02:06.280> at<00:02:06.460> it

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609 
think is because of how he looked at it

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:09.960 
think is because of how he looked at it
