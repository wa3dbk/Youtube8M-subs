version<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.309> Draganov<00:01:00.109> and<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.440> reason<00:01:01.680> I

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
version of the Draganov and the reason I

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.500 
version of the Draganov and the reason I
like<00:01:01.859> using<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.309> because<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:02.969> suppressed

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
like using this because it is suppressed

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.649 
like using this because it is suppressed
and<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.930> kills<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:05.040> three<00:01:05.610> or<00:01:05.729> four<00:01:05.939> shots<00:01:06.240> I

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
and it kills in three or four shots I

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.160 
and it kills in three or four shots I
think<00:01:07.500> two<00:01:07.830> shots<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.280> head<00:01:08.450> and<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.960> takes

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
think two shots to the head and it takes

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.580 
think two shots to the head and it takes
two<00:01:10.290> shots<00:01:10.530> ahead<00:01:10.939> three<00:01:11.939> shots<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> body

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.120 
can see right here you can use the m93
and<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.659> can<00:01:54.780> kill<00:01:54.930> very<00:01:55.200> effective<00:01:55.710> Airy

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
and you can kill very effective Airy

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.780 
and you can kill very effective Airy
fast<00:01:56.430> even<00:01:56.790> without<00:01:57.030> Magnum<00:01:57.479> ammo<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:58.490> if<00:01:59.490> you

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
fast even without Magnum ammo and if you

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.510 
fast even without Magnum ammo and if you
and<00:02:00.060> use<00:02:00.780> your<00:02:00.960> user<00:02:01.350> uh<00:02:01.520> semi-automatic

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
and use your user uh semi-automatic

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.130 
and use your user uh semi-automatic
rifle<00:02:02.850> just<00:02:03.000> like<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.420> like<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.659> semi<00:02:03.930> iMac

you<00:02:16.020> see<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.200> keep<00:02:16.410> my<00:02:16.530> sensitivity<00:02:17.280> up<00:02:17.550> a

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
you see I keep my sensitivity up a

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.550 
you see I keep my sensitivity up a
little<00:02:17.790> bit<00:02:17.970> there<00:02:18.180> because<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.290> had<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.470> little

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
I'm shooting that's because I don't

the<00:02:46.950> scope<00:02:47.959> but<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:49.620> can<00:02:49.769> kind<00:02:50.100> of<00:02:50.190> counter

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
the scope but you can kind of counter

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:51.979

off in a distance it's actually better
to<00:02:54.000> have<00:02:54.209> more<00:02:54.420> sensitivity<00:02:54.959> because<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.590> can

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
to have more sensitivity because you can

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.430 
to have more sensitivity because you can
make<00:02:55.890> my<00:02:56.190> new<00:02:56.400> make<00:02:57.150> my<00:02:57.330> new<00:02:57.569> movements<00:02:58.110> easier

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
make my new make my new movements easier

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.080 
make my new make my new movements easier
as<00:02:58.970> opposed<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.239> you<00:03:00.510> know<00:03:01.819> sniping<00:03:02.819> in<00:03:03.000> a

fast-paced<00:03:12.209> game<00:03:12.420> than<00:03:12.600> battlefield<00:03:13.109> so<00:03:13.380> uh<00:03:13.410> I

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
fast-paced game than battlefield so uh I

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.509 
fast-paced game than battlefield so uh I

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
the wrong rifle on generally I use this

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.520 
the wrong rifle on generally I use this
as<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.459> meat<00:03:35.850> I<00:03:36.090> usually<00:03:36.540> use<00:03:36.660> my<00:03:36.810> rifle<00:03:37.200> medium

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
as a meat I usually use my rifle medium

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.130 
as a meat I usually use my rifle medium
range<00:03:37.799> and<00:03:38.069> and<00:03:38.910> that's<00:03:39.420> pretty<00:03:39.569> much<00:03:39.780> the

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
range and and that's pretty much the

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.940 
range and and that's pretty much the
only<00:03:40.170> time<00:03:40.500> I<00:03:40.680> use<00:03:40.799> it<00:03:41.150> medium<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.269> long<00:03:42.480> range

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
only time I use it medium to long range

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.860 
only time I use it medium to long range
and<00:03:43.950> just<00:03:44.549> generally<00:03:45.180> if<00:03:45.269> it's<00:03:45.420> like<00:03:45.569> a<00:03:45.600> long

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870

off<00:05:46.340> of<00:05:46.610> something<00:05:46.789> you<00:05:47.120> could<00:05:47.240> do<00:05:47.330> it<00:05:47.419> much

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
off of something you could do it much

off of something you could do it much
easier<00:05:47.960> with<00:05:48.169> a<00:05:48.200> mortar<00:05:48.530> strike<00:05:48.770> and<00:05:49.400> that

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
easier with a mortar strike and that

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.710 
easier with a mortar strike and that
brings<00:05:49.669> me<00:05:49.789> to<00:05:49.910> the<00:05:50.030> point<00:05:50.180> where<00:05:50.419> more<00:05:50.600> to

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
brings me to the point where more to

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.409 
brings me to the point where more to
strike<00:05:50.990> versus<00:05:51.320> c4<00:05:51.770> like<00:05:52.729> on<00:05:52.850> a<00:05:52.940> tank<00:05:53.210> heavy

you should properly use the MOR strike
you<00:06:08.320> should<00:06:08.530> you<00:06:08.830> could<00:06:08.980> spam<00:06:09.250> it<00:06:09.460> which<00:06:09.730> is

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
you should you could spam it which is

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.300 
you should you could spam it which is
very<00:06:10.500> experiment<00:06:11.500> hope<00:06:11.650> you<00:06:11.770> get<00:06:11.890> lucky<00:06:12.040> kill

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
very experiment hope you get lucky kill

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.640 
very experiment hope you get lucky kill
which<00:06:12.490> is<00:06:12.640> pretty<00:06:13.450> good<00:06:13.630> tactic<00:06:14.050> you<00:06:14.470> can<00:06:14.500> use

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
which is pretty good tactic you can use

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.410 
which is pretty good tactic you can use
it<00:06:14.890> to<00:06:15.010> destroy<00:06:15.430> you<00:06:15.730> know<00:06:15.850> roofs<00:06:16.180> and

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:16.420 
it to destroy you know roofs and

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.020 
it to destroy you know roofs and
buildings<00:06:16.810> which<00:06:16.960> is<00:06:17.080> not<00:06:17.260> the<00:06:17.350> good<00:06:17.500> tactic

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
buildings which is not the good tactic

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.490 
buildings which is not the good tactic
but<00:06:19.030> the<00:06:19.180> most<00:06:19.360> effective<00:06:19.540> way<00:06:19.840> I<00:06:19.900> find<00:06:20.230> it<00:06:20.380> is

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
but the most effective way I find it is

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.410 
but the most effective way I find it is
to<00:06:20.860> destroy<00:06:21.280> play<00:06:21.490> in<00:06:21.670> placements<00:06:22.180> with<00:06:22.270> it

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:22.420 
to destroy play in placements with it

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.240 
to destroy play in placements with it

emplacements caster mortar strike on the
gun<00:06:28.720> emplacement<00:06:29.290> it<00:06:29.470> will<00:06:29.680> destroy<00:06:30.100> it<00:06:30.310> and

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
gun emplacement it will destroy it and

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.610 
gun emplacement it will destroy it and
it's<00:06:31.270> very<00:06:31.630> good<00:06:31.810> for<00:06:31.870> doing<00:06:32.110> things<00:06:32.440> of

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620
