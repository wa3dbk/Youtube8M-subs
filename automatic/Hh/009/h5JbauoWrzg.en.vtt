00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.740
 and 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.449
 instant gaming dotcom 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.860
 hello and welcome again and csi them 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.140
 I bring a little trick here in the ratchet 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.640
 and clank technology and good this trick 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.740
 is going to be just in the ratchet and 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.650
 clank 1 or in the ratchet and clank 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.170
 peel or go and basically this trick goes 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.809
 to be to get a lot of 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.680
 screaming at the minute or automatically 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.260
 we will pick up the screaming 900 screams 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.220
 per minute exactly and well then what 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.910
 what we have to do is justly 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.220
 travel to this planet on the planet of 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.260
 the oberwart races that we even 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.790
 we will leave the map is that this trick goes 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.460
 to be getting off the map to get 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.320
 those infinite writers of agreement and 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.380
 well for this trick what is going 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.970
 to need is the dummy weapon is me 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.880
 It looks like it's called and what we do is 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.300
 point to the l1 and just put 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.100
 here with the round so let's say the 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.560
 mannequin we put several mannequins to the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.300
 time until it just pushes us 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.970
 off the map according once 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.619
 so we are out of the map because I 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.170
 what I recommend now is to aim again 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.070
 with the l1 to place us on the site and 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.140
 look towards him 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.150
 agree and what you will do in the green 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.240
 is to walk through the green very little by little 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.670
 ok before this I would like to teach 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.860
 a couple of things that we just 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.690
 can happen and well just so the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.700
 first thing that you can leave by 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.460
 here unintentionally of the map of agreement 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.680
 because this is not here but later 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.750
 now I will teach you a solution for 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.759
 to be able to get here from here but 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.130
 just if you enter here no longer 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.290
 you can leave what I recommend that 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.240
 you go down and kill yourself in the 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.649
 Water of agreement also can happen to you 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.630
 that right here you stay 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.970
 stranded and what I recommend is that 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.709
 pulsáis start and I go to load 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.220
 start and start again with the trick 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.810
 okay it's a pretty simple thing 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.050
 okay and good as now you will see me 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.690
 I'm going to kill myself so you can see 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.239
 that I reappear without problems and 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.610
 here I am if you stay and ammunition 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.230
 What I recommend is that you go to 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.070
 buy or just load of 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.410
 again the good game here comes what 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.470
 I told you at the beginning of 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.060
 that if I pass is that there are two zones 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.800
 where you can just put this 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.880
 area that I am teaching that is quite 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.260
 wide and extensible the other area is more 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.120
 narrow and is the one that you have to do 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.400
 with the trick are the ones that you have to 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.050
 get it right and here is a trick then for 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.060
 get right to do the trick according 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.590
 that is, this is a way of doing well 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.690
 the trick if you came out here from 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.760
 I agree what you have to do 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.900
 basically I have come just for 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.840
 here and quickly by pressing x and r2 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.070
 so the jetpack out is worth it and now what 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.250
 what you will have to do is to continue 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:15.090
 here and continue now I'm going to teach ya 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.710
 what is the real trick or is it already 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.480
 I teach how I do well what I have 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.210
 taught is a precaution in case 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.620
 It happens and well then also what can 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.000
 to pass is that just as you see or 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.320
 put the doll in the middle what you have 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.540
 what to do is simply break it already 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.280
 it is as you have seen 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.890
 Well, what was what you have 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.370
 what to do is to aim with the e1 and start 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.319
 to drop mannequins is worth until 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.690
 just push us towards that inside 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.030
 OK 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.100
 As you can see, it has not come out again 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.260
 again you break without problem we 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.480
 mannequins and will try again this is 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.340
 try again and again until you 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.230
 get it right in agreement is very basic and 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.330
 simple as you can see there has already left me 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.820
 well to place what I recommend a 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.530
 time here is to give one to point l 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.560
 towards the green agree now we give 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.210
 to the one of ahead and now therefore with very 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.010
 carefully then what we have to 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.030
 to do is to stick to the wall towards 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.380
 green and go walking is very simple and 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.000
 a bit difficult the truth because you 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.640
 you can fall down because there is one 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.530
 happened a couple of times I've fallen and 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.019
 has been a pretty big problem the 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.850
 true to tell you that this works also 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.150
 in playstation 2 since it is a game 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.760
 remastered for playstation3 and good 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.590
 well once you cross this also what 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.250
 you have to do now basically here 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.360
 is to jump and go there to where 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.900
 he said in agreement 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.820
 you have to go planning as you see 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.740
 there little by little I go down there 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.170
 loose there is worth getting here is a bit 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.420
 complicated but in the end you will arrive and 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.970
 Now what you do here is press x + 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.340
 to hit a super jump with him and to 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.870
 I remember you and well then once here 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.970
 what I recommend is to pull this side 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.729
 If you have the other side, the 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.499
 rayet him 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.509
 what is this called to do careers 

00:04:56.499 --> 00:05:00.939
 the hover board or something like that may be 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:02.139
 see and start the race so everything 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:03.909
 what you will have done for nothing or be 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.490
 pull where I shot please 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:08.589
 you did not have it bad it is good then for 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.300
 get the pythons what will you have 

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:11.860
 what to do is to pull forward I'm going to 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.870
 put the camera fast so this 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.909
 go a little faster and good then what 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.550
 what you will have to do is go through this 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:21.249
 as fast as you can because this is 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.409
 silly what you will have to do 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:26.469
 put is the weapon that I have just 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:28.509
 putting vale is a weapon that emits sound 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:30.849
 and attracts screams in agreement breaks 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:34.149
 boxes and attracts keaton that's why it's going to 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:35.589
 Serve a lot for the good and good trick 

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:38.229
 Well what we have to do now 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:39.610
 just get to this area of ​​the map 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.379
 as you are seeing there that there is a lot 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.149
 of boxes up and what we will have to 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:45.639
 to do is simply to place us under 

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:48.219
 there it is worth and what we will do is keep the 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:49.870
 round button to not start 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:51.819
 break the boxes above and we 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.059
 begin to fall screams of heaven 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:56.770
 this then we can get the 

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:58.839
 pythons that you want that you will have to 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.969
 leave the console a couple of hours 

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:01.990
 ignited so that they fall there the 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:03.580
 pythons 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.490
 what I recommend is that it was one and 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.710
 just for example another command over 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.230
 of the round button so that you can 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.720
 leave this automatically catching 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.310
 buttons and whatever in the meantime 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.530
 you can do what you want you can play 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.750
 with your cat or just eat or 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.560
 is a bowl of crispin what you want is worth 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.670
 and here you leave this because 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.160
 you get the buttons you want is a 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:29.080
 trick the truth and well with this you 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.210
 I leave you hope that you have liked to give 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.390
