00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.930
 pretty regular side dishes I didn't see many warnings and I built myself 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.590
 a very factor paolo image 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.770
 I care a lot because the last hand I got out makes your boss pass 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.839
 when I had two jakcosn board he copied 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:17.760
 walter now 80 hope you have I can enjoy a good card maybe I can 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:19.630
 find someone to give me some cits 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.850
 to me actors deciding with so many subscribers as important as starting with 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.749
 perhaps an aggressive approach to making a mirror right away is 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:29.859
 relevant or prefer not to risk the beat 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.519
 My style of play though 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:35.569
 the smell of a hector arises on the basis of the players who, therefore, the paul 

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:38.690
 levels tando to play with hands studying massari 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.690
 and possibly after ascot also play with marginal hands 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.060
 published the game on reading the opponents call 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.020
 player so a curiosity a player who reacts this way 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.230
 nervous as we have just seen 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.729
 he maybe even interpreter for this interview complained 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.369
 as you interpret it and a little bit give some indication yahoo 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.220
 it is simply characterless it does not give you any relevance 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.980
 quarda regardless of the interview I immediately had a couple of hands and ugly 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.830
 ofootball to him. hot 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.030
 he is very nervous, so he revenge he felt a lot of sickness 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.260
 probably yes 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.280
 however from maybe it may be that to the next victim we hope 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.930
 that can give some cipster so let's go on here is this point 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.430
 we also wish from our heart 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.790
 is a consideration will decide luca rossano that you could not players 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.940
 Italians who are always 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.680

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.140
 what is your emotion to be here in sanremo where we are already clarified often 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.590
 present to see all the rooms so full 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.740
 to the motion so much above all because they consider it this tournament 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.180
 the most important of the tar manta season votes from the androgyny montecarlo ad 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.630
 an economically motoimport tournament went from Italian I consider this 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.680
 luca then we move away because they obviously bother us 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.800
 also to this a volume of voice 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.570

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.050
 sanremo casino would really be 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.609
 in other words, a great success 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.859
 have you seen already considered have made some differences from the level mi 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:26.280
 say service titles on the international scene 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.800
 or more -8 you believe there are such differences 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.169
 I didn't notice any difference, it's for you anyway I'm talking about Italians 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:37.359
 have improved after a year so many Italian torrents are targeted at the table 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.930
 it's a picture of the adobe get for one is behaving really barack 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.510
 ak to make an indelible comparison I saw the level of play of the bikes 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.089
 lower than in Italy 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:51.359
