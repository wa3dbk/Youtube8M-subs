 the best music teachers training in your 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:13.110
 the city and remotely via the Internet 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:17.000
 video tutorials forum where your questions 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:21.260

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.260
 muzika.ru presents 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.340
 shock 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.620
 percussion instrument is 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:44.250
 that there is no such very standard 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.110
 from the stage let's say that for example in 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.269
 unlike the violin where there is a violin 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.710
 there is a bow 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:54.690
 then on the drum set here you can 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.570
 vary and proper amount and 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.700
 cymbals and number of drums and 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.460
 and the actual character of the plates is 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.920
 may be the roof with wood tea wright 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.950
 one or two or three is already like someone 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.810
 everything depends on our attitude to 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:15.720
 the music of our flight of thought is creative then 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.690
 we saw the same thing with volumes 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.320
 video where it was fashionable to hang such 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:26.570
 mountains of drums here are such suspended 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.790
 the whole there is almost like in the store 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.869
 grief plates but in order to 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.000
 and play some simple things 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.770
 enough in principle here is such a setup 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.950
 which are now in front of me is 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.500
 snare is rect it is still them 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.630
 call tom-tom this fort he 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.700
 from the fact that he is on the floor here he is 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.020
 and called legged is big 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.420
 polecat drum wright and two plates 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.329
 crash is just for convenience allowed to 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.159
 not reach here's what that here 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.310
 moment we can play this or this 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.079
 and also they are different in sound and already 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.369
 knowing this sound we when we play we can 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.310
 let's say so choose which plate 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:16.410
 In this case, we play the main 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:20.959
 task drummer musician who 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:25.650
 playing a drum set this creation 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:28.340
 we call it a groove but in Russian 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.500
 you can still say create a rhythm 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.139
 rhythmic canvas 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.250
 which connect such tools 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:39.010
 like bass guitar which 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.960
 also promote us groovy guitar 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.060
 when she plays rhythm parts 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.580
 keyboard instruments vocals brass but 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.000
 it all depends on your own 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.330
