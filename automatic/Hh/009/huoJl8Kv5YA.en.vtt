00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.640
 combination 86 peculiar to the device 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.500
 based on reference itself 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.989
 however, the changes are not 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.700
 limited to add to visit 20 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.100

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.420
 the number of phases should reduce the load 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.739
 on the elements is true thereby reducing them 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.390

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.690
 sixty six millimeters 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.459
 however, the overall dimensions of the device are noticeable 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.109
 bigger because protruding over edge 5 se 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.570
 cooling system device length

 not boring using the elements 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.660
 which are useful functional terms 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.549
 In this case, the bracket increases 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.140
 the rigidity of the PCB on the top 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.970

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.550
 the temperature of the graphics chip was 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.650
 29 degrees with rotational speed 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.659
 the fan did not rise above 9 hundred 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.669

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.960
 g plus was 67 degrees great 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.460
 the result if we consider that 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.500
 GPU frequency 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.870
 nearly 100 megahertz higher than recommended 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.639
 for the adapter lineup jid o gtx780 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.229
 to keep the temperature indicated 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.419

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.219
 increased to 2300 revolutions per minute 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.870
 despite the relatively low 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:56.669
 tonality index of the active 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.560

 discomfort noise level definitely 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.490
 increases but subjectively it is not higher than 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:04.199
 in reference cooler we note that 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.569

 the utility allows you to adjust the most 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.120
 important parameters and track critical 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.770
 characteristic to frequency breaker 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.090
 video card potential we increased 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.520

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:36.990
 amounted to 1.3 volts and was also increased 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:39.000
 power parameters bidding up to 105 percent 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.779
 In this mode, the base frequency of the chip 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.699
 managed to raise 950 4 to 1022 for the coat of arms 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:47.460
 after additional overclocking border 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:49.590
 acceleration range moved over 1163 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.210
 on the coat of arms is curious that even after 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.039
 noticeable processor boost with 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.690

 only up to 70 degrees with speed 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.270
 fan rotation is almost not 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.770
 changed with regard to frequency strips 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.139
 for memory, there is a reason for 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.659
 healthy optimism the microchip succeeded 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:08.340

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:09.750
 twenty percent frequency carried 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.940
 results in a significant increase 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.680
 bandwidth memory instead

 in some cases even get ahead of him 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.930
 additional overclocking increases the lead 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:39.759
 about the same 5-10 percent while
