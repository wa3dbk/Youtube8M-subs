eighty to a hundred dollars okay we have
the<00:01:36.170> old<00:01:36.380> one<00:01:36.649> in<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:36.950> new<00:01:37.369> connector<00:01:38.050> make

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
the old one in the new connector make

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.100 
the old one in the new connector make
sure<00:01:39.080> both<00:01:39.890> mesh<00:01:40.580> and<00:01:40.970> there<00:01:41.450> they<00:01:41.869> are

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
sure both mesh and there they are

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.800 
sure both mesh and there they are
exactly<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:43.009> same<00:01:43.039> if<00:01:43.520> you<00:01:43.670> can<00:01:43.880> plug<00:01:44.450> it<00:01:44.660> in

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
exactly the same if you can plug it in

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.359 
exactly the same if you can plug it in
before<00:01:44.959> you<00:01:45.229> start<00:01:45.530> cutting<00:01:45.709> any<00:01:45.979> warriors

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
before you start cutting any warriors

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.270 
before you start cutting any warriors
it'll<00:01:46.640> be<00:01:46.759> awesome<00:01:47.020> don't<00:01:48.020> cut<00:01:48.289> any<00:01:48.470> wires<00:01:48.709> to

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
it'll be awesome don't cut any wires to

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.820 
it'll be awesome don't cut any wires to
make<00:01:49.490> sure<00:01:49.789> this<00:01:50.000> is<00:01:50.179> right

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
make sure this is right

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.100 
make sure this is right
after<00:01:51.830> you<00:01:51.979> get<00:01:52.220> your<00:01:52.429> new<00:01:52.849> harness<00:01:53.179> make<00:01:53.929> sure

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
after you get your new harness make sure

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.589 
after you get your new harness make sure
to<00:01:54.289> cut<00:01:54.530> it<00:01:54.709> maybe<00:01:55.009> about<00:01:55.369> order<00:01:56.119> of<00:01:56.149> an<00:01:56.420> inch

00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:56.599 
to cut it maybe about order of an inch

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:04.089 
to cut it maybe about order of an inch
to<00:01:57.050> half<00:01:57.560> an<00:01:57.679> inch<00:01:57.860> long<00:02:02.410> okay<00:02:03.440> inside<00:02:03.830> that

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:04.099 
to half an inch long okay inside that

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:05.580 
to half an inch long okay inside that
connectors<00:02:04.819> that<00:02:04.849> you're<00:02:05.119> gonna<00:02:05.239> be<00:02:05.450> getting

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
connectors that you're gonna be getting

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.059 
connectors that you're gonna be getting
with<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.709> harness<00:02:08.110> see<00:02:09.110> this<00:02:09.830> is<00:02:09.979> the

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
with the harness see this is the

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.790 
with the harness see this is the
connector<00:02:10.540> but<00:02:11.540> I'm<00:02:11.690> going<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.380> do<00:02:12.530> it<00:02:12.650> all

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
connector but I'm going to do it all

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.449 
connector but I'm going to do it all
differently

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
differently

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.020 
differently
I'm<00:02:13.790> gonna<00:02:14.000> soldered<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:15.410> wires<00:02:15.880> which<00:02:16.880> i

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
I'm gonna soldered the wires which i

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.490 
I'm gonna soldered the wires which i
think<00:02:17.090> is<00:02:17.540> better<00:02:17.780> than<00:02:18.050> using<00:02:18.380> these

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
think is better than using these

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.260 
think is better than using these
connectors<00:02:19.010> but<00:02:19.580> if<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:19.880> don't<00:02:20.120> have<00:02:20.239> a

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
connectors but if you don't have a

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.540 
connectors but if you don't have a
solder<00:02:20.750> so<00:02:21.110> now<00:02:21.319> probably<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:21.980> can<00:02:22.160> do<00:02:22.340> it<00:02:22.459> the

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
solder so now probably you can do it the

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.520 
solder so now probably you can do it the
other<00:02:22.580> way<00:02:22.910> there's<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.660> string<00:02:23.900> grab<00:02:24.110> even<00:02:24.440> I

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
other way there's a string grab even I

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.230 
other way there's a string grab even I
need<00:02:24.830> some<00:02:25.069> shrink<00:02:25.760> wrap

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.150 

okay<00:02:30.240> you<00:02:30.780> start<00:02:31.020> with<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.200> first<00:02:31.380> wire<00:02:31.650> very

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
okay you start with the first wire very

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.280 
okay you start with the first wire very
important<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.790> both<00:02:32.970> one<00:02:33.330> by<00:02:33.510> one<00:02:33.780> this<00:02:34.140> is

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
important you both one by one this is

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.470 
important you both one by one this is
that<00:02:34.470> kind<00:02:34.770> of<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.460> way<00:02:35.760> you're<00:02:36.090> gonna<00:02:36.180> twist

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
that kind of the way you're gonna twist

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.170 
that kind of the way you're gonna twist
the<00:02:36.780> wires<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.290> put<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.560> together<00:02:37.910> make<00:02:38.910> sure

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
the wires to put it together make sure

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.610 
the wires to put it together make sure
to<00:02:39.420> put<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:39.630> shrink<00:02:40.110> wrap<00:02:40.470> on<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:42.000> wire

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
to put that shrink wrap on the wire

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.170 
to put that shrink wrap on the wire
before<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.830> start<00:02:44.240> soldering<00:02:45.240> any<00:02:45.840> any<00:02:46.530> wires

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
before you start soldering any any wires

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.360 
before you start soldering any any wires
make<00:02:48.180> sure<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.510> put<00:02:48.690> two<00:02:48.960> two<00:02:49.500> pieces<00:02:49.950> would<00:02:50.250> be

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
make sure to put two two pieces would be
