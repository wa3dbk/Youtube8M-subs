00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.940
 matthias of gizmodo here 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:11.050
 I have the device of prestigio craze 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:14.380
 is called the risk itself 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.510
 you get a high end that gets it 5 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.920
 inch device should look pretty pretty 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.390
 all special you can maybe see 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.570
 such a little bit 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.740
 it is very very thin only 55 mm me 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.090
 I guess that's not the world record 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.190
 otherwise they would have said it but on 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.630
 any case your good shape us that 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.349
 look at and briefly again the 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.789
 packaging on so far very nice here 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.339
 we are a bit clear 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:39.519
 The specs on it side 5 inch display 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:42.789
 with full hd resolution gorilla-glas 3 10 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:45.899
 megapixel camera behind 5 megapixel 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:53.709
 camera front with wide angle no change 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:56.679
 and hspa + unfortunately no lte 1 7 ghz core 

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:58.569
 chrome for use 2 gb ram and should 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.219
 enough 16 gigabytes internal 

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:02.799
 memory is a bit 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.920
 just considering you think that 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:07.380
 unfortunately not with a micro sd 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.990
 can expand 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:15.040
 Nice tools in capable and the battery 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.870
 with 2300 milliamps solana becomes 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.860
 to show yourself 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.860
 Today we do but at times 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:38.350
 with you curious 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.940
 advertised as very stylish 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.940
 will be a lot of glass 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.440
 well before we unpack the device 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.860
 let's see what else with it 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.860
 in it is 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.800
 Of course, this is very classic here 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:19.000
 power supply ever what that for a 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:21.470
 power brings 5 ​​volts only one ampera 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.510
 is really very chic and for that 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.510
 narrow little man 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.719
 small needle and the sim card is 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:41.469
 likely to make out 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:50.459
 this war was possible for others 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:50.459
 nonsense because no one needs a cable 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:58.409
 every case a very high quality plastic 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.859
 he too is very average 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:11.260
 nothing of prestige on it but also no matter 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.419
 should load new phone or data 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.150
 transfer the headphones to this one already 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:18.069
 again a bit more important and are 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.319
 actually a bit prettier 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.739
 maybe you get a bit long 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:28.930
 at least cable looks so far all over 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:33.669
 nice and is how you think 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:36.400
 can also simultaneously a headset here 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:39.549
 you can see the little hole for that 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.859
 Microphone and a button on it to make calls 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.489
 to accept or to start music yet 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.159
 to stop 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:52.479
 hugo chávez whether one comes to going 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:59.259
 but it's actually good 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:04:01.959
 that is actually very narrow and tim 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:07.870
 not well processed I firmly 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:09.239
 great other film from that you have here 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.280
 below 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:15.030
 the speaker the speaker boxes 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.280
 put a small hole for the microphone 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:23.229
 and back on it but like me 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:26.919
 seems to be down here 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:28.500
 a speaker output had no 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.810
 spacer i could imagine 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.310
 if the device lays flat on the table 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.590
 you play music 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.630
 Maybe that does not sound like that anymore 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.479
 We'll be great in the back 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:45.070
 Here we have the camera with the 3 10 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:48.029
 megapixel and down the net flash of the 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:52.180
 However, image sensors are from sony 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:55.750
 on top of it we have the little board 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.900
 for micro usb on the right side sim 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:02.050
 card slot number one and on the 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.139
 left side that I only number 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:13.449
 one of them will probably have 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:16.830
 We will not be up for both 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.830
 so let's take a look 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.180
 I just like single slot slots 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:37.979
 ever with us on the packaging 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:39.840
 city so the well that will then 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.699
 probably in the test then clarify where there 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.780
 the second sim card inserted 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:43.680
 she does not have to be now either 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.570
 withhold 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.100
 Well, we continue on the left 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.310
 We have a classic page 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:53.130
 volume rocker is a bit out 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.570
 but it consolidates so well and so far 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.650
 down here and off we 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.470
 be operated directly times 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:04.080
 up there we have the 5 megapixel 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:07.160
 front camera with wide-angle lens otherwise 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.810
 makes the device quite a good impression 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.599
 and it's the same with me 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.550
 only thing you really have to say what 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:18.960
 in the price category the device should 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:21.060
 namely 350 euros do not cost okay 16 gb 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.490
 internal memory and not upgradeable 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.889
 with a sim card accusation back 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.560
 with the micro sd card that's sooner 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:31.380
 bad 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.000
 and that's no lte has that 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.750
 certainly some also complain though 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.560
 I have to say that the display is on 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.560
 first impression 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:48.240
 really good impression 

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.680
 that one sees something 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:14.270
 but there we are quite a lot 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:19.710
 things already pre-installed this 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:23.040
 clean master battery but let's see 

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:25.350
 what the model is actually in then 

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.750
 test even on the first picture like 

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.370
 really good 350 euros until now 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.140
 Of course, no bargain 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:34.800
 I have not said anything yet 

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:36.920
 internal clocks in mediatek processor and 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.310
 though the 65 92 

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:42.870
 octagon with 1 7 ghz 

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:45.780
 that is already better processor of 

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:47.580
 mediatek and I'm curious what then 

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.870
 actually in our use case 

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.750
 we will come out in the next 

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:53.640
 days and weeks the device in detail 

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:55.650
 test if you have any question 

00:07:53.640 --> 00:08:00.410
 then just write it under the 

00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:00.410
 articles comment thank you
