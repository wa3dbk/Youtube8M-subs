banjos and harmonicas and some of these
other<00:01:48.909> instruments<00:01:49.420> so<00:01:49.870> it<00:01:49.930> was<00:01:50.050> kind<00:01:50.200> of<00:01:50.260> hard

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
other instruments so it was kind of hard

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.230 
other instruments so it was kind of hard
to<00:01:50.530> pick<00:01:50.710> out<00:01:50.860> just<00:01:50.890> one<00:01:51.130> defined<00:01:51.729> acoustic

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
to pick out just one defined acoustic

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.670 
to pick out just one defined acoustic
part<00:01:52.479> but<00:01:52.630> we<00:01:52.720> did<00:01:52.869> our<00:01:52.990> best<00:01:53.140> and<00:01:53.409> I<00:01:53.440> think<00:01:53.470> we

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
part but we did our best and I think we

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.990 
part but we did our best and I think we
came<00:01:53.830> up<00:01:53.950> with<00:01:54.040> a<00:01:54.130> great<00:01:54.340> one<00:01:54.520> that's<00:01:54.729> gonna<00:01:54.850> be

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
came up with a great one that's gonna be

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.130 
came up with a great one that's gonna be
able<00:01:55.060> to<00:01:55.180> get<00:01:55.330> you<00:01:55.450> through<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.720> whole<00:01:55.869> song

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
able to get you through the whole song

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.290 
able to get you through the whole song
and<00:01:56.409> it's<00:01:56.800> actually<00:01:57.130> fairly<00:01:57.580> doable<00:01:57.909> there's

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
and it's actually fairly doable there's

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.820 
and it's actually fairly doable there's
only<00:01:58.450> four<00:01:58.840> different<00:01:59.229> sections<00:01:59.560> we're<00:01:59.740> gonna

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
only four different sections we're gonna

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:10.960 
only four different sections we're gonna
need<00:02:00.100> to<00:02:00.220> know<00:02:00.369> the<00:02:01.119> first<00:02:01.360> one<00:02:01.570> is<00:02:01.780> this

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.160 

this<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.090> actually<00:02:12.390> key<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.690> getting<00:02:12.840> this<00:02:13.020> to

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
this is actually key to getting this to

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.800 
this is actually key to getting this to
feel<00:02:13.350> right<00:02:13.560> is<00:02:13.710> all<00:02:13.890> in<00:02:14.040> your<00:02:14.070> strumming<00:02:14.810> so

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
feel right is all in your strumming so

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:28.280 
feel right is all in your strumming so
let's<00:02:16.110> do<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.320> nice<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.500> slow

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.119 

so<00:02:29.099> it's<00:02:29.250> down<00:02:29.549> down<00:02:30.239> down<00:02:31.019> up<00:02:31.349> down<00:02:31.409> up<00:02:32.099> down

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
so it's down down down up down up down

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:37.309 
so it's down down down up down up down
down<00:02:32.939> down<00:02:33.810> down<00:02:34.220> down<00:02:35.220> down<00:02:35.909> down<00:02:36.269> up<00:02:36.900> down<00:02:37.260> up

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
down down down down down down up down up

00:02:37.319 --> 00:03:02.380 
down down down down down down up down up
two<00:02:37.950> three<00:02:38.430> go

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.790 

to<00:03:02.540> play<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.810> lead<00:03:02.960> guitar<00:03:03.230> part<00:03:03.500> four<00:03:03.680> days

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
to play the lead guitar part four days

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
only four different things we need to

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.950 
only four different things we need to
learn<00:03:07.250> so<00:03:07.940> let's<00:03:08.120> learn<00:03:08.300> them<00:03:08.510> in<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.750> order

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
learn so let's learn them in the order

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.260 
learn so let's learn them in the order
that<00:03:08.990> they<00:03:09.230> come<00:03:09.440> in<00:03:09.620> during<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.250> song<00:03:10.460> the

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
first one that comes in during the intro

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.070 
first one that comes in during the intro
and<00:03:13.400> is<00:03:13.490> also<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:13.850> verse<00:03:14.240> lick<00:03:14.480> sounds<00:03:14.960> like

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
and is also the verse lick sounds like

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:28.090

this if you're in standard tuning and

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.130 
this if you're in standard tuning and
