00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.730 
and take a look what's inside okay so
here's<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.390> look<00:01:12.570> at<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.840> Bruce<00:01:13.049> Banner<00:01:13.290> figure

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
here's a look at the Bruce Banner figure

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.620 
here's a look at the Bruce Banner figure
outside<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> packaging<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.420> think

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
outside of the packaging and I think

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.480 
outside of the packaging and I think
overall<00:01:15.990> Hasbro<00:01:16.470> stood<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.799> nice<00:01:17.009> job<00:01:17.310> with

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
overall Hasbro stood a nice job with

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.429 
overall Hasbro stood a nice job with
this<00:01:17.670> figure<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.240> capturing<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.900> likeness<00:01:19.080> of

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
this figure in capturing the likeness of

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.950 
this figure in capturing the likeness of
the<00:01:19.500> actor<00:01:19.890> Mark<00:01:20.159> Ruffalo<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.850> think<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.780> head

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
the actor Mark Ruffalo I think the head

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.140 
the actor Mark Ruffalo I think the head
sculpt<00:01:22.290> looks<00:01:22.590> pretty<00:01:22.830> good<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.520> won't<00:01:24.000> say

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
sculpt looks pretty good I won't say

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.820 
sculpt looks pretty good I won't say
it's<00:01:24.270> one<00:01:24.479> hundred<00:01:24.659> percent<00:01:24.869> dead-on<00:01:25.470> but

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
it's one hundred percent dead-on but

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.800 
it's one hundred percent dead-on but
it's<00:01:26.369> certainly<00:01:26.640> close<00:01:27.030> enough<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
it's certainly close enough to do the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.609 
it's certainly close enough to do the
job<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.350> then<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.189> rest<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.640> figure<00:01:30.619> you

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
job and then the rest of the figure you

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.200 
job and then the rest of the figure you
know<00:01:31.710> basically<00:01:31.890> he's<00:01:32.340> wearing<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.820> kind<00:01:33.060> of

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
know basically he's wearing this kind of

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.450 
know basically he's wearing this kind of
a<00:01:33.270> sport<00:01:33.810> coat<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.470> code<00:01:34.710> itself<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.430> a

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
a sport coat and the code itself is a

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.100 
a sport coat and the code itself is a
separate<00:01:35.909> piece<00:01:36.119> from<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.390> figure<00:01:36.810> now<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
separate piece from the figure now the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.929 
separate piece from the figure now the
sleeves<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.770> coat<00:01:37.979> are<00:01:38.220> sculpted<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
sleeves of the coat are sculpted on the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.819 
sleeves of the coat are sculpted on the
figure<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.960> could<00:01:40.110> take<00:01:40.140> off<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.680> coat

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
figure so you could take off the coat

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.469 
figure so you could take off the coat
part<00:01:41.220> but<00:01:41.430> he<00:01:41.520> would<00:01:41.670> still<00:01:41.700> have<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> sleeves

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
part but he would still have the sleeves

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.139 
part but he would still have the sleeves
on<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.799> does<00:01:43.979> give<00:01:44.220> them<00:01:44.369> some<00:01:44.700> movement

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
on but it does give them some movement

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.600 
on but it does give them some movement
there<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.560> since<00:01:46.979> it's<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.250> separate

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
there so that it's since it's a separate

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.160

his knees or kind of come out of the
packaging<00:02:05.729> at<00:02:05.969> least<00:02:06.149> mine<00:02:06.360> did<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.659> little

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
packaging at least mine did a little

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.440 
packaging at least mine did a little
warped<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.220> can<00:02:08.369> see<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.759> legs<00:02:09.000> are<00:02:09.239> kind

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
warped so you can see the legs are kind

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.430 
warped so you can see the legs are kind
of<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:10.140> lower<00:02:10.319> legs<00:02:10.619> are<00:02:10.860> kind<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.220> outwards

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
of the lower legs are kind of outwards

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.510 
of the lower legs are kind of outwards
and<00:02:12.530> so<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:12.680> looks<00:02:12.740> a<00:02:12.920> little<00:02:13.100> funny<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.400> could

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
and so it looks a little funny you could

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.890 
and so it looks a little funny you could
probably<00:02:13.670> take<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:13.970> hair<00:02:14.210> dryer<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.510> straight

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900

movement with the head so it's a little
tight<00:03:59.330> so<00:03:59.660> you<00:03:59.750> have<00:03:59.900> to<00:04:00.019> kind<00:04:00.170> of<00:04:00.320> really<00:04:00.650> push

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
tight so you have to kind of really push

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:53.529 
jacket does prohibit him from looking
back<00:04:51.470> too<00:04:51.710> much<00:04:51.889> at<00:04:52.099> the<00:04:52.190> midsection<00:04:52.550> he<00:04:53.360> does

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
joints at the legs but again the jacket

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.920 
joints at the legs but again the jacket
does<00:04:58.430> limit<00:04:58.610> how<00:04:58.909> much<00:04:59.030> he<00:04:59.210> can<00:04:59.330> do<00:04:59.449> the<00:04:59.599> splits

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.439 
does limit how much he can do the splits
um<00:05:00.169> so<00:05:00.440> that's<00:05:00.620> about<00:05:00.889> as<00:05:01.280> much<00:05:01.550> as<00:05:01.849> he<00:05:02.300> can<00:05:02.360> get

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
um so that's about as much as he can get

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:04.990 
um so that's about as much as he can get
his<00:05:02.599> legs<00:05:02.780> out<00:05:03.050> he<00:05:03.949> can<00:05:04.069> get<00:05:04.130> his<00:05:04.280> leg<00:05:04.490> forward

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:26.259 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:28.959 

Poquette<00:06:27.259> on<00:06:27.289> the<00:06:27.680> body<00:06:28.190> doesn't<00:06:28.639> quite<00:06:28.909> work

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:28.969 
Poquette on the body doesn't quite work

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:32.080 
Poquette on the body doesn't quite work
though<00:06:29.650> okay<00:06:30.650> so<00:06:30.710> that's<00:06:31.009> my<00:06:31.219> view<00:06:31.279> overall<00:06:32.060> I

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
though okay so that's my view overall I

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:33.550 
though okay so that's my view overall I
like<00:06:32.419> this<00:06:32.630> figure<00:06:32.990> I<00:06:33.020> think<00:06:33.229> they've<00:06:33.349> done<00:06:33.500> a

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
like this figure I think they've done a

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.170 
like this figure I think they've done a
good<00:06:33.770> job<00:06:33.830> with<00:06:34.069> capturing<00:06:34.699> the<00:06:34.849> overall

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180 
good job with capturing the overall

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.670 
good job with capturing the overall
likeness<00:06:35.599> of<00:06:35.750> the<00:06:35.810> actor<00:06:36.199> with<00:06:36.380> the<00:06:36.500> face

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
likeness of the actor with the face

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.310 
likeness of the actor with the face
sculpt<00:06:37.190> the<00:06:37.759> soft<00:06:38.000> knees<00:06:38.270> are<00:06:38.690> you<00:06:38.990> know

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.320 
sculpt the soft knees are you know

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.840 
sculpt the soft knees are you know
that's<00:06:39.620> probably<00:06:39.860> the<00:06:40.130> only<00:06:40.220> complaint<00:06:40.670> I

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:40.850 
that's probably the only complaint I

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.640 
that's probably the only complaint I
have<00:06:41.000> about<00:06:41.300> it<00:06:41.510> with<00:06:41.630> the<00:06:41.720> gummy<00:06:41.930> knees<00:06:42.200> but

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
have about it with the gummy knees but

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.610 
have about it with the gummy knees but
it's<00:06:42.890> not<00:06:43.070> that<00:06:43.280> big<00:06:43.430> a<00:06:43.490> deal<00:06:43.580> I<00:06:44.050> do<00:06:45.050> like<00:06:45.470> the

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
it's not that big a deal I do like the

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.380 
it's not that big a deal I do like the
idea<00:06:45.650> that<00:06:46.010> we're<00:06:46.310> getting<00:06:46.430> civilian<00:06:47.060> figures

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:47.390 
idea that we're getting civilian figures

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.720 
idea that we're getting civilian figures
like<00:06:47.660> this<00:06:47.990> and<00:06:48.320> again<00:06:48.530> I<00:06:48.710> think<00:06:48.860> this<00:06:49.430> is<00:06:49.490> a

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:49.730 
like this and again I think this is a

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.090 
like this and again I think this is a
sculpt<00:06:50.150> that<00:06:50.330> they<00:06:50.450> could<00:06:50.630> reuse<00:06:50.960> for<00:06:51.290> figures

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.100 
sculpt that they could reuse for figures

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.740 
sculpt that they could reuse for figures
like<00:06:52.280> Tony<00:06:52.520> Stark<00:06:52.880> down<00:06:53.060> the<00:06:53.180> road<00:06:53.360> now<00:06:53.390> I<00:06:53.660> do

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750 
like Tony Stark down the road now I do

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.840 
like Tony Stark down the road now I do
have<00:06:53.870> a<00:06:54.020> little<00:06:54.110> bit<00:06:54.560> of<00:06:54.590> a<00:06:54.800> mixed<00:06:55.160> opinion

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:55.850 
have a little bit of a mixed opinion

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.850 
have a little bit of a mixed opinion
about<00:06:55.940> this<00:06:56.330> so<00:06:56.600> while<00:06:57.230> I<00:06:57.260> like<00:06:57.500> the<00:06:57.680> Bruce

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860 
about this so while I like the Bruce

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.770 
about this so while I like the Bruce
Banner<00:06:58.130> figure<00:06:58.580> at<00:06:58.820> the<00:06:58.910> same<00:06:59.180> time<00:06:59.390> I<00:06:59.450> can't

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780 
Banner figure at the same time I can't

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.480
