and then you can also get liquid formula

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.279 
and then you can also get liquid formula
or<00:00:53.370> concentrated<00:00:54.000> liquid<00:00:54.120> formula<00:00:54.719> now<00:00:54.960> most

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
or concentrated liquid formula now most

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.650 
or concentrated liquid formula now most
people<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.860> know<00:00:55.920> use<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.120> powdered<00:00:57.390> formula

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
people I know use the powdered formula

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.660 
people I know use the powdered formula
for<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> couple<00:00:58.199> reasons<00:00:58.230> number<00:00:58.890> one<00:00:59.010> it's

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
for a couple reasons number one it's

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.090 
for a couple reasons number one it's
very<00:01:00.480> easy<00:01:00.809> with<00:01:01.079> powdered<00:01:01.379> formula<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.890> make

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
very easy with powdered formula to make

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.950 
very easy with powdered formula to make
smaller<00:01:02.460> or<00:01:02.699> larger<00:01:03.059> quantities<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.750> not<00:01:03.840> to

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
smaller or larger quantities and not to

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.350 
smaller or larger quantities and not to
waste<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:05.040> also<00:01:05.309> good<00:01:05.610> storage<00:01:06.090> wise

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
waste it it's also good storage wise

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.850 
waste it it's also good storage wise
because<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.930> doesn't<00:01:07.170> take<00:01:07.290> up<00:01:07.439> as<00:01:07.590> much<00:01:07.650> space

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
because it doesn't take up as much space

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.179 
because it doesn't take up as much space
and<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.970> does<00:01:09.150> tend<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.450> be<00:01:09.570> cheaper<00:01:10.189> however

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
and it does tend to be cheaper however

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.890 
and it does tend to be cheaper however
if<00:01:11.610> you're<00:01:11.760> going<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.119> long<00:01:12.299> trip<00:01:12.600> or

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
if you're going on a long trip or

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.149 
if you're going on a long trip or
something<00:01:13.170> like<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.799> don't<00:01:13.920> think

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
something like that and you don't think

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.920 
something like that and you don't think
you're<00:01:14.250> going<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.430> have<00:01:14.549> access<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.299> water<00:01:15.570> you

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
you're going to have access to water you

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.300 
you're going to have access to water you
might<00:01:16.110> want<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.350> consider<00:01:16.650> one<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.040> liquid

can I use tap water in making formula
this<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.310> something<00:02:11.790> on<00:02:11.910> which<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.209> should

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
this is something on which you should

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.100 
this is something on which you should
check<00:02:12.450> with<00:02:12.870> your

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
check with your

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.810 
check with your
doctor<00:02:13.470> I<00:02:13.650> did<00:02:13.980> talk<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.340> my<00:02:14.430> doctor<00:02:14.490> about

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
doctor I did talk to my doctor about

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.460 
doctor I did talk to my doctor about
this<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.270> he<00:02:15.390> said<00:02:15.420> in<00:02:15.690> New<00:02:15.810> York<00:02:15.990> City<00:02:16.200> it's

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
this and he said in New York City it's

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.430 
this and he said in New York City it's
fine<00:02:16.980> but<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.150> have<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.540> make<00:02:18.720> sure<00:02:18.750> because

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
fine but you have to make sure because

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.740 
fine but you have to make sure because
in<00:02:19.650> some<00:02:19.860> cases<00:02:20.160> actually<00:02:20.640> fluoride<00:02:21.540> levels

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
in some cases actually fluoride levels

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.020 
in some cases actually fluoride levels
can<00:02:22.110> be<00:02:22.230> too<00:02:22.440> high<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:23.280> doctors<00:02:23.700> will<00:02:23.850> want

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
can be too high and doctors will want

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.880 
can be too high and doctors will want
you<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.240> alternate<00:02:24.750> between<00:02:24.870> using<00:02:25.380> tap<00:02:25.650> water

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
you to alternate between using tap water

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.680 
you to alternate between using tap water
and<00:02:26.190> using<00:02:26.370> other<00:02:26.640> types<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:27.120> water<00:02:27.330> so<00:02:27.540> this

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
and using other types of water so this

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.570 
and using other types of water so this
is<00:02:27.750> something<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.050> should<00:02:28.380> check<00:02:28.530> out<00:02:28.650> okay

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
is something you should check out okay

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.550 
is something you should check out okay
so<00:02:30.000> let's<00:02:30.240> now<00:02:30.420> get<00:02:30.630> down<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.020> mechanics

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
so let's now get down to the mechanics

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.900 
so let's now get down to the mechanics
of<00:02:31.710> how<00:02:31.740> you're<00:02:32.100> going<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.250> prepare<00:02:32.670> your

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
of how you're going to prepare your

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.310 
of how you're going to prepare your
formula<00:02:33.360> now<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.570> first<00:02:33.870> thing<00:02:33.990> you<00:02:34.110> want<00:02:34.260> to

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
formula now the first thing you want to

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.720 
formula now the first thing you want to
do<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.650> want<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:34.920> make<00:02:35.070> sure<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.340> have<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.520> very

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
do you want to make sure you have a very

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.180 
do you want to make sure you have a very
sterilized<00:02:36.420> bottle<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.530> nipple<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.070> that

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
sterilized bottle and nipple and that

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.710 
sterilized bottle and nipple and that
your<00:02:38.310> hands<00:02:38.490> are<00:02:38.640> clean<00:02:38.790> so<00:02:39.090> wash<00:02:39.240> your<00:02:39.270> hands

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
your hands are clean so wash your hands

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.840 
your hands are clean so wash your hands
carefully<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.440> Here<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.220> am<00:02:41.310> I've<00:02:41.550> got<00:02:41.700> my

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
carefully and Here I am I've got my

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.010 
carefully and Here I am I've got my
bottle<00:02:42.120> I'm<00:02:42.180> going<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.360> use<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.480> born<00:02:42.750> free

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
bottle I'm going to use a born free

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.220 
bottle I'm going to use a born free
bottle<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:44.420> born<00:02:45.420> free<00:02:45.600> actually<00:02:45.780> has<00:02:46.050> these

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
bottle and born free actually has these

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.960 
bottle and born free actually has these
nice<00:02:46.440> inserts<00:02:46.950> these<00:02:47.130> all<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.550> course<00:02:47.760> have<00:02:47.910> to

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
nice inserts these all of course have to

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.820 
nice inserts these all of course have to
be<00:02:48.030> clean<00:02:48.300> too<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:49.410> first<00:02:49.620> thing<00:02:49.740> I'm

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
be clean too and the first thing I'm

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.050 
be clean too and the first thing I'm
going<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:50.010> do<00:02:50.130> is<00:02:50.250> I'm<00:02:50.370> going<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.520> put<00:02:50.670> my<00:02:50.790> water

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
going to do is I'm going to put my water

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.820 
going to do is I'm going to put my water
in<00:02:51.270> my<00:02:51.540> bottle<00:02:51.870> not<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.410> other<00:02:52.530> way<00:02:52.709> around

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
in my bottle not the other way around

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.710 
in my bottle not the other way around
because<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.340> can<00:02:53.640> skew<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.120> measurements

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
because that can skew the measurements

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.660 
because that can skew the measurements
of<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.870> formula<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:55.350> I'm<00:02:55.500> just<00:02:55.800> for<00:02:55.980> for

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
of the formula so I'm just for for

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.699 
of the formula so I'm just for for
demonstration<00:02:57.330> purposes<00:02:57.900> I'm<00:02:58.200> going<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.440> pour

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
demonstration purposes I'm going to pour

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.000 
demonstration purposes I'm going to pour
up<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.160> four<00:02:59.550> ounces<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.600> I'm<00:03:01.320> using<00:03:01.500> my<00:03:01.620> Brita

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
up to four ounces and I'm using my Brita

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.729 
up to four ounces and I'm using my Brita
so<00:03:02.489> this<00:03:02.820> is<00:03:02.970> tap<00:03:03.180> water<00:03:03.209> but<00:03:03.630> it's<00:03:03.780> it's

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
so this is tap water but it's it's

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.380 
so this is tap water but it's it's
sterilize<00:03:05.190> tap<00:03:05.400> water<00:03:05.580> so<00:03:05.760> I<00:03:05.820> go<00:03:06.000> right<00:03:06.209> up<00:03:06.360> to

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
sterilize tap water so I go right up to

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.930 
sterilize tap water so I go right up to
the<00:03:06.570> four<00:03:06.780> ounces<00:03:07.140> on<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.410> bottle<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:07.980> then

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
the four ounces on the bottle and then

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.570 
the four ounces on the bottle and then
I'm<00:03:09.090> going<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.420> add<00:03:09.600> my<00:03:10.350> formula<00:03:10.950> I'm<00:03:11.370> going<00:03:11.430> to

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
I'm going to add my formula I'm going to

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.800 
I'm going to add my formula I'm going to
use<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.790> one<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:11.970> I've<00:03:12.180> already<00:03:12.570> opened

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
use the one that I've already opened

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.870 
use the one that I've already opened
wait<00:03:13.530> like<00:03:13.920> that<00:03:14.040> one<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:14.400> got<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.700> get<00:03:14.760> the

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
wait like that one I got to get the

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.240 
wait like that one I got to get the
similac<00:03:15.209> okay<00:03:15.840> so<00:03:17.420> typically<00:03:18.420> with<00:03:18.630> formula

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
similac okay so typically with formula

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.970 
similac okay so typically with formula
one<00:03:20.250> level<00:03:20.850> scoop<00:03:21.180> of<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.450> formula<00:03:21.900> is<00:03:22.110> equal

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
one level scoop of the formula is equal

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.490 
one level scoop of the formula is equal
to<00:03:23.130> two<00:03:23.370> ounces<00:03:23.940> of<00:03:24.000> water<00:03:24.420> so<00:03:24.900> we<00:03:25.080> have<00:03:25.110> four

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
to two ounces of water so we have four

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.229 
to two ounces of water so we have four
ounces<00:03:25.890> here<00:03:26.400> not<00:03:26.760> being<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:27.060> great

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
ounces here not being a great

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.550 
ounces here not being a great
mathematician<00:03:27.450> but<00:03:28.049> that's<00:03:28.200> going<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:28.410> tell

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
mathematician but that's going to tell

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.830 
mathematician but that's going to tell
me<00:03:28.709> I<00:03:28.739> need<00:03:28.950> two<00:03:29.310> scoops<00:03:29.610> of<00:03:29.730> formula<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.390> I'm

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
me I need two scoops of formula and I'm

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.000 
me I need two scoops of formula and I'm
going<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.019> make<00:03:31.170> sure<00:03:31.320> that<00:03:31.470> they<00:03:31.620> are<00:03:31.739> quite

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
going to make sure that they are quite

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.210 
going to make sure that they are quite
level<00:03:32.570> all<00:03:33.570> right<00:03:33.810> so<00:03:34.019> I<00:03:34.049> round<00:03:34.799> it<00:03:34.950> out<00:03:35.040> like

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
level all right so I round it out like

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.130 
level all right so I round it out like
this<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:35.580> then<00:03:35.670> I<00:03:35.850> use<00:03:36.120> my<00:03:36.269> clean<00:03:36.600> index

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
this and then I use my clean index

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.470 
this and then I use my clean index
finger<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.560> just<00:03:37.850> just<00:03:38.850> like<00:03:39.000> that<00:03:39.180> just<00:03:39.360> like

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
finger to just just like that just like

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.120 
finger to just just like that just like
you<00:03:39.720> were<00:03:40.110> making<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.620> know<00:03:40.709> just<00:03:40.950> like<00:03:41.010> you

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
you were making you know just like you

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.350 
you were making you know just like you
make<00:03:41.280> your<00:03:41.430> cookies<00:03:41.580> when<00:03:41.940> you<00:03:42.030> don't<00:03:42.180> want<00:03:42.299> to

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
make your cookies when you don't want to

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.720 
make your cookies when you don't want to
overdo<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:42.720> on<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:42.959> salt<00:03:43.320> or<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.500> sugar<00:03:43.799> okay

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
overdo it on the salt or the sugar okay

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.820 
overdo it on the salt or the sugar okay
so<00:03:44.790> there<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.150> go<00:03:45.239> and<00:03:45.780> --duck<00:03:46.620> --duck<00:03:46.650> --duck

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
so there I go and --duck --duck --duck

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.100 
so there I go and --duck --duck --duck
nice<00:03:47.549> smooth<00:03:48.320> rounded<00:03:49.320> scoopful<00:03:50.450> it's<00:03:51.450> really

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
nice smooth rounded scoopful it's really

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.810 
nice smooth rounded scoopful it's really
really<00:03:52.560> important<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:53.400> you<00:03:53.549> don't

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
really important that you don't

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.430 
really important that you don't
underestimate<00:03:54.239> it<00:03:54.720> in<00:03:55.019> terms<00:03:55.170> of<00:03:55.320> the

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
underestimate it in terms of the

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.199 
underestimate it in terms of the
quantity<00:03:55.890> of<00:03:56.040> formula<00:03:56.519> you<00:03:56.640> want<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.090> make

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
quantity of formula you want to make

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.490 
quantity of formula you want to make
sure<00:03:57.239> your<00:03:57.570> baby's<00:03:57.870> getting<00:03:58.200> all<00:03:58.350> that

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
sure your baby's getting all that

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.380 
sure your baby's getting all that
nutrition<00:03:59.010> and<00:03:59.190> you<00:03:59.250> cannot<00:03:59.790> under<00:04:00.120> do<00:04:00.269> it

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
nutrition and you cannot under do it

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.509 
nutrition and you cannot under do it
that's<00:04:00.600> very<00:04:00.720> very<00:04:01.140> important<00:04:01.590> it's<00:04:02.220> better

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
that's very very important it's better

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.699 
that's very very important it's better
to<00:04:02.700> use<00:04:02.880> room-temperature<00:04:03.299> water<00:04:03.840> because

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
to use room-temperature water because

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.500 
to use room-temperature water because
that's<00:04:04.980> going<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.489> dissolve<00:04:05.670> more<00:04:06.239> quickly

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
that's going to dissolve more quickly

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.090 
that's going to dissolve more quickly
and<00:04:06.840> more<00:04:06.959> easily<00:04:07.110> in<00:04:07.410> your<00:04:07.440> bottle<00:04:07.799> so<00:04:07.950> now

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
and more easily in your bottle so now

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.530 
and more easily in your bottle so now
I've<00:04:08.340> attached<00:04:08.700> my<00:04:08.820> little<00:04:09.120> of<00:04:09.209> Born<00:04:09.450> Free

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
I've attached my little of Born Free

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.319 
I've attached my little of Born Free
piece<00:04:09.930> I'm<00:04:10.530> screwing<00:04:11.519> on<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:11.880> top<00:04:12.060> of<00:04:12.209> my

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
piece I'm screwing on the top of my

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.330 
piece I'm screwing on the top of my
bottle<00:04:12.660> make<00:04:12.810> sure<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:13.079> get<00:04:13.260> this<00:04:13.350> on<00:04:13.560> level

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
bottle make sure you get this on level

and tight sometimes when I'm in a hurry

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.710 
and tight sometimes when I'm in a hurry
it<00:04:16.590> goes<00:04:16.950> on<00:04:17.160> slanted<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:18.120> then<00:04:18.269> it<00:04:18.390> will<00:04:18.510> leak

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
it goes on slanted and then it will leak

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.979 
it goes on slanted and then it will leak
then<00:04:19.709> I'm<00:04:19.859> going<00:04:19.979> to<00:04:20.010> put<00:04:20.190> on<00:04:20.220> my<00:04:20.459> top<00:04:20.519> and<00:04:21.060> I'm

just going to shake and I'm going to

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.250 
just going to shake and I'm going to
wait<00:04:23.729> and<00:04:23.970> those<00:04:24.120> clumps<00:04:24.510> are<00:04:24.840> going<00:04:25.080> to<00:04:25.140> go

you're going to want to do that do not
warm<00:04:50.560> bottles<00:04:50.980> in<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.190> microwave<00:04:51.670> this<00:04:51.940> can

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
warm bottles in the microwave this can

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.930 
warm bottles in the microwave this can
cause<00:04:52.380> unevenness<00:04:53.380> and<00:04:53.590> temperature<00:04:54.070> the

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
cause unevenness and temperature the

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.610 
cause unevenness and temperature the
best<00:04:55.240> thing<00:04:55.420> to<00:04:55.450> do<00:04:55.690> is<00:04:55.930> to<00:04:56.170> take<00:04:56.380> your

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
best thing to do is to take your

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.620 
best thing to do is to take your
prepared<00:04:57.190> bottle<00:04:57.640> of<00:04:57.760> formula<00:04:58.030> out<00:04:58.270> of<00:04:58.330> the

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
prepared bottle of formula out of the
