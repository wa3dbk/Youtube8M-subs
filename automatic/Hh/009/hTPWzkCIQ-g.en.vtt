00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:18.050
 listen so hello to everyone android 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.990
 and this little video is a little off 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.880
 standard course for my channel this 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.399
 just a small gameplay 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.320
 small such instrument of plaine we 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:28.910
 talking wheel with a Thai device 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.099
 who bought for a couple of days literally 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.610
 you know maybe i love sometimes 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.950
 finger sniper device and decided to general 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.610
 record such a fight so now it is quite 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.640
 many other boxes and YouTube are popular 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.170
 In our game they do it, I decided 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.570
 also try to look at it 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.090
 react you write that opinion in 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.280
 comments like to see such videos 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.579
 on my channel maybe sniper 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.050
 a device with a shotgun or something else and 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.200
 which modes do you want to see and 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.120
 You want to instill in general also write 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.369
 write to the VKontakte group in my bitch 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.930
 will be in the description there we will be able to basis 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.909
 You can talk to me about this topic. 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.829
 ask questions suggestions so on 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.740
 We will discuss this here with 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:15.170
 as you people write comments and in 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.479
 in general, I myself know that they love that when 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.300
 and here comes such a gameplay 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.190
 let's say in ordinary battle on a burning field 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.290
 for me to be a member of what and they love it 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.030
 gameplay with comments that is alive 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.659
 exactly 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.900
 play time recorded i tried also 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.350
 do but if you have some news 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.119
 it is unlikely to turn out to be a string if i 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.450
 making a game 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.920
 gameplay with my comments then i dont 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.500
 I can show you less 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.479
 normal game since i will 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.080
 focus exactly on the voice on 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.390
 conversation and the game will be generally 0 and 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.890
 attention I think this is very me 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.789
 like or is there a second option 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.770
 when i'm focused game and i just 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.810
 I will not say anything it will just 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.090
 words in a minute I think no one 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.490
 interesting and it makes no sense to do so 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.560
 so I decided to look for some 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.459
 a compromise of course you can write your 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:16.390
 opinion in the comments but I decided to just 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.920
 put the music on the background and with the sound of the game 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.910
 again the sound of the game will be completely 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.470
 written that is 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:26.380
 be heard and on the background will be quietly so 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.300
 ugly music some background 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.420
 which you can easily replace with your 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.010
 just turned off the sound 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.650
 I think this is the most correct decision to 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.550
 the moment you can write your opinion in 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.440
 comments 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.420
 amber on yu tuba again I repeat 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.360
 calendar group vkontakte to this video 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.489
 times themes VKontakte and so on I think 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.069
 together we will decide if at all 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.370
 want to see a video of this genre my 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:56.360
 channel as now comes frag show 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.580
 some occasional guides and so on in 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.700
 mostly cafe if you're interested 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.500
 such a format then write what you want 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.200
 see him on the channel and write how you 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.360
 imagine it well, but on this 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.910
 all I wanted to say now is I probably 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.549
 paint put some melodic 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.390
 homely song to sleep and you 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.390
 watch this video 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.630
 and 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.180
 and 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.259
 saw snow
