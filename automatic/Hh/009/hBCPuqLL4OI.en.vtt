00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.740
 Hello, one of the subscribers 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.200
 asked to make a video on a double 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.870
 squeezing the clutch here today and tell 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.120
 what is it a double squeeze clutch it 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.730
 used on more ancient cars 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.720
 where the gearbox was not 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.000
 synchronizers and switching 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.580
 just double you 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.750
 in order to reduce the load on 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.310
 gears gears in modern 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.990
 cars of course there is 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.390
 synchronizers and shifters 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.579
 performed but from 1 to 2 there from second to 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.160
 the third 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:41.399
 in one switch here with double you 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.070
 press principle how would work pedals he 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.050
 so I mean you go first 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.510
 neutral gear and pedals release 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.910
 and then go to the second 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.620
 transmission go into technical 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.230
 details until I will be there 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.510
 happens with the box but just this 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.910
 allows you to reduce the load on the gears 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:05.280
 and so the box will serve 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.080
 longer if switching idiot with 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.340
 increased low gear then 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.340
 peregazovka applied that is when you 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.659
 from second gear to first 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.240
 squeeze the clutch moves to 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.930
 neutral release all the pedals give 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.909
 board and then lower the gas squeeze 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.070
 the clutch is already moving down 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.750
 the transfer then done this in order to 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.270
 gears you spinning with one 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.159
 speed so the load on them will be 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.549
 less now show something like this 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.549
 was happening 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.640
 let us suppose 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.250
 go go first to neutral 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.020
 transfer all release later entry 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.020
 second gear is squeezed and switched on 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.729
 also in third gear 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.920
 that is, go to the nitro spoon and then 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.650
 in third gear then there it is 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.509
 called a double squeeze clutch in 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.750
 it was mainly used on freight 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.640
 vehicles which were not in boxes 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.140
 synchronizers if go down 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.970
 switching then you have to do 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.000
 peregazovka meaning you squeeze 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.690
 clutch put on the neutral push 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.720
 gas let him go and then the inclusion 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.080
 talking about not waiting for the transfer 2 of course until 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:33.150
 this must be reduced first speed 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:36.540
 let's go food from i to 2 to slow down 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.340
 clutch squeezed into neutral put 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.830
 pressed the gas on and then already goes 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.810
 first gear connection i.e. 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.970
 thus the load and gears 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.970
 will be smaller
