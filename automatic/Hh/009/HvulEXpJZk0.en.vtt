00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
these the recyclable perhaps a good idea

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.609 
these the recyclable perhaps a good idea
so<00:00:30.519> I<00:00:30.550> made<00:00:30.789> a<00:00:30.820> few<00:00:31.060> videos<00:00:31.290> showing<00:00:32.290> that

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
so I made a few videos showing that

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.180 
so I made a few videos showing that
they're<00:00:32.860> very<00:00:33.070> easy<00:00:33.160> to<00:00:33.579> manipulate<00:00:34.180> but

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
they're very easy to manipulate but

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.680

that<00:01:04.030> being<00:01:04.239> said<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.580> pack<00:01:06.909> itself<00:01:07.479> I<00:01:07.810> don't

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:08.469 
that being said the pack itself I don't

it's<00:01:08.740> only<00:01:09.179> eco-friendly<00:01:10.179> if<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:11.140> person<00:01:11.590> who

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
it's only eco-friendly if the person who

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.899 
it's only eco-friendly if the person who
opens<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:12.219> path<00:01:12.460> recycles<00:01:13.299> it<00:01:14.189> now<00:01:15.189> if<00:01:15.609> you<00:01:15.789> go

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
opens the path recycles it now if you go

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.419 
opens the path recycles it now if you go
to<00:01:15.999> any<00:01:16.299> local<00:01:16.719> game<00:01:17.079> store<00:01:17.109> most<00:01:18.070> of<00:01:18.249> them<00:01:18.399> are

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
to any local game store most of them are

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:21.749 
to any local game store most of them are
not<00:01:18.789> going<00:01:18.999> to<00:01:19.119> have<00:01:19.270> recycling<00:01:20.079> and<00:01:20.609> so<00:01:21.609> the

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
not going to have recycling and so the

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.480 
not going to have recycling and so the
idea<00:01:21.819> of<00:01:22.359> eco-friendly<00:01:23.219> recyclable<00:01:24.219> path

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
idea of eco-friendly recyclable path

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.559 
idea of eco-friendly recyclable path
only<00:01:24.789> works<00:01:25.539> if<00:01:25.929> people<00:01:26.380> are<00:01:26.469> recycling<00:01:27.100> tax

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:27.569 
only works if people are recycling tax

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.010 
only works if people are recycling tax
