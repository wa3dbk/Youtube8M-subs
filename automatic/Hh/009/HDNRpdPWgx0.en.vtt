minutes
so<00:02:28.540> we<00:02:29.319> will<00:02:29.560> adjust<00:02:30.129> the<00:02:30.310> heat<00:02:30.519> just<00:02:30.849> to<00:02:31.030> have

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
so we will adjust the heat just to have

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.360 
so we will adjust the heat just to have
a<00:02:31.209> rolling<00:02:31.659> simmer<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:34.120> then<00:02:35.099> just<00:02:36.099> check

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
a rolling simmer and then just check

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.319 
a rolling simmer and then just check
every<00:02:37.359> now<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.659> then<00:02:37.780> that<00:02:38.579> the<00:02:39.579> curry<00:02:40.030> is<00:02:40.150> not

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
every now and then that the curry is not

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.059 
every now and then that the curry is not
sticking<00:02:40.719> to<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.930> bottom<00:02:41.049> of<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.409> pan<00:02:41.650> and

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
sticking to the bottom of the pan and

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.910 
sticking to the bottom of the pan and
then<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.909> sauce<00:02:43.120> is<00:02:43.299> reducing<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:43.959> a<00:02:44.230> required

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
then the sauce is reducing to a required

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.960 
then the sauce is reducing to a required
consistency

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.870 

so<00:02:49.900> that's<00:02:50.080> how<00:02:50.290> easy<00:02:50.320> it<00:02:50.830> is<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.280> make<00:02:51.460> pitch

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880
