and the nineties

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.150 
and the nineties
maybe<00:00:45.090> like<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> bluesy<00:00:45.870> overdrive<00:00:46.260> pedal<00:00:46.620> more

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
maybe like a bluesy overdrive pedal more

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.950 
maybe like a bluesy overdrive pedal more
a<00:00:47.190> high<00:00:47.430> gain<00:00:47.700> pedal<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.329> like<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> push

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
a high gain pedal and just like a push

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.260 
a high gain pedal and just like a push
overdrive<00:00:49.320> just<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.040> get<00:00:50.190> different<00:00:50.399> gain

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
overdrive just so I get different gain

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.299 
overdrive just so I get different gain
stages<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> amp<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.380> then<00:00:52.710> I'd<00:00:52.800> use<00:00:52.829> some

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
stages of the amp and then I'd use some

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.650 
stages of the amp and then I'd use some
modulation<00:00:53.760> effects<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.329> really<00:00:54.570> like

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
modulation effects I really like

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.819 
modulation effects I really like
striving<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.140> stuff<00:00:55.320> for<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.710> it's

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
striving and stuff for that so it's

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.530 
striving and stuff for that so it's
quite<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.610> quite<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.820> lot<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.030> stuff<00:00:57.239> going<00:00:57.420> on

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
quite it's quite a lot of stuff going on

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.270 
quite it's quite a lot of stuff going on
in<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.750> board<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.079> I've<00:00:58.140> also<00:00:58.260> got<00:00:58.410> my<00:00:58.829> tech

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
in the board and I've also got my tech

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.470 
in the board and I've also got my tech
would<00:00:59.489> be<00:00:59.579> operating<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.000> lot<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.239> stuff<00:01:00.390> off

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
would be operating a lot of stuff off

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.090 
would be operating a lot of stuff off
the<00:01:00.660> side<00:01:00.840> aside<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.140> as<00:01:01.230> pre<00:01:01.440> got<00:01:02.070> a

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
up as I would my valve heads so get a

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:21.890 
up as I would my valve heads so get a

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
there's got a really deep rich cleanness

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.660 
there's got a really deep rich cleanness
down<00:01:25.930> there<00:01:26.140> which<00:01:26.290> only<00:01:26.979> never<00:01:27.250> me<00:01:27.430> you

Marshall<00:02:06.240> kind<00:02:06.900> of<00:02:06.960> thing<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.290> then<00:02:07.410> I'd

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
Marshall kind of thing and then I'd

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.859 
Marshall kind of thing and then I'd
probably<00:02:07.920> use<00:02:08.100> that<00:02:08.460> setting<00:02:08.729> it's<00:02:09.420> not<00:02:09.570> kind

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
probably use that setting it's not kind

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.240 
probably use that setting it's not kind
of<00:02:09.899> Hendrix<00:02:10.289> II<00:02:10.380> sort<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.679> things<00:02:10.860> I'll<00:02:11.070> just

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250

so we're sticking with the same amp
model<00:05:49.580> here<00:05:49.759> which<00:05:49.880> is<00:05:50.210> round<00:05:50.990> one<00:05:51.259> which<00:05:52.069> is

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 
model here which is round one which is

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:54.550 
model here which is round one which is
identical<00:05:53.389> to<00:05:53.419> that<00:05:53.690> late<00:05:53.960> seventies<00:05:54.349> early

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
identical to that late seventies early

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.820 
identical to that late seventies early
eighties<00:05:55.180> all-american<00:05:56.180> rock<00:05:57.169> sound<00:05:57.470> which

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
eighties all-american rock sound which

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.620 
eighties all-american rock sound which
I'm<00:05:57.949> sure<00:05:58.099> we're<00:05:58.250> all<00:05:58.310> familiar<00:05:58.340> with<00:05:58.699> I've

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
I'm sure we're all familiar with I've

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.719 
I'm sure we're all familiar with I've
changed<00:06:00.169> a<00:06:00.289> little<00:06:00.470> bit<00:06:00.680> of<00:06:00.770> EQ<00:06:00.919> put<00:06:01.310> me<00:06:01.430> a<00:06:01.460> bit

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
changed a little bit of EQ put me a bit

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:03.520 
changed a little bit of EQ put me a bit
more<00:06:01.759> bottom<00:06:02.150> in<00:06:02.270> a<00:06:02.479> slight<00:06:03.139> bit<00:06:03.380> more

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
more bottom in a slight bit more

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.800 
more bottom in a slight bit more
delaying<00:06:03.949> and<00:06:04.270> that's<00:06:05.270> probably<00:06:05.449> what<00:06:05.630> I'd<00:06:05.690> do

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
delaying and that's probably what I'd do

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.050 
delaying and that's probably what I'd do
with<00:06:05.930> a<00:06:05.960> lead<00:06:06.169> sound<00:06:06.349> anyway<00:06:06.819> yeah<00:06:07.819> and<00:06:07.940> it's

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
with a lead sound anyway yeah and it's

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:24.939 
with a lead sound anyway yeah and it's
not<00:06:08.120> something<00:06:08.419> like<00:06:08.449> this

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:24.949 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.040 

so<00:06:25.949> just<00:06:26.160> change<00:06:26.340> to<00:06:26.400> a<00:06:26.520> different<00:06:26.580> amp<00:06:27.050> what

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
so just change to a different amp what

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.780 
so just change to a different amp what
being<00:06:28.230> saying<00:06:28.440> and<00:06:28.740> we're<00:06:28.889> on<00:06:29.040> the<00:06:29.580> southern

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
being saying and we're on the southern
