00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
the day after all of that and yes so

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.309 
the day after all of that and yes so
this<00:03:24.019> is<00:03:24.199> the<00:03:24.319> output<00:03:24.500> of<00:03:24.799> it<00:03:25.359> not<00:03:26.359> much<00:03:26.569> did

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
this is the output of it not much did

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:28.839 
this is the output of it not much did
this<00:03:27.530> is<00:03:27.739> actually<00:03:28.189> after<00:03:28.459> we've<00:03:28.579> used<00:03:28.730> a

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
this is actually after we've used a

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.250 
this is actually after we've used a
bunch<00:03:29.030> I<00:03:29.150> think<00:03:29.329> total<00:03:29.629> we<00:03:29.719> probably<00:03:29.930> put<00:03:30.169> out

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
bunch I think total we probably put out

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.619 
bunch I think total we probably put out
about<00:03:30.409> 15<00:03:30.799> dubs<00:03:31.040> of<00:03:31.159> potions<00:03:31.579> using<00:03:32.540> this

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
about 15 dubs of potions using this

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.119 
about 15 dubs of potions using this
system<00:03:32.870> but<00:03:33.199> basically<00:03:33.439> how<00:03:33.650> it<00:03:33.680> works<00:03:33.919> is

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
system but basically how it works is

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.280 
system but basically how it works is
this<00:03:34.669> one<00:03:35.120> button<00:03:35.480> is<00:03:35.629> hooked<00:03:35.930> to<00:03:35.989> every

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
this one button is hooked to every

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.530 
this one button is hooked to every
single<00:03:36.469> input<00:03:36.769> this<00:03:37.040> is<00:03:37.159> the<00:03:37.250> classic<00:03:37.540> Brewer

just I wouldn't do that just as extended
speed<00:04:31.009> is<00:04:31.099> nasty<00:04:31.520> but<00:04:31.699> uh<00:04:31.759> I<00:04:32.320> could<00:04:33.320> do<00:04:34.009> that<00:04:34.039> if

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
speed is nasty but uh I could do that if

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.800 
speed is nasty but uh I could do that if
I<00:04:34.430> wanted<00:04:34.669> to<00:04:34.729> this<00:04:34.969> number<00:04:35.210> whatever<00:04:35.389> I<00:04:35.539> want
