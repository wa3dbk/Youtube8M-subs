00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
I post is a ground war for the most part

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.919 
I post is a ground war for the most part
and<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.220> chose<00:00:29.429> hardline<00:00:30.060> as<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.420> first<00:00:30.630> perk

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
and I chose hardline as the first perk

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.020 
and I chose hardline as the first perk
because<00:00:31.349> i'm<00:00:31.769> running<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.279> spy<00:00:32.520> plane<00:00:32.850> and

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
because i'm running the spy plane and

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.520 
because i'm running the spy plane and
free<00:00:33.329> for<00:00:33.510> all<00:00:33.600> from<00:00:33.750> what<00:00:33.870> i<00:00:33.899> noticed<00:00:34.380> i<00:00:34.500> was

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
free for all from what i noticed i was

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.130 
free for all from what i noticed i was
only<00:00:34.800> able<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.219> play<00:00:35.430> 10<00:00:35.700> games<00:00:36.000> but<00:00:36.780> from<00:00:37.020> what

only able to play 10 games but from what

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.750 
only able to play 10 games but from what
I<00:00:37.200> noticed<00:00:37.620> seems<00:00:37.950> like<00:00:38.190> that's<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.520> best

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
I noticed seems like that's the best

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.580 
I noticed seems like that's the best
choice<00:00:39.090> because<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.329> mediately<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.020> started<00:00:40.440> off

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
choice because I mediately I started off

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.619 
choice because I mediately I started off
with<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.860> counter<00:00:41.250> spy<00:00:41.489> plane<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.059> here's<00:00:42.570> a

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
with the counter spy plane and here's a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.810 
with the counter spy plane and here's a
guy<00:00:42.719> hiding<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.649> corner<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.070> really<00:00:44.640> don't

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.940 
know what the heck he's doing or but
he's<00:00:46.620> only<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.950> level<00:00:47.190> 10<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:48.270> um<00:00:48.660> yeah<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.440> was

experiment with the counter spy plane in
the<00:00:51.960> first<00:00:51.989> game<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.710> realized<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.250> it's

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
the first game and I realized that it's

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.670 
the first game and I realized that it's
just<00:00:53.610> not<00:00:53.760> not<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.480> big<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.930> deal<00:00:55.110> I'd

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
around the map effectively without

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.210

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
work here but um yeah so I was able to

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.640 
work here but um yeah so I was able to
kind<00:02:22.580> of<00:02:22.730> get<00:02:22.880> away<00:02:23.150> with<00:02:23.360> not<00:02:23.570> having<00:02:23.870> a

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
kind of get away with not having a

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.740 
kind of get away with not having a
super-fast<00:02:25.160> sensitivity<00:02:25.880> you<00:02:25.970> know<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.390> the

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
super-fast sensitivity you know and the

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.020 
super-fast sensitivity you know and the
3s<00:02:27.110> just<00:02:27.380> feels<00:02:27.620> perfect<00:02:28.190> it's<00:02:28.340> very<00:02:28.580> smooth

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
3s just feels perfect it's very smooth

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.120 
3s just feels perfect it's very smooth
you<00:02:29.780> could<00:02:29.960> turn<00:02:30.200> around<00:02:30.230> pretty<00:02:30.920> much

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
you could turn around pretty much

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.230 
you could turn around pretty much
instantly<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:32.740> it<00:02:33.740> like<00:02:34.040> really<00:02:34.250> suits<00:02:35.120> me

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
instantly and it like really suits me

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.030 
instantly and it like really suits me
well<00:02:35.360> now<00:02:35.780> I'm<00:02:36.200> going<00:02:36.380> to<00:02:36.440> stick<00:02:36.650> here<00:02:36.860> I<00:02:36.890> think

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
well now I'm going to stick here I think

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.980 
well now I'm going to stick here I think
permanently<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.940> only<00:02:38.150> thing<00:02:38.330> is<00:02:38.480> I<00:02:38.510> may

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
permanently the only thing is I may

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.740 
permanently the only thing is I may
decide<00:02:39.890> that<00:02:40.360> occasionally<00:02:41.360> drop<00:02:41.600> my

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
decide that occasionally drop my

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.240 
decide that occasionally drop my
sensitivity<00:02:42.350> when<00:02:42.650> I'm<00:02:42.770> playing<00:02:42.890> with<00:02:43.190> a

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
sensitivity when I'm playing with a

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.580 
sensitivity when I'm playing with a
three-shot<00:02:43.790> barest<00:02:44.150> weapon<00:02:44.510> because<00:02:44.870> it's

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
three-shot barest weapon because it's

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.310 
three-shot barest weapon because it's
really<00:02:46.250> easy<00:02:46.490> to<00:02:46.760> use<00:02:46.820> a<00:02:47.110> three-shot<00:02:48.110> bears

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
really easy to use a three-shot bears

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.400 
really easy to use a three-shot bears
weapon<00:02:48.710> on<00:02:48.800> a<00:02:48.830> to<00:02:49.040> sensitivity<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:50.410> with

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
weapon on a to sensitivity and with

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.990 
weapon on a to sensitivity and with
automatic<00:02:52.010> ARS<00:02:52.430> I'm<00:02:52.520> going<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:52.730> stick<00:02:52.970> with

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
automatic ARS I'm going to stick with

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.810 
automatic ARS I'm going to stick with
the<00:02:53.390> three<00:02:54.080> because<00:02:54.470> it<00:02:54.740> just<00:02:55.070> really<00:02:55.790> feels

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
the three because it just really feels

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.640 
the three because it just really feels
like<00:02:56.210> it's<00:02:56.510> going<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.720> open<00:02:56.900> me<00:02:57.170> up<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.560> whole

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
like it's going to open me up to a whole

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.740 
like it's going to open me up to a whole
different<00:02:57.860> level<00:02:58.580> of<00:02:58.790> being<00:02:59.150> able<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.480> play

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
different level of being able to play

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.210 
different level of being able to play
like<00:03:00.110> when<00:03:00.290> I'm<00:03:00.410> playing<00:03:00.530> aggressively

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
like when I'm playing aggressively

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.950 
like when I'm playing aggressively
because<00:03:01.430> a<00:03:01.520> lot<00:03:01.730> of<00:03:01.760> times<00:03:02.060> you<00:03:02.690> know<00:03:02.810> I'll

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
because a lot of times you know I'll

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.540 
because a lot of times you know I'll
just<00:03:03.140> not<00:03:03.440> be<00:03:03.590> able<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.830> spin<00:03:04.160> fast<00:03:04.430> enough

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
just not be able to spin fast enough

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.160 
just not be able to spin fast enough
especially<00:03:04.970> when<00:03:05.420> I'm<00:03:05.510> aim<00:03:05.750> down<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:05.990> sights

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
especially when I'm aim down the sights

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.380 
especially when I'm aim down the sights
that's<00:03:06.710> when<00:03:06.890> it<00:03:06.980> really<00:03:07.060> comes<00:03:08.060> into<00:03:08.300> play

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
that's when it really comes into play

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.120 
that's when it really comes into play
and<00:03:08.810> that's<00:03:09.200> one<00:03:09.500> of<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.620> things<00:03:09.710> that<00:03:10.100> I

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
and that's one of the things that I

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.550 
and that's one of the things that I
didn't<00:03:10.760> get<00:03:10.850> to<00:03:10.910> mention<00:03:11.120> during<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:12.080> dual

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
didn't get to mention during the dual

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.530 
didn't get to mention during the dual
commentary<00:03:13.010> with<00:03:13.340> extras<00:03:13.820> i<00:03:13.970> wanted<00:03:14.270> to<00:03:14.360> talk

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
commentary with extras i wanted to talk

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.810 
commentary with extras i wanted to talk
about<00:03:14.600> that<00:03:15.020> was<00:03:15.320> with<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:15.950> infrared<00:03:16.280> scope

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
about that was with the infrared scope

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.880 
about that was with the infrared scope
one<00:03:17.120> of<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.300> real<00:03:17.540> problems<00:03:17.570> I<00:03:18.200> had<00:03:18.440> with<00:03:18.680> it

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
one of the real problems I had with it

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.250 
one of the real problems I had with it
was<00:03:19.030> when<00:03:20.030> you<00:03:20.150> aim<00:03:20.330> down<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:20.630> sights<00:03:20.750> it

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
was when you aim down the sights it

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.110 
was when you aim down the sights it
almost<00:03:21.890> turns<00:03:22.100> into<00:03:22.310> a<00:03:22.370> sniper<00:03:22.730> you<00:03:23.000> know

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
almost turns into a sniper you know

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.520 
almost turns into a sniper you know
because<00:03:23.480> you<00:03:23.600> can<00:03:23.750> like<00:03:23.870> hold<00:03:24.110> your<00:03:24.320> breath

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
because you can like hold your breath

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.890 
because you can like hold your breath
and<00:03:24.770> on<00:03:25.520> a<00:03:25.550> to<00:03:25.850> sensitivity<00:03:26.360> if<00:03:26.600> you've<00:03:26.720> ever

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
and on a to sensitivity if you've ever

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.380 
and on a to sensitivity if you've ever
tried<00:03:27.200> to<00:03:27.350> snipe<00:03:27.620> that<00:03:27.650> is<00:03:28.130> entirely<00:03:28.580> too<00:03:28.880> slow

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
tried to snipe that is entirely too slow

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.940 
tried to snipe that is entirely too slow
and<00:03:29.420> that<00:03:29.989> was<00:03:30.140> one<00:03:30.320> of<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.500> things<00:03:30.680> that<00:03:30.830> I

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
and that was one of the things that I

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.190 
and that was one of the things that I
was<00:03:31.070> really<00:03:31.340> struggling<00:03:31.760> with<00:03:32.000> but<00:03:32.450> I<00:03:32.630> stuck

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
was really struggling with but I stuck

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.690 
was really struggling with but I stuck
it<00:03:33.230> out<00:03:33.470> and<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:33.709> eventually<00:03:33.950> got<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.370> couple

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
it out and I eventually got a couple

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.580 
it out and I eventually got a couple
good<00:03:34.820> gameplay<00:03:35.420> is<00:03:35.480> on<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:35.810> two<00:03:36.020> but<00:03:36.320> I<00:03:36.350> mean<00:03:36.560> I

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
good gameplay is on the two but I mean I

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.500 
good gameplay is on the two but I mean I
wish<00:03:36.890> I<00:03:37.040> would<00:03:37.190> have<00:03:37.220> took<00:03:37.820> the<00:03:37.880> leap<00:03:38.150> of<00:03:38.270> faith

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
wish I would have took the leap of faith

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.600 
wish I would have took the leap of faith
and<00:03:38.810> you<00:03:39.320> know<00:03:39.440> moved<00:03:39.709> it<00:03:39.860> up<00:03:39.980> to<00:03:40.070> a<00:03:40.100> three<00:03:40.340> then

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
and you know moved it up to a three then

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.420 
and you know moved it up to a three then
because<00:03:41.620> it's<00:03:42.620> definitely<00:03:43.040> going<00:03:43.130> to<00:03:43.190> give<00:03:43.340> me

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
because it's definitely going to give me

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.009 
because it's definitely going to give me
the<00:03:43.550> ability<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:44.000> play<00:03:44.180> I<00:03:44.209> think<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.600> lot<00:03:44.630> better

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
the ability to play I think a lot better

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.710 
the ability to play I think a lot better
I<00:03:45.320> got<00:03:45.709> a<00:03:45.739> lot<00:03:46.070> of<00:03:46.100> good<00:03:46.580> feedback<00:03:47.000> from<00:03:47.540> the
