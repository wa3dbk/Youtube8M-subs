00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
you guys to reverse Albright knot now

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.950 
you guys to reverse Albright knot now
this<00:00:21.070> particular<00:00:21.220> knot<00:00:21.730> is<00:00:21.880> a<00:00:21.970> great<00:00:22.330> knot<00:00:22.630> for

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
this particular knot is a great knot for

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.839 
this particular knot is a great knot for
connecting<00:00:23.350> brain<00:00:23.740> and<00:00:24.340> monofilament

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:24.849 
connecting brain and monofilament

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.779 
connecting brain and monofilament
leaders<00:00:25.359> they<00:00:26.199> usually<00:00:26.439> retain<00:00:26.949> a<00:00:27.250> hundred

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
leaders they usually retain a hundred

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.439 
leaders they usually retain a hundred
percent<00:00:27.880> of<00:00:28.269> the<00:00:28.839> lines<00:00:29.109> breaking<00:00:29.439> strength

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
percent of the lines breaking strength

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.060 
percent of the lines breaking strength
today<00:00:31.449> we're<00:00:31.929> going<00:00:32.020> to<00:00:32.110> be<00:00:32.230> connecting<00:00:32.680> this

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
today we're going to be connecting this

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.270 
today we're going to be connecting this

leader

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
leader

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.180 
leader
we<00:00:37.690> prepared<00:00:38.079> a<00:00:38.170> Bimini<00:00:38.500> twist<00:00:38.740> a<00:00:38.829> little<00:00:38.860> bit

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
we prepared a Bimini twist a little bit

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.670 
we prepared a Bimini twist a little bit
earlier<00:00:39.640> which<00:00:40.180> created<00:00:40.750> this<00:00:40.870> loop<00:00:41.230> in<00:00:41.470> the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
earlier which created this loop in the

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.270 
earlier which created this loop in the
brave<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:43.000> basically<00:00:43.420> all<00:00:43.540> we<00:00:43.660> do<00:00:43.900> we<00:00:44.140> grab<00:00:45.130> the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
brave so basically all we do we grab the

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.150 
brave so basically all we do we grab the
braid<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:46.510> so<00:00:46.750> pull<00:00:47.020> it<00:00:47.110> nice<00:00:47.230> and<00:00:47.260> tight<00:00:47.470> and

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
braid like so pull it nice and tight and

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.550 
braid like so pull it nice and tight and
we<00:00:48.250> want<00:00:48.490> a<00:00:48.520> wine<00:00:48.760> our<00:00:49.120> leader<00:00:49.450> around<00:00:50.410> the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 
we want a wine our leader around the

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:57.290 
we want a wine our leader around the
braid<00:00:50.850> ten<00:00:51.850> times<00:00:52.890> then<00:00:53.890> one<00:00:54.130> two<00:00:54.940> three<00:00:56.220> four

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
braid ten times then one two three four

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.200 
braid ten times then one two three four
five<00:00:58.300> six

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:13.560 

seven<00:01:05.520> eight<00:01:06.840> nine<00:01:08.400> ten<00:01:09.400> then<00:01:11.670> we<00:01:12.670> grab<00:01:12.970> the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
seven eight nine ten then we grab the

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.930 
seven eight nine ten then we grab the
end<00:01:13.810> of<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.110> leader<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:18.250> we<00:01:18.520> put<00:01:18.820> it<00:01:18.910> through

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
end of the leader and we put it through

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.990 
end of the leader and we put it through
the<00:01:19.900> braid<00:01:20.200> loop<00:01:20.500> to<00:01:20.800> slip<00:01:21.070> at<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.400> end<00:01:21.550> like

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
the braid loop to slip at the end like

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.690 
the braid loop to slip at the end like
so<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:26.020> we<00:01:26.320> pull<00:01:26.590> them<00:01:26.740> both<00:01:26.920> down<00:01:27.250> tight

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
so and we pull them both down tight

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.950 
so and we pull them both down tight
together<00:01:28.210> those<00:01:29.080> strands<00:01:29.500> of<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.710> mono<00:01:30.040> and

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
together those strands of the mono and

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.080 
together those strands of the mono and
we<00:01:31.960> let<00:01:32.140> go<00:01:32.350> and<00:01:32.770> just<00:01:33.280> pull<00:01:33.550> the<00:01:33.700> mainline

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
we let go and just pull the mainline

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.950 
we let go and just pull the mainline
leave<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:34.450> tag<00:01:34.690> over<00:01:34.900> there<00:01:35.369> as<00:01:36.369> you<00:01:36.580> can<00:01:36.610> see

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
leave the tag over there as you can see

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.260 
leave the tag over there as you can see
the<00:01:37.960> mono<00:01:38.229> will<00:01:38.619> start<00:01:38.890> to<00:01:39.100> wind<00:01:39.369> around<00:01:39.880> the

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
the mono will start to wind around the

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.109 
the mono will start to wind around the
braid<00:01:43.890> now<00:01:44.890> you<00:01:44.950> have<00:01:45.430> to<00:01:45.550> pull<00:01:45.729> this<00:01:45.820> quite

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
braid now you have to pull this quite

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.359 
braid now you have to pull this quite
tight<00:01:46.420> very<00:01:47.229> important<00:01:47.680> that<00:01:47.770> at<00:01:47.890> all<00:01:48.009> bunches

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
tight very important that at all bunches

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:57.120 
tight very important that at all bunches
up<00:01:48.490> together<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.990> there<00:01:53.680> we<00:01:53.830> have<00:01:54.009> it

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.310 

that<00:01:57.850> night<00:01:58.060> is<00:01:58.299> nice<00:01:58.509> and<00:01:58.750> tight<00:01:58.899> done

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
that night is nice and tight done

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.620 
that night is nice and tight done
perfectly<00:01:59.829> and<00:02:00.100> it<00:02:00.670> will<00:02:00.789> not<00:02:00.939> break<00:02:01.210> under

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
perfectly and it will not break under

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.270 
perfectly and it will not break under
extreme<00:02:02.110> pressure<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.759> you<00:02:03.939> do<00:02:05.189> trim<00:02:06.189> you

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
extreme pressure so you do trim you

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.919 
extreme pressure so you do trim you
tagged<00:02:06.990> leave<00:02:07.990> a<00:02:08.019> few<00:02:08.289> mil<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:10.360> goes<00:02:10.599> for<00:02:10.810> you
