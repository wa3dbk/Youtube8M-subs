00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
little packet disk animals um starting

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.940 
little packet disk animals um starting
to<00:02:51.360> tell<00:02:51.540> which<00:02:51.720> ones<00:02:51.930> on<00:02:52.079> the<00:02:52.200> back<00:02:52.560> here<00:02:52.920> I

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
to tell which ones on the back here I

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.220 
to tell which ones on the back here I
think<00:02:53.190> it's<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.430> crab<00:02:53.849> on<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.180> back<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.900> yeah

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
think it's the crab on the back and yeah

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.789 
think it's the crab on the back and yeah
mater<00:02:56.040> Hawk<00:02:56.310> on<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.610> front<00:02:57.019> so<00:02:58.019> um<00:02:58.290> I'm<00:02:58.530> pretty

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
mater Hawk on the front so um I'm pretty

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.979 
mater Hawk on the front so um I'm pretty
sure<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.280> wolf<00:02:59.819> was<00:03:00.060> probably<00:03:00.480> in<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.720> middle

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
sure the wolf was probably in the middle

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.850 
sure the wolf was probably in the middle
here<00:03:01.319> or<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.040> ape<00:03:02.269> he<00:03:03.269> usually<00:03:03.360> ate<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:03.750> lot<00:03:03.989> so

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
here or the ape he usually ate a lot so

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.520 
here or the ape he usually ate a lot so

that plugs in right here and then his

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.339 
that plugs in right here and then his
tuning<00:03:08.250> fork<00:03:08.519> right<00:03:09.269> here<00:03:09.569> plugs<00:03:09.930> into<00:03:10.140> the

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
tuning fork right here plugs into the

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
full-sized version of the full folk the

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.250 
full-sized version of the full folk the
fork<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.150> he<00:03:21.269> can't<00:03:21.480> hold<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:21.840> or<00:03:21.930> anything<00:03:22.079> but

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
fork so he can't hold it or anything but

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.319 
fork so he can't hold it or anything but
at<00:03:22.620> least<00:03:22.769> his<00:03:23.010> represent<00:03:23.489> on<00:03:23.579> his<00:03:23.760> belt<00:03:24.000> and

at least his represent on his belt and
then<00:03:25.019> you<00:03:25.230> have<00:03:26.510> this<00:03:27.510> piece<00:03:27.780> right<00:03:28.049> here<00:03:28.109> that

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
then you have this piece right here that

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.550 
then you have this piece right here that
you<00:03:28.650> can<00:03:28.769> barely<00:03:28.950> see<00:03:29.660> for<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.780> back<00:03:31.109> when<00:03:31.470> he

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
is holding the young gavel reka just

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.319 
is holding the young gavel reka just
like<00:03:35.359> this<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:37.500> let's<00:03:38.459> plug<00:03:38.730> that<00:03:38.790> in<00:03:39.120> back

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
like this so let's plug that in back

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:43.699 
like this so let's plug that in back
here<00:03:40.639> just<00:03:41.639> like<00:03:41.790> so<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.389> show<00:03:43.260> off<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.470> hand

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:15.220 
makes it so where you can't really lose
them

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230
