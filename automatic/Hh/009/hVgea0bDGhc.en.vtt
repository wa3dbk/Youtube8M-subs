it's<00:02:53.450> near<00:02:54.080> I<00:02:54.350> think<00:02:55.220> we'll<00:02:55.370> like<00:02:56.000> as<00:02:56.450> usual

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
it's near I think we'll like as usual

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.730 
it's near I think we'll like as usual
minecraft<00:02:57.380> when<00:02:58.280> it<00:02:58.430> says<00:02:58.610> building<00:02:59.000> terrain

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
say simulating world for a bit or think

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.500 
say simulating world for a bit or think
that's<00:03:05.390> at<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.540> end<00:03:05.780> of<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.110> looking<00:03:06.650> world

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
that's at the end of the looking world

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.580 
that's at the end of the looking world
but<00:03:08.510> eat<00:03:08.690> it<00:03:08.720> which<00:03:08.930> way<00:03:10.870> it's<00:03:11.870> loading<00:03:12.440> right

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
but eat it which way it's loading right

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:21.550 
but eat it which way it's loading right
there<00:03:12.830> and<00:03:13.130> I<00:03:14.830> guess<00:03:15.830> I<00:03:15.860> can<00:03:16.010> exit<00:03:16.340> out<00:03:20.560> see

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
there and I guess I can exit out see

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.759 
there and I guess I can exit out see
saving<00:03:21.950> chunks<00:03:22.489> and<00:03:22.940> I<00:03:23.330> think<00:03:23.630> later<00:03:23.930> later<00:03:24.590> on

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
saving chunks and I think later later on

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.420 
saving chunks and I think later later on
we'll<00:03:24.950> sage<00:03:25.220> it<00:03:26.530> simulating<00:03:27.530> world<00:03:27.739> for<00:03:27.920> a<00:03:27.950> bit

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
we'll sage it simulating world for a bit
