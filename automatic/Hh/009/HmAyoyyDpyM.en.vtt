 masterpiece combat system is also very 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.450

 will be in the game process will be divided 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.400
 in two phases day and night you 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.489
 together with the team you run and collect 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.260
 garbage resources build from these resources 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.840
 ford and it will all look like a micro 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.480
 at night on your freshly built fort 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.849
 hordes of monsters and demons are attacking 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.830
 you will mercilessly shred for some reason 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.640
 developers compare the night phase with 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.000
 gears of war 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.190
 in the game will be company company plot i 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.940
 I think minutes a shovel and a chair and 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:26.030
 and everything is crazy and ruby ​​plot yes ok 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.130
 let there be a company and not even one 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.160
 several so far only 3 are ready 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.690
 the passage of each company will take from 10 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.330
 up to 50 hours 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.760
 maps and level generated 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.830
 quite by chance therefore double on 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.600
 one card you are hardly going to be apart from 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.700
 obstacles you can build different 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.070
 traps that can not only 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.789
 restrain enemies but destroy them 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:53.330
 Versa in solo difference minkravt but you 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:55.490
 understood in the game form will be 4 class 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.710
 each of which has different 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.169
 abilities and bonus so for example 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.300
 the constructor builds much faster 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.849
 construction than others and spending 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.889
 fewer scavenger resources 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:09.289
 focus on mining material well 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.060
 the team is good at distance fighting 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.430
 prefers melee as well 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.240
 has a double jump overall cool 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.830
 cool 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.830
 cool waiting again 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.170
 Company blizzard again stirred them 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:28.020
 working on a new game attention nifiga 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:30.180
 this is not warcraft and starcraft and diablo 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.940
 it will be a brand new product on 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.920
 the day the blizzard company registered 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.590
 new brand for your next 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:40.440

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.920
 unknown except overwatch name 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.690
 no clues connecting the game with 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.810
 previous universe blizzard 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:54.060
 it is very intriguing rumors and references 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.920
 The new project has been here for a long time though 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.290
 the fact that blizzard is active 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.390
 gaining new employees in general like 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.810

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:06.000
 this is not a new game from the studio blizzard 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.620
 which will not depend on three 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.080
 previous blizzard universes 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.080
