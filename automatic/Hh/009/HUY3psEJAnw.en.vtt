00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
recovering from that all right so you

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.420 
recovering from that all right so you
see<00:02:22.600> if<00:02:22.690> you<00:02:22.810> stay<00:02:22.990> under<00:02:23.260> him<00:02:23.440> he's<00:02:24.280> just

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
see if you stay under him he's just

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.880 
see if you stay under him he's just
going<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:24.700> keep<00:02:24.790> doing<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.740> you<00:02:26.740> can

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
going to keep doing that and you can

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.220 
going to keep doing that and you can
just<00:02:27.040> keep<00:02:27.270> wailing<00:02:28.270> on<00:02:28.390> him<00:02:28.420> Oh

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.220 

all<00:02:31.769> right<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.159> one's<00:02:32.190> tougher<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.760> dodge

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
all right so that one's tougher to dodge

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.149 
all right so that one's tougher to dodge
but<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.290> believe<00:02:34.319> it<00:02:34.709> is<00:02:34.800> possible<00:02:36.769> so<00:02:37.769> you<00:02:37.860> want

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
but I believe it is possible so you want

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.619 
but I believe it is possible so you want
