00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.220
 Miguel Veloso 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.829
 It's complicated everything that's perfect. 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.949
 many people try to be smarter and telecom the coach 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.400
 no need to pick the first one 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.740
 if you bet on the first step 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.950
 the company also the active twitter in action has a plan b 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.680
 each person has to create 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.680
 who are behind can not impose rights 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.500
 with jury kick 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.600
 passed the hour ask me similar in the table look tight system already the 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.970
 front seat weight 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.370
 now the process 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.500
 it was much fuller 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.080
 this time he got arrested the vice-president petrÃ³polis and in the 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.890
 electronics 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.219
 We had a very important political council meeting. 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.260
 in history a boy as he realized that the market could pass 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.950
 everybody wanting to pass at the same time 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.800
 poor of who left behind 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.140
 exaggerations apart from some of us flying today three days after 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.460
 be pressed more and more common just to have an idea 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.680
 from January to May this year the number of passengers grew 30% on flights 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.910
 increased by 12 1% on international flights in relation to the same 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.260
 last year are people who do not know each other 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.189
 parents who have to live through some process there were many hours 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:22.009
 when forgetting that the region is a collective space 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.009
 leaving aside certain basic rules 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.239
 it's time to talk about 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.770
 who is going to help us is a writer of texture and buildings of a school of 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.899
 police training the first situation the hand luggage 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:46.129
 do you remember the zone that I thought the focus should be on the school of government to 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:47.049
 rule 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.049
 one per person 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:51.859
 this advice 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.809
 then without ever finding a fair 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:59.249
 You're not taking this hill with your father hired Mark V of the art. 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:06.079
 then for a collective environment it is once of a public transport 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.109
 are developing because the side passenger is also going to take 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.629
 Baggage 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.639
 tite 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.129
 had a girl who appears on a phonograph 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.819
 He talked all the time telling his personal life about the life of others. 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.819
 I speak to others too. 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:33.019
 another delicate situation the cities that do not stop talking or whole and tall 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:33.659
 level 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.379
 Do you want to rest and can not 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:37.949
 do what 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:41.030
 It will be for breathing, sir. 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.750
 It's all people people could talk loud or low because I'm not 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.510
 getting two socks that I can rest and can not read 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.020
 just addressed the person and asked that it actually decrease the author of votes 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.120
 It's not bad, it's not bad. 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.129
 inside you that is consuming 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.910
 and you end up having a situation 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.910
 is stressful of the goal and ends up generating confusion 

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:12.259
 after trying too much the same thing 

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:15.299
 for being a doctor or in particular 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.249
 I almost always knew 

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:21.649
 It's going to be a tough game and you want to get up and go to the bathroom. 

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:22.240
 past 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.560
 for its part of the larger sum exceeds several more attempts to cut it 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.810
 but it's no use for a pickaxe to wait for him to wake up 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:33.870
 He did not wake up. 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.199
 It's obvious you 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:40.889
 then with final weighed the subpoena street you touch he had operated the shoulder the 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.499
 two tennis players 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:45.499
 They already played him so he can wake up. 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.900
 it was horrible person drinks beer from most bad thing 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.590
 the smell of beer having still been the captain of that very heavy thing me 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:01.650
 said he wants 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:02.770
 this award 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.169
 age of yours pass by car and source well 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:11.580
 not 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.490
 thanks to the network of sewers of the dance and my favorite evil lost more of the 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.490
 that the trade volume of the database 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.409
 in these unresolved cases of the drug 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:25.509
 let's agree that babies could not have avoided this year 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.659
 they left the specialized people is the case of the airplane you are not lombard 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:34.210
 presented on the stage of their team 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.460
 so then 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.919
 I do not know if that time is beer in the cortex and it was 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.610
 It's for you to take a break, it's not for you to get drunk. 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:44.620
 it's not good 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.650
 This is the difference. 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.550
 will be some alternative for those who work in the river the titles follow and 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.669
 unacceptable 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:54.789
 they are our 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:56.639
 I won, sit, sit, USA. 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.430
 this march was a bad person 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.409
 Teresa sells the procedure 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:04.830
 she will avoid failure and tendentiously calm 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.379
 patience 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:08.800
 is passing the commissioner 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.629

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:14.960
 thank you 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.339
 it's that way 

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:19.339
 treat them like we like to be treated 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:19.899
