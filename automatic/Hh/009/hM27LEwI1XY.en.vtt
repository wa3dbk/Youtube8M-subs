00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.600
 good morning to all guys then this is not a video guide is not a 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.600
 video tutorial but simply a prudent one on mine quite 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:12.949
 on dragogalax9993 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:16.829
 then right now I'm loading platinum part 36 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.829
 see that my mind will be published after brands 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.570
 today I want to talk to you about my guides and who they are in the future 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.059
 I quite compare platinum lepers up to 1 46 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.870
 torino obviously not a film, of course I will make others 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.850
 lol why is it 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.810
 now sail 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.930
 once I have beaten the league to the league the line in section 42 seems to me 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:48.590
 no 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.070
 51 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.650
 like these parts here 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.650
 this first part and finish it the final part 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.110
 first and foremost they continue platinum and I'll finish it all 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.939
 sorry for my photo sunset certainly not good 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.760
 % 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.110
 not broke I will end up all platinum 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.920
 including the capture of the genitals all the several extra parts 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.850
 hello 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.310
 where i went 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.460
 yes of course the dance is the end of the platinum guide entrusted with view 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.360
 also on home page in mid-February 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.900
 in the then 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.900
 I have a nice idea 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.860
 I would like first 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.820
 a guide is not made 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.600
 burton does as you want 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.600
 to emerald pokemon 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.100
 a pokemon emerald tie this complete 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.530
 Latin pop like all the extra parts 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.530
 msc will succeed because 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.240
 I saw them from above in particular 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.180
 attic re rescue problem that you enter in the rescue should 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.289
 cancel once the league is beaten 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.189
 it is for this yahoo movie i would have a kind of a request sex roby 27 95 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.649
 medium to ask me if still to his pokemon emerald rom 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.209
 because it doesn't have that rescue problem otherwise 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:25.969
 they see it as solving also because 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:29.719
 I know how to solve boh that is why 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:34.689
 masterwood teknomat a2 made weather forecasts when explaining 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:35.839
 how to solve 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:38.169
 eventually I will use that method 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:42.090
 the report in mind to let me stay at the head of pokemon smeraldo takeda 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:44.179
 ten the one I want to do 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:45.619
 long ago I did 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:48.799
 but it goes a long time ago like this summer 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.799
 only that of 

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:55.809
 republic to publish the parts so many times that 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:59.899
 that I just want to see them 

00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:01.289
 long-distance outlet 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:04.469
 then emurayden start again 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:08.019
 go to parties I still have it but I think she starts it again because 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:11.909
 just 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.459
 I published the old parties a little too many times and I will have published four times 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.459
 about 3 I don't remember well 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:21.979
 that's it. I'll finish platinum 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:23.090
 all complete 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.689
 the end scheduled for mid-February 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:28.699
 and then begins an emerald pokemon guide 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:32.989
 ergo hey as an alternative emerald vorrai pokemon green leaf red fire 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.259
 or not only known yellow pokemon are still 

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:38.849
 undecided 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.039
 ah so I will let you know this romantic rock here I'll let you know 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:44.799
 of my final decision 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.959
 and fundamentum next video
