alright<00:00:01.290> I'm<00:00:01.650> a<00:00:01.680> little<00:00:01.920> further<00:00:02.159> along<00:00:02.370> our

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
alright I'm a little further along our

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.740 
alright I'm a little further along our
trail<00:00:03.030> now<00:00:03.300> and<00:00:04.080> I'm<00:00:04.380> coming<00:00:04.620> up<00:00:04.830> onto<00:00:05.629> one<00:00:06.629> of

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
trail now and I'm coming up onto one of

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.360 
trail now and I'm coming up onto one of
the<00:00:06.810> many<00:00:06.990> sinkholes<00:00:07.560> you'll<00:00:07.799> find<00:00:08.040> here<00:00:08.280> on

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
the many sinkholes you'll find here on

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.169 
the many sinkholes you'll find here on
what<00:00:08.519> Kyllo<00:00:08.970> Springs<00:00:09.360> State<00:00:09.809> Park<00:00:10.820> and<00:00:11.820> as<00:00:12.030> you

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
what Kyllo Springs State Park and as you

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.520 
what Kyllo Springs State Park and as you
can<00:00:12.330> see<00:00:12.480> off<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.990> right<00:00:13.170> there's<00:00:13.440> a

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
can see off to the right there's a

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.400 
can see off to the right there's a
little<00:00:13.650> drop-off<00:00:14.190> here<00:00:14.630> and<00:00:15.630> actually<00:00:16.049> we're

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
little drop-off here and actually we're

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.890 
little drop-off here and actually we're
still<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.949> that<00:00:17.130> area<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:18.210> had<00:00:18.750> the

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
still in that area that had the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.679 
still in that area that had the
controlled<00:00:19.289> burn<00:00:19.789> so<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> lot<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.300> ground

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
controlled burn so a lot of the ground

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.269 
controlled burn so a lot of the ground
vegetation<00:00:22.289> has<00:00:22.410> been<00:00:22.590> burned<00:00:22.800> away<00:00:22.949> but

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
vegetation has been burned away but

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.000 
vegetation has been burned away but
that's<00:00:23.430> actually<00:00:23.810> good<00:00:24.810> for<00:00:25.109> visibility<00:00:25.830> we

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
that's actually good for visibility we

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.150 
that's actually good for visibility we
can<00:00:26.160> see<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> lot<00:00:26.580> better<00:00:27.199> what<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.439> sinkhole

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
can see a lot better what this sinkhole

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.139 
can see a lot better what this sinkhole
looks<00:00:29.550> like<00:00:30.380> normally<00:00:31.610> when<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.730> walk<00:00:32.910> by

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
looks like normally when you walk by

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.639 
looks like normally when you walk by
here<00:00:34.010> there<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.730> area<00:00:36.090> down<00:00:36.329> there<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.780> huge

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
here there that area down there is huge

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.869 
here there that area down there is huge
palmetto<00:00:38.899> plants<00:00:39.899> with<00:00:40.829> palmetto<00:00:41.250> tree<00:00:41.340> just

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
palmetto plants with palmetto tree just

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.340 
palmetto plants with palmetto tree just
filling<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.329> up<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.629> unfortunately<00:00:43.140> people

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
filling it up and unfortunately people

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.290 
filling it up and unfortunately people
are<00:00:43.530> sticking<00:00:44.040> their<00:00:44.190> styrofoam<00:00:44.730> cups<00:00:45.059> down

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
are sticking their styrofoam cups down

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.540 
are sticking their styrofoam cups down
there<00:00:45.600> but<00:00:46.700> anyways<00:00:48.440> this<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.680> just<00:00:50.340> one<00:00:50.520> of

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
there but anyways this is just one of

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.639 
there but anyways this is just one of
the<00:00:50.700> many<00:00:50.879> sinkholes<00:00:51.390> you'll<00:00:51.600> find<00:00:51.870> here<00:00:52.170> this

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
the many sinkholes you'll find here this

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.950 
the many sinkholes you'll find here this
one<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.239> imagine<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:55.340> you<00:00:56.340> know<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.270> area<00:00:57.750> of

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
one I imagine is you know on the area of

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.080 
one I imagine is you know on the area of
judging<00:00:58.379> by<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.559> trees<00:00:58.949> maybe<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.850> hundred

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
judging by the trees maybe a hundred

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.500 
judging by the trees maybe a hundred
years<00:01:00.270> old<00:01:00.920> it's<00:01:01.920> filled<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.910> plants<00:01:03.480> have

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
years old it's filled in and plants have

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.649 
years old it's filled in and plants have
filled<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.379> trees<00:01:04.650> are<00:01:04.860> growing<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.309> it

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
filled in on it trees are growing in it

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.830 
filled in on it trees are growing in it
so<00:01:07.010> yeah<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.130> not<00:01:08.250> an<00:01:08.430> ancient<00:01:08.820> sinkhole<00:01:09.630> by

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
so yeah it's not an ancient sinkhole by

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.620 
so yeah it's not an ancient sinkhole by
any<00:01:09.960> means<00:01:10.229> but<00:01:10.700> it's<00:01:11.700> been<00:01:11.909> here<00:01:12.119> for<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.420> while

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
any means but it's been here for a while

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.649 
any means but it's been here for a while
and<00:01:13.640> there's<00:01:14.640> another<00:01:14.880> thing<00:01:15.119> called<00:01:15.180> further

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
and there's another thing called further

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.929 
and there's another thing called further
down<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.080> trail<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:17.100> we're<00:01:17.310> gonna<00:01:17.430> get<00:01:17.670> to

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
down this trail that we're gonna get to

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.740 
down this trail that we're gonna get to
that's<00:01:18.150> actually<00:01:18.390> an<00:01:18.689> active<00:01:19.140> sinkhole<00:01:19.619> and

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
that's actually an active sinkhole and

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.090 
that's actually an active sinkhole and
that'll<00:01:21.750> be<00:01:21.840> an<00:01:21.960> interesting<00:01:22.049> one<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.770> see<00:01:22.950> as

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
that'll be an interesting one to see as

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.050 
that'll be an interesting one to see as
well<00:01:23.930> but<00:01:25.130> right<00:01:26.130> now<00:01:28.070> just<00:01:29.070> about<00:01:29.369> every<00:01:29.820> Lake

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
well but right now just about every Lake

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.890 
well but right now just about every Lake
in<00:01:30.530> Florida<00:01:31.530> Central<00:01:31.950> Florida<00:01:32.390> formed<00:01:33.390> from<00:01:33.780> a

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
in Florida Central Florida formed from a

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.510 
in Florida Central Florida formed from a
sinkhole<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:35.150> when<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> sinkhole<00:01:37.130> was<00:01:38.130> deep

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
sinkhole and when the sinkhole was deep

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.580 
sinkhole and when the sinkhole was deep
enough<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:39.270> would<00:01:39.450> reach<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.900> aquifer<00:01:40.439> and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
enough it would reach the aquifer and

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.969 
enough it would reach the aquifer and
then<00:01:40.890> fill<00:01:41.130> up<00:01:41.159> with<00:01:41.430> water<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:42.829> that's<00:01:43.829> all

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
then fill up with water and that's all

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.620 
then fill up with water and that's all
most<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.310> our<00:01:44.460> lakes<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.820> Florida<00:01:45.180> are<00:01:45.299> formed

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
most of our lakes in Florida are formed

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.219 
most of our lakes in Florida are formed
from<00:01:46.049> sinkholes<00:01:46.700> okay<00:01:47.700> right<00:01:48.360> now<00:01:48.689> we're

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
from sinkholes okay right now we're

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.920 
from sinkholes okay right now we're
coming<00:01:49.530> up<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:49.770> one<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:49.979> my<00:01:50.130> favorite<00:01:50.340> places

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
coming up on one of my favorite places

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.300 
coming up on one of my favorite places
it's<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:52.290> an<00:01:52.829> active<00:01:53.670> sinkhole<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:55.310> sinkhole

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
it's a an active sinkhole this sinkhole

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.569 
it's a an active sinkhole this sinkhole
formed<00:01:56.820> in<00:01:57.439> spring<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.909> 2000<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:00.960> by<00:02:01.770> active<00:02:02.280> I

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
formed in spring of 2000 and by active I

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.139 
formed in spring of 2000 and by active I
mean<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.469> it<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:04.649> still<00:02:04.890> growing<00:02:05.149> it's

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
mean that it is still growing it's

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.380 
mean that it is still growing it's
continued<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.020> grow<00:02:07.170> since<00:02:07.530> then

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
continued to grow since then

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.670 
continued to grow since then
periodically<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.810> sides<00:02:10.080> will<00:02:10.319> cave<00:02:10.560> in

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
periodically the sides will cave in

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.280 
periodically the sides will cave in
sometimes<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.610> bottom<00:02:13.939> still<00:02:14.450> falls<00:02:14.989> out<00:02:15.260> a

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
sometimes the bottom still falls out a

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.220 
sometimes the bottom still falls out a
little<00:02:15.560> bit<00:02:16.269> just<00:02:17.269> depends<00:02:17.629> usually<00:02:18.109> in<00:02:18.170> the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
little bit just depends usually in the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.110 
little bit just depends usually in the
spring<00:02:18.349> times<00:02:18.829> when<00:02:19.129> that<00:02:19.280> happens<00:02:19.730> actually

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
spring times when that happens actually

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.199 
spring times when that happens actually
we've<00:02:20.209> had<00:02:20.359> some<00:02:20.599> rains<00:02:21.280> but<00:02:22.280> here<00:02:23.060> we're

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
we've had some rains but here we're

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.149 
we've had some rains but here we're
coming<00:02:23.540> up<00:02:23.659> on<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:23.930> here<00:02:24.519> and<00:02:26.859> we<00:02:27.859> can<00:02:28.040> look

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
coming up on it here and we can look

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:34.720 
coming up on it here and we can look
down<00:02:28.370> into<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:29.980> from<00:02:32.470> it<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.769> would<00:02:34.129> guesstimate

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
down into it from it I would guesstimate

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.789 
down into it from it I would guesstimate
that<00:02:34.790> this<00:02:35.359> is<00:02:35.750> about<00:02:36.609> 200<00:02:38.260> 120<00:02:39.260> feet<00:02:39.439> across

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
that this is about 200 120 feet across

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:45.970 
that this is about 200 120 feet across
and<00:02:42.670> about<00:02:43.670> 30<00:02:44.269> feet<00:02:44.599> deep<00:02:44.959> maybe<00:02:45.739> a<00:02:45.829> little

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
and about 30 feet deep maybe a little

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.960 
and about 30 feet deep maybe a little
more<00:02:46.329> you<00:02:47.329> can<00:02:47.450> see<00:02:47.659> where<00:02:48.310> there's<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.489> tree

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
more you can see where there's a tree

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.089 
more you can see where there's a tree
here<00:02:51.280> that's<00:02:52.840> this<00:02:53.840> tree<00:02:54.230> here<00:02:54.560> it's<00:02:54.769> since

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
here that's this tree here it's since

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.629 
here that's this tree here it's since
been<00:02:55.189> caught<00:02:55.639> in<00:02:55.790> a<00:02:55.879> fire<00:02:56.530> but<00:02:57.530> it<00:02:58.159> has<00:02:58.430> not

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
been caught in a fire but it has not

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.960 
been caught in a fire but it has not
been<00:02:58.879> swallowed<00:02:59.419> up<00:02:59.510> completely<00:03:00.019> by<00:03:00.409> the<00:03:00.970> by

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
been swallowed up completely by the by

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.050 
been swallowed up completely by the by
the<00:03:02.030> sinkhole<00:03:03.459> actually<00:03:04.459> these<00:03:04.639> other<00:03:04.819> trees

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
the sinkhole actually these other trees

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.270 
the sinkhole actually these other trees
that<00:03:05.269> you<00:03:05.419> see<00:03:05.450> here<00:03:06.019> have<00:03:06.439> grown<00:03:06.799> in<00:03:07.069> here

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
that you see here have grown in here

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.770 
that you see here have grown in here
since<00:03:07.609> then<00:03:08.169> these<00:03:09.169> two<00:03:09.769> I<00:03:10.069> guess<00:03:10.340> they're

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
since then these two I guess they're

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.319 
since then these two I guess they're
theirs<00:03:12.040> they're<00:03:13.040> probably<00:03:13.370> a<00:03:13.519> maple<00:03:13.970> of<00:03:14.090> some

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
theirs they're probably a maple of some

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.300 
theirs they're probably a maple of some
sort<00:03:14.599> and<00:03:14.810> there's<00:03:14.989> a<00:03:15.079> couple<00:03:15.470> of<00:03:15.680> Pines<00:03:15.949> over

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
sort and there's a couple of Pines over

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.430 
sort and there's a couple of Pines over
there<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.669> some<00:03:16.819> scrub<00:03:17.180> over<00:03:17.389> there<00:03:17.629> but

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
there and some scrub over there but

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.250 
there and some scrub over there but
there<00:03:18.739> were<00:03:18.889> some<00:03:19.159> huge<00:03:19.609> and<00:03:20.030> I<00:03:20.120> mean<00:03:20.329> huge<00:03:20.690> big

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
there were some huge and I mean huge big

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.069 
there were some huge and I mean huge big
pine<00:03:21.560> trees<00:03:22.510> bigger<00:03:23.510> than<00:03:23.720> this<00:03:23.840> one<00:03:24.019> here

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
pine trees bigger than this one here

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.289 
pine trees bigger than this one here
that<00:03:24.680> were<00:03:24.889> completely<00:03:25.400> swallowed<00:03:25.940> up<00:03:26.090> when<00:03:26.269> I

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
that were completely swallowed up when I

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.259 
that were completely swallowed up when I
first<00:03:26.900> saw<00:03:27.139> this<00:03:27.379> thing<00:03:27.709> you<00:03:28.639> could<00:03:28.940> see<00:03:29.120> the

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
first saw this thing you could see the

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.930 
first saw this thing you could see the
tops<00:03:29.540> of<00:03:29.810> them<00:03:30.019> and<00:03:30.409> there<00:03:31.040> wasn't<00:03:31.250> then<00:03:31.760> they

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
tops of them and there wasn't then they

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.289 
tops of them and there wasn't then they
disappeared<00:03:32.690> after<00:03:33.049> a<00:03:33.790> period<00:03:34.790> of<00:03:34.819> time<00:03:35.030> this

look around the edge of this thing

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.320 
look around the edge of this thing
partway<00:05:01.080> down<00:05:01.230> you<00:05:02.160> get<00:05:02.400> to<00:05:02.520> see<00:05:02.700> a<00:05:02.730> kind<00:05:03.150> of<00:05:03.180> a

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
partway down you get to see a kind of a

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.290 
partway down you get to see a kind of a
a<00:05:03.660> limestone<00:05:04.140> layer<00:05:04.800> or<00:05:05.100> a<00:05:05.160> real<00:05:05.610> thick<00:05:05.970> clay

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
a limestone layer or a real thick clay

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.540 
a limestone layer or a real thick clay
layer<00:05:07.460> now<00:05:08.460> over<00:05:09.210> here<00:05:10.220> you<00:05:11.220> even<00:05:11.370> get<00:05:11.520> a

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
layer now over here you even get a

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.370 
layer now over here you even get a
better<00:05:11.700> shot<00:05:12.030> of<00:05:12.060> this<00:05:12.360> pine<00:05:12.690> tree<00:05:12.720> here

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
better shot of this pine tree here

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.030 
better shot of this pine tree here
that's<00:05:13.920> right<00:05:14.190> on<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:14.490> edge<00:05:14.760> of<00:05:15.030> the<00:05:15.150> sinkhole

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
that's right on the edge of the sinkhole

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.790 
that's right on the edge of the sinkhole
this<00:05:17.040> guy<00:05:17.340> here<00:05:17.850> you<00:05:18.170> can<00:05:19.170> see<00:05:19.410> how<00:05:19.620> much<00:05:19.740> of

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
this guy here you can see how much of

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.550 
this guy here you can see how much of
its<00:05:20.070> root<00:05:20.250> system<00:05:20.870> is<00:05:21.870> actually<00:05:22.260> below<00:05:22.470> the

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
its root system is actually below the

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.750 
its root system is actually below the
edge<00:05:22.920> of<00:05:23.100> the<00:05:23.330> of<00:05:24.330> the<00:05:24.450> lip<00:05:24.630> of<00:05:24.750> the<00:05:24.840> sinkhole

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
edge of the of the lip of the sinkhole

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.920 
edge of the of the lip of the sinkhole
and<00:05:26.760> I<00:05:27.000> don't<00:05:27.060> know<00:05:27.240> how<00:05:27.390> much<00:05:27.510> longer<00:05:27.810> that

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
and I don't know how much longer that

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.070 
and I don't know how much longer that
trees<00:05:28.380> gonna<00:05:28.620> last<00:05:28.920> I<00:05:29.600> don't<00:05:30.600> think<00:05:30.930> it's

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
trees gonna last I don't think it's

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.790 
trees gonna last I don't think it's
gonna<00:05:31.230> be<00:05:32.030> much<00:05:33.030> more<00:05:33.060> than<00:05:33.360> a<00:05:33.800> good

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
gonna be much more than a good

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.570 
gonna be much more than a good
thunderstorm<00:05:35.040> or<00:05:36.200> tropical<00:05:37.200> storm<00:05:37.560> to<00:05:38.430> blow

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
thunderstorm or tropical storm to blow

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.420 
thunderstorm or tropical storm to blow
that<00:05:38.850> thing<00:05:38.910> over<00:05:39.450> into<00:05:39.720> this<00:05:40.310> into<00:05:41.310> the

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
that thing over into this into the

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.620 
that thing over into this into the
sinkhole<00:05:41.790> here<00:05:42.240> you<00:05:42.720> can<00:05:42.840> see<00:05:43.020> that<00:05:43.320> the<00:05:44.130> main

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
sinkhole here you can see that the main

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.810 
sinkhole here you can see that the main
part<00:05:45.630> of<00:05:45.750> the<00:05:45.840> tree<00:05:46.050> goes<00:05:46.290> down<00:05:46.560> quite<00:05:46.890> far<00:05:47.190> I'm

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
part of the tree goes down quite far I'm

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.280 
part of the tree goes down quite far I'm
surprised<00:05:48.270> at<00:05:48.450> that<00:05:48.980> so<00:05:49.980> I<00:05:50.810> guess<00:05:51.810> that's<00:05:51.990> it

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290 
surprised at that so I guess that's it

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.310 
surprised at that so I guess that's it
from<00:05:52.500> here

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
from here

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.490 
from here
let's<00:05:55.320> see<00:05:55.500> if<00:05:55.620> I<00:05:56.660> can<00:05:57.660> make<00:05:57.810> it<00:05:57.840> across<00:05:58.200> here

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
let's see if I can make it across here

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.040 
let's see if I can make it across here
without<00:05:58.650> breaking<00:05:59.160> my<00:05:59.190> neck<00:05:59.340> I<00:05:59.870> don't<00:06:00.870> know<00:06:00.960> if

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
without breaking my neck I don't know if

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.879 
without breaking my neck I don't know if
I<00:06:01.110> want<00:06:01.290> to<00:06:01.350> do<00:06:01.470> this<00:06:01.620> or<00:06:01.800> not
