00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:08.300 
this was a really fun project to work on

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.160 
this was a really fun project to work on
the<00:00:09.300> beginning<00:00:09.660> all<00:00:09.780> started<00:00:10.110> with

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
the beginning all started with

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.780 
the beginning all started with
midfielders<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:10.769> we<00:00:11.010> looked<00:00:11.250> at<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.639> new

masters of the midfielder to really kind

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.740 
masters of the midfielder to really kind
of<00:00:14.040> dig<00:00:14.250> deep<00:00:14.429> into<00:00:14.610> into<00:00:15.059> what<00:00:15.299> they<00:00:15.480> needed

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
of dig deep into into what they needed

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.950 
of dig deep into into what they needed
for<00:00:16.080> their<00:00:16.800> product<00:00:17.330> we<00:00:18.330> kind<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.600> landed<00:00:18.840> on

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
for their product we kind of landed on

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.929 
for their product we kind of landed on
three<00:00:19.710> things<00:00:19.920> we<00:00:20.160> wanted<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.400> live<00:00:20.640> for<00:00:20.820> them

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
three things we wanted to live for them

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.109 
three things we wanted to live for them
this<00:00:21.570> concept<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.439> half<00:00:22.890> step<00:00:23.160> ahead<00:00:23.310> this

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
this concept of a half step ahead this

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.179 
this concept of a half step ahead this
concept<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.660> controlled<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.199> ball<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:26.039> then

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
concept of controlled the ball and then

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.710 
concept of controlled the ball and then
finally<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.699> concept<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.150> from<00:00:27.359> showing<00:00:27.539> the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
finally the concept of from showing the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.929 
finally the concept of from showing the
weather<00:00:28.099> so<00:00:29.099> we<00:00:29.130> talked<00:00:29.369> about<00:00:29.429> half<00:00:29.670> step

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
weather so we talked about half step

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.650 
weather so we talked about half step
ahead<00:00:30.289> we<00:00:31.289> start<00:00:31.529> with<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.650> outsole<00:00:32.040> so

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
ahead we start with the outsole so

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.330 
ahead we start with the outsole so
completely<00:00:33.660> different<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.469> redesigned

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
completely different in a redesigned

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.950 
completely different in a redesigned
outsole<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.329> what<00:00:36.510> we've<00:00:36.660> had<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.899> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
outsole and what we've had in the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.139 
outsole and what we've had in the
previous<00:00:37.079> maestri<00:00:37.829> we<00:00:38.399> wanted<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.850> bring<00:00:39.059> a

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
previous maestri we wanted to bring a

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.119 
previous maestri we wanted to bring a
new<00:00:39.329> stud<00:00:39.629> traction<00:00:40.050> pattern<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.800> was<00:00:40.950> going

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
new stud traction pattern that was going

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.709 
new stud traction pattern that was going
to<00:00:41.160> be<00:00:41.219> able<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.550> allow<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.790> player<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.450> get<00:00:42.570> in

to be able to allow the player to get in

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.180 
to be able to allow the player to get in
and<00:00:42.840> out<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> ground<00:00:43.230> but<00:00:43.559> also<00:00:43.590> help

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
and out of the ground but also help

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.670 
and out of the ground but also help
amplify<00:00:44.460> rotation<00:00:45.270> we<00:00:46.050> know<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.350> midfield

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
amplify rotation we know the midfield

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.470 
amplify rotation we know the midfield
player<00:00:46.920> does<00:00:47.219> more<00:00:47.640> rotations<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.360> more

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
player does more rotations and more

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
traction pattern that's going to do that

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.389 
traction pattern that's going to do that

texture to help with that control on the
lateral<00:01:30.390> outside<00:01:30.840> as<00:01:31.020> well<00:01:31.979> we<00:01:32.850> talked<00:01:33.060> about

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
lateral outside as well we talked about

lateral outside as well we talked about
the<00:01:33.840> receiving<00:01:34.290> control<00:01:34.619> pad<00:01:34.829> we've

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
the receiving control pad we've

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.520 
the receiving control pad we've
redesigned<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.390> as<00:01:36.570> well<00:01:36.750> when<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.259> look<00:01:37.409> at

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
redesigned this as well when you look at

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.929 
redesigned this as well when you look at
people's<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.130> players<00:01:38.340> different<00:01:38.759> foot

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
people's and players different foot

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.700 
people's and players different foot
shapes<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.450> their<00:01:39.869> arch<00:01:40.079> heights<00:01:40.380> they're

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
shapes and their arch heights they're

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.319 
shapes and their arch heights they're
all<00:01:40.829> very<00:01:41.040> different<00:01:41.280> what<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.060> actually

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
all very different what this actually

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.300 
all very different what this actually
does<00:01:42.720> now<00:01:42.960> when<00:01:43.290> it's<00:01:43.439> broken<00:01:43.680> up<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.130> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310

same way meaning is going to be great
fitting<00:01:49.740> as<00:01:49.979> well<00:01:50.759> we<00:01:50.970> wanted<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.240> ensure<00:01:51.479> that

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
fitting as well we wanted to ensure that

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.870 
fitting as well we wanted to ensure that
we<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:52.200> ball<00:01:52.619> contact<00:01:53.100> time<00:01:53.310> with<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
we have ball contact time with the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.179 
we have ball contact time with the
material<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.540> with<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.229> past<00:01:55.439> pad<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.009> we

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
material and with the past pad so we

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.830 
material and with the past pad so we
spaced<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.670> out<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:56.939> when<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.090> ball<00:01:57.360> comes<00:01:57.659> in

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
spaced it out so when the ball comes in

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.749 
spaced it out so when the ball comes in
contact<00:01:58.020> you're<00:01:58.799> getting<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.189> connection<00:01:59.490> of
