these and he said it doesn't matter

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.630 
these and he said it doesn't matter
because<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.530> could<00:02:35.040> have<00:02:35.160> happened<00:02:35.520> in<00:02:35.610> my

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
because it could have happened in my

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.020 
because it could have happened in my
sleep<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.630> I<00:02:37.380> my<00:02:37.560> husband<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:38.550> I've<00:02:38.670> been

thing<00:02:43.620> in<00:02:43.800> my<00:02:43.920> sleep<00:02:44.280> where<00:02:44.520> like<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:44.880> make<00:02:45.090> a

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
thing in my sleep where like I make a

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.530 
thing in my sleep where like I make a
clicking<00:02:45.510> sound<00:02:45.860> with<00:02:46.860> my<00:02:47.040> teeth<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:48.120> could

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
clicking sound with my teeth so I could

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.340 
clicking sound with my teeth so I could
be<00:02:49.010> clenching<00:02:50.010> down<00:02:50.280> in<00:02:50.489> my<00:02:50.670> sleep<00:02:51.120> um<00:02:51.420> which

be clenching down in my sleep um which
is<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.500> good<00:02:52.680> reason<00:02:53.100> to<00:02:53.220> get<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.400> night<00:02:53.700> guard<00:02:53.910> if

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
is a good reason to get a night guard if

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.240 
is a good reason to get a night guard if
you're<00:02:54.570> gonna<00:02:54.720> invest<00:02:55.170> money<00:02:55.620> in<00:02:55.860> something

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
you're gonna invest money in something

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.280 
you're gonna invest money in something
like<00:02:56.400> this<00:02:56.640> so<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.959> could<00:02:58.140> have<00:02:58.260> been

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
like this so it could have been

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.930 
like this so it could have been
something<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:58.830> did<00:02:58.980> in<00:02:59.010> my<00:02:59.190> sleep<00:02:59.489> but<00:02:59.790> it

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
something I did in my sleep but it

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.920 
something I did in my sleep but it
shouldn't<00:03:00.360> have<00:03:00.480> happened<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:01.380> so<00:03:01.680> um<00:03:02.930> he

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
shouldn't have happened and so um he

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.690 
shouldn't have happened and so um he

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.770 
get back to Las Vegas to have them check
it<00:03:08.580> out<00:03:08.850> and<00:03:09.950> replace<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.400> honestly<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.420> that

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
it out and replace it honestly and that

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.110 
it out and replace it honestly and that
it<00:03:13.380> for<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.650> time<00:03:13.830> being<00:03:14.220> no<00:03:14.550> chewing<00:03:14.970> or

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
it for the time being no chewing or

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.860 
it for the time being no chewing or
anything<00:03:15.300> like<00:03:15.540> that

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
anything like that

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.569 
anything like that
um<00:03:16.340> because<00:03:17.340> I<00:03:17.610> could<00:03:18.360> break<00:03:19.140> off<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.860> two

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
um because I could break off the two

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.210 
um because I could break off the two
screws<00:03:20.940> that<00:03:21.030> are<00:03:21.209> keeping<00:03:21.390> it<00:03:21.600> in<00:03:21.840> or<00:03:22.350> it

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
screws that are keeping it in or it

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.050 
screws that are keeping it in or it
could<00:03:23.579> affect<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.570> implants<00:03:25.350> actually<00:03:26.160> um<00:03:26.489> so

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
could affect the implants actually um so

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.150 
could affect the implants actually um so
it's<00:03:27.870> not<00:03:28.019> a<00:03:28.049> fun<00:03:28.260> situation<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.890> be<00:03:29.010> in<00:03:29.040> for

been doing lately and I had some egg

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.489 
been doing lately and I had some egg
drop<00:04:28.789> soup<00:04:28.819> today<00:04:29.300> because<00:04:29.960> I<00:04:29.990> can't<00:04:30.319> even

00:04:30.489 --> 00:04:30.499

cleaning<00:04:32.870> them<00:04:33.050> has<00:04:33.469> been<00:04:33.770> pretty<00:04:34.129> difficult

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
cleaning them has been pretty difficult

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.730 
cleaning them has been pretty difficult
because<00:04:35.029> I<00:04:35.300> use<00:04:35.599> a<00:04:35.629> water<00:04:35.960> pick<00:04:36.289> and<00:04:36.499> the<00:04:36.560> water

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
because I use a water pick and the water

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.920 
because I use a water pick and the water
pick<00:04:37.039> has<00:04:37.310> a<00:04:37.340> very<00:04:37.639> high-powered<00:04:38.120> stream<00:04:38.779> of

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
pick has a very high-powered stream of

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.200 
pick has a very high-powered stream of
water<00:04:39.310> shooting<00:04:40.310> in<00:04:40.400> there<00:04:40.610> so<00:04:40.789> that's<00:04:40.969> not

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
water shooting in there so that's not

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.019 
water shooting in there so that's not
going<00:04:41.389> to<00:04:41.479> work<00:04:41.539> um<00:04:42.099> so<00:04:43.099> I've<00:04:43.219> had<00:04:43.639> to<00:04:43.729> keep<00:04:43.909> it

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:44.029 
going to work um so I've had to keep it

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:45.760 
going to work um so I've had to keep it
on<00:04:44.150> a<00:04:44.180> lower<00:04:44.419> setting<00:04:44.810> it's<00:04:45.110> not<00:04:45.289> cleaning<00:04:45.590> on

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
on a lower setting it's not cleaning on

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.649 
on a lower setting it's not cleaning on
this<00:04:45.919> good<00:04:46.189> so<00:04:46.430> I<00:04:46.460> wouldn't<00:04:46.849> be<00:04:46.969> surprised<00:04:47.389> if

00:04:47.649 --> 00:04:47.659 
this good so I wouldn't be surprised if

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:50.110 
this good so I wouldn't be surprised if
they're<00:04:47.840> like<00:04:47.990> what's<00:04:48.650> going<00:04:48.949> on<00:04:49.129> here<00:04:49.550> when<00:04:50.090> I

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
they're like what's going on here when I

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.689 
they're like what's going on here when I
go<00:04:50.360> back<00:04:50.629> and<00:04:50.870> they<00:04:51.020> remove<00:04:51.650> it<00:04:51.860> it<00:04:52.039> might<00:04:52.490> not

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
go back and they remove it it might not

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.610 
go back and they remove it it might not
be<00:04:52.939> like<00:04:53.150> the<00:04:53.419> cleanest<00:04:53.840> environment<00:04:54.020> ever

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
be like the cleanest environment ever

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.029

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
but you know I would rather do that than

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.519 
but you know I would rather do that than
to<00:04:58.400> risk<00:04:58.639> having<00:04:59.150> to<00:04:59.330> go<00:04:59.479> to<00:04:59.539> an<00:04:59.750> airport<00:04:59.960> like

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:00.529 
to risk having to go to an airport like

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:02.619 
to risk having to go to an airport like
