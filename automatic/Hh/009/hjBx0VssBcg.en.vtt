00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
they fucking could but unfortunately I'm

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.000 
they fucking could but unfortunately I'm
fucking<00:02:04.270> terrible<00:02:04.750> at<00:02:04.930> it<00:02:05.140> but<00:02:05.409> you<00:02:05.740> know<00:02:05.860> what

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
fucking terrible at it but you know what

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.320 
fucking terrible at it but you know what
I<00:02:06.040> actually<00:02:06.310> thought<00:02:06.640> I<00:02:06.700> did<00:02:06.909> pretty<00:02:06.940> good<00:02:07.150> at

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
I actually thought I did pretty good at

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.150 
I actually thought I did pretty good at
this<00:02:07.450> right<00:02:07.630> that's<00:02:07.840> like<00:02:07.900> 140<00:02:08.590> meters<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.130> I

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
this right that's like 140 meters and I

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.590 
this right that's like 140 meters and I
was<00:02:09.280> like<00:02:09.429> hey<00:02:09.550> this<00:02:09.700> day<00:02:10.030> I'm<00:02:10.209> not<00:02:10.269> better

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
was like hey this day I'm not better

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.759 
was like hey this day I'm not better
than<00:02:10.690> I<00:02:10.899> couldn't<00:02:11.290> get<00:02:11.380> back<00:02:11.410> up<00:02:11.500> there<00:02:11.709> again

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
than I couldn't get back up there again

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.830 
than I couldn't get back up there again
so<00:02:12.220> I<00:02:12.280> automatically<00:02:12.670> assume<00:02:13.000> that<00:02:13.030> well<00:02:13.360> they

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
so I automatically assume that well they

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.500 
so I automatically assume that well they
got<00:02:14.110> lucky<00:02:14.440> I<00:02:14.470> got<00:02:14.680> pretty<00:02:14.830> far<00:02:15.100> and<00:02:15.489> I'm<00:02:16.269> good

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
got lucky I got pretty far and I'm good

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.180 
got lucky I got pretty far and I'm good
though<00:02:16.810> cuz<00:02:17.110> I<00:02:17.290> made<00:02:17.500> it<00:02:17.590> I'm<00:02:17.680> good<00:02:18.040> maybe

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
though cuz I made it I'm good maybe

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.979 
though cuz I made it I'm good maybe
there<00:02:18.370> once<00:02:18.580> that's<00:02:18.850> all<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.030> need<00:02:19.239> right<00:02:19.510> then

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
there once that's all I need right then

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.600 
there once that's all I need right then
I<00:02:20.019> made<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.290> mistake<00:02:20.440> of<00:02:20.830> going<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:21.250> watching

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
I made a mistake of going and watching

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.130 
I made a mistake of going and watching
the<00:02:21.670> replay<00:02:22.120> from<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.570> number<00:02:22.780> one<00:02:22.810> guy<00:02:23.110> I

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
the replay from the number one guy I

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.380 
the replay from the number one guy I
assumed<00:02:23.830> they<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.730> number<00:02:25.030> one<00:02:25.180> person

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
assumed they the number one person

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.940 
assumed they the number one person
probably<00:02:25.900> went<00:02:26.019> through<00:02:26.080> like<00:02:26.350> really<00:02:26.380> slow

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
probably went through like really slow
