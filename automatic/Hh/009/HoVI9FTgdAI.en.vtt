00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.850
 but that is a no brainer, they put flowers down 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.999
 how varied what is now made of this service insiders the Bernese 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:13.719
 Savings due to rape and violence are also those of violence

 swearing off was more spectacular 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.239
 how private consumption will become 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.539
 a fully loaded busy last kilometer is really worth 15 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:26.439
 then the two highest ranking other parts of the world become de Wever 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:29.439
 Westerwelle had inflicted considerable 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:47.119
 At the time they were 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:51.019
 Dan Aykroyd tries successfully in the bag 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.390
 both halves all born together the idea how to get such an idea 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.379
 at all 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.449
 he made with the 1 0 percent of the need and me 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:03.529
 with it, the same Sa collects with the original so these international 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:07.849
 have climbed mountains around what should this follow-up project what could be 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.909
 according to the motto, it does not always have to be higher or keep going 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:12.059
 more quickly 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:16.059
 Lisa will have come up with this thought lonely from Dr. under Merkel the 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:18.949
 highest mountains of the only thought 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:23.529
 more thoughts to come to make more of the motorized story 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:24.179
 rather 

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:28.179
 to do the way of the intermediate level by bike and so collect on 

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:29.809
 come to the thought that courage 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:33.589
 Within a week Touch Tim k Braas realized that there Wolfgang Carnival one 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:36.669
 really is authentic testimonial 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:42.349
 Trendsport really lives and thus perfectly matches our brand Senza 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:43.029
 nearly 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:46.219
 that you can change this so that they are the seven highest peaks of the world 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:48.219
 Federal states where he 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:51.459
 that with his national coach - each one is there own so that 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:52.669
 Doris areas 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:56.909
 and now Stemmert Windach stent Carinthia and Tyrol m the Grossglockner Theßeling 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:01.260
 Wins from seven summit PD nine states remained over it 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:03.259
 now with really dangerous 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:06.939
 Enzo Knife GEMA Walser's Round Story also way says »if that 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:07.669
 Weather 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:11.889
 which always played along so that always the sun laughed like that 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.639
 Doris this week 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.930
 out of concern of nature and it is also the beautiful thing about it 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.239
 and what do you know for you the most exhausting he Capello or the 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.090
 biggest challenge a whole project 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.080
 It is very difficult to say what is the most difficult of the day 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.849
 technically as he assures the Grossglockner why in the ascent 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.599
 permanently the rainy straw Meier will to win 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:33.319
 the snow was blowing 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:37.369
 but it was also the culprit about way in between so that would have been simplified 

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:40.610
 Bissl underestimates but after climbing mode also Stomp him 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.919
 On the way you are then also normal hours to ride the bike so this 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.240
 this difference of different versions of the 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.699
 Musculature if her Berber and the already tired we were Baur his 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.469
 Key message from 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:57.969
 also at the hour over nine hours of bike the name the sheet in small 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:01.179
 Daniel the mini-wm mountaineering that is because water switching back and forth so 

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:05.769
 Kurt should be alternated and it was this combination of both that 

00:05:05.769 --> 00:05:07.210
 Mountaineering and cycling 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.740
 but at least manage to spend Brun's time with us 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.699
 and more and more retirees pursued in his book pursuing court Fischler takes place 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.280
 give for most that means they even slept on average 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.279
 then during this record attempt 

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:24.809
 although IT is to the maw so between four and five hours and that sees this 

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:26.700
 similar to Thompson less through the 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.560
 physical stress from the child fatigue then the musculature it is me 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.360
 then less and subtenants genesis really so Sam on small space 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.930
 Black Panther a short time together so 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.930
 to incidents 5000 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.719
 Authenticity Trainer 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:02.539
 the driver old 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:05.539
 he tells 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.479
 is displayed correctly Red 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:12.479
 the rest is invested 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:20.400
 rtr should sell it as a success 30
