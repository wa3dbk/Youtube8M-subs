00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
you compare it to devices like this

your cost above that price obviously if
you<00:00:46.489> do<00:00:46.610> the<00:00:46.730> compression<00:00:47.300> if<00:00:47.930> you<00:00:48.110> even<00:00:48.440> talk

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
you do the compression if you even talk

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.680 
you do the compression if you even talk
about<00:00:48.649> some<00:00:49.039> branded<00:00:49.430> alternatives<00:00:50.120> they

path 1s so I'm not able to show you at
this<00:01:00.020> point<00:01:00.230> of<00:01:00.379> time<00:01:00.410> the<00:01:00.800> tablet<00:01:01.430> station

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760

this point of time the tablet station
can<00:01:01.940> be<00:01:01.969> purchased<00:01:02.390> at<00:01:02.570> around<00:01:02.989> $4.99<00:01:03.920> ringing

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
can be purchased at around $4.99 ringing

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.870 
can be purchased at around $4.99 ringing
it<00:01:04.280> so<00:01:04.729> if<00:01:04.909> you<00:01:05.000> do<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:06.040> mathematics<00:01:07.040> it<00:01:07.220> costs

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
it so if you do the mathematics it costs

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:20.590 
it so if you do the mathematics it costs

gonna take a look at the ampere off of
this<00:02:21.110> charter

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
this charter

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.449 
this charter
so<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:23.420> ampere<00:02:23.959> that<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.830> output<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:25.250> this

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
so the ampere that the output of this

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.699 
so the ampere that the output of this
charger<00:02:25.849> is<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.060> 2<00:02:26.330> amp<00:02:26.480> charger<00:02:26.870> yeah<00:02:27.200> the

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
charger is a 2 amp charger yeah the

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.440 
charger is a 2 amp charger yeah the
phones<00:02:28.099> are<00:02:28.250> pretty<00:02:28.400> thin<00:02:28.670> here<00:02:28.880> so<00:02:29.060> you<00:02:29.239> can't

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
phones are pretty thin here so you can't

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.850 
phones are pretty thin here so you can't
really<00:02:29.599> see<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:29.959> on<00:02:30.019> camera<00:02:30.230> it's<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.590> 2<00:02:30.739> amp
