00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.280
 Welcome to our quiet 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.860
 tutorial we want to show you today 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.490
 we both 125cc yamaha yzf the engine 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.990
 expands 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.310
 that can be very helpful sometimes 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.080
 as for example at the now inter 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.970
 wanted to change or maybe several 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.980
 make other maintenance on the motor 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.269
 wanted for so motor on the bad bank to 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.550
 they make me a little bit more beautiful 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.180
 as the engine just so radiation too 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.279
 burst 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.080
 still installed in the vehicle is in the reason 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.550
 Actually quite simple work 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.469
 you just need to be reasonably 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.950
 this is not a professional tool 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.260
 absolutely what should be bought 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.090
 you can actually find each one in 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.770
 every short well sorted at home 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.059
 the garage only failed 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.809
 because the question has something to do with it 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.289
 security yes the work takes a while 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.090
 little 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.430
 You should be such a good one 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.840
 two hours to live for and around the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.489
 time not to blind I would say 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.710
 Let's just start with it after yes 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.270
 we go to disguise both 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.299
 have mined and also the tank 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.549
 We all give it away 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.610
 electrical cable and all 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.610
 other 2 on the vehicle to solve 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.770
 It is important that we all as possible 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.929
 to see big parts like here now 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.280
 the throttle valves purity too 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.590
 completely degraded then you have afterwards 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.679
 When removing the engine as much as possible 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.679
 space 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:35.069
 some ropes we are already a small one 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.659
 This safety catch can be secured 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:37.520
 simply bent with a pair of pliers 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.780
 become 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.750
 right here at the clutch rope you can 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.799
 quite simply with a water pump pliers 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.490
 confirm and then be very easy 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.490
 accept 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.840
 now a little tricky that fritzl 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.840
 to decrease 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.780
 It was a little trick next to us 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.640
 better to be able to remember where you screw 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.750
 have unscrewed this just screwed 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.340
 in the open screw holes again 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.340
 so they will not get lost 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.580
 Now the puzzle is solved first 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.300
 just the two fixing screws 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.300
 to solve 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.560
 the fuse plate off 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.299
 and the puzzle together with chain easy 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.370
 I have to go through that for that 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.780
 rear wheel will be dismantled with a little 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.290
 force the chain may simply easier 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.250
 especially because of it after that 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.250
 release the control linkage 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.260
 just the screw off and in the skirt 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.730
 pull it off 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.799
 mark you what possible for a 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.599
 direction the control linkage has sat 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.620
 that ye after the ride again 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.909
 much comfort you, of course, 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.389
 The exhaust should also be removed 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.879
 become 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:55.799
 will solve this 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.870
 fixing screws rear part the 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.780
 Fixing screws which took out below 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.799
 grimma is like all screws undertook 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.799
 Exhaust manifold directly 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.050
 Now it is still very important that you 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.780
 the water of the engine peels off suitably 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.880
 simply the upper water hose 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.620
 the water pump of course you can too 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.870
 simply remove the lid from the water 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:23.030
 would go on and the water would be easy 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.830
 run a banner I recommend you 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.050
 just switch to a cylinder or 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.280
 have similar work motor 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.280
 to renew water in any case 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.890
 you already have all the cables and 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.209
 Solved anything else and can remember it 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.580
 make the main fixing screws 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.269
 the engine in any case 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.310
 to solve 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.709
 I do not recommend the screws 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.080
 to pull out because the engine otherwise tilt 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.340
 could 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.700
 and possibly injury 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.700
 consists 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:08.630
 after the last bolt is released 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.520
 Can your engine gets pretty easy 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.890
 drop out of the vehicle 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.200
 Watch out here is no finger 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:19.310
 under the motor because these remain 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.019
 again a few miles and that was it 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.010
 now you can easily continue a 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.010
 new engine work
