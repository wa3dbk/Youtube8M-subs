00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.440
 hello all friends with you I bob is 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.209
 secrets and easter eggs from the game gta 5 and 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.890
 let's start today's release from pretty 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.290
 still known easter egg they know 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.180
 almost all especially those who are 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.760
 interesting and I immediately apologize for the fact that 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.770
 I did not show you this flying saucer 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.050
 before that I just didn't have it before 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.640
 funds for the record I did not know where to find 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.349
 battiscopa it turns out he becomes 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.260
 available only after certain 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.210
 the number of completed tasks in general 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.700
 here he is, I don't know about you 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.040
 explain the coordinates here are certain 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.410
 no, in general , somehow you remember see something 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.140
 end the light gray road well 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.030
 away on cards with i over gray and like this 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.059
 Now, if you just hold it 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.180
 somewhere here i don't know i remember 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.129
 just don't know how to explain to you 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.050
 In general, I considered something that did not show 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.840
 to you this easter egg for me it will be 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.710
 very stupid because Easter eggs are real 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.410
 very cool here is such a plate very 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.000
 the only pity is that nothing can be with her 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.920
 make and there are no interactions 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.500
 although who knows maybe 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.330
 and if somewhere in a clip something shot 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.420
 what is it to push something to be with her 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.720
 something happens i don't know honestly i don't know 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.970
 but so far no one has found this. 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.920
 I don't know. I tried to swim into it. 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.420
 I didn’t succeed even at home 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.660
 what could have been there 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.789
 then others have already done it for me 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.429
 players in general, that's such a cool 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:39.490
 Easter eggs and I am glad that I am finally 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:42.160
 and and showed yes and making Easter eggs 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.959
 is also in the ocean I don't know how 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.399
 show you again exactly where she is 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:47.060
 is here no some 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.119
 certain coordinates 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.009
 want lingering places but for now 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.979
 when I sail I will try to somehow 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.750
 better not show you at all 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.880
 be sure to take the bathyscaphe here 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.659
 quite enough of your own spirit and 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.000
 do not need any other facilities 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:08.269
 the depth is small so i think you with 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.429
 you can easily find and swim here in 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.680
 Generally when I swim again to you 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.360
 will come back as we will now try you 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.300
 show where it 's still located on 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.400
 card here I would advise you to remember 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.380
 and it is like that on the road and like that 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.340
 here in the ocean in general here it is this 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.890
 Easter eggs 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.140
 sea ​​monster everyone says what is it 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.319
 most likely an alien though I am not 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.480
 I know maybe it's some kind of dinosaur 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.489
 underwater maybe this turtle is bigger 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.099
 all for some reason reminds me of a turtle 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.900
 although I do not know how the skeleton is arranged 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.209
 turtles 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.030
 maybe not at all, but those who are strong in 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:47.630
 biology or some other sciences 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.790
 learning animals maybe all 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.480
 and get here by the way his tail 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.859
 as you see the ribs and the skull also have 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.829
 fins 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:01.010
 but I think the tortoise is still a bit 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:03.650
 don't know right now wait we still 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.450
 once done and swim back here 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.549
 look at the skull closer 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.319
 so well, here's the last swim I just 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.260
 not enough breath to here 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.290
 be more show you but here 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:19.939
 look here it is a skull 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.769
 I do not know very healthy and that this is me too 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:22.250
 I don't know, in principle, they just say what 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.700
 this 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.859
 alien and sea monster more than and 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.280

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:33.349
 on the beach this is a lafesta t-shirt 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.569
