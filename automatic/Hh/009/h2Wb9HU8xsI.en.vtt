00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
could get it to me at least for my

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.620 
could get it to me at least for my
birthday<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> first<00:01:12.210> week<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.479> june

birthday in the first week of june

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.090 
birthday in the first week of june
because<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.049> mean<00:01:13.229> he's<00:01:13.380> had<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> clip<00:01:13.890> since

because I mean he's had the clip since
April<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:15.000> shouldn't<00:01:15.330> be<00:01:15.509> an<00:01:15.630> easy<00:01:15.810> task

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930
