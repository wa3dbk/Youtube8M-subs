00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.930
 buenos aires- capital of argentina 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.620
 in the streets tango is danced 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.220
 and here in the neighborhood of puerto madero 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.220
 there are also numerous food stalls 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.960
 in buenos aires you eat mostly a 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.960
 meat thing 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.270
 this is what we want to cause a mode 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.079
 so that people know that the grill 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.079
 is working 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.190
 since 4 years ago sandra sanchez has 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.890
 his position in the east of the city now 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.990
 she is already an expert in the exact guess 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.210
 roast 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:09.580
 I started making chips made 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.250
 nice chips and good and little bit I went 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.720
 learning and I started to play 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.240
 as a barbecue 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:22.370
 the churrasco is a good piece of meat 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.680
 of beef and we put it a moment nothing more 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.320
 on the way back when it 's like this 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.810
 then the meat is known to be 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.600
 point when the juice starts to come out 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.940
 juice of the flesh fruit towards 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.940
 up and now we're going to see that 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.990
 throughout the day a sandra sells up 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.990
 30 of these treats 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.610
 and whoever wants to can complement his 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.610
 jar with a new fried and ham 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:04.650
 spicy sauce gherkins onions 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.930
 jalapeÃ±os and chiles all a matter of 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.240
 pleasures 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.560
 during the week your clients are about 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.560
 all workers in the area 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.950
 and it's clear because they love the 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.130
 steak 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.960
 because I'm Argentine 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:28.540
 the Argentinian if he gets up eats meat 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.080
 after doing his things he eats meat and 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.710
 before going to bed all meat 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.510
 It has been fourteen meals 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.819
 weekly 3 gijÃ³n meats 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.010
 and depending on the garrison the 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.000
 Argentine pays between two and three euros 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.000
 for its trait
