different<00:00:49.920> which<00:00:50.700> really<00:00:51.090> changed<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.690> way<00:00:51.840> I

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
different which really changed the way I

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.410 
different which really changed the way I
looked<00:00:52.320> at<00:00:52.620> solving<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.309> problem<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:54.059> wasn't

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
looked at solving this problem it wasn't

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.389 
looked at solving this problem it wasn't
just<00:00:54.539> about<00:00:54.719> okay<00:00:55.289> as<00:00:55.469> my<00:00:55.500> house<00:00:55.890> can<00:00:56.219> have

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
just about okay as my house can have

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.740 
just about okay as my house can have
some<00:00:56.610> damage<00:00:57.000> as<00:00:57.809> big<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.469> problem<00:00:58.739> as<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.219> was

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
some damage as big a problem as that was

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.830 
some damage as big a problem as that was
it<00:01:00.750> really<00:01:01.079> changed<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:02.420> realized<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.600> this

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
it really changed I realized that this

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.420 
it really changed I realized that this
can<00:01:04.080> be<00:01:04.199> an<00:01:04.290> issue<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.619> can<00:01:04.949> affect<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
can be an issue that can affect the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.300 
can be an issue that can affect the
safety<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.820> my<00:01:06.000> family<00:01:06.560> and<00:01:07.560> I'd<00:01:07.860> never<00:01:08.010> really

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
safety of my family and I'd never really

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.429 
safety of my family and I'd never really
thought<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.270> looking<00:01:09.930> at<00:01:10.260> what

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
thought of that so in looking at what

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.679 
thought of that so in looking at what
product<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.010> was<00:01:11.220> going<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.700> use<00:01:12.150> since<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
product I was going to use since the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.660 
product I was going to use since the
product<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.140> had<00:01:13.320> didn't<00:01:13.710> work<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.369> did

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
product I had didn't work so you did

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.580 
product I had didn't work so you did
have<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.939> system<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.479> place<00:01:15.509> had<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> system<00:01:16.470> in

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
have a system in place had a system in

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.550 
have a system in place had a system in
place<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:17.460> was<00:01:18.000> supposed<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.509> work<00:01:18.689> was

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
place that was supposed to work was

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.800 
place that was supposed to work was
supposed<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.950> be<00:01:20.040> good<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.490> wasn't<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.630> best

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
supposed to be good I wasn't the best

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.539 
supposed to be good I wasn't the best
wasn't<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.470> most<00:01:22.619> expensive<00:01:23.070> because<00:01:23.369> I

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
wasn't the most expensive because I

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.670 
wasn't the most expensive because I
didn't<00:01:23.790> think<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.030> was<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.150> big<00:01:24.330> deal<00:01:24.680> I

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
didn't think it was a big deal I

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.590 
didn't think it was a big deal I
realized<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.000> wasn't<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.450> way<00:01:27.570> I

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
realized that that wasn't the way I

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.149 
realized that that wasn't the way I
needed<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.080> view<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.770> was<00:01:28.979> dealing

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
needed to view it that I was dealing

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.789 
needed to view it that I was dealing
with<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.430> whole<00:01:29.640> lot<00:01:29.820> more<00:01:30.060> than<00:01:30.360> just<00:01:30.799> there

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
with a whole lot more than just there

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.580 
with a whole lot more than just there
may<00:01:31.950> be<00:01:31.979> some<00:01:32.280> ice<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.640> my<00:01:32.820> roof<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:34.470> may

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
may be some ice on my roof and it may

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.990 
may be some ice on my roof and it may
cause<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> problem<00:01:35.250> with<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> gutter<00:01:35.880> or

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
cause a problem with a gutter or

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.940 
cause a problem with a gutter or
something<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:37.020> became<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.350> lot<00:01:37.560> more<00:01:37.710> than<00:01:37.770> that

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
something it became a lot more than that

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.219 
something it became a lot more than that
to<00:01:38.130> me<00:01:38.369> first<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.180> became<00:01:39.450> convinced<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:40.110> I

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
to me first I became convinced that I

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.990 
to me first I became convinced that I
had<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.530> fix<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.890> problem<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.790> what<00:01:41.970> I

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
had to fix the problem and that what I

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.660 
had to fix the problem and that what I
had<00:01:42.329> didn't<00:01:42.750> fix<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.140> problem<00:01:43.560> then<00:01:44.399> in

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
had didn't fix the problem then in

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.700 
had didn't fix the problem then in
looking<00:01:45.030> at<00:01:45.210> what<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.659> solutions<00:01:46.200> were<00:01:46.409> I

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
looking at what the solutions were I

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.950 
looking at what the solutions were I
became<00:01:47.189> convinced<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.149> smartest<00:01:48.780> way

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
became convinced that the smartest way

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.319 
became convinced that the smartest way
to<00:01:48.990> go<00:01:49.290> was<00:01:49.619> thermal<00:01:49.979> technologies<00:01:50.549> because

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
to go was thermal technologies because

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.050 
to go was thermal technologies because
it<00:01:51.479> fixed<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> problem<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:53.070> for<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.880> long

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
it fixed the problem and for the long

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.510 
it fixed the problem and for the long
term<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.360> was<00:01:54.600> actually<00:01:54.960> less<00:01:55.110> expensive<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:56.340> a

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
term it was actually less expensive in a

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.719 
term it was actually less expensive in a
lot<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.729> different<00:01:56.850> ways<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.689> great<00:01:57.899> thing<00:01:57.930> is

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
lot of different ways the great thing is

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.069 
lot of different ways the great thing is
thermal<00:01:59.729> technologies<00:02:00.360> blend<00:02:00.810> of

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
thermal technologies blend of

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.760 
thermal technologies blend of
effectiveness<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.340> cost<00:02:03.119> was<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.680> know

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
effectiveness and cost was you know

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.100 
effectiveness and cost was you know
pretty<00:02:05.040> much<00:02:05.159> everything<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.670> could<00:02:05.820> hope

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
pretty much everything I could hope

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.010 
pretty much everything I could hope
so<00:02:06.860> it's<00:02:07.040> good<00:02:07.250> technology<00:02:07.820> kaust<00:02:08.630> makes<00:02:08.930> a

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
so it's good technology kaust makes a

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.870 
so it's good technology kaust makes a
lot<00:02:09.140> of<00:02:09.170> sense<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.740> ongoing<00:02:10.190> cost<00:02:10.429> is<00:02:10.670> much

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
lot of sense the ongoing cost is much

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.900 
lot of sense the ongoing cost is much
less<00:02:11.150> expensive<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:11.810> my<00:02:12.260> house<00:02:12.440> is<00:02:12.620> protected

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
less expensive and my house is protected

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.720 
less expensive and my house is protected
as<00:02:13.910> my<00:02:14.600> family<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:15.230> that's<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:16.340> know<00:02:16.430> I<00:02:16.460> can't

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
as my family and that's you know I can't

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.160 
as my family and that's you know I can't
ask<00:02:16.910> for<00:02:17.000> more<00:02:17.180> net<00:02:17.390> yeah<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:17.810> can't<00:02:18.020> put<00:02:18.140> a

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
ask for more net yeah you can't put a

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.260 
ask for more net yeah you can't put a
price<00:02:18.230> on<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.590> Canyon<00:02:19.010> nope<00:02:19.340> okay<00:02:19.910> Dave

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
price on that Canyon nope okay Dave

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.910 
price on that Canyon nope okay Dave

thank you so much for talking to us make
sure<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:22.190> never<00:02:22.250> happens<00:02:22.550> again<00:02:23.140> that

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
sure this never happens again that

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.780 
sure this never happens again that
that's<00:02:24.470> up<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.740> thermal<00:02:25.010> technologies<00:02:25.550> and

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
that's up to thermal technologies and

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:26.770 
that's up to thermal technologies and
they<00:02:25.910> will<00:02:26.090> make<00:02:26.240> sure<00:02:26.390> it<00:02:26.510> never<00:02:26.690> happens

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
they will make sure it never happens

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.890 
they will make sure it never happens
again<00:02:27.110> that's<00:02:27.500> for<00:02:27.740> sure
