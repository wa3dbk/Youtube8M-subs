the<00:00:35.190> sides<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:35.850> our<00:00:36.059> volume<00:00:36.780> buttons

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
the sides we have our volume buttons

the sides we have our volume buttons
covered<00:00:37.530> up<00:00:38.149> which<00:00:39.149> are<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> little<00:00:40.079> bit

does take a good amount of force to get
to<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.969> then<00:00:45.570> we<00:00:45.690> have<00:00:45.870> our<00:00:46.140> mute<00:00:46.559> switch

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
to and then we have our mute switch

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.880 
to and then we have our mute switch
which<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.489> very<00:00:47.850> easy<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.329> get<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.770> across<00:00:49.770> the

which is very easy to get to across the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.680 
which is very easy to get to across the
top<00:00:50.100> we<00:00:50.219> have<00:00:50.250> our<00:00:50.430> power<00:00:50.610> button<00:00:50.969> which<00:00:51.510> is

top we have our power button which is

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.150 
top we have our power button which is
not<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> problem<00:00:52.410> which<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.649> much<00:00:52.829> better<00:00:53.070> than

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
not a problem which is much better than

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.459 
not a problem which is much better than
the<00:00:53.699> volume<00:00:54.030> buttons<00:00:54.300> going<00:00:55.140> across<00:00:55.289> the

and going across the bottom it is an

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.990 
and going across the bottom it is an
open<00:01:00.449> area<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:01.890> all<00:01:02.280> your<00:01:02.550> ports<00:01:02.820> will

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
open area so that all your ports will

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.140 
open area so that all your ports will
fit<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.300> there<00:01:03.420> nicely<00:01:03.860> and<00:01:04.860> then<00:01:05.850> across<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
fit in there nicely and then across the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.750 
fit in there nicely and then across the
sides<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.170> TPU<00:01:08.040> material<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.729> a

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
sides it is that TPU material so it's a

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.570 
sides it is that TPU material so it's a
little<00:01:08.880> bit<00:01:08.970> sticky<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.080> way<00:01:10.200> on<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.340> back

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
little bit sticky in a way on the back

little bit sticky in a way on the back
it<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.970> very<00:01:12.270> smooth<00:01:12.810> matte<00:01:13.290> finish<00:01:13.770> case

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
it is a very smooth matte finish case

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.039 
it is a very smooth matte finish case
which<00:01:14.670> means<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:14.970> doesn't<00:01:15.150> scratch<00:01:15.360> doesn't

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
which means it doesn't scratch doesn't

which means it doesn't scratch doesn't
get<00:01:16.170> fingerprints<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:16.979> feels<00:01:17.159> really

allow<00:01:22.740> slightly<00:01:23.490> transparency<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.450> can

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
allow slightly transparency so you can

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.420 
allow slightly transparency so you can

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
looks really nice and it does protect it

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.190 
looks really nice and it does protect it
because<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.790> whip<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.240> front<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.689> the

because of the whip on the front and the
and<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.950> little<00:01:47.130> bit<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.250> thickness<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.790> it

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
and a little bit of thickness that it

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.780 
and a little bit of thickness that it
gives<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.799> overall<00:01:49.799> I'd<00:01:49.890> give<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.310> 4<00:01:50.670> out

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
gives it overall I'd give this a 4 out

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
buttons being pretty difficult to press

loose<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.840> sides<00:01:58.079> but<00:01:58.409> it's<00:01:58.560> not<00:01:58.680> too<00:01:58.920> bad

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
loose on the sides but it's not too bad

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.749 
loose on the sides but it's not too bad
and<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.850> is<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.000> nice<00:02:00.240> snug<00:02:00.689> fit<00:02:00.750> on<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.380> corners
