00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
FTP client so that I can graphically

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.510 
FTP client so that I can graphically
show<00:00:56.990> you<00:00:57.050> where<00:00:57.380> I'm<00:00:57.500> putting<00:00:57.740> these<00:00:58.160> things

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
but you can do the same kind of thing

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.299 
but you can do the same kind of thing
using<00:01:01.880> a<00:01:02.150> file<00:01:02.690> manager<00:01:03.200> on<00:01:03.380> the<00:01:03.590> Android<00:01:04.100> if

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
using a file manager on the Android if

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.070 
using a file manager on the Android if
you<00:01:04.400> were<00:01:04.489> to<00:01:04.580> put<00:01:04.729> all<00:01:04.759> the<00:01:04.939> files<00:01:05.180> onto<00:01:05.509> an<00:01:05.900> SD

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
you were to put all the files onto an SD

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.760 
you were to put all the files onto an SD
card<00:01:06.409> first<00:01:07.180> now<00:01:08.180> what<00:01:08.749> I<00:01:08.780> have<00:01:09.079> set<00:01:09.499> up<00:01:09.619> is

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.889 
card first now what I have set up is
that<00:01:09.799> folder<00:01:10.340> that<00:01:10.369> I<00:01:10.520> showed<00:01:10.820> you<00:01:10.939> roms<00:01:11.359> with

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
that folder that I showed you roms with

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.239 
matter if it's V 64 and 64 ZX 64 it
doesn't<00:01:19.729> really<00:01:19.850> matter<00:01:20.439> and<00:01:21.439> then<00:01:21.619> here<00:01:22.069> is

folder here we want to make sure that we

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.899 
folder here we want to make sure that we
go<00:01:29.600> into<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.170> storage<00:01:30.469> SD<00:01:30.920> card<00:01:31.159> 0<00:01:31.460> so<00:01:31.670> this<00:01:31.759> is

go into the storage SD card 0 so this is
the<00:01:31.999> internal<00:01:32.630> memory<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.200> we<00:01:33.920> go<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.159> dot<00:01:34.729> n64

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
the internal memory and we go to dot n64

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.260 
the internal memory and we go to dot n64
oyd<00:01:35.840> this<00:01:36.499> is<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:37.219> the<00:01:37.429> dot<00:01:37.639> is<00:01:37.850> basically

oyd this is the the dot is basically

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.489 
oyd this is the the dot is basically
signifying<00:01:38.840> that<00:01:38.960> it's<00:01:39.170> going<00:01:39.259> to<00:01:39.319> be<00:01:39.469> a

that texture pack but the naming of this
is<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.969> crucial<00:02:08.240> part<00:02:08.569> you<00:02:08.840> want<00:02:08.990> to<00:02:09.050> make

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
is the crucial part you want to make

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.920 
is the crucial part you want to make
sure<00:02:09.229> that<00:02:09.560> this<00:02:09.890> name<00:02:10.310> matches<00:02:11.180> this<00:02:11.630> name

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
sure that this name matches this name

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.970 
sure that this name matches this name
here<00:02:12.439> but<00:02:13.420> it's<00:02:14.420> not<00:02:14.659> simply<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.319> file<00:02:15.680> name

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
here but it's not simply the file name

here but it's not simply the file name
that<00:02:16.010> we're<00:02:16.340> trying<00:02:16.580> to<00:02:16.849> match<00:02:17.060> work

that we're trying to match work
trying<00:02:17.749> to<00:02:17.930> match<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.650> ROM<00:02:18.950> name<00:02:19.519> and<00:02:19.909> in

order to find out the embedded ROM name

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.839 
order to find out the embedded ROM name
it's<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.719> good<00:02:24.200> idea<00:02:24.499> to<00:02:24.709> use<00:02:24.889> a<00:02:24.920> tool<00:02:25.370> for

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
it's a good idea to use a tool for

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.489 
it's a good idea to use a tool for
Windows<00:02:26.749> called<00:02:27.409> tool<00:02:27.859> 64<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:30.290> show<00:02:30.439> you

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:30.499 
Windows called tool 64 and to show you

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:33.300 
Windows called tool 64 and to show you
how<00:02:30.739> that<00:02:30.799> works<00:02:31.189> we<00:02:31.909> go<00:02:32.090> into<00:02:32.329> Windows<00:02:32.810> here

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
how that works we go into Windows here

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.949 
how that works we go into Windows here
and<00:02:34.310> it's<00:02:34.579> this<00:02:34.849> program<00:02:35.329> sorry

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
and it's this program sorry

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.569 
and it's this program sorry
right<00:02:36.680> here<00:02:36.950> tool<00:02:37.159> 64<00:02:37.849> you<00:02:38.780> go<00:02:38.959> to<00:02:39.319> the<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:40.370> ROM

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
right here tool 64 you go to the the ROM

right here tool 64 you go to the the ROM
that<00:02:40.849> you've<00:02:41.000> downloaded<00:02:41.209> so<00:02:41.959> you<00:02:42.109> wouldn't

you've you've downloaded the ROM to

you've you've downloaded the ROM to
right<00:02:47.870> click<00:02:48.109> on<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.379> ROM<00:02:49.150> click<00:02:50.150> ROM

Super Mario 64 all caps spaces in
between<00:02:57.319> ok<00:02:58.219> so<00:02:58.280> that's<00:02:58.579> what<00:02:58.790> we<00:02:58.879> want<00:02:59.060> to

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
between ok so that's what we want to

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.780 
between ok so that's what we want to
make<00:02:59.239> sure<00:02:59.449> that<00:02:59.569> it's<00:02:59.750> named<00:03:00.049> as<00:03:00.290> we<00:03:01.250> go<00:03:01.430> here

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
make sure that it's named as we go here

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.679 
make sure that it's named as we go here
Super<00:03:02.449> Mario<00:03:02.629> 64<00:03:02.980> spaces<00:03:03.980> caps<00:03:04.250> perfect<00:03:05.239> so

Super Mario 64 spaces caps perfect so

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:07.899 
Super Mario 64 spaces caps perfect so
everything<00:03:06.230> is<00:03:06.379> named<00:03:06.620> correctly<00:03:07.280> once<00:03:07.819> you

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:07.909 
everything is named correctly once you

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.209 
everything is named correctly once you
start<00:03:08.239> having<00:03:08.449> names<00:03:09.319> that<00:03:09.620> are<00:03:09.739> different

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:10.219 
start having names that are different

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:12.670 
start having names that are different
from<00:03:10.400> one<00:03:10.639> another<00:03:11.019> then<00:03:12.019> it<00:03:12.049> starts<00:03:12.469> not

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
from one another then it starts not

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.670 
from one another then it starts not
working<00:03:13.159> because<00:03:13.340> when<00:03:13.909> n64<00:03:14.840> oeid<00:03:15.019> opens<00:03:15.500> up

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
working because when n64 oeid opens up

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.830 
working because when n64 oeid opens up
this<00:03:15.889> ROM<00:03:16.219> it<00:03:16.549> doesn't<00:03:16.939> know<00:03:17.090> exactly<00:03:17.269> which

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
this ROM it doesn't know exactly which

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.439 
this ROM it doesn't know exactly which
texturepack<00:03:18.650> you're<00:03:19.010> trying<00:03:19.579> to<00:03:19.819> use<00:03:20.120> because

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:20.449 
texturepack you're trying to use because

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:23.499 
texturepack you're trying to use because
it's<00:03:20.810> not<00:03:21.019> there<00:03:21.260> is<00:03:21.379> no<00:03:21.759> folder<00:03:22.759> associated

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:23.509 
it's not there is no folder associated

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:25.929 
it's not there is no folder associated
with<00:03:23.689> that<00:03:23.870> name<00:03:24.139> so<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:24.919> file<00:03:25.250> name<00:03:25.549> doesn't

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:25.939 
with that name so the file name doesn't

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:29.830 
with that name so the file name doesn't
have<00:03:26.090> to<00:03:26.239> match<00:03:26.449> but<00:03:27.439> this<00:03:28.009> ROM<00:03:28.519> name<00:03:28.939> has<00:03:29.629> to

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
have to match but this ROM name has to

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.949 
have to match but this ROM name has to
match<00:03:30.049> and<00:03:30.409> that's<00:03:31.129> the<00:03:31.519> important<00:03:31.970> part<00:03:32.120> so

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
match and that's the important part so

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.539 
match and that's the important part so
now<00:03:32.989> we'll<00:03:33.290> get<00:03:33.409> back<00:03:33.590> onto<00:03:33.859> the<00:03:34.040> phone<00:03:34.280> and

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
now we'll get back onto the phone and

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.849 
now we'll get back onto the phone and
see<00:03:34.819> how<00:03:34.909> it<00:03:35.090> runs<00:03:35.269> now<00:03:36.169> that<00:03:36.349> all<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:36.650> files

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
see how it runs now that all the files

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:38.949 
see how it runs now that all the files
are<00:03:37.129> in<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.310> right<00:03:37.489> location<00:03:38.150> we're<00:03:38.629> able<00:03:38.720> to

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
are in the right location we're able to

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.949 
are in the right location we're able to
do<00:03:39.109> this<00:03:39.290> really<00:03:39.650> simply<00:03:40.250> we<00:03:40.699> go<00:03:40.849> to<00:03:40.909> n64<00:03:41.419> oeid

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
do this really simply we go to n64 oeid

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.830 
do this really simply we go to n64 oeid
and<00:03:42.229> I'll<00:03:42.680> start<00:03:43.340> by<00:03:43.489> doing<00:03:43.759> this<00:03:43.939> just<00:03:44.720> to

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
and I'll start by doing this just to

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.649 
and I'll start by doing this just to
show<00:03:44.870> you<00:03:46.299> Super<00:03:47.299> Mario<00:03:47.479> 64<00:03:49.239> alright<00:03:50.239> so<00:03:50.509> now

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:50.659 
show you Super Mario 64 alright so now

we're<00:04:25.699> gonna<00:04:25.789> go<00:04:26.000> into<00:04:26.210> settings<00:04:26.570> and<00:04:27.039> since

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
we're gonna go into settings and since

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.070 
we're gonna go into settings and since
everything<00:04:28.340> is<00:04:28.580> labeled<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.330> correct<00:04:29.810> way

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
everything is labeled the correct way

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.589 
everything is labeled the correct way
going<00:04:30.860> into<00:04:31.099> engines

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:31.599 
going into engines

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:34.290 
going into engines
and<00:04:32.020> turning<00:04:32.289> on<00:04:32.589> external<00:04:33.159> textures<00:04:33.789> back

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
and turning on external textures back

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.859 
and turning on external textures back
out<00:04:34.889> well<00:04:35.889> when<00:04:36.610> we<00:04:36.759> open<00:04:37.029> this<00:04:37.149> ROM<00:04:37.389> it'll<00:04:37.689> go

00:04:37.859 --> 00:04:37.869 
out well when we open this ROM it'll go

00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:39.899 
out well when we open this ROM it'll go
for<00:04:38.080> that<00:04:38.229> texture<00:04:38.800> pack<00:04:39.009> that<00:04:39.219> we<00:04:39.339> put<00:04:39.669> into

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:39.909 
for that texture pack that we put into

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:43.290 
for that texture pack that we put into
the<00:04:40.209> high<00:04:40.629> res<00:04:40.929> folder<00:04:41.919> that<00:04:42.249> we<00:04:42.429> showed<00:04:43.149> you

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
the high res folder that we showed you

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.439 
the high res folder that we showed you
before<00:04:43.619> so<00:04:44.619> now<00:04:44.979> when<00:04:45.159> we<00:04:45.309> loaded<00:04:45.520> it'll<00:04:46.300> take

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
before so now when we loaded it'll take

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.299 
before so now when we loaded it'll take
a<00:04:46.479> little<00:04:46.809> bit<00:04:46.959> longer<00:04:47.199> to<00:04:47.499> loaded<00:04:47.800> initially

00:04:48.299 --> 00:04:48.309 
a little bit longer to loaded initially

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:49.769 
a little bit longer to loaded initially
just<00:04:48.520> because<00:04:48.759> it's<00:04:48.939> loading<00:04:49.300> that<00:04:49.479> that

00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:49.779 
just because it's loading that that

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:52.889 
just because it's loading that that
texture<00:04:50.199> pack<00:04:51.149> but<00:04:52.149> it<00:04:52.270> loads<00:04:52.479> into<00:04:52.779> that

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:52.899 
texture pack but it loads into that

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:55.439 
texture pack but it loads into that
textured<00:04:53.349> version<00:04:53.740> of<00:04:53.860> it<00:04:54.009> so<00:04:54.240> let's<00:04:55.240> go<00:04:55.360> to

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
textured version of it so let's go to

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.040 
textured version of it so let's go to
that<00:04:55.629> same<00:04:56.520> load<00:04:57.520> that<00:04:57.879> I<00:04:57.909> had<00:04:58.149> before<00:04:58.360> and

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
that same load that I had before and

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.339 
that same load that I had before and
you'll<00:04:59.770> immediately<00:05:00.009> see<00:05:00.520> some<00:05:00.729> differences

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
you'll immediately see some differences

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:04.139 
you'll immediately see some differences
for<00:05:02.349> one<00:05:02.499> the<00:05:02.649> text<00:05:03.009> is<00:05:03.129> now<00:05:03.309> the<00:05:03.759> font<00:05:03.999> has

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:04.149 
for one the text is now the font has

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:06.719 
for one the text is now the font has
changed<00:05:04.719> the<00:05:05.050> walls<00:05:05.979> are<00:05:06.249> now<00:05:06.399> a<00:05:06.430> lot<00:05:06.699> more

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
changed the walls are now a lot more

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.639 
changed the walls are now a lot more
textured<00:05:07.479> the<00:05:07.689> ground<00:05:08.110> actually<00:05:08.469> has<00:05:08.619> a

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:08.649 
textured the ground actually has a

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:11.999 
textured the ground actually has a
pattern<00:05:09.159> to<00:05:09.339> it<00:05:09.369> even<00:05:10.240> the<00:05:10.419> the<00:05:11.139> icons<00:05:11.559> up<00:05:11.770> here

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 
pattern to it even the the icons up here

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.059 
pattern to it even the the icons up here
from<00:05:12.219> Mario<00:05:12.639> and<00:05:13.059> for<00:05:13.539> the<00:05:13.719> stars<00:05:14.080> are<00:05:14.589> much

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:15.069 
from Mario and for the stars are much

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:18.149 
from Mario and for the stars are much
more<00:05:15.339> detailed<00:05:15.819> now<00:05:16.599> if<00:05:16.899> I<00:05:17.080> quit<00:05:17.469> out<00:05:17.619> of<00:05:17.649> here

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:18.159 
more detailed now if I quit out of here

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:22.379 
more detailed now if I quit out of here
and<00:05:18.339> I<00:05:18.819> just<00:05:18.969> walk<00:05:19.209> into<00:05:19.419> the<00:05:20.430> area<00:05:21.430> here<00:05:21.879> we

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
and I just walk into the area here we

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:23.969 
and I just walk into the area here we
can<00:05:22.569> see<00:05:22.749> that<00:05:22.779> they've<00:05:23.139> changed<00:05:23.409> up<00:05:23.680> a<00:05:23.800> lot<00:05:23.949> of

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
can see that they've changed up a lot of

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:25.889 
can see that they've changed up a lot of
the<00:05:24.129> stuff<00:05:24.339> in<00:05:24.519> here<00:05:24.759> as<00:05:24.939> well<00:05:25.119> the<00:05:25.659> ground

been updated with higher resolution text
textures<00:05:38.159> going<00:05:39.159> into<00:05:39.519> here<00:05:40.889> we<00:05:41.889> see<00:05:42.099> even

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:42.969 
textures going into here we see even

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:45.809 
textures going into here we see even
blah<00:05:43.629> blah<00:05:43.899> blah<00:05:44.110> blah<00:05:44.349> awesome
