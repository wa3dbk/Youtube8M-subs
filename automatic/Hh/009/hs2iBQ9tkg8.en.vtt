spending money in the future as a result

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.670 
spending money in the future as a result
of<00:01:45.119> driving<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.630> change<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.079> consumer<00:01:46.259> behavior

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
of driving a change in consumer behavior

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.499 
of driving a change in consumer behavior
sometimes<00:01:47.460> we're<00:01:47.880> right<00:01:48.060> about<00:01:48.299> that

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
sometimes we're right about that

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.600 
sometimes we're right about that
sometimes<00:01:49.140> we're<00:01:49.409> not<00:01:49.619> but<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> couple<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.430> good

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
sometimes we're not but a couple of good

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.670 
sometimes we're not but a couple of good
examples<00:01:50.790> are<00:01:51.390> video<00:01:51.780> egg<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.140> Wild<00:01:52.380> Tangent

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
examples are video egg and Wild Tangent

the<00:01:53.070> online<00:01:53.399> gaming<00:01:53.790> network<00:01:54.360> are<00:01:54.540> in<00:01:54.659> that

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
the online gaming network are in that

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.440 
the online gaming network are in that
box<00:01:55.110> as<00:01:55.320> well<00:01:55.350> we<00:01:56.070> think<00:01:56.219> video<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.729> extremely

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
box as well we think video is extremely

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.420 
box as well we think video is extremely
interesting<00:01:58.049> we<00:01:58.380> think<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.100> social

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
interesting we think that the social

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.219 
interesting we think that the social
networking<00:01:59.790> space<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.329> very<00:02:00.540> hard<00:02:00.810> place<00:02:01.200> to

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
networking space is a very hard place to

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.310 
networking space is a very hard place to
advertisers<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.430> navigate<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.540> we<00:02:04.020> think

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
advertisers to navigate and we think

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.499 
advertisers to navigate and we think
that<00:02:04.409> video<00:02:04.979> eggs<00:02:05.310> built<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.850> player<00:02:06.090> that

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
that video eggs built in player that

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.719 
that video eggs built in player that
allows<00:02:06.540> us<00:02:06.990> distribute<00:02:07.770> content<00:02:08.129> into<00:02:08.580> those

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
allows us distribute content into those

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.490 
allows us distribute content into those
networks<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.300> very<00:02:09.509> valuable<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.080> us<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.440> we

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
networks is very valuable to us and we

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.660 
networks is very valuable to us and we
think<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:10.770> going<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.950> be<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.069> very<00:02:11.250> strong

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
think it's going to be a very strong

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
think it's going to be a very strong
play<00:02:11.940> because<00:02:12.480> it

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
play because it

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.720 
play because it
offers<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.900> great<00:02:13.320> deal<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.590> volume<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.610> an

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
audience that's pretty hard to get

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.590 
audience that's pretty hard to get
through<00:02:16.560> other<00:02:16.770> forms<00:02:17.130> of<00:02:17.250> video<00:02:17.580> media<00:02:17.880> we're

through other forms of video media we're

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.800 
through other forms of video media we're
not<00:02:18.720> crazy<00:02:18.930> about<00:02:19.200> pre-roll<00:02:20.060> we<00:02:21.060> love<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.360> model

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
not crazy about pre-roll we love a model

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.380 
not crazy about pre-roll we love a model
I<00:02:21.960> go<00:02:22.590> back<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.070> it<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.280> ABC<00:02:23.610> com<00:02:24.000> model<00:02:24.300> we

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
I go back to it the ABC com model we

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.150 
I go back to it the ABC com model we
think<00:02:24.570> it's<00:02:24.720> fabulous<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.500> we're<00:02:25.590> using<00:02:25.770> it<00:02:26.040> a

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
think it's fabulous and we're using it a

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.400 
think it's fabulous and we're using it a
great<00:02:26.400> deal<00:02:26.640> there's<00:02:27.210> a<00:02:27.240> lot<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.570> unknowns<00:02:28.140> out

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
great deal there's a lot of unknowns out

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.050 
great deal there's a lot of unknowns out
there<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.800> don't<00:02:29.070> think<00:02:29.190> anyone's<00:02:29.550> cracked<00:02:29.940> the

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
there I don't think anyone's cracked the

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.680 
there I don't think anyone's cracked the
code<00:02:30.300> on<00:02:30.330> youtube<00:02:31.200> so<00:02:31.590> far<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:31.980> what<00:02:32.100> to<00:02:32.280> do

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
code on youtube so far and what to do

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.900 
code on youtube so far and what to do
but<00:02:33.690> all<00:02:33.900> we<00:02:34.230> know<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:35.040> advertising<00:02:35.760> and

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
but all we know is the advertising and

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.320 
but all we know is the advertising and
content<00:02:36.080> somehow<00:02:37.080> go<00:02:37.920> together<00:02:38.130> and<00:02:38.580> we<00:02:39.090> think

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
content somehow go together and we think

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.640 
content somehow go together and we think
that<00:02:39.480> what's<00:02:39.900> going<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.200> happen<00:02:40.500> is<00:02:40.620> people

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
that what's going to happen is people

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.520 
that what's going to happen is people
were<00:02:41.100> increasingly<00:02:41.880> monetized<00:02:42.690> interesting

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
were increasingly monetized interesting

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.830 
were increasingly monetized interesting
applications<00:02:44.490> that<00:02:45.030> people<00:02:45.180> opt-in

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
applications that people opt-in

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.170 
applications that people opt-in
deliberate<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.650> use<00:02:46.920> as<00:02:47.160> opposed<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.150> just

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
deliberate to use as opposed to just

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.920 
deliberate to use as opposed to just
consuming<00:02:49.140> media<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:50.160> adding<00:02:51.030> video<00:02:51.450> around

those<00:02:52.170> applications<00:02:52.710> in<00:02:53.160> some<00:02:53.430> way<00:02:53.580> is<00:02:53.700> going

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
those applications in some way is going

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.070 
those applications in some way is going
to<00:02:53.910> be<00:02:54.000> something<00:02:54.150> that's<00:02:54.330> very<00:02:54.630> valuable<00:02:54.780> to

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
to be something that's very valuable to

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.830 
to be something that's very valuable to
our<00:02:55.200> clients<00:02:55.620> what's<00:02:56.280> applications<00:02:57.090> will

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
our clients what's applications will

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.200 
our clients what's applications will
facebook<00:02:58.260> now<00:02:58.440> an<00:02:58.560> open<00:02:58.860> system<00:02:59.100> right<00:02:59.460> and<00:02:59.700> so

facebook now an open system right and so
people<00:03:00.420> are<00:03:00.660> developing<00:03:01.350> applications<00:03:01.620> like

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
people are developing applications like

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.390 
people are developing applications like
an<00:03:02.340> aquarium<00:03:03.200> application<00:03:04.200> for<00:03:04.530> facebook<00:03:05.070> now

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
an aquarium application for facebook now

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.580 
an aquarium application for facebook now
the<00:03:05.460> people<00:03:05.670> are<00:03:05.880> developing<00:03:06.300> those

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
the people are developing those

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.900 
the people are developing those
applications<00:03:07.590> have<00:03:07.950> almost<00:03:08.310> no<00:03:08.580> way<00:03:08.790> of

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
applications have almost no way of

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.910 
applications have almost no way of
monetizing<00:03:09.360> them<00:03:09.780> at<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:09.990> moment<00:03:10.350> what<00:03:10.740> I'd

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
monetizing them at the moment what I'd

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.800 
monetizing them at the moment what I'd
hope<00:03:11.220> is<00:03:11.490> that<00:03:11.520> when<00:03:11.760> people<00:03:11.940> launch<00:03:12.480> those

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
hope is that when people launch those

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.390 
hope is that when people launch those
kind<00:03:13.110> of<00:03:13.200> applications<00:03:13.920> that<00:03:14.130> they're<00:03:14.280> going

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
kind of applications that they're going

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.890 
kind of applications that they're going
to<00:03:14.460> use<00:03:14.520> and<00:03:14.910> have<00:03:15.030> fun<00:03:15.240> with<00:03:15.450> they'll

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
to use and have fun with they'll

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.470 
to use and have fun with they'll
tolerate<00:03:16.170> some<00:03:16.709> video<00:03:17.040> as<00:03:17.250> part<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.700> that<00:03:17.940> kind

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
tolerate some video as part of that kind

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.959 
tolerate some video as part of that kind
of<00:03:18.720> mix
