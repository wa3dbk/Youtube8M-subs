00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.170 

you

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:14.180 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.670 

you<00:00:15.180> know<00:00:15.300> what<00:00:15.510> I<00:00:15.540> think<00:00:16.139> I'm<00:00:16.200> on<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.410> record

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
you know what I think I'm on the record

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.530 
you know what I think I'm on the record
as<00:00:16.770> saying<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:17.010> think<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.520> point<00:00:17.760> system<00:00:17.970> still

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:18.540 
as saying I think the point system still

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.920 
as saying I think the point system still
needs<00:00:18.779> work<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.680> think<00:00:20.330> the<00:00:21.330> regional<00:00:21.690> champ

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
needs work I think the regional champ

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.210 
needs work I think the regional champ
has<00:00:22.020> been<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.230> lot<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.440> good<00:00:22.650> progress<00:00:22.980> but<00:00:23.070> I

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
has been a lot of good progress but I

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.720 
has been a lot of good progress but I
still<00:00:23.580> think<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:23.850> needs<00:00:23.880> work<00:00:26.690> you<00:00:27.690> know<00:00:28.730> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
still think it needs work you know the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.429 
still think it needs work you know the
goal<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.180> have<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.630> best<00:00:30.779> athletes<00:00:31.289> in

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
goal is to have the best athletes in

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.979 
goal is to have the best athletes in
their<00:00:31.619> best<00:00:31.830> shape<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.400> the<00:00:32.780> start<00:00:33.780> line<00:00:33.809> in

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
their best shape on the start line in

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.270 
their best shape on the start line in
the<00:00:34.050> World<00:00:34.170> Championships<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.070> think<00:00:35.220> you

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
the World Championships and I think you

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.619 
the World Championships and I think you
need<00:00:35.400> to<00:00:35.460> work<00:00:35.670> backwards<00:00:35.879> from<00:00:36.090> there<00:00:36.239> and

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
need to work backwards from there and

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.479 
need to work backwards from there and
structure<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.350> whole<00:00:37.500> system<00:00:37.680> around<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.309> I

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
structure the whole system around that I

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:46.130 
structure the whole system around that I
do<00:00:39.300> think<00:00:39.839> that<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:41.120> system<00:00:42.120> where<00:00:44.870> the<00:00:45.870> best

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
do think that a system where the best

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.899 
do think that a system where the best
athletes<00:00:46.530> race<00:00:46.769> more<00:00:47.070> often<00:00:47.370> for<00:00:47.610> deeper

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
athletes race more often for deeper

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:49.369 
athletes race more often for deeper
prize<00:00:48.120> monies<00:00:48.449> is<00:00:48.659> probably<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> way<00:00:49.229> to<00:00:49.260> go

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
prize monies is probably the way to go

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.740 
prize monies is probably the way to go
that's<00:00:49.680> what<00:00:49.799> you<00:00:49.920> see<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.159> other<00:00:50.309> sports

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
there should be no easy prize prize

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.329 
there should be no easy prize prize
checks<00:00:54.089> no<00:00:54.839> easy<00:00:54.989> paydays<00:00:55.470> it's<00:00:55.830> professional

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
best more often and i don't think you do

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
to get a job that's sport I think from a

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.910 
to get a job that's sport I think from a
marketing<00:01:44.999> standpoint<00:01:45.499> there's<00:01:46.499> no<00:01:46.619> point

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
marketing standpoint there's no point

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.590 
marketing standpoint there's no point
having<00:01:47.070> diluted<00:01:47.579> fields<00:01:47.939> for<00:01:48.119> limited<00:01:48.420> prize

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
having diluted fields for limited prize

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.649 
having diluted fields for limited prize
money<00:01:49.460> you<00:01:50.460> know<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.609> think<00:01:50.789> if<00:01:51.119> there's<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
money you know I think if there's the

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.830 
money you know I think if there's the
demand<00:01:52.499> there<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.859> put<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.039> race<00:01:53.249> on<00:01:53.840> which

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
demand there to put a race on which

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.410 
demand there to put a race on which
obviously<00:01:55.079> there<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.499> because<00:01:56.090> you<00:01:57.090> know<00:01:57.179> Iron

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
obviously there is because you know Iron

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.059 
obviously there is because you know Iron

Man and challenge you're adding races
got<00:01:59.509> annually<00:02:00.509> around<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.140> globe<00:02:01.289> and

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
got annually around the globe and

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.569 
got annually around the globe and
they're<00:02:01.560> selling<00:02:01.859> out<00:02:02.009> which<00:02:02.189> means<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
they're selling out which means the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.879 
they're selling out which means the
demand<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.060> there<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.840> think<00:02:03.929> as<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.409> sport<00:02:04.829> we

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:04.889 
demand is there so I think as a sport we

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:06.709 
demand is there so I think as a sport we
need<00:02:05.039> to<00:02:05.159> meet<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.520> demand<00:02:05.700> for<00:02:06.090> sure<00:02:06.240> that

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
need to meet that demand for sure that

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:07.730 
need to meet that demand for sure that
doesn't<00:02:06.899> mean<00:02:07.079> there<00:02:07.200> has<00:02:07.289> to<00:02:07.380> be<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.530> pro

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
doesn't mean there has to be a pro

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.510 
doesn't mean there has to be a pro
category<00:02:08.220> at<00:02:08.310> every<00:02:08.490> race<00:02:08.990> so<00:02:09.990> I<00:02:10.380> think<00:02:10.890> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
category at every race so I think the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.680 
category at every race so I think the
powers-that-be<00:02:11.760> need<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.240> sit<00:02:12.450> down<00:02:12.480> and

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
powers-that-be need to sit down and

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.839 
powers-that-be need to sit down and
maybe<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.500> race<00:02:13.650> directors<00:02:14.129> can<00:02:14.430> bid<00:02:14.610> for<00:02:14.790> it

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
maybe the race directors can bid for it

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.039 
maybe the race directors can bid for it
each<00:02:14.970> year<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.450> know<00:02:15.569> what<00:02:15.659> one<00:02:15.810> year<00:02:15.959> we

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
each year so you know what one year we

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.420 
each year so you know what one year we
don't<00:02:16.200> want<00:02:16.319> to<00:02:16.379> poke<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.739> degree<00:02:16.980> we<00:02:17.220> might

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
don't want to poke a degree we might

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.170 
don't want to poke a degree we might
have<00:02:17.580> some<00:02:17.849> pros

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
have some pros

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.509 
have some pros
come<00:02:18.299> as<00:02:18.420> ambassadors<00:02:18.989> other<00:02:19.590> years<00:02:20.040> yeah<00:02:20.400> we

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
come as ambassadors other years yeah we

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:21.679 
come as ambassadors other years yeah we
think<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.790> adds<00:02:20.909> to<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.150> race<00:02:21.299> by<00:02:21.450> having<00:02:21.629> a

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
think it adds to the race by having a

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:22.880 
think it adds to the race by having a
pro<00:02:21.870> category<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.319> might<00:02:22.439> bring<00:02:22.620> some<00:02:22.680> more

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
pro category it might bring some more

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.809 
pro category it might bring some more
media<00:02:24.140> but<00:02:25.140> as<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.260> sport<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:25.650> think<00:02:25.819> we

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
media but as a sport I think we

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.699 
media but as a sport I think we
certainly<00:02:27.150> need<00:02:27.329> to<00:02:27.450> be<00:02:27.599> more<00:02:28.500> thoughtful

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
certainly need to be more thoughtful

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.559 
certainly need to be more thoughtful
about<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.310> don't<00:02:29.579> it<00:02:29.849> just<00:02:29.909> dilutes<00:02:30.450> the

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
about that I don't it just dilutes the

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.349 
about that I don't it just dilutes the
whole<00:02:30.810> product<00:02:31.519> no<00:02:32.519> one's<00:02:32.700> entitled<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.209> make

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:36.619 
on a great show I mean that's ultimately
when<00:03:35.669> you're<00:03:35.790> talking<00:03:36.060> about<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.449> business

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
when you're talking about the business

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:37.490 
when you're talking about the business
of<00:03:36.870> sport<00:03:37.079> you're<00:03:37.169> talking<00:03:37.379> about

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
of sport you're talking about

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.089 
of sport you're talking about
entertainment<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.430> great<00:03:38.879> racing<00:03:39.329> and<00:03:40.229> like

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
entertainment and great racing and like

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.009 
entertainment and great racing and like
you<00:03:41.609> alluded<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.120> having<00:03:42.479> the<00:03:42.629> biggest<00:03:42.810> names

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
you alluded to having the biggest names

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.960 
you alluded to having the biggest names
race<00:03:43.319> more<00:03:43.590> often<00:03:43.799> for<00:03:43.979> bigger<00:03:44.129> prize<00:03:44.400> purses

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
race more often for bigger prize purses

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.599 
race more often for bigger prize purses
that<00:03:45.150> probably<00:03:45.989> is<00:03:46.139> a<00:03:46.169> solution<00:03:46.530> because<00:03:47.519> I

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
that probably is a solution because I

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.059 
that probably is a solution because I
think<00:03:47.669> that<00:03:48.120> will<00:03:48.269> filter<00:03:48.720> down<00:03:48.949> through<00:03:49.949> the

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
think that will filter down through the

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.679 
think that will filter down through the
rest<00:03:50.220> of<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.430> sport<00:03:52.639> yes<00:03:53.639> a<00:03:53.909> lot<00:03:54.419> of<00:03:54.479> thought

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:54.689 
rest of the sport yes a lot of thought

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:55.969 
rest of the sport yes a lot of thought
needs<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:54.989> go<00:03:55.079> into<00:03:55.229> I'm<00:03:55.409> still<00:03:55.769> not<00:03:55.859> a<00:03:55.919> hundred

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:55.979 
needs to go into I'm still not a hundred

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:57.649 
needs to go into I'm still not a hundred
percent<00:03:56.280> sold<00:03:56.729> on<00:03:56.879> the<00:03:56.970> qualification

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
percent sold on the qualification

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.589 
percent sold on the qualification
process<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.199> the<00:03:58.259> points<00:03:59.180> and<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.359> weight<00:04:00.509> is

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
process and the points and the weight is

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.189 
process and the points and the weight is
because<00:04:01.970> yeah<00:04:02.970> I<00:04:03.000> think<00:04:03.419> with<00:04:03.689> any<00:04:03.810> system

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:04.199 
because yeah I think with any system

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:06.619 
because yeah I think with any system
that<00:04:04.229> you<00:04:04.409> put<00:04:04.560> in<00:04:04.680> play<00:04:05.150> certain<00:04:06.150> scenarios

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
that you put in play certain scenarios

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:07.939 
that you put in play certain scenarios
arise<00:04:06.959> that<00:04:07.229> you<00:04:07.319> never<00:04:07.500> would<00:04:07.769> have<00:04:07.829> thought

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:07.949 
arise that you never would have thought

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.159 
arise that you never would have thought
of<00:04:08.129> until<00:04:08.370> actually<00:04:08.849> and<00:04:09.090> it's<00:04:09.900> a<00:04:09.959> matter<00:04:10.079> of

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
of until actually and it's a matter of

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.199 
of until actually and it's a matter of
troubleshooting<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:11.159> I<00:04:11.459> guess<00:04:11.639> finessing<00:04:12.120> it

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
troubleshooting and I guess finessing it

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.479 
troubleshooting and I guess finessing it
along<00:04:12.419> the<00:04:12.449> way<00:04:12.689> so<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:13.409> think<00:04:14.069> it's<00:04:14.280> always

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
along the way so I think it's always

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.219 
along the way so I think it's always
open<00:04:14.729> for<00:04:15.000> discussion<00:04:15.090> absolutely<00:04:16.019> but<00:04:16.199> I

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
open for discussion absolutely but I

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:17.839 
open for discussion absolutely but I
definitely<00:04:16.500> think<00:04:16.919> what<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.220> suggested<00:04:17.699> is

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
definitely think what you suggested is

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.789 
definitely think what you suggested is
is<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.180> way<00:04:18.299> we<00:04:18.449> need<00:04:18.599> to<00:04:18.659> go<00:04:18.930> at<00:04:19.590> the

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
is the way we need to go at the

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.170 
is the way we need to go at the
professional<00:04:20.280> end<00:04:20.400> of<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.549> sport<00:04:20.849> there's<00:04:21.090> no

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
professional end of the sport there's no

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.830 
professional end of the sport there's no
point<00:04:21.449> having<00:04:22.520> you<00:04:23.520> know<00:04:23.780> just<00:04:24.780> because

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
point having you know just because

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.510 
point having you know just because
there's<00:04:25.169> a<00:04:25.199> hundred<00:04:25.500> races<00:04:25.830> having<00:04:26.039> 100<00:04:26.340> pro

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
there's a hundred races having 100 pro

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.370 
there's a hundred races having 100 pro
fields<00:04:27.000> I<00:04:27.180> don't<00:04:27.360> think<00:04:27.539> we<00:04:27.630> have<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:27.990> numbers

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
fields I don't think we have the numbers

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.070 
fields I don't think we have the numbers
and<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:29.370> quality<00:04:29.580> to<00:04:29.880> sustain<00:04:30.300> a<00:04:30.599> great<00:04:30.900> race

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
and the quality to sustain a great race

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.610 
and the quality to sustain a great race
at<00:04:31.260> each<00:04:31.349> one

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
at each one

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.870 
at each one
those<00:04:32.840> so<00:04:33.889> maybe<00:04:34.889> we<00:04:35.070> need<00:04:35.190> to<00:04:35.220> get<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.520> us<00:04:35.610> more

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
those so maybe we need to get to us more

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.510 
those so maybe we need to get to us more
of<00:04:35.970> a<00:04:36.030> system<00:04:36.389> like<00:04:37.490> what<00:04:38.490> golf<00:04:38.729> has<00:04:38.940> so<00:04:40.520> but

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
of a system like what golf has so but

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.010 
of a system like what golf has so but
anyway<00:04:41.610> always<00:04:42.060> always<00:04:42.300> good<00:04:42.570> to<00:04:42.690> discuss

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
anyway always always good to discuss

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.300 
anyway always always good to discuss
these<00:04:43.229> things<00:04:43.290> and<00:04:43.800> you<00:04:43.919> know<00:04:44.010> there's<00:04:44.220> a<00:04:44.280> lot

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
these things and you know there's a lot

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.040 
these things and you know there's a lot
of<00:04:44.430> people<00:04:44.639> involved<00:04:44.970> in<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.270> sport<00:04:45.360> whether

the sport at heart and will make the

the sport at heart and will make the
right<00:04:54.120> decisions<00:04:54.660> we're<00:04:55.139> just<00:04:55.290> seeing<00:04:55.440> the

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
right decisions we're just seeing the

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.129 
right decisions we're just seeing the
wait<00:04:56.370> wait<00:04:56.729> you<00:04:56.880> I<00:04:56.940> to<00:04:57.000> use<00:04:57.360> structures<00:04:57.810> the

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
wait wait you I to use structures the

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.460 
wait wait you I to use structures the
WTS<00:04:58.830> that<00:04:59.190> just<00:04:59.729> seems<00:05:00.060> like<00:05:00.419> a<00:05:00.479> model<00:05:00.960> that<00:05:01.139> is

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
WTS that just seems like a model that is

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.260 
WTS that just seems like a model that is
work<00:05:01.740> obviously<00:05:02.040> getting<00:05:02.490> in<00:05:02.699> with<00:05:02.880> pursuing

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
work obviously getting in with pursuing

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.390 
work obviously getting in with pursuing
now<00:05:03.960> absolutely<00:05:04.410> I<00:05:04.500> think<00:05:04.530> they've<00:05:05.130> hit

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
now absolutely I think they've hit

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.120 
now absolutely I think they've hit
something<00:05:05.760> I<00:05:05.850> mean<00:05:06.000> those<00:05:06.240> races<00:05:06.720> are<00:05:07.130> super

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
something I mean those races are super

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.350 
something I mean those races are super
competitive<00:05:10.430> always<00:05:11.430> entertaining<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:12.240> good

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
competitive always entertaining and good

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.790 
competitive always entertaining and good
to<00:05:12.479> watch<00:05:12.690> and<00:05:12.840> I<00:05:12.870> think<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.229> flow-on<00:05:13.440> effect

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
to watch and I think the flow-on effect

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.379 
to watch and I think the flow-on effect
is<00:05:13.919> people<00:05:14.190> are<00:05:14.280> interested<00:05:14.729> you<00:05:14.760> direct

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
is people are interested you direct

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.270 
is people are interested you direct
eyeballs<00:05:15.810> towards<00:05:16.199> and<00:05:16.380> then<00:05:16.500> which<00:05:16.889> leads<00:05:17.130> on

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
eyeballs towards and then which leads on

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.580 
eyeballs towards and then which leads on
to<00:05:17.310> other<00:05:17.550> things<00:05:17.780> obviously<00:05:18.780> marketing<00:05:19.289> and

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
to other things obviously marketing and

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.230 
to other things obviously marketing and
sponsorship<00:05:19.710> and<00:05:20.370> and<00:05:20.490> then<00:05:20.910> that<00:05:21.060> money

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
sponsorship and and then that money
