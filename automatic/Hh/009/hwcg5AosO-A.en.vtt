00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.300
This isn't a nice looking car.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.600
I mean it's good looking, but the state it's in... is lacking.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.600
So why are we driving this one?

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.200
Because it's mine, so I don't have to think about the
owners' feelings, when I thrash it.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.679
So this is a Toyota MR2. A bit more, than
163.000 examples were manufactured between

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:53.089
1985-89. This is from 1986, which is before
the facelift of '87, so this is one of the

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.530
originals, the first generation.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.530
It's incredible, how the MR2 feels like a
spaceship, compared to my ancient-feeling

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.320
Peugeot 505. Incredible, because they are
exactly the same age. This is the charm, that

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.150
made the Japanese cars such a hit in the '70s
and even more in the '80s.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:17.150
Believe it or not, the MR2 wasn't meant to
be a sports car. The original goal was to

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.160
make a suburban runabout, comfortable for
two occupants and their bags. However, the

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.860
brief also said it should handle well, so
the engineers decided it should get a mid-engine

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.800
layout, to reach a dynamic balance like no
other car in the class.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.900
Most of the mechanicals came from the Toyota parts-bin.
The trans-axle itself came

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.100
from a front-drive Corolla, or Carina, I don't
even know, and they simply put it back here.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.290
The suspension is a strut from an FWD car
as well, even the steering rods are still

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.000
there, only bolted to the body, and not a
steering rack.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.900
So what makes it special? The way they
put these pieces together. It's really

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.700
more than the sum of it's parts. For example,
everything heavy is between the two axles.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.739
Here, behind the rear axle, there's only an
empty trunk, and the exhaust piping.

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.129
Also here, in front of the front axle, there's
only an empty trunk, and the cooling radiator.

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:34.329
Everything else is in between the four wheels,
even the fuel tank is set up between the two

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.300
passengers, right in the middle of the car.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.109
This is of course a purely analogue sports
car. Every last detail is communicated to

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:57.569
the driver via the steering wheel and the
seat. The car simply talks to you and tells

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.569
you all about what's happening right now,
and what's coming up next. The MR2 isn't all

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:10.430
that quick, not even with 1986 standards,
let alone 2013, but driving it at speed, edging

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.060
towards its limits is a hugely rewarding experience.
You constantly crave to get that corner right,

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.329
to be that little bit faster than last time
out, to push the envelope as they say, and

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:28.329
the MR2 is game for all this. Such a helping
fellow, such a friendly handling companion in

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.269
these endeavors, you cannot really feel any
way other than love it. Really it's such a

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.439
perfect toy, such a perfect lover, I had to
call it my Girl, and think about her as my

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:44.279
mistress, the one I sneak away with in the
twilight hours after work, because it's such

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:47.279
a thrilling ride, every time. 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:51.889
I cannot hope to describe this. Let's try 
and show it to you.

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.310
Ray's Volk wheels with semi-slick rubber,
EBC Yellow Stuff pads clutch the drilled disks,

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.310
and the whole car sits a few centimeters closer
to the ground. This is an MR2 built for the

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.680
track. Let's see, what's what!

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.680
Because of the upgrades to the steering, suspension
and tires, this feels like a different car.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.250
There's a whole lot more bite to the front-end,
and the rear sticks for a lot longer too.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:47.220
The wonderful 4A-GE is close to factory spec
here, and works very well on the track. Even

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:54.099
though the car is worlds faster in the corners,
the original output doesn't feel inadequate,

00:05:54.099 --> 00:06:00.870
on the contrary. So what's this about? Well,
they took the factory chassis setup, and turned

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.860
everything up to 11. It's still usable on
the street, like this, though it's much less

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:13.750
supple and much more of a physical burden
to drive. However here on the closed track,

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.849
this is the peaches. This is getting everything
from the chassis that's in there, and it works.

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:23.539
It's the drivers' turn now, there's
no pointing at the car, if the times are too

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:29.560
slow, it's the drivers' job to get every entry,
every apex and every exit right, and get exactly

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.150
onto the limit of the track and the car, step
by step. And this is such a thrill, such a

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:42.470
ride... of course it'll cost you, a lot too.
But at the other end it's like if you learned

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:51.470
a new language, whole worlds open up, if you
get deep into it. We're pretty lucky to have

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:57.030
safe tracks that are available to this end,
and have the opportunity, to strap in,

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:04.139
and fight for every tenths of a second - with
no-one else, but ourselves. The MR2 is the

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:11.039
perfect mate for this. You can look elsewhere,
there are other solutions, 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:16.180
but the MR2 is just perfect.
