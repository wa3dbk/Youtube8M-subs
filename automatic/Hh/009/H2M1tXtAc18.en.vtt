00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
internet searches and so that they will

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.660 
internet searches and so that they will
obviously<00:01:06.420> be<00:01:06.570> multiplying<00:01:07.320> their<00:01:08.070> figures

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
obviously be multiplying their figures

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.429 
obviously be multiplying their figures
according<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.720> total<00:01:09.960> amount<00:01:10.170> of

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
searches on the internet but it's a

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.880 
searches on the internet but it's a
really<00:01:12.210> useful<00:01:12.420> tool<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.439> figures<00:01:13.740> are

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
really useful tool and a figures are

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.980 
really useful tool and a figures are
fairly<00:01:14.850> relevant<00:01:15.560> so<00:01:16.560> let's<00:01:16.920> start<00:01:17.189> off<00:01:17.400> by

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990
