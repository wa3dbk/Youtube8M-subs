00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
audio DB 651 so these are six and a half

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.540 
audio DB 651 so these are six and a half
inch<00:00:14.820> coaxial<00:00:15.389> speakers<00:00:15.839> that<00:00:16.800> obviously<00:00:17.430> go

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
half inch infinities that are in my

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.650 
half inch infinities that are in my
diamante<00:00:25.439> right<00:00:25.710> now<00:00:26.300> reason<00:00:27.300> I'm<00:00:27.390> replacing

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
diamante right now reason I'm replacing

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.570 
diamante right now reason I'm replacing
them<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.260> they're<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> little<00:00:29.010> bit<00:00:29.279> blown

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
them is that they're a little bit blown

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.150 
them is that they're a little bit blown
or<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.000> guess<00:00:30.300> half<00:00:30.630> blown<00:00:30.929> they<00:00:31.230> seem<00:00:31.980> to

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
or I guess half blown they seem to

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.430 
or I guess half blown they seem to
rattle<00:00:32.550> but<00:00:32.730> still<00:00:33.149> work<00:00:33.420> at<00:00:33.780> high<00:00:33.989> volume

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
rattle but still work at high volume

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
either ways they're half blown so I can

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.750 
either ways they're half blown so I can
replace<00:00:36.360> them<00:00:36.510> with<00:00:36.630> these<00:00:36.719> bulk<00:00:36.989> some

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
my Sony 2 channel amplifier and I guess

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.859 
my Sony 2 channel amplifier and I guess
I'm<00:01:23.040> slowly<00:01:23.310> breaking<00:01:23.610> them<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.030> sorta<00:01:24.540> I'm

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
I'm slowly breaking them in sorta I'm

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.870 
I'm slowly breaking them in sorta I'm
not<00:01:25.020> sure<00:01:25.170> but<00:01:25.369> anyways<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.400> quick
