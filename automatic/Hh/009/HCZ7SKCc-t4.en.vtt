00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
on games are supposed to probably the

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.950

them on the turbo graphics or something
like<00:00:22.509> star<00:00:22.930> /<00:00:23.140> audio<00:00:23.320> or<00:00:23.770> Parvati<00:00:24.009> is<00:00:24.279> it's

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
like star / audio or Parvati is it's

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.970 
like star / audio or Parvati is it's
just<00:00:24.669> a<00:00:24.939> Z<00:00:25.090> any<00:00:25.239> shoot<00:00:25.509> look<00:00:25.750> so<00:00:26.320> anywhere<00:00:26.739> you

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
just a Z any shoot look so anywhere you

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.010 
just a Z any shoot look so anywhere you

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:30.099 
game which is actually quite good

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.330 
game which is actually quite good
especially<00:00:30.610> because<00:00:31.480> it's<00:00:32.470> one<00:00:32.829> of<00:00:32.950> them<00:00:33.070> for

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
especially because it's one of them for

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.340 
especially because it's one of them for
PSP<00:00:33.910> is<00:00:34.120> supposed<00:00:34.480> to<00:00:34.570> be<00:00:34.660> able<00:00:34.780> to<00:00:34.989> play<00:00:35.290> at

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
PSP is supposed to be able to play at

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.140 
PSP is supposed to be able to play at
five<00:00:35.680> minutes<00:00:36.010> on<00:00:36.070> the<00:00:36.160> guana<00:00:36.400> boss<00:00:36.640> this

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
five minutes on the guana boss this

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.580 
five minutes on the guana boss this
actually<00:00:37.600> allows<00:00:37.630> you<00:00:37.930> to<00:00:38.020> see<00:00:38.230> if<00:00:38.320> you<00:00:38.440> have

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
actually allows you to see if you have

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.350 
actually allows you to see if you have
progress<00:00:38.980> in<00:00:39.130> between<00:00:39.370> levels<00:00:39.730> so<00:00:39.970> that's

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
progress in between levels so that's

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.510 
progress in between levels so that's
really<00:00:40.510> good<00:00:40.840> for<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:41.800> shoot<00:00:42.040> move<00:00:42.280> because

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
really good for the shoot move because

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.580 
really good for the shoot move because
sometimes<00:00:43.300> you<00:00:43.540> just<00:00:43.690> can't<00:00:43.810> and<00:00:44.290> it's

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
sometimes you just can't and it's

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.620 
sometimes you just can't and it's
something<00:00:44.740> that<00:00:44.890> I<00:00:45.010> would<00:00:45.550> always<00:00:45.910> prefer<00:00:46.060> so

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
airs on PM's because it's a shoot move

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.279 
airs on PM's because it's a shoot move
but<00:01:43.090> it<00:01:43.210> doesn't<00:01:43.509> take<00:01:43.630> itself<00:01:43.840> too<00:01:44.110> seriously

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
but it doesn't take itself too seriously

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.820 
but it doesn't take itself too seriously
it's<00:01:45.159> just<00:01:45.460> the<00:01:45.610> induct<00:01:46.149> however<00:01:46.899> it<00:01:47.289> clears

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
it's just the induct however it clears

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.590 
it's just the induct however it clears
like<00:01:48.039> a<00:01:48.069> real<00:01:48.340> shoot<00:01:48.610> more<00:01:48.880> it<00:01:49.149> all<00:01:49.420> the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
like a real shoot more it all the

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.969 
like a real shoot more it all the
mechanics<00:01:50.050> are<00:01:50.140> there<00:01:50.319> it<00:01:50.440> works<00:01:50.679> well

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
mechanics are there it works well

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.370 
mechanics are there it works well
controls<00:01:51.940> well<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.479> speed<00:01:52.750> of<00:01:52.899> the<00:01:52.929> hamster

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
controls well the speed of the hamster

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.249 
controls well the speed of the hamster
is<00:01:53.440> really<00:01:53.740> good<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.130> most<00:01:55.030> importantly<00:01:55.750> it's

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
is really good and most importantly it's

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.710 
is really good and most importantly it's
block<00:01:56.679> hard<00:01:57.039> it's<00:01:57.789> one<00:01:58.030> of<00:01:58.060> those<00:01:58.270> you<00:01:58.539> get

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
block hard it's one of those you get

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.020 
block hard it's one of those you get
three<00:01:59.649> pieces<00:01:59.860> of<00:02:00.039> energy<00:02:00.429> in<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:00.610> top<00:02:00.789> left

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
three pieces of energy in the top left

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.520 
three pieces of energy in the top left
corner<00:02:01.330> which<00:02:01.569> basically<00:02:01.899> means<00:02:02.140> you<00:02:02.319> can<00:02:02.440> get

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
corner which basically means you can get

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.889 
corner which basically means you can get
hit<00:02:02.800> three<00:02:03.129> times<00:02:03.399> before<00:02:03.729> you're<00:02:04.060> done<00:02:04.239> once

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
hit three times before you're done once

hit three times before you're done once
you<00:02:05.050> die<00:02:05.259> you<00:02:05.619> use<00:02:05.830> a<00:02:05.860> continued<00:02:06.489> and<00:02:06.700> you<00:02:06.879> get

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
you die you use a continued and you get

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.690 
you die you use a continued and you get
five<00:02:07.300> grunting<00:02:07.720> used<00:02:07.899> Alaska<00:02:08.470> so<00:02:08.950> that's<00:02:09.489> it

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
five grunting used Alaska so that's it

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.850 
five grunting used Alaska so that's it
it's<00:02:10.330> one<00:02:10.660> of<00:02:10.780> those<00:02:10.869> it<00:02:11.200> really<00:02:11.620> is<00:02:11.830> a

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
it's one of those it really is a

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.040 
it's one of those it really is a
hardship<00:02:12.459> move<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:13.000> it's<00:02:13.180> really<00:02:13.690> nice<00:02:13.989> and

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
hardship move and it's really nice and

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.380 
hardship move and it's really nice and
refreshing<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.770> see<00:02:14.800> that<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.580> donor<00:02:16.030> heart
