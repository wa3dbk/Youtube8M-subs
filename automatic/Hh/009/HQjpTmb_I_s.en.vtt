00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.800
 hello to all and humility we find ourselves 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:24.240
 on crash team racing on ps vita 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.700
 so this is a basic psone game and we 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.329
 can play it on the ps vita a ps3 or 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.239
 psp 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:33.259
 so we will immediately discover at 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.259
 what does it look like when we play it 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:49.440
 individual a player is going to be six meters 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:52.640
 so we have enough 8 who is that person 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.640
 we will be able against 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:02.110
 here we are going to take on their the first 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.110
 in three rounds game enough 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.280
 and me 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.540
 if I fall over it's not going to do it 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.410
 Yes 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.500
 breath 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.470
 times no 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.320
 so that's about crash 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.210
 bandicoot you also have a mode 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.840
 battle that is not too bad 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.320
 so it's a game that costs I believe 5 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.010
 euros 1 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.140
 so me who had it on psone to 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.720
 the time I really enjoyed replaying a 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.350
 little bit if you do not know the game 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.820
 it's always fun to discover so 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.990
 that's it for the gameplay of 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.970
 crash team racing 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.740

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.780
