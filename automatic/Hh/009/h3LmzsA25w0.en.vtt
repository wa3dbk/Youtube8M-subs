and then dip my stuff into it that's
really<00:00:06.950> messy<00:00:07.340> well<00:00:08.000> and<00:00:08.960> it's<00:00:09.230> stringy<00:00:09.559> kind

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
really messy well and it's stringy kind

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.539 
really messy well and it's stringy kind
of<00:00:09.980> like<00:00:10.130> them<00:00:11.379> hot<00:00:12.379> glue<00:00:12.709> guns<00:00:12.980> how<00:00:13.429> it

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
of like them hot glue guns how it

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.310 
of like them hot glue guns how it
strings<00:00:13.910> this<00:00:14.269> stuff<00:00:14.450> does<00:00:14.629> the<00:00:14.719> same<00:00:14.959> so

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
strings this stuff does the same so

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.900

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
I'm gonna take a little bit of glue put

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.940 
I'm gonna take a little bit of glue put
it<00:00:21.740> on<00:00:21.890> here<00:00:23.350> normally<00:00:24.350> I<00:00:24.439> do<00:00:24.590> this<00:00:24.710> with<00:00:24.860> the

little glob of glue and then we put the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.530 
little glob of glue and then we put the
big<00:00:30.830> bead<00:00:31.070> on<00:00:31.220> and<00:00:31.550> we<00:00:31.610> push<00:00:31.820> it<00:00:31.970> up<00:00:32.090> against

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
big bead on and we push it up against

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.869 
big bead on and we push it up against
till<00:00:32.989> it<00:00:33.080> hits<00:00:33.170> the<00:00:33.350> paper<00:00:33.559> I<00:00:33.890> don't<00:00:34.730> know<00:00:34.820> if

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
till it hits the paper I don't know if

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.280 
till it hits the paper I don't know if
the<00:00:35.120> camera<00:00:35.450> will<00:00:35.510> pick<00:00:35.690> that<00:00:35.809> up<00:00:35.870> but<00:00:36.110> there's

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
the camera will pick that up but there's

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.049 
the camera will pick that up but there's
a<00:00:36.350> little<00:00:36.680> bead<00:00:36.860> of<00:00:37.100> glue<00:00:37.129> there<00:00:37.699> you<00:00:37.910> don't

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
a little bead of glue there you don't

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:39.310 
a little bead of glue there you don't
want<00:00:38.180> that<00:00:38.510> because<00:00:38.750> it<00:00:39.019> will<00:00:39.110> look<00:00:39.290> like

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
want that because it will look like

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.470 
want that because it will look like
garbage<00:00:40.040> when<00:00:40.400> you<00:00:40.910> got<00:00:41.090> your<00:00:41.210> finished

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480

and then we're going to take this other
bead<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.610> dip<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> glue<00:01:03.199> stringy

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
bead and dip it in the glue stringy

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.999 
bead and dip it in the glue stringy
stringy<00:01:04.440> and<00:01:05.720> then<00:01:06.720> we're<00:01:07.080> going<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:07.740> put

stringy and then we're going to just put

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.010 
stringy and then we're going to just put
that<00:01:08.220> right<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.119> edge<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.509> butt<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.930> up

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
that right on the edge and butt it up

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
that right on the edge and butt it up
against<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:12.470> again<00:01:13.470> there's<00:01:13.680> gonna<00:01:13.770> be<00:01:14.009> a

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
against it again there's gonna be a

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.120 
against it again there's gonna be a
little<00:01:14.280> bit<00:01:14.399> of<00:01:14.750> what<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.869> call<00:01:16.170> glue<00:01:17.159> use<00:01:19.130> and

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
little bit of what I call glue use and

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.030 
little bit of what I call glue use and
you<00:01:20.250> want<00:01:20.399> to<00:01:20.460> get<00:01:20.550> that<00:01:20.670> off<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.880> there

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
you want to get that off of there

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.830 
you want to get that off of there

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
this glue this East 6000 glue if you're

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.520 
this glue this East 6000 glue if you're
not<00:01:24.960> familiar<00:01:25.110> with<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:26.509> it's<00:01:27.509> awesome<00:01:27.780> it'll

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
not familiar with it it's awesome it'll

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.139 
not familiar with it it's awesome it'll
glue<00:01:28.679> just<00:01:28.920> about<00:01:29.100> anything<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.820> will<00:01:29.940> not

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
glue just about anything and it will not

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.050 
glue just about anything and it will not
come<00:01:30.360> apart<00:01:31.100> but<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.340> doesn't<00:01:32.700> completely

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
come apart but it doesn't completely

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.880 
come apart but it doesn't completely
chore<00:01:33.420> for<00:01:33.660> 24<00:01:34.020> hours<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.440> you<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:34.649> have<00:01:34.800> to

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
chore for 24 hours so you just have to

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.419 
chore for 24 hours so you just have to
be<00:01:35.009> kind<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.250> careful<00:01:35.429> with<00:01:35.789> it<00:01:35.970> okay<00:01:37.429> and

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
be kind of careful with it okay and

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:40.100 
be kind of careful with it okay and
we're<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:38.759> gonna<00:01:38.880> finish<00:01:39.210> all<00:01:39.539> four<00:01:39.570> sides

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
we're just gonna finish all four sides

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:56.670 
we're just gonna finish all four sides
like<00:01:40.410> we<00:01:40.530> did<00:01:40.649> the<00:01:40.710> first<00:01:40.770> one

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.340 

on<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.340> bead<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:58.390> smaller<00:01:58.750> one

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:10.550 

the<00:02:03.100> glue<00:02:04.830> stick<00:02:05.830> it<00:02:06.040> on

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.110 

so

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.130 

so<00:02:13.599> now<00:02:13.750> we<00:02:13.810> have<00:02:14.050> all<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.620> handles<00:02:15.099> attached

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
so now we have all the handles attached

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.229 
so now we have all the handles attached
so<00:02:17.140> your<00:02:17.290> scroll<00:02:17.650> now<00:02:17.890> looks<00:02:18.160> like<00:02:18.220> this<00:02:18.580> or

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
so your scroll now looks like this or

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.920 
so your scroll now looks like this or
you<00:02:19.599> know<00:02:19.720> whatever<00:02:19.959> beads<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.650> use<00:02:21.930> they

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
you know whatever beads you use they

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.210 
you know whatever beads you use they
might<00:02:23.110> be<00:02:23.260> different<00:02:23.620> than<00:02:23.739> this<00:02:23.860> but<00:02:23.920> you

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
might be different than this but you

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.589 
might be different than this but you
know<00:02:24.340> it'll<00:02:24.519> you<00:02:24.970> want<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.180> make<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:25.390> look<00:02:25.510> like

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
know it'll you want to make it look like

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.030 
know it'll you want to make it look like
it's<00:02:25.750> got<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:25.900> handle<00:02:26.200> on<00:02:26.319> it<00:02:26.500> which<00:02:26.739> is<00:02:26.769> the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
it's got a handle on it which is the

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.580 
it's got a handle on it which is the
goal<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:28.540> now<00:02:28.660> if<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:28.900> know<00:02:28.989> this<00:02:29.230> is<00:02:29.349> kind<00:02:29.560> of

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
goal so now if you know this is kind of

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.740 
goal so now if you know this is kind of
aged<00:02:29.830> looking<00:02:30.310> it's<00:02:30.459> kind<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.730> brown<00:02:31.000> tinted

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
aged looking it's kind of brown tinted

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.890 
aged looking it's kind of brown tinted
and<00:02:32.379> this<00:02:32.560> is<00:02:32.739> stark<00:02:33.099> white<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:34.510> this<00:02:34.750> is

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
and this is stark white and this is

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.670 
and this is stark white and this is
stark<00:02:35.260> white

stark white

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.860 
stark white

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
in there and you're just basically going

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.840 
in there and you're just basically going
to<00:03:11.100> paint<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.700> scroll<00:03:12.560> not<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.830> printed<00:03:14.520> part

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
to paint the scroll not the printed part

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:21.850

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
don't worry about the splashy look

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.910

because when it dries all that goes away

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:53.510
