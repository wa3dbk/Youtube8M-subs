00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
Pokemon was meant to be for children so

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.160 
Pokemon was meant to be for children so
having<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.840> child<00:01:31.700> protagonist<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.909> better<00:01:33.869> off

like a year yet is kind of making the
older<00:01:41.430> fans<00:01:41.670> very<00:01:42.600> very<00:01:42.869> disappointed<00:01:43.619> in

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
older fans very very disappointed in

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.580 
older fans very very disappointed in
that<00:01:44.119> but<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.299> mean<00:01:45.450> if<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.689> think<00:01:45.720> about<00:01:46.079> it

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
that but I mean if you think about it

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.990 
that but I mean if you think about it
ash<00:01:47.540> there's<00:01:48.540> also<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:49.079> theory<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.530> Ash<00:01:50.000> being

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
ash there's also a theory that Ash being

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.149 
ash there's also a theory that Ash being
ten<00:01:51.329> could<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:51.840> be<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:51.990> label<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.770> what<00:01:52.950> she

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
ten could just be a label and what she

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.859 
ten could just be a label and what she
could<00:01:53.340> actually<00:01:53.549> be<00:01:54.030> older<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:55.200> being<00:01:55.649> ten

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
could actually be older but being ten

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.270 
could actually be older but being ten
technically<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.020> their<00:01:58.259> world<00:01:58.590> could<00:01:59.040> mean

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
technically in their world could mean

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.789 
technically in their world could mean
that<00:01:59.549> he's<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.030> know<00:02:00.060> he's<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.899> teenager<00:02:01.439> he's

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
that he's you know he's a teenager he's

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.459 
that he's you know he's a teenager he's
old<00:02:02.040> enough<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.340> be<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:03.360> know<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:04.020> going<00:02:04.350> off

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
old enough to be you know to going off

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.590 
old enough to be you know to going off
on<00:02:04.500> his<00:02:04.829> own<00:02:05.030> because<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.270> know<00:02:06.360> when<00:02:06.509> you're

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
on his own because you know when you're

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.059 
on his own because you know when you're
ten<00:02:06.840> years<00:02:07.020> old<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.469> you're<00:02:07.560> going<00:02:07.829> on<00:02:07.920> your

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
own journeys without supervision I mean

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.630 
own journeys without supervision I mean
you<00:02:10.020> think<00:02:10.200> about<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.649> like<00:02:10.770> in<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.340> world

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.920 
you think about it like in this world
that<00:02:11.879> would<00:02:11.970> never<00:02:12.209> happen

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
that would never happen

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.440 
that would never happen
but<00:02:13.379> in<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.739> Pokemon<00:02:14.219> world<00:02:14.519> that<00:02:14.849> could<00:02:15.060> happen

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
but in a Pokemon world that could happen

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.819 
but in a Pokemon world that could happen
so<00:02:15.659> in<00:02:16.650> reality<00:02:17.069> he<00:02:17.640> has<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.969> be<00:02:18.090> at<00:02:18.180> least<00:02:18.239> like

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
so in reality he has to be at least like

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.349 
so in reality he has to be at least like
1415<00:02:19.829> years<00:02:20.069> old<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.549> mean<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:20.849> seems<00:02:21.150> most

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359 
1415 years old I mean that seems most

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.559 
1415 years old I mean that seems most
reasonable<00:02:22.049> to<00:02:22.230> me<00:02:22.489> that<00:02:23.489> he<00:02:23.640> at<00:02:23.730> least<00:02:23.760> has

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
reasonable to me that he at least has

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.860 
reasonable to me that he at least has
gained<00:02:25.099> several<00:02:26.099> years<00:02:26.579> into<00:02:27.450> his<00:02:27.689> life<00:02:28.639> since

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
gained several years into his life since

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.740 
gained several years into his life since
in<00:02:30.870> turning<00:02:31.290> 10<00:02:31.530> in<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.829> first<00:02:32.040> episode<00:02:32.750> or

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
in turning 10 in the first episode or

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.940 
in turning 10 in the first episode or
being<00:02:34.319> 10<00:02:34.739> since<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.579> first<00:02:35.790> episode<00:02:36.049> so<00:02:37.049> it

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
being 10 since the first episode so it

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.729 
being 10 since the first episode so it
just<00:02:38.159> seems<00:02:38.340> reasonable<00:02:38.879> for<00:02:38.909> me<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.439> that<00:02:40.439> he

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
just seems reasonable for me to that he

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.649 
just seems reasonable for me to that he
would<00:02:40.980> be<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.760> higher<00:02:43.189> age<00:02:44.189> a<00:02:44.970> lot<00:02:45.209> you<00:02:45.510> know

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
would be of higher age a lot you know

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.009 
would be of higher age a lot you know
older<00:02:46.139> so<00:02:47.129> I<00:02:47.430> mean<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:48.120> me<00:02:48.269> it<00:02:48.419> still<00:02:48.659> seems

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
older so I mean to me it still seems

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.520 
older so I mean to me it still seems
unnatural<00:02:49.829> that<00:02:49.950> he's<00:02:50.099> still<00:02:50.459> just<00:02:51.450> 10<00:02:52.319> years

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
unnatural that he's still just 10 years

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.649 
unnatural that he's still just 10 years
old<00:02:52.739> I<00:02:52.919> mean<00:02:53.040> he<00:02:53.129> has<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.370> be<00:02:53.700> he<00:02:54.359> has<00:02:54.480> to

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
old I mean he has to be he has to

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.330 
old I mean he has to be he has to
eventually<00:02:54.840> age<00:02:55.290> in<00:02:55.530> my<00:02:55.650> opinion<00:02:56.069> that<00:02:56.099> they

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
eventually age in my opinion that they

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.610 
eventually age in my opinion that they
should<00:02:56.579> have<00:02:56.819> eventually<00:02:57.150> an<00:02:57.450> episode<00:02:57.900> like

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
should have eventually an episode like

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.559 
should have eventually an episode like
where<00:02:58.859> he<00:02:59.069> has<00:02:59.189> an<00:02:59.370> episode<00:02:59.459> where<00:02:59.849> he<00:03:00.000> has<00:03:00.329> an

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
where he has an episode where he has an

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.619 
where he has an episode where he has an
actual<00:03:00.719> birthday<00:03:01.409> and<00:03:01.730> he's<00:03:02.730> officially<00:03:03.150> 11

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
actual birthday and he's officially 11

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.119 
actual birthday and he's officially 11
maybe<00:03:03.810> they<00:03:04.049> could<00:03:04.200> actually<00:03:04.409> make<00:03:04.859> an

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
maybe they could actually make an

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.159 
maybe they could actually make an
episode<00:03:05.489> where<00:03:05.909> they<00:03:06.060> show<00:03:06.269> he's<00:03:06.540> 11<00:03:06.930> so<00:03:07.049> at

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.169 
episode where they show he's 11 so at

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.589 
episode where they show he's 11 so at
least<00:03:07.290> they<00:03:07.829> can<00:03:07.859> make<00:03:08.159> some<00:03:08.700> people<00:03:08.819> like

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
least they can make some people like

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.190 
least they can make some people like
especially<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.200> older<00:03:10.909> fanbase<00:03:11.909> that<00:03:12.209> he<00:03:12.959> is

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
especially the older fanbase that he is

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.280 
especially the older fanbase that he is
aging<00:03:13.859> you<00:03:14.400> know<00:03:14.519> like<00:03:14.819> and<00:03:15.090> he<00:03:15.239> will<00:03:15.719> age<00:03:15.989> and

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
aging you know like and he will age and

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.530 
aging you know like and he will age and
he's<00:03:16.439> now<00:03:16.590> 11<00:03:17.099> but<00:03:17.250> then<00:03:17.370> they<00:03:17.519> bring<00:03:18.269> up<00:03:18.449> a

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
he's now 11 but then they bring up a

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.879 
he's now 11 but then they bring up a
whole<00:03:18.690> bunch<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:18.959> other<00:03:19.139> theories<00:03:19.440> saying

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
whole bunch of other theories saying

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.500 
whole bunch of other theories saying
like<00:03:20.129> oh<00:03:20.310> it's<00:03:20.849> gonna<00:03:20.940> be<00:03:21.090> like<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.269> whole

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
like oh it's gonna be like a whole

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.990 
like oh it's gonna be like a whole
another<00:03:21.569> 17<00:03:22.349> seasons<00:03:22.590> till<00:03:23.010> he<00:03:23.099> turns<00:03:23.340> 12<00:03:23.729> you

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
another 17 seasons till he turns 12 you

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.759 
another 17 seasons till he turns 12 you
know<00:03:24.030> so<00:03:24.750> I<00:03:24.780> don't<00:03:25.169> know<00:03:25.260> but<00:03:25.409> that<00:03:25.560> will<00:03:25.650> be<00:03:25.739> a

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
know so I don't know but that will be a

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.020 
know so I don't know but that will be a
whole<00:03:26.220> long<00:03:26.760> time<00:03:27.090> but<00:03:28.019> I<00:03:28.049> feel<00:03:28.620> like<00:03:29.030> they

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
whole long time but I feel like they

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.729 
whole long time but I feel like they
should<00:03:30.060> eventually<00:03:30.569> have<00:03:30.959> him<00:03:31.079> age<00:03:31.290> but<00:03:31.530> that

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
should eventually have him age but that

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.000 
should eventually have him age but that
would<00:03:31.859> probably<00:03:31.889> be<00:03:32.310> really<00:03:32.370> hard<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:33.030> can

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
would probably be really hard you can

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.000 
would probably be really hard you can
considering<00:03:35.010> that<00:03:35.669> ash<00:03:36.120> has<00:03:36.599> only<00:03:37.169> had<00:03:37.470> ever

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
considering that ash has only had ever

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.520 
considering that ash has only had ever
had<00:03:39.590> about<00:03:40.590> 17<00:03:41.489> seasons<00:03:41.790> worth<00:03:42.479> of<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:43.379> know

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
had about 17 seasons worth of you know

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.479 
had about 17 seasons worth of you know
just<00:03:44.430> time<00:03:45.060> passing<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:46.109> the<00:03:46.799> fact<00:03:47.099> that<00:03:47.220> that

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
just time passing and the fact that that

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.909 
just time passing and the fact that that
it<00:03:47.609> took<00:03:47.849> so<00:03:48.090> long<00:03:48.329> I<00:03:48.689> mean<00:03:48.900> making<00:03:49.259> him<00:03:49.590> age

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
it took so long I mean making him age

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.819 
it took so long I mean making him age
now<00:03:50.310> would<00:03:51.120> just<00:03:51.150> not<00:03:51.659> really<00:03:51.930> make<00:03:52.139> sense<00:03:52.500> in

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
now would just not really make sense in

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.770 
now would just not really make sense in
terms<00:03:53.519> that<00:03:53.639> they<00:03:53.879> will<00:03:54.030> have<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.359> do<00:03:54.509> some

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
terms that they will have to do some

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.580 
terms that they will have to do some
major<00:03:56.239> changing<00:03:57.239> about<00:03:57.449> that<00:03:57.750> in<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.169> future

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
major changing about that in the future

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.429 
major changing about that in the future
and<00:03:58.889> it<00:03:59.609> would<00:03:59.790> kind<00:04:00.299> of<00:04:00.359> mess<00:04:00.419> up<00:04:00.599> because

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 
and it would kind of mess up because

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:02.929 
and it would kind of mess up because
then<00:04:01.680> they<00:04:01.799> would<00:04:01.949> have<00:04:02.069> to<00:04:02.189> be<00:04:02.310> like<00:04:02.430> oh<00:04:02.639> now

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939 
then they would have to be like oh now

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.259 
then they would have to be like oh now
we<00:04:03.930> have<00:04:04.139> to<00:04:04.290> make<00:04:04.409> another<00:04:04.769> 17<00:04:05.370> season<00:04:05.909> before

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
we have to make another 17 season before

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.140 
we have to make another 17 season before
making<00:04:06.750> 12<00:04:07.019> again<00:04:07.319> or<00:04:07.500> make<00:04:08.159> another<00:04:08.609> several

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
making 12 again or make another several

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.479 
making 12 again or make another several
seasons<00:04:09.449> before<00:04:09.840> even<00:04:10.290> it's<00:04:10.650> like<00:04:10.889> you<00:04:11.370> know

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
seasons before even it's like you know

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.849 
seasons before even it's like you know
maybe<00:04:12.180> they'll<00:04:12.449> speed<00:04:12.750> up<00:04:12.870> time<00:04:13.109> perhaps<00:04:13.530> but

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
maybe they'll speed up time perhaps but

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:17.149 
maybe they'll speed up time perhaps but
yet<00:04:14.220> again<00:04:14.340> that<00:04:15.120> would<00:04:15.329> be<00:04:15.540> really<00:04:16.169> confusing

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:17.159 
yet again that would be really confusing

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:21.890 
yet again that would be really confusing
to<00:04:17.699> the<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:19.079> pretty<00:04:19.500> much<00:04:19.590> everybody<00:04:20.190> so<00:04:20.900> him

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
to the to pretty much everybody so him

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.110 
to the to pretty much everybody so him
aging<00:04:22.560> is<00:04:22.740> also<00:04:23.279> something<00:04:23.669> that<00:04:23.820> would<00:04:24.029> be

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
aging is also something that would be

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.029 
aging is also something that would be
hard<00:04:24.450> to<00:04:24.539> do<00:04:24.810> for<00:04:25.020> them

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
hard to do for them

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:29.240 
hard to do for them
so<00:04:26.580> but<00:04:27.090> in<00:04:27.630> terms<00:04:27.990> of<00:04:28.199> aging<00:04:28.470> if<00:04:28.889> he<00:04:29.069> never

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
so but in terms of aging if he never

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.719 
so but in terms of aging if he never
ages<00:04:29.850> though<00:04:30.090> I<00:04:30.330> mean<00:04:30.960> he<00:04:31.470> could<00:04:31.680> never<00:04:31.860> grow

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
ages though I mean he could never grow

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.990 
ages though I mean he could never grow
in<00:04:33.180> terms<00:04:33.449> of<00:04:33.840> like<00:04:34.050> it's<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:34.889> pokemon<00:04:35.490> is<00:04:35.699> also

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.159 
in terms of like it's a pokemon is also
kind<00:04:36.210> of<00:04:36.240> a<00:04:36.360> show<00:04:36.509> where<00:04:36.750> it<00:04:36.810> kind<00:04:36.960> of<00:04:36.990> teaches

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.909 
really really hard to work with I think
for<00:05:14.009> them<00:05:14.099> in<00:05:14.400> my<00:05:15.030> opinion<00:05:15.330> and<00:05:15.720> so<00:05:16.590> I<00:05:16.620> mean
