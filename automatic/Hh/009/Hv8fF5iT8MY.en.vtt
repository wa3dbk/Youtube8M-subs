00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
also there is a financial issue

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.219 
also there is a financial issue
companies<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.340> use<00:01:47.850> pesticides<00:01:48.750> they

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
companies that use pesticides they

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.810 
companies that use pesticides they
wonder<00:01:49.560> why<00:01:49.710> their<00:01:49.979> crop<00:01:50.189> yields<00:01:50.520> are<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:50.670> low

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
wonder why their crop yields are so low

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.660 
wonder why their crop yields are so low
why<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.570> workers<00:01:52.049> are<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.350> unhealthy<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.220> why

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
why the workers are so unhealthy and why

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.359 
why the workers are so unhealthy and why
there<00:01:53.909> aren't<00:01:54.090> making<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:54.659> much<00:01:54.810> money<00:01:55.369> they

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
there aren't making so much money they

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.219 
there aren't making so much money they
do<00:01:56.430> not<00:01:56.670> realize<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.570> effects<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:58.020> pesticides

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
do not realize the effects of pesticides

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.770 
do not realize the effects of pesticides
are<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.490> connection<00:01:59.880> between<00:02:00.000> pesticides

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
are the connection between pesticides

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.940 
are the connection between pesticides
and<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:02.670> lack<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.180> crop<00:02:03.750> yield<00:02:04.020> but<00:02:04.680> there<00:02:04.829> is

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
and the lack of crop yield but there is

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.190 
and the lack of crop yield but there is
a<00:02:04.979> solution<00:02:05.600> it<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.840> organic<00:02:07.770> cotton

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.150 

then<00:02:14.580> organic<00:02:15.580> cotton<00:02:16.770> connects<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.920> gaps

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
then organic cotton connects the gaps

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.880 
then organic cotton connects the gaps
between<00:02:19.680> production<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:21.130> assume<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:23.380> solves

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
between production I assume it solves

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.280 
between production I assume it solves
the<00:02:24.040> issues<00:02:24.430> with<00:02:25.180> its<00:02:25.360> strong<00:02:25.690> muscles<00:02:26.170> and

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
the issues with its strong muscles and

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.490 
the issues with its strong muscles and
sustainability<00:02:27.099> and<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.870> look<00:02:29.050> awesome<00:02:29.230> in

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
sustainability and you look awesome in

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.309 
sustainability and you look awesome in
it<00:02:29.590> too<00:02:29.800> it<00:02:30.700> empowers<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:31.300> it<00:02:31.510> feeds<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.170> soil

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
it too it empowers you it feeds the soil
