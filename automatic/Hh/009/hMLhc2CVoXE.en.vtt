00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 speak it guys and beauty games here 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.109
 today bringing another video for you and 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.019
 today I want to show the way that made me 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.410
 hope again in the way of 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.500
 gta5 this motto here gives you a taste of 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.580
 as if we could control a 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.760
 two tricks of gta but sg already exists mode 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.340
 that we can control ufos yes already 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.160
 had but he was just a skin and yet 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.009
 we controlled the hydra and you should already 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.669
 have noticed I do not usually bring molds 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.170
 of the channel 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.360
 that's because I'm not enjoying 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.030
 Lately most of these templates 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.950
 Exit from James are really cool, I guess. 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.379
 not worth doing video not 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.579
 Most of them are silly but this one I 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.950
 really liked 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.590
 I do not know how his creator got it. 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.270
 but it's impressive 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.460
 I'm going to tell you to mold yourself to what's up 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.430
 seeming to be official, we already controlled 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.949
 the same was a corner before 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.590
 and it's so fucking look that we can only call 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.080
 the egg or typing we can abduct the 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.360
 people and cars when we enter it 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.270
 It disappears not appear within 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.729
 or have reported inside 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.890
 ufo with golden shine know type 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.560
 giving a touch of alien technology 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.710
 With a lot of fucking guy over there, we can 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.700
 shoot a type of lightning that explodes a 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.580
 thing like that 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.580
 carmody really is very good with just 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.939
 a problem sometimes it causes 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.799
 falls and frame knows but does not happen 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.500
 much more happens 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:39.329
 Congratulations to the creator and I also want 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.159
