00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
producer anyway it's got this kind of

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.400 
producer anyway it's got this kind of
like<00:00:40.920> repetitive<00:00:41.780> sound<00:00:42.780> it's<00:00:43.110> kind<00:00:43.290> of

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
like repetitive sound it's kind of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.060 
like repetitive sound it's kind of
hammered<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.980> little<00:00:44.010> bit<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:45.140> let's<00:00:46.140> look<00:00:46.950> at

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
hammered a little bit and let's look at

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.590 
hammered a little bit and let's look at
that<00:00:47.190> bowing<00:00:47.610> just<00:00:47.820> on<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.000> open<00:00:48.239> strings

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
that bowing just on the open strings

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.510 
that bowing just on the open strings
first<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.230> it's<00:00:49.350> right<00:00:49.739> at<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.920> lower<00:00:50.190> half

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
first and it's right at the lower half

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.799 
first and it's right at the lower half
of<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.700> bow<00:00:50.850> get<00:00:51.059> really<00:00:51.360> close<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
of the bow get really close to the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.810 
of the bow get really close to the
camera<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.350> see<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.039> pretty

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
camera so you can see this and pretty

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:08.320 
camera so you can see this and pretty
close<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.020> bridge<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:58.760> little<00:00:59.760> slower<00:01:06.619> and

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
close to the bridge a little slower and

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.550 
close to the bridge a little slower and
nothing<00:01:09.330> too<00:01:09.450> hard<00:01:09.659> about<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:10.080> you'll

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
nothing too hard about that you'll

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.050 
nothing too hard about that you'll
notice<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.979> put<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.189> couple<00:01:11.460> accents<00:01:11.939> in

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
notice that I put a couple accents in

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.380 
notice that I put a couple accents in
the<00:01:12.150> parts<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:13.320> kind<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.590> help<00:01:14.159> give<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.760> some

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the parts to kind of help give you some

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.050 
the parts to kind of help give you some
direction<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:16.710> then<00:01:17.100> let's<00:01:17.610> talk<00:01:17.759> about<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
direction and then let's talk about the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.830 
direction and then let's talk about the
left<00:01:18.270> hand<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:19.070> it<00:01:20.070> depends<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:20.610> how<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.570> like

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
left hand so it depends on how you like

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.510 
left hand so it depends on how you like
to<00:01:21.869> set<00:01:22.110> yourself<00:01:22.229> up<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:23.070> let's<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.369> do

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
to set yourself up but let's just do

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.290 
to set yourself up but let's just do
this<00:01:23.700> walk<00:01:23.939> up<00:01:24.119> with<00:01:24.330> me<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.720> D<00:01:26.180> d1

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
this walk up with me on D d1

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.070 
this walk up with me on D d1
and<00:01:28.810> then<00:01:28.900> a<00:01:28.930> to<00:01:30.300> that<00:01:31.300> low<00:01:31.480> two<00:01:31.540> on<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:31.930> D

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
and then a to that low two on the D

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.880 
and then a to that low two on the D
string<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.560> then<00:01:32.890> reach<00:01:33.610> over<00:01:34.680> your<00:01:35.680> first

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
string and then reach over your first

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.710 
string and then reach over your first
finger<00:01:36.190> onto<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.580> g<00:01:36.820> string<00:01:37.180> and<00:01:37.210> then<00:01:37.600> we'll

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
finger onto the g string and then we'll

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.360 
finger onto the g string and then we'll
just<00:01:37.870> kind<00:01:38.080> of<00:01:38.140> touch<00:01:38.350> them<00:01:38.560> together<00:01:38.740> and<00:01:39.220> it

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
just kind of touch them together and it

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.030 
just kind of touch them together and it
should<00:01:39.580> be<00:01:39.700> pretty<00:01:39.850> close<00:01:40.120> at<00:01:40.330> that<00:01:40.450> point

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
should be pretty close at that point

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.340 
should be pretty close at that point
they<00:01:42.040> worked<00:01:42.880> for<00:01:43.060> me<00:01:43.120> might<00:01:44.020> take<00:01:44.200> you<00:01:44.320> a

they worked for me might take you a

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.820 
they worked for me might take you a
couple<00:01:44.410> times<00:01:44.770> so<00:01:45.330> at<00:01:46.330> that<00:01:46.660> point<00:01:46.930> leave<00:01:47.680> them

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
couple times so at that point leave them

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.010 
couple times so at that point leave them
on<00:01:47.950> don't<00:01:48.550> don't<00:01:48.940> take<00:01:49.120> them<00:01:49.240> off<00:01:49.330> this<00:01:49.780> is

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
on don't don't take them off this is

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.690

simple if you leave it on so we have the
one<00:01:54.160> and<00:01:54.190> two<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.740> then<00:01:57.310> all<00:01:57.730> we're<00:01:58.030> gonna<00:01:58.150> do

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
one and two and then all we're gonna do

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.780 
one and two and then all we're gonna do
is<00:01:58.360> add<00:01:58.690> the<00:01:58.930> three<00:01:59.490> which<00:02:00.490> is<00:02:00.610> halfway

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
is add the three which is halfway

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:07.230 
is add the three which is halfway
through<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.270> first<00:02:01.420> bar<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.790> just<00:02:06.970> do<00:02:07.060> that<00:02:07.180> a

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
through the first bar so just do that a

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.139 
through the first bar so just do that a
couple<00:02:07.300> times<00:02:07.540> where<00:02:07.990> you<00:02:08.080> play<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.940> then<00:02:10.060> the
