00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.130
 alexander hello this is the next hero 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.770
 in my dresses helmet leaves helmet 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.530
 Series a needs the words right out 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.450
 get the spinal cord out 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.639
 That's a hybrid here 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.619
 the hard shell like me and the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:22.230
 hard core like me here you are 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.869
 youtube stupid comments to make it 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.869
 easy as a bit out and about 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.750
 sluggish but this clearly heavier the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.110
 weighs about 350 grams what to write 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.180
 360 or something like that weighs about 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.040
 350 360 degrees 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.050
 through this hard shell is as at 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.480
 Robust can then do ground times 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.950
 no problem over it and I scrub 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.559
 guess if you look at the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.489
 hand out blues on the floor without too much 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.699
 damage from exactly fits perfectly 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.180
 but has the money behind me what I 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.010
 not ideal and find even the one 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.350
 history is he doing so fast 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.080
 but these three things I find him 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.970
 better but I will not show you what to me 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.710
 like 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.659
 that can be great for her 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.290
 actually sits pretty much right here 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.810
 ahead 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.380
 fact is that we here under deck 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.259
 go here 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.390
 maybe that's cool for one 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.950
 but for the other, I have to bother 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.380
 for example, always sunglasses on here 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.750
 handle and that would be for me 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.930
 nothing but look at you 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.090
 otherwise I think of aldi helmet 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.270
 I have had in my hand so far 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.640
 makes you look qualitatively best 14 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.049
 Price and I had a few helm now 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.049
 held your nose and me 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:44.280
 You spit on the shop and order 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.590
 something resourceful what hath so on for money 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.689
 but he sits properly looks only 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.490
 whether this deep like her something for you 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.840
 it reminds me a little bit like that 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.530
 a skateboard or snowboard helmets 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.689
 otherwise perfect 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.380
 There is nothing more to say to her 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.380
 you can look 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.899
 also sees the ventilation openings here 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.899
 now we see us the next zoom
