00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:07.519
 so again all the good time of the day 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.679
 you and me again 6 fabric and we like 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:13.139
 fulfillment of requests for video on requests 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.219
 workers yes that is and workers that 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.439
 said they said 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.750
 and you published it as samsung 9 900 x 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.550
 a triad like this but it's called 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.250
 new samsung carton number 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.859
 superfast and things like that if arthur 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.410
 and long-running overtakes macbook air by 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.960
 boot and stuff like that but principle 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.850
 such a phrase was thrown windows when 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.760
 showed to stop she still can not 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.390
 work and continues there thinking about 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.790
 something 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.100
 but the macbook is there or the magician 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.520
 loaded immediately up to 100 shows and 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.660
 similar to me here is old 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.760
 macbook and macbook quarrel mac mini 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.309
 here 1 and 4 gigahertz processor 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.149
 gigabytes of memory 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:03.390
 Production time for 2007 is similar. 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.049
 it has a relative me see it 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.310
 mpi sea-doo while so it was called this 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:13.979
 what's called fujitsu lifebook if 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.330
 I can not see here I do not know how she is 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.070
 It's dark and life is probably closing 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.890
 sue 810 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.210
 that is, all together this is a world of devices 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.310
 which I have left from passed 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.850
 there is generally 800 megahertz here 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.810
 processor and one gigabyte of memory 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.150
 the beauty of it is that it is 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.150
 touchscreen yes you can do it like this 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.979
 here it has a stylus in general, all that 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.439
 i really need them so far 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.649
 use and life time at six o'clock 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.360
 no external devices are justified yes 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.130
 that is, its very convenient by the way 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.680
 Iâ€™m interested in recruiting 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.720
 I tell you about this device that's because he's 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.170
 i fit like 6 inch early 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.360
 such is the intermediate generation and so 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.149
 the challenge of our test is how you performed 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.399
 requests was very simple igor take 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.910
 please fend off you see me 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.069
 in the window there turn on the one and see another 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.270
 who is faster i will do that 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.290
 i am taking now 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:20.940
 and here I have a switch and then I find 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.070
 switch mage is not in the subway button is not 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.020
 it's so easy to climb mac mini 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.570
 and on account of 3, our head will not turn up 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.570
 nothing 1 2 3 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:37.800
 and this is not included it included will 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.460
 a small forum for a couple of seconds but in 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.480
 principle, yes, we see how 1 starts as 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.640
 starts second 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.120
 By the way there is very much memory checking already 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.630
 late already checked here I started it myself 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.630
 cancel 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.790
 waiting until the first star can not we see 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:01.140
 how is the windows loading we see 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:06.000
 running wheel to mind to here such 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.960
 here they all run together we see that 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.870
 windows 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.920
 already started by the way there is windows 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.940
 7 home 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.940
 not even a starter to a fake home premium 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.820
 ultimate I turned on the lagoon there 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.770
 the second one is gonna be my mother on mac mini 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:32.580
 also of the lagoon here we see please 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:35.040
 rate and now let's see who is who 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:39.560
 here already welcome screen went who not 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:43.260
 sees yes that is like windows and 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:48.959
 respectively that here and poppy here 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:53.040
 together they load again remind 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:55.410
 there 1 and 4 here are 800 megahertz and here about 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.350
 welcome screen pay attention at all 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.310
 already appeared see if we clicked 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.860
 windows button 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.970
 we can press the windows button 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:12.240
 windows immediately clicked yes already this 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:14.790
 not the same takmak mark appeared 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.600
 bottom panel on the top as you see it 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:21.000
 not yet now we will drive off a little bit 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.730
 the top menu with the start he's after all 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.990
 see here it appeared and now we are so 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.569
 For the sake of experiment, we also press start 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.270
 clicked on 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:33.460
 him and again trying to work on 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.029
 I showed at this time trying to run 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:41.080
 kinds of microsoft internet explorer 

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:43.629
 I run it and we see that it 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:48.360
 works we go back run here 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:53.889
 Safari downstairs then I could see it clicked and 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.839
 and not one or the other does not look here 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.659
 here here 

00:04:54.839 --> 00:05:00.490
 completely like an old misfortune 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:02.199
 some this then it continues 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.999
 rampant if you look 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.999
 Please note I have facebook 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:11.680
 about started and here is still still 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:14.559
 the ball is spinning the ball is spinning 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:21.249
 that just fell off pressing a button 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:22.839
 start now we press safari and wait 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:29.669
 we wait 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:35.439
 and that's just starting a safari 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:37.300
 cycles and so we see who spoke 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:41.099
 that windows are so heavy 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:44.619
 device you can spit on his face 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:47.139
 as you saw only 100 windows 7 800 

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:50.889
 megahertz is new gigabyte 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:53.039
 memory on an old netbook again 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:06:00.309
 I will repeat it 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:06:03.719
 fuji lifebook you 810 did so 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:07.449

 Thank you for comparing windows 7 

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:23.469
 and mac os x on download speed on 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:25.889
