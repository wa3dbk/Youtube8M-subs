of the new leather same with the corners
they're<00:02:27.769> missing<00:02:28.159> so<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.370> have<00:02:28.459> to<00:02:28.549> put<00:02:28.700> on<00:02:28.790> new

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:28.939 
they're missing so I have to put on new

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.439 
the edge of the cloth and it's a shame

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.869 
the edge of the cloth and it's a shame
because<00:02:36.439> we<00:02:36.980> still<00:02:37.189> could<00:02:37.370> have<00:02:37.459> had<00:02:37.640> our

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
because we still could have had our

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.569 
because we still could have had our
original<00:02:38.000> leather<00:02:38.659> and<00:02:39.650> do<00:02:39.769> a<00:02:39.799> proper<00:02:40.099> reback

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
original leather and do a proper reback

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.000 
original leather and do a proper reback
and<00:02:40.849> there<00:02:40.939> probably<00:02:41.120> was<00:02:42.019> an<00:02:42.260> original<00:02:42.680> spine

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
and there probably was an original spine

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.699 
and there probably was an original spine
-<00:02:43.340> that's<00:02:43.639> melted<00:02:44.569> in<00:02:44.690> here<00:02:44.930> that's<00:02:45.170> gone<00:02:45.500> as

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
- that's melted in here that's gone as

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.170 
- that's melted in here that's gone as
well<00:02:45.920> but<00:02:46.819> to<00:02:47.060> make<00:02:47.209> matters<00:02:47.359> worse<00:02:47.769> they<00:02:48.769> put

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
well but to make matters worse they put

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.210 
well but to make matters worse they put
about<00:02:50.180> three<00:02:50.450> layers<00:02:50.629> of<00:02:50.870> masking<00:02:51.739> tape<00:02:51.799> on

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
about three layers of masking tape on

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.879 
about three layers of masking tape on
the<00:02:52.579> hinge<00:02:52.849> and<00:02:53.239> then<00:02:54.079> to<00:02:54.260> make<00:02:54.409> matters<00:02:54.769> even

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:54.889 
the hinge and then to make matters even

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:59.020 
the hinge and then to make matters even
worse<00:02:55.099> they<00:02:55.700> used<00:02:56.349> library<00:02:57.349> tape<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.790> more

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
worse they used library tape and more

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.280 
worse they used library tape and more
masking<00:02:59.540> tape<00:02:59.780> to<00:03:00.430> glue<00:03:01.430> this<00:03:01.700> together<00:03:02.629> so<00:03:03.260> I

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
masking tape to glue this together so I

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.559 
masking tape to glue this together so I
have<00:03:03.829> to<00:03:03.950> go<00:03:04.069> in<00:03:04.250> with<00:03:04.489> chemicals<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.329> lift

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
have to go in with chemicals and lift

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.740 
have to go in with chemicals and lift
this<00:03:06.519> these<00:03:07.519> two<00:03:07.790> layers<00:03:08.030> of<00:03:08.329> tape<00:03:08.510> but<00:03:08.689> you

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
this these two layers of tape but you

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.020 
this these two layers of tape but you
can<00:03:08.959> see<00:03:09.200> how<00:03:09.439> that's<00:03:09.650> an<00:03:09.769> improper<00:03:10.069> method<00:03:10.819> of

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
can see how that's an improper method of

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.949 
can see how that's an improper method of
free<00:03:11.599> hinging<00:03:11.840> a<00:03:12.139> book<00:03:12.879> it's<00:03:13.879> just<00:03:14.030> all<00:03:14.750> it

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
free hinging a book it's just all it
