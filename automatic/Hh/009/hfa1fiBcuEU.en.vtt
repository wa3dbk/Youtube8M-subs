00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.830
 hello my name is alexander 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.810
 I am a swimming coach for the planet club 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.840
 fitness today we will talk 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.579
 about swimming about the right technique and how 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.610
 usually occurs on teaching for what 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.610
 methodology 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.449
 when the swimmer moves in the water 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:38.220
 body must be balanced 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.500
 streamlined and the angle of attack should be 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.739
 about 35 degrees and so what 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.489
 it was so angle of attack is the angle between 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.070
 water surface and 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.409
 swimmer's body, respectively, less than 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.710
 angle of attack of the flow body over the 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:54.449
 less resistance and man evils not 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.070
 exerting great effort swim the lobules 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.650
 quickly that is more professional 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.710
 more technically very important to do so 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.839
 son while learning to breathe swimming 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.159
 specific breathing she is 3 phase 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:10.590
 the first breath is done the mouth is minimal 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.860
 delay and exhale goes nose water 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.799
 inhale we breathe out quickly but deeply 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.950
 long uniform many people breathe 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.170
 wrap air in your nose and so here 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.079
 you need to check it that did not take 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.329
 the air is there and fast complexity yet 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:27.869
 inhalation align hands movements 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.710
 and feet 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.210
 since during the movement of the swimmer in the water 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.789
 a lot of oxygen goes to work 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.569
 muscles and also to warm the body water 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:41.640
 because the heat capacity of water is higher part 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:44.009
 was south of the air important to make out 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.409
 crawl footwork should pace up ulki 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.479
 high and small amplitude we are not 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.670
 should dig deep deep 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.210
 water but did not come to hard to raise 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.549
 swimmer 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.409
 hips to keep closer to the surface of the water 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.710
 movement comes from the hip first 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.110
 run thigh and then 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.520
 I am catching up with his ankle that is in 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.369
 knee joint minimal movement 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.080
 it turns out to be some consummation when 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.530
 high elbow position with us 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.709
 cessar arm is relaxed and no 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.989
 stress on the shoulder joint and 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.630
 accordingly the catcher is correct technically 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.190
 swim will stop your energy important yet 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.680
 notice that the mushroom should be 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.690
 long mandatory finished phase 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.610
 the worker must be repulsive 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.950
 comes to the hip is a very important point 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.590
 swimming skill is the maximum 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.180
 reduce all kinds of resistance weakly you 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.920
 definitions we may have 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.530
 will increase to the front desk not if 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.910
 the position of the head high for this to be 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.640
 be sure to follow that is the position 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.320
 human body must be a swimmer 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.750
 streamlined hand should not cross 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.560
 lines of the body line if occurs at 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.260
 confluence rang 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.630
 body lines then the body starts spinning 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.370
 hence the wave resistance 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.370
 that you know that this, too, need to follow
