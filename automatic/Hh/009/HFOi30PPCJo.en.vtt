00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
for a more sophisticated audience and

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.960 
for a more sophisticated audience and
they're<00:01:16.500> dealing<00:01:17.159> with<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.340> dilemmas<00:01:17.790> of

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
they're dealing with the dilemmas of

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.520 
they're dealing with the dilemmas of
high<00:01:18.090> school<00:01:18.390> life<00:01:18.630> that's<00:01:18.990> that's<00:01:19.229> done<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
high school life that's that's done in a

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.410 
high school life that's that's done in a
very<00:01:19.680> relatable<00:01:20.130> fashion<00:01:20.580> yes<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.060> can't<00:01:21.270> say

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
very relatable fashion yes I can't say

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.850 
very relatable fashion yes I can't say
too<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.900> relationships<00:01:22.619> are<00:01:22.770> really

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
too that the relationships are really

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.920 
too that the relationships are really
there<00:01:23.430> eloquently<00:01:23.909> explored<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.689> think

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
there eloquently explored and I think

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.620 
there eloquently explored and I think
they<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.290> through<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.580> great<00:01:27.330> use<00:01:27.600> of

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
they do this through a great use of

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.330 
they do this through a great use of
dialogue<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.680> it's<00:01:28.799> really<00:01:28.920> fresh<00:01:29.310> and

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
dialogue and so it's really fresh and

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.640 
dialogue and so it's really fresh and
original<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.119> also<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> circumstances

well-known<00:03:58.000> jazz<00:03:58.420> tune<00:03:58.690> I<00:03:58.840> thought<00:03:58.990> that<00:03:59.140> was

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
well-known jazz tune I thought that was

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.020 
well-known jazz tune I thought that was
a<00:03:59.260> nice<00:03:59.470> touch<00:03:59.740> and<00:03:59.980> look<00:04:00.550> as<00:04:00.700> you<00:04:00.820> said

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030

there's plenty of toe tapping goodness

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.590 
there's plenty of toe tapping goodness
it's<00:04:02.830> seriously<00:04:03.370> energizing<00:04:04.090> stuff<00:04:04.390> and

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
it's seriously energizing stuff and

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.180 
it's seriously energizing stuff and
that's<00:04:04.720> because<00:04:05.020> the<00:04:05.140> composer<00:04:05.530> is<00:04:05.770> Yoko

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
that's because the composer is Yoko

direction<00:04:25.720> by<00:04:26.050> sheer<00:04:26.260> nature

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
direction by sheer nature

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.980 
direction by sheer nature
is<00:04:26.740> very<00:04:26.949> good<00:04:27.310> it's<00:04:27.580> not<00:04:27.760> boundary<00:04:28.570> breaking

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
is very good it's not boundary breaking

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.600 
is very good it's not boundary breaking
but<00:04:29.110> then<00:04:29.290> for<00:04:29.620> this<00:04:29.680> particular<00:04:29.860> story<00:04:30.490> it

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
but then for this particular story it

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.700 
but then for this particular story it
doesn't<00:04:30.760> have<00:04:31.060> to<00:04:31.240> be<00:04:31.360> it's<00:04:31.479> not<00:04:31.540> required<00:04:31.960> but

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
doesn't have to be it's not required but

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.159 
doesn't have to be it's not required but
overall<00:04:33.220> the<00:04:33.550> story<00:04:33.850> itself<00:04:34.270> falls<00:04:34.930> a<00:04:35.139> little

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
overall the story itself falls a little

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.100 
overall the story itself falls a little
short<00:04:35.410> of<00:04:35.949> being<00:04:36.190> compelling<00:04:36.940> while<00:04:37.600> I<00:04:37.630> admire

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
short of being compelling while I admire

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.080

how<00:04:38.350> well<00:04:38.620> this<00:04:38.860> drama<00:04:39.220> has<00:04:39.370> been<00:04:39.430> written<00:04:39.760> and

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
how well this drama has been written and

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.850 
how well this drama has been written and
directed<00:04:40.240> I<00:04:40.720> think<00:04:40.990> that<00:04:41.110> over<00:04:41.350> time<00:04:41.620> it's

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
directed I think that over time it's

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.560 
directed I think that over time it's
going<00:04:42.010> to<00:04:42.160> be<00:04:42.250> largely<00:04:42.580> forgettable<00:04:43.060> and

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
going to be largely forgettable and

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.230 
going to be largely forgettable and
that's<00:04:43.990> why<00:04:44.530> it<00:04:45.250> only<00:04:45.370> just<00:04:45.639> creeps<00:04:45.940> over<00:04:46.150> the

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
that's why it only just creeps over the

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.850 
that's why it only just creeps over the
line<00:04:46.419> as<00:04:46.570> a<00:04:46.600> borrow<00:04:46.930> from<00:04:47.290> me<00:04:47.380> and<00:04:47.560> I'm<00:04:47.620> really

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
line as a borrow from me and I'm really

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.650 
line as a borrow from me and I'm really
only<00:04:48.130> giving<00:04:48.520> it<00:04:48.610> a<00:04:48.699> borrowed<00:04:49.030> based<00:04:49.270> on<00:04:49.510> what

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
only giving it a borrowed based on what

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.050 
only giving it a borrowed based on what
our<00:04:49.690> our<00:04:50.199> viewers<00:04:50.560> might<00:04:50.979> enjoy<00:04:51.520> as<00:04:51.760> well<00:04:52.000> I

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
our our viewers might enjoy as well I

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.270 
our our viewers might enjoy as well I

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280

think in particular some of our female
viewers<00:04:54.639> because<00:04:54.850> this<00:04:55.540> is<00:04:55.810> you<00:04:56.500> know<00:04:56.560> it's

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
it's a change of pace this genre and it

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.379 
it's a change of pace this genre and it
is<00:04:58.960> done<00:04:59.350> well<00:04:59.710> and<00:05:00.310> look<00:05:00.850> that's<00:05:01.030> why<00:05:01.210> I<00:05:01.240> was

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389
