00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
this is a video of my paper Leon Kennedy

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.410 
this is a video of my paper Leon Kennedy
from<00:00:08.910> residue<00:00:09.330> before<00:00:09.480> bottle<00:00:10.410> cap<00:00:11.360> this<00:00:12.360> is

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
from residue before bottle cap this is

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.640 
from residue before bottle cap this is
the<00:00:12.570> version<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:14.030> the<00:00:15.030> on<00:00:15.210> with<00:00:16.369> handgun<00:00:17.369> and

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
the version of the on with handgun and

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.689 
the version of the on with handgun and
his<00:00:19.650> jacket<00:00:20.750> I<00:00:21.980> can't<00:00:22.980> remember<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.310> think<00:00:23.580> this

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
his jacket I can't remember I think this

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.950 
his jacket I can't remember I think this
is<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.350> third<00:00:25.350> bottle<00:00:25.650> cap<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.310> get<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:26.960> the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
is the third bottle cap you get in the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:38.229 
is the third bottle cap you get in the
first<00:00:28.230> row<00:00:30.019> but<00:00:31.189> I<00:00:32.510> can't<00:00:33.510> remember

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.580 

underneath<00:00:39.950> this<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.760> pipe<00:00:42.600> cleaner<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.559> I

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
underneath this is a pipe cleaner so I

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.470 
underneath this is a pipe cleaner so I
could<00:00:43.860> get<00:00:44.040> into<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.930> pose<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:47.059> on<00:00:48.059> top<00:00:48.329> of

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
could get into this pose and on top of

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.310 
could get into this pose and on top of
that<00:00:48.570> it's<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:49.020> layers<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.879> paper<00:00:51.140> to<00:00:52.140> make

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
that it's just layers of paper to make

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.799 
that it's just layers of paper to make
up<00:00:52.500> his<00:00:53.180> face<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.570> his<00:00:55.379> jacket<00:00:56.190> his<00:00:56.460> shirt<00:00:56.809> and

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
up his face and his jacket his shirt and

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.450 
up his face and his jacket his shirt and
his<00:00:57.960> pants<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:59.010> his<00:00:59.160> feet<00:00:59.510> and<00:01:00.510> his<00:01:00.780> gun<00:01:01.460> um

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
his pants and his feet and his gun um

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.280 
his pants and his feet and his gun um
there's<00:01:02.879> no<00:01:03.000> pipe<00:01:03.210> cleaner<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> gun

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
there's no pipe cleaner in the gun

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.830 
there's no pipe cleaner in the gun
though<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:04.799> just<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.510> separate<00:01:06.510> thing<00:01:06.659> that's

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
though it's just a separate thing that's

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.039 
though it's just a separate thing that's
glued<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.320> there<00:01:09.860> yeah<00:01:10.860> I'll<00:01:11.040> just<00:01:11.990> try<00:01:12.990> to

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
glued in there yeah I'll just try to

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.480 
glued in there yeah I'll just try to
show<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.500> gun

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.060 

so<00:01:19.450> hard<00:01:20.170> to<00:01:20.409> see<00:01:20.680> but<00:01:21.220> I<00:01:22.530> did<00:01:23.530> put<00:01:24.040> some

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
so hard to see but I did put some

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:31.100 
so hard to see but I did put some
details<00:01:24.790> into<00:01:25.479> it<00:01:27.300> but<00:01:28.300> it<00:01:28.600> is<00:01:28.780> hard<00:01:29.110> to<00:01:29.440> see

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
details into it but it is hard to see

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.660 
details into it but it is hard to see
and<00:01:32.110> since<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:32.680> pipe<00:01:32.860> cleaner<00:01:33.100> is<00:01:33.310> still<00:01:33.520> in

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
and since the pipe cleaner is still in

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.310 
and since the pipe cleaner is still in
there<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.930> can<00:01:35.680> move<00:01:35.920> his<00:01:36.190> arms<00:01:36.729> around<00:01:37.320> his

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
there you can move his arms around his

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.630 
there you can move his arms around his
head<00:01:38.590> though<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:40.360> can<00:01:40.600> move<00:01:40.780> but<00:01:41.200> it's<00:01:42.159> really

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
head though it can move but it's really

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.450 
head though it can move but it's really
stiff<00:01:43.030> because<00:01:43.710> there<00:01:44.710> are<00:01:44.890> quite<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.250> few

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
stiff because there are quite a few

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.460 
stiff because there are quite a few
layers<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:45.790> paper<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:47.140> make<00:01:47.320> up<00:01:47.530> his<00:01:47.649> head<00:01:47.890> so<00:01:48.220> I

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
layers of paper to make up his head so I

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.669 
layers of paper to make up his head so I
tend<00:01:50.470> I<00:01:50.710> just<00:01:50.950> leave<00:01:51.130> it<00:01:51.160> as<00:01:51.490> it<00:01:52.000> is<00:01:52.410> so<00:01:53.410> you<00:01:53.470> can

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
tend I just leave it as it is so you can

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.710 
tend I just leave it as it is so you can
get<00:01:53.800> them<00:01:53.950> into<00:01:54.070> different<00:01:54.789> poses<00:01:56.910> from<00:01:57.910> in

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
get them into different poses from in

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.490 
get them into different poses from in
the<00:01:58.960> game<00:01:59.170> his<00:02:00.009> legs<00:02:00.310> can<00:02:00.610> move<00:02:00.670> but<00:02:01.350> they<00:02:02.350> are

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
the game his legs can move but they are

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.310 
the game his legs can move but they are
very<00:02:02.770> stiff<00:02:03.130> and<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:04.600> only<00:02:04.750> thing<00:02:05.020> that's

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
very stiff and the only thing that's

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.029 
very stiff and the only thing that's
keeping<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:07.060> thing<00:02:07.119> -<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.630> bottle<00:02:07.929> cap<00:02:08.110> is<00:02:08.979> a

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
keeping this thing - the bottle cap is a

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.810 
keeping this thing - the bottle cap is a
bit<00:02:09.369> of<00:02:09.550> white<00:02:10.149> glue<00:02:10.390> on<00:02:10.660> each<00:02:10.690> foot<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.820> white

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
bit of white glue on each foot and white

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.229 
bit of white glue on each foot and white
glue<00:02:13.030> doesn't<00:02:13.300> stick<00:02:13.480> well<00:02:13.900> -<00:02:14.700> plastic<00:02:15.700> at<00:02:16.000> all

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
glue doesn't stick well - plastic at all

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.520 
glue doesn't stick well - plastic at all
so<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:17.580> try<00:02:18.580> not<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.819> move<00:02:19.239> it<00:02:19.450> -<00:02:20.050> so<00:02:20.350> that

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
so I try not to move it - so that

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.699 
so I try not to move it - so that
doesn't<00:02:21.489> break<00:02:21.640> because<00:02:22.030> right<00:02:22.300> now<00:02:22.709> it's

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
doesn't break because right now it's

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.900 
doesn't break because right now it's
fine<00:02:24.070> but<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:25.150> is<00:02:25.390> very<00:02:26.200> fragile<00:02:26.440> so<00:02:26.890> if<00:02:27.010> I<00:02:27.130> tap

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
fine but it is very fragile so if I tap

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.930 
fine but it is very fragile so if I tap
it<00:02:28.090> too<00:02:28.209> hard<00:02:28.510> or<00:02:28.810> anything<00:02:29.799> and<00:02:30.370> it<00:02:30.730> will

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
it too hard or anything and it will

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.110 
it too hard or anything and it will
break<00:02:31.320> off<00:02:32.320> so<00:02:32.829> I<00:02:33.329> just<00:02:34.329> leave<00:02:34.630> it<00:02:34.810> there<00:02:36.120> next

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
break off so I just leave it there next

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.370 
break off so I just leave it there next
to<00:02:37.209> my<00:02:37.329> other<00:02:37.480> stuff<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:42.280> is<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:43.170> bottle<00:02:44.170> cap

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
to my other stuff it is a bottle cap

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:52.130 
to my other stuff it is a bottle cap
like<00:02:44.739> I<00:02:44.890> said<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:47.310> does<00:02:48.310> work<00:02:49.060> as<00:02:49.360> a<00:02:49.390> bottle<00:02:49.810> cap

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.050 

I<00:02:53.459> might<00:02:54.459> get<00:02:54.640> some<00:02:54.700> like<00:02:55.260> hot<00:02:56.260> glue<00:02:56.590> or

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
I might get some like hot glue or

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.150 
I might get some like hot glue or
something<00:02:58.060> like<00:02:58.180> that<00:02:58.239> to<00:02:58.660> glue<00:02:58.870> this<00:02:59.160> onto

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
something like that to glue this onto

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.660 
something like that to glue this onto
the<00:03:00.579> bottle<00:03:01.390> cap<00:03:01.600> so<00:03:01.840> that<00:03:02.019> it<00:03:02.290> stays<00:03:03.000> better

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
the bottle cap so that it stays better

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.410 
the bottle cap so that it stays better
to<00:03:06.670> paint<00:03:06.910> it<00:03:07.150> I<00:03:07.650> used<00:03:08.650> watercolors<00:03:09.489> but<00:03:10.120> I

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
to paint it I used watercolors but I

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.620 
to paint it I used watercolors but I
didn't<00:03:10.750> have<00:03:10.959> any<00:03:11.260> black<00:03:11.940> water<00:03:12.940> color<00:03:13.269> so<00:03:13.600> I

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
didn't have any black water color so I

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.860 
didn't have any black water color so I
had<00:03:14.019> to<00:03:14.170> use<00:03:14.730> permanent<00:03:15.730> marker<00:03:16.150> which<00:03:16.540> really

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
had to use permanent marker which really
