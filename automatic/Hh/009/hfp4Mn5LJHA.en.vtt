00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.690 

what<00:02:20.340> they<00:02:21.209> said<00:02:21.799> these<00:02:22.799> are<00:02:22.950> my<00:02:22.980> rabbit<00:02:23.489> cages

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700

what they said these are my rabbit cages
and<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:27.379> built<00:02:28.379> them<00:02:28.500> all

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
and I built them all

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.229 
and I built them all
no<00:02:31.680> sense<00:02:31.920> in<00:02:32.010> hoarding<00:02:32.340> gråvik<00:02:32.700> pages<00:02:33.030> or

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
no sense in hoarding gråvik pages or

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.550 
no sense in hoarding gråvik pages or
buying<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:33.629> from<00:02:33.689> a<00:02:33.810> pet<00:02:33.989> store<00:02:34.019> because<00:02:34.439> it's

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
buying it from a pet store because it's

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.740 
buying it from a pet store because it's
just<00:02:34.680> not<00:02:34.739> big<00:02:35.010> enough<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:35.519> you<00:02:35.549> got<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.599> kind

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
just not big enough so you got to kind

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.050 
just not big enough so you got to kind
of<00:02:36.810> build<00:02:36.989> your<00:02:37.140> own<00:02:37.609> downside<00:02:38.609> is<00:02:38.790> they're

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
of build your own downside is they're

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.140 
of build your own downside is they're
extremely<00:02:39.450> heavy<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:39.959> hard<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.560> move

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
extremely heavy and hard to move

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.979 
extremely heavy and hard to move
probably<00:02:42.150> in<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.269> future<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.599> build<00:02:42.900> them

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
probably in the future I build them

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.009 
probably in the future I build them
individually<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.549> uh<00:02:44.750> they're<00:02:45.750> not<00:02:45.840> so

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
individually so that uh they're not so

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:46.970 
individually so that uh they're not so
tough<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.319> move<00:02:46.470> because<00:02:46.709> they<00:02:46.799> probably

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
tough to move because they probably

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.699 
tough to move because they probably
weigh<00:02:47.189> a<00:02:47.220> couple<00:02:47.250> hundred<00:02:47.519> pounds<00:02:47.879> okay

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
weigh a couple hundred pounds okay

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.269 
weigh a couple hundred pounds okay
anyways<00:02:49.709> that's<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.400> rabbits<00:02:50.730> thanks
