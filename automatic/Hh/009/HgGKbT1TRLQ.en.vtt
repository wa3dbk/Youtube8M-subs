up<00:03:07.590> I'll<00:03:07.739> read<00:03:08.610> up<00:03:08.760> something<00:03:09.209> on<00:03:09.299> it<00:03:09.510> maybe<00:03:09.720> I

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
up I'll read up something on it maybe I

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.330 
up I'll read up something on it maybe I
could<00:03:09.959> find<00:03:10.140> some<00:03:10.379> kind<00:03:10.410> of<00:03:10.620> instruction

could find some kind of instruction

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.680 
could find some kind of instruction

about this game the one bit of

about this game the one bit of
information<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:19.349> did<00:03:19.500> find<00:03:19.769> was<00:03:20.670> basically<00:03:21.090> a

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
information I did find was basically a

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.690 
information I did find was basically a
long<00:03:21.720> review<00:03:22.110> than<00:03:22.260> panda<00:03:22.739> for<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.519> same

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
long review than panda for the same

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.190 
long review than panda for the same
reasons<00:03:24.030> I'm<00:03:24.150> panning<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:26.660> but<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.780> couldn't

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
reasons I'm panning it but I couldn't

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.720 
reasons I'm panning it but I couldn't
for<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.769> life<00:03:28.799> of<00:03:29.040> me<00:03:29.129> figure<00:03:29.160> out<00:03:29.430> what<00:03:29.700> the

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
for the life of me figure out what the

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.780 
for the life of me figure out what the
buttons<00:03:30.120> do<00:03:30.410> they<00:03:31.410> make<00:03:32.160> some<00:03:32.340> attempts<00:03:32.670> at

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
buttons do they make some attempts at

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.599 
buttons do they make some attempts at
punches<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:33.420> kicks<00:03:33.660> but<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:35.190> doesn't<00:03:35.459> seem

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
punches and kicks but it doesn't seem

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.750 
punches and kicks but it doesn't seem
consistent<00:03:36.709> and<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.859> end<00:03:38.010> result<00:03:38.370> is<00:03:38.459> you<00:03:38.609> get

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
consistent and the end result is you get

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.550 
consistent and the end result is you get
frustrated<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.540> just<00:03:39.870> start<00:03:40.049> smashing

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
frustrated and just start smashing

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.530 
frustrated and just start smashing
buttons<00:03:40.890> like<00:03:41.099> I<00:03:41.250> found<00:03:41.730> myself<00:03:41.940> doing<00:03:42.269> within

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
buttons like I found myself doing within

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.380 
buttons like I found myself doing within
three<00:03:42.989> minutes<00:03:43.109> of<00:03:43.319> playing<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.680> game<00:03:44.390> it's

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
three minutes of playing the game it's

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.229 
three minutes of playing the game it's
just<00:03:45.510> it's<00:03:45.840> horrible<00:03:46.519> the<00:03:47.519> graphics<00:03:48.000> are

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
just it's horrible the graphics are

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.449 
just it's horrible the graphics are
pretty<00:03:49.040> shitty<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.359> must<00:03:51.359> say<00:03:51.540> I<00:03:51.780> mean<00:03:52.319> the<00:03:52.680> ring

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
pretty shitty I must say I mean the ring

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.970 
pretty shitty I must say I mean the ring
in<00:03:53.639> the<00:03:53.760> arena<00:03:54.450> or<00:03:54.720> whatever<00:03:55.139> the<00:03:55.560> hell<00:03:55.739> it<00:03:55.889> is

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
in the arena or whatever the hell it is

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.339 
in the arena or whatever the hell it is
is<00:03:56.549> fairly<00:03:56.970> detailed<00:03:58.579> but<00:03:59.579> you<00:03:59.970> know<00:04:00.349> it's

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
is fairly detailed but you know it's

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.129 
is fairly detailed but you know it's
just<00:04:01.530> kind<00:04:02.040> of<00:04:02.099> a<00:04:02.190> mess

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
just kind of a mess

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.479 
just kind of a mess
the<00:04:04.139> monsters<00:04:04.620> don't<00:04:04.889> really<00:04:05.190> look<00:04:05.430> like

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
the monsters don't really look like

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.930 
the monsters don't really look like
anything<00:04:06.359> in<00:04:07.019> particular<00:04:07.519> they're<00:04:08.519> just<00:04:08.730> kind

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
anything in particular they're just kind

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.879 
anything in particular they're just kind
of<00:04:09.000> generic<00:04:09.720> ugly<00:04:10.669> blobs<00:04:11.669> and<00:04:12.709> that's<00:04:13.709> not

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
of generic ugly blobs and that's not

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.210 
of generic ugly blobs and that's not
helping<00:04:14.989> helping<00:04:15.989> sway<00:04:16.410> me<00:04:16.590> either<00:04:16.829> into

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
helping helping sway me either into

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.909 
helping helping sway me either into
thinking<00:04:17.549> that<00:04:17.700> this<00:04:17.820> might<00:04:18.000> be<00:04:18.180> a<00:04:18.209> fun<00:04:18.510> game

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
thinking that this might be a fun game

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.089 
thinking that this might be a fun game
scary<00:04:19.919> monsters<00:04:20.430> or<00:04:20.669> they're<00:04:21.120> just<00:04:21.359> ugly<00:04:22.099> and

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
scary monsters or they're just ugly and

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:28.550 
scary monsters or they're just ugly and
not<00:04:23.849> very<00:04:24.030> fun<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.450> play<00:04:24.479> with<00:04:27.200> now<00:04:28.200> since<00:04:28.470> I

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
not very fun to play with now since I

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.900 
not very fun to play with now since I
don't<00:04:28.620> have<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:28.889> instruction<00:04:29.370> manual<00:04:29.760> I'm

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
don't have the instruction manual I'm

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.240 
don't have the instruction manual I'm
guessing<00:04:30.450> that<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:30.990> general<00:04:31.650> concept<00:04:32.099> is

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
guessing that the general concept is

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.730 
guessing that the general concept is
that<00:04:32.280> this<00:04:32.729> is<00:04:32.940> a<00:04:32.970> wrestling<00:04:33.389> game<00:04:33.570> so<00:04:34.320> once

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
that this is a wrestling game so once

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.810 
that this is a wrestling game so once
you<00:04:34.830> knock<00:04:35.010> down<00:04:35.190> your<00:04:35.370> opponent<00:04:35.729> you're

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
you knock down your opponent you're

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.250 
you knock down your opponent you're
supposed<00:04:36.090> to<00:04:36.150> make<00:04:36.300> some<00:04:36.479> attempt<00:04:36.810> at<00:04:36.870> pinning

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
supposed to make some attempt at pinning

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.379 
supposed to make some attempt at pinning
them<00:04:37.470> or<00:04:37.620> something<00:04:37.950> and<00:04:38.550> every<00:04:38.820> time<00:04:38.970> I<00:04:39.060> try

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
them or something and every time I try

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.990 
them or something and every time I try
to<00:04:39.860> pin<00:04:40.860> my<00:04:41.039> opponent<00:04:41.490> when<00:04:41.580> I<00:04:41.639> knock<00:04:41.820> them

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
to pin my opponent when I knock them

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.300 
to pin my opponent when I knock them
down<00:04:42.150> and<00:04:42.360> nothing<00:04:42.690> happened<00:04:43.050> I<00:04:43.320> floundered

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
down and nothing happened I floundered

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.860 
down and nothing happened I floundered
