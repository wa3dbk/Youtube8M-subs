slower and yet the back and forth but
you'll<00:02:11.459> be<00:02:11.519> able<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.940> visually<00:02:12.450> see<00:02:13.069> the<00:02:14.069> paint

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
you'll be able to visually see the paint

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.080 
you'll be able to visually see the paint
bubbling

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.620 

and<00:02:18.420> one<00:02:18.690> thing<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.080> want<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.380> remember<00:02:20.630> you

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
and one thing you want to remember you

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.699 
and one thing you want to remember you
are<00:02:21.870> working<00:02:21.900> with<00:02:22.470> wood<00:02:22.739> and<00:02:23.130> wood<00:02:23.280> burns<00:02:24.709> so

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
are working with wood and wood burns so

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.690 
are working with wood and wood burns so
this<00:02:25.950> keeps<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.819> steady<00:02:27.630> flow<00:02:28.020> going<00:02:28.410> back<00:02:29.310> and

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
this keeps a steady flow going back and

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.240 
this keeps a steady flow going back and
forth<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.900> one<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.170> reasons<00:02:34.620> for<00:02:34.769> off

forth and one of the reasons for off

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.190 
forth and one of the reasons for off
using<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.269> heat<00:02:36.510> gun<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:38.720> it's<00:02:39.720> going<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.019> be<00:02:40.170> a

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
using a heat gun is it's going to be a

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.839 
using a heat gun is it's going to be a
lot<00:02:40.530> less<00:02:41.630> hazardous<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.010> finish<00:02:44.610> we're

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
lot less hazardous to the finish we're

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.080 
lot less hazardous to the finish we're
trying<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.360> save<00:02:46.340> if<00:02:47.340> they're<00:02:47.580> just<00:02:47.790> stripping

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090

something<00:02:48.660> down<00:02:48.870> or<00:02:50.209> you<00:02:51.209> know<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:51.420> can<00:02:51.690> use

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
something down or you know you can use

something down or you know you can use

I<00:03:01.340> find<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.700> easiest<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.480> best<00:03:03.510> way<00:03:03.989> as<00:03:04.140> this

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
I find the easiest and best way as this

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.580 
I find the easiest and best way as this
needs<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.769> deepness<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.459> as<00:03:06.360> you<00:03:06.510> can<00:03:06.690> see<00:03:06.900> it's

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
needs a deepness and as you can see it's

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.470 
needs a deepness and as you can see it's
just<00:03:07.739> steadily<00:03:08.720> moving<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:11.510> we're<00:03:12.510> doing<00:03:12.690> a

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
just steadily moving and we're doing a

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.539 
just steadily moving and we're doing a
nice<00:03:15.480> wide<00:03:15.870> path<00:03:16.319> here<00:03:17.060> that's<00:03:18.060> going<00:03:18.330> to

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
nice wide path here that's going to

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.479 
nice wide path here that's going to
actually<00:03:20.549> turn<00:03:20.819> this<00:03:21.000> into<00:03:21.269> a<00:03:21.390> pretty<00:03:22.489> small

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
actually turn this into a pretty small

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.580 
actually turn this into a pretty small
job<00:03:24.380> for<00:03:25.380> a<00:03:25.500> stripping<00:03:26.100> is<00:03:26.370> not<00:03:27.410> she's<00:03:28.410> never

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
job for a stripping is not she's never

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.400 
job for a stripping is not she's never
tried<00:03:28.890> and<00:03:29.340> it's<00:03:29.489> very<00:03:29.730> messy<00:03:30.140> it's<00:03:31.140> very

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
tried and it's very messy it's very

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.430 
tried and it's very messy it's very
costly

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
costly

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.190

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
had to breathe and as you can see we

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.650 
had to breathe and as you can see we
made<00:03:36.380> one<00:03:36.590> big<00:03:36.800> pass<00:03:37.070> you<00:03:37.820> get<00:03:38.030> this<00:03:38.180> on<00:03:38.420> there
