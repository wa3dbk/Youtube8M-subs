looking pretty so the rollers kind of

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.490 
looking pretty so the rollers kind of
defeated<00:05:00.510> the<00:05:00.630> purpose<00:05:00.960> because<00:05:01.199> I<00:05:01.229> had<00:05:01.410> to

actually holding up I'm very surprised
all<00:05:45.900> right<00:05:46.410> so<00:05:46.620> all<00:05:46.650> of<00:05:46.889> my<00:05:46.950> twists<00:05:47.430> are<00:05:47.550> taking

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
all right so all of my twists are taking

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.779 
all right so all of my twists are taking
out<00:05:48.150> and<00:05:48.660> I<00:05:48.750> really<00:05:49.169> am<00:05:49.349> liking<00:05:49.650> it<00:05:50.039> but<00:05:50.610> now

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
out and I really am liking it but now

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.719 
out and I really am liking it but now
I'm<00:05:51.180> going<00:05:51.450> to<00:05:51.599> use<00:05:51.630> my<00:05:51.960> pick<00:05:52.260> and<00:05:52.530> fluff<00:05:53.370> it<00:05:53.580> up

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
I'm going to use my pick and fluff it up

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:56.240 
I'm going to use my pick and fluff it up
some<00:05:54.030> more<00:05:54.240> just<00:05:55.199> to<00:05:55.349> create<00:05:55.590> a<00:05:55.710> little<00:05:55.800> bit<00:05:56.130> of

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
some more just to create a little bit of

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.969 
some more just to create a little bit of
volume<00:05:56.520> I<00:05:56.940> do<00:05:57.030> not<00:05:57.570> separate<00:05:58.199> my<00:05:58.410> twists<00:05:58.740> very

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
volume I do not separate my twists very

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.909 
volume I do not separate my twists very
much<00:05:59.220> because<00:05:59.699> one<00:06:00.240> the<00:06:00.990> humidity<00:06:01.500> makes<00:06:01.740> it

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
much because one the humidity makes it

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.310 
much because one the humidity makes it
poofier<00:06:02.310> and<00:06:02.610> two<00:06:02.849> I<00:06:03.240> just<00:06:03.690> really<00:06:03.870> don't<00:06:04.080> care

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
poofier and two I just really don't care

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.020 
poofier and two I just really don't care
for<00:06:04.380> it<00:06:04.770> because<00:06:04.919> I<00:06:05.010> want<00:06:05.190> the<00:06:05.280> style<00:06:05.520> to<00:06:05.820> last

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
for it because I want the style to last

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.260 
for it because I want the style to last
