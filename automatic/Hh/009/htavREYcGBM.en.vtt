pass<00:04:50.440> their<00:04:50.830> quality<00:04:51.280> control<00:04:51.960> so<00:04:52.960> these

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
pass their quality control so these

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.770

imperfections the 23 logo on the back is

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
imperfections the 23 logo on the back is
crooked<00:06:33.660> but<00:06:34.660> it<00:06:34.990> doesn't<00:06:35.440> mean<00:06:35.560> they're<00:06:35.770> fake

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:36.820 
crooked but it doesn't mean they're fake

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.360 
crooked but it doesn't mean they're fake
just<00:06:37.150> means<00:06:37.420> that<00:06:37.810> they<00:06:38.020> are<00:06:38.470> going<00:06:39.010> through<00:06:39.130> a

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
just means that they are going through a

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.900 
just means that they are going through a
different<00:06:39.820> version<00:06:40.980> to<00:06:41.980> get<00:06:42.190> to<00:06:42.340> the<00:06:42.460> final

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
different version to get to the final

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.690 
different version to get to the final
retail<00:06:43.720> version<00:06:44.260> so<00:06:44.830> that's<00:06:45.100> why<00:06:45.280> you<00:06:45.340> see<00:06:45.670> a

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:45.700 
retail version so that's why you see a

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.420 
retail version so that's why you see a
few<00:06:46.030> different<00:06:46.180> versions<00:06:46.810> and<00:06:47.100> obviously<00:06:48.100> the

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.430 
few different versions and obviously the

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.050 
few different versions and obviously the
quality<00:06:48.970> are<00:06:49.570> on<00:06:49.750> some<00:06:50.020> of<00:06:50.080> the<00:06:50.170> versions<00:06:51.060> that

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
quality are on some of the versions that

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.690 
quality are on some of the versions that
are<00:06:52.210> shoddy<00:06:52.510> that<00:06:52.840> don't<00:06:53.050> meet<00:06:53.490> meet<00:06:54.490> the

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:54.700 
are shoddy that don't meet meet the

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.230 
are shoddy that don't meet meet the
criteria<00:06:55.590> so<00:06:56.590> that's<00:06:57.310> the<00:06:57.580> deal<00:06:57.790> with<00:06:58.090> the

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 
criteria so that's the deal with the

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.790 
criteria so that's the deal with the
real<00:06:58.450> to<00:06:58.870> fake<00:06:59.110> em<00:06:59.560> how<00:06:59.890> it<00:07:00.040> works<00:07:00.250> and<00:07:01.800> pretty

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 
real to fake em how it works and pretty

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.040 
real to fake em how it works and pretty

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:21.580 
they are not fake they are just a

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.010 
they are not fake they are just a
different<00:07:22.060> version<00:07:22.390> from<00:07:23.850> what<00:07:24.850> the<00:07:25.690> people

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:26.020
