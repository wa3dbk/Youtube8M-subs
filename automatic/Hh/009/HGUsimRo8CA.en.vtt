00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
so that's great from the bottom the way

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.270 
so that's great from the bottom the way
one's<00:01:27.579> gonna<00:01:27.850> hide<00:01:28.299> and<00:01:29.229> more<00:01:29.649> about<00:01:30.220> a

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
one's gonna hide and more about a

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.600 
one's gonna hide and more about a
species<00:01:30.850> gets<00:01:31.390> destroyed<00:01:31.990> with<00:01:32.439> each

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
species gets destroyed with each

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:56.860 
species gets destroyed with each
but<00:01:34.540> uh<00:01:34.570> no<00:01:34.870> more<00:01:35.080> fish<00:01:35.500> and<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:36.310> clay

a<00:01:57.160> three-mile<00:01:58.160> limit<00:01:58.400> sword<00:01:58.910> we<00:01:59.270> need

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
a three-mile limit sword we need

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.070 
a three-mile limit sword we need
collectively<00:02:00.500> first<00:02:01.010> rule<00:02:01.400> the<00:02:02.270> tragic<00:02:02.780> crews

must<00:02:03.410> realized<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:04.520> theory<00:02:04.790> but<00:02:05.360> never<00:02:05.630> so

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
must realized a theory but never so

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.930 
must realized a theory but never so
any<00:02:07.210> clone<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:08.020> net<00:02:08.290> brother<00:02:08.800> backs<00:02:09.520> him<00:02:09.790> up

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
any clone and net brother backs him up

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.850 
any clone and net brother backs him up
must<00:02:10.300> do<00:02:10.980> so<00:02:11.980> snowboard<00:02:12.520> fish<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.690> clay

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
must do so snowboard fish and the clay

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.770 
must do so snowboard fish and the clay
there<00:02:15.670> are<00:02:16.030> no<00:02:16.300> more<00:02:16.900> fish<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.740> McClane

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
there are no more fish and McClane

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.830 
there are no more fish and McClane
so<00:02:20.290> there's<00:02:20.620> great<00:02:20.830> band<00:02:21.460> of<00:02:21.730> autumn<00:02:22.240> weather

we once got a hey and more of every

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.530 
we once got a hey and more of every
species<00:02:26.620> gets<00:02:27.130> destroyed<00:02:27.760> when<00:02:28.180> heat<00:02:28.300> I<00:02:28.600> play

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
species gets destroyed when heat I play

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.430 
species gets destroyed when heat I play
-<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.920> clay

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440

was gonna hey
for<00:02:43.709> every<00:02:44.550> species<00:02:44.880> gets<00:02:45.390> destroyed<00:02:46.050> which

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
for every species gets destroyed which

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.680 
for every species gets destroyed which
mainly<00:02:48.410> fish<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.800> McClay

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
mainly fish and McClay

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.850 
mainly fish and McClay
a<00:02:51.830> role<00:02:52.830> for<00:02:53.400> fish<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.450> McClay
