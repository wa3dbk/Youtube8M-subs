good<00:00:22.289> however<00:00:22.800> in<00:00:22.980> Gears<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.400> War<00:00:23.460> one<00:00:23.820> unlike

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
good however in Gears of War one unlike

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.870 
good however in Gears of War one unlike
the<00:00:24.630> other<00:00:24.810> games<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.830> bowl<00:00:26.070> talk<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.550> very

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
the other games the bowl talk is very

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.700 
the other games the bowl talk is very
very<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.180> lot<00:00:27.510> harder<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.960> use<00:00:28.230> pretty<00:00:28.590> much

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
very a lot harder to use pretty much

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.740 
very a lot harder to use pretty much
it's<00:00:29.099> basically<00:00:29.550> exactly<00:00:29.970> like<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.420> sniper

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
it's basically exactly like the sniper

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.470 
it's basically exactly like the sniper
your<00:00:31.170> position<00:00:31.769> needs<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.579> be<00:00:32.790> on<00:00:33.000> point

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
your position needs to be on point

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.660 
your position needs to be on point
unlike<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.290> other<00:00:34.469> games<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.190> don't<00:00:35.430> have

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
unlike in the other games you don't have

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.639 
unlike in the other games you don't have
that<00:00:35.850> quick<00:00:36.180> shooting<00:00:36.719> mechanism<00:00:37.320> when<00:00:37.530> you

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
that quick shooting mechanism when you

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.470 
that quick shooting mechanism when you
get<00:00:37.800> an<00:00:37.890> active<00:00:38.250> reload<00:00:38.670> with<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.000> weapon<00:00:39.329> in

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
get an active reload with the weapon in

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.880 
get an active reload with the weapon in
this<00:00:39.600> game<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.050> literally<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.590> same

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
this game it's literally just the same

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.940 
this game it's literally just the same
speed<00:00:41.460> firing<00:00:42.090> rate<00:00:42.300> every<00:00:42.780> single<00:00:43.079> time<00:00:43.350> so

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
speed firing rate every single time so

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.440 
speed firing rate every single time so
you<00:00:44.010> really<00:00:44.489> really<00:00:44.700> need<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.120> be<00:00:45.210> accurate

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
you really really need to be accurate

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.690 
you really really need to be accurate
with<00:00:46.020> your<00:00:46.289> shooting<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.129> bowl<00:00:47.399> tock

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
with your shooting of the bowl tock

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.430 
with your shooting of the bowl tock
pistol<00:00:48.180> obviously<00:00:48.629> go<00:00:48.780> for<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.050> head<00:00:49.170> as<00:00:49.260> much

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
pistol obviously go for the head as much

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.080 
pistol obviously go for the head as much
as<00:00:49.559> possible<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:50.399> trying<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.820> get<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> head

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
as possible but trying to get a head

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.910 
as possible but trying to get a head
shot<00:00:51.120> with<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.570> bolt<00:00:51.840> or<00:00:52.050> pistol<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.680> Gears

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
shot with this bolt or pistol in Gears

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.130 
shot with this bolt or pistol in Gears
one<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:53.850> much<00:00:54.239> harder<00:00:54.270> than<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.960> in

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
one it's so much harder than it is in

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.540 
one it's so much harder than it is in
the<00:00:55.230> other<00:00:55.350> kids<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.800> all<00:00:55.920> games<00:00:56.100> like<00:00:56.309> gears

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the other kids of all games like gears

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.580 
the other kids of all games like gears
of<00:00:56.670> war<00:00:56.850> two<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.090> gears<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.600> war<00:00:57.750> free<00:00:58.050> because

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
of war two and gears of war free because

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.950 
of war two and gears of war free because
you<00:00:58.710> don't<00:00:58.949> have<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.280> faster<00:00:59.940> fire<00:01:00.270> rate<00:01:00.570> so

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
you don't have that faster fire rate so

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.299 
you don't have that faster fire rate so
you<00:01:01.020> really<00:01:01.140> do<00:01:01.350> need<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.620> be<00:01:01.710> accurate<00:01:01.890> as<00:01:02.190> you

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
you really do need to be accurate as you

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.549 
you really do need to be accurate as you
can<00:01:02.430> see<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.270> like<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.750> slut<00:01:03.780> pistol<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.530> a

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
can see is it like the slut pistol is a

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.740 
can see is it like the slut pistol is a
tumah<00:01:05.129> laid<00:01:05.280> down<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> ammo<00:01:06.240> comes<00:01:06.510> quite

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
tumah laid down but the ammo comes quite

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.240 
tumah laid down but the ammo comes quite
quickly<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.439> need<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.650> practice<00:01:07.680> with

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
quickly you just need to practice with

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.950 
quickly you just need to practice with
this<00:01:08.400> weapon<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.939> haven't<00:01:09.360> used<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> wall
