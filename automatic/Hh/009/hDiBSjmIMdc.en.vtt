00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.219 
few actors in it I mean I think total
cast<00:05:16.180> you<00:05:17.180> know<00:05:17.210> doesn't<00:05:17.690> comes<00:05:17.810> very<00:05:18.050> many

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
cast you know doesn't comes very many

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:20.279 
cast you know doesn't comes very many
people

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289 
people

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.549 
people
but<00:05:20.889> the<00:05:21.009> story<00:05:21.399> is<00:05:21.639> so<00:05:22.059> compelling<00:05:22.089> and<00:05:22.719> I

00:05:23.549 --> 00:05:23.559 
but the story is so compelling and I

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:25.829 
but the story is so compelling and I
have<00:05:24.279> such<00:05:24.550> faith<00:05:24.789> in<00:05:25.089> our<00:05:25.210> director<00:05:25.599> James

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:28.859 
have such faith in our director James

00:05:30.989 --> 00:05:30.999 
being an extremely talented man is also

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:32.519 
being an extremely talented man is also
very<00:05:31.210> brave<00:05:31.449> you<00:05:31.749> know<00:05:31.779> I've<00:05:31.990> had<00:05:32.259> a<00:05:32.319> friend

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:32.529 
very brave you know I've had a friend

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:34.920 
very brave you know I've had a friend
who<00:05:32.919> has<00:05:33.580> seen<00:05:33.879> a<00:05:33.909> test<00:05:34.210> screening<00:05:34.449> recently

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
who has seen a test screening recently

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.570 
who has seen a test screening recently
and<00:05:35.050> there<00:05:35.199> is<00:05:35.379> apparently<00:05:35.529> a<00:05:35.919> portion<00:05:36.399> for

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
and there is apparently a portion for

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.820 
and there is apparently a portion for
like<00:05:36.759> 15<00:05:37.599> minutes<00:05:37.960> in<00:05:38.080> the<00:05:38.110> middle<00:05:38.199> film<00:05:38.589> with

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
like 15 minutes in the middle film with

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:39.749 
like 15 minutes in the middle film with
no<00:05:39.099> dialogue

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 
no dialogue

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:41.549 
no dialogue
and<00:05:40.300> it's<00:05:40.449> just<00:05:40.689> me<00:05:40.869> walking<00:05:41.020> around<00:05:41.319> the

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:41.559 
and it's just me walking around the

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:43.829 
and it's just me walking around the
house<00:05:41.819> but<00:05:42.819> it<00:05:42.939> is<00:05:43.089> apparently<00:05:43.539> some<00:05:43.689> of<00:05:43.779> the

00:05:43.829 --> 00:05:43.839 
house but it is apparently some of the

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:45.689 
house but it is apparently some of the
most<00:05:43.960> compelling<00:05:44.339> it's<00:05:45.339> going<00:05:45.520> to<00:05:45.580> be

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:45.699 
most compelling it's going to be

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:47.100 
most compelling it's going to be
terrifying<00:05:46.119> and<00:05:46.300> at<00:05:46.449> the<00:05:46.539> test<00:05:46.779> dream<00:05:46.960> they

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
terrifying and at the test dream they

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.299 
terrifying and at the test dream they
had<00:05:47.139> apparently<00:05:47.469> people<00:05:47.740> were<00:05:47.919> leaping<00:05:48.099> out

00:05:48.299 --> 00:05:48.309 
had apparently people were leaping out

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:51.269 
had apparently people were leaping out
their<00:05:48.580> seats<00:05:48.819> terrified<00:05:49.749> and<00:05:50.050> you<00:05:50.889> know<00:05:51.009> so<00:05:51.249> I

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:51.279 
their seats terrified and you know so I

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:54.029 
their seats terrified and you know so I
think<00:05:51.849> it's<00:05:51.939> gonna<00:05:52.180> be<00:05:52.360> a<00:05:52.389> really<00:05:53.080> really<00:05:53.409> good

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
think it's gonna be a really really good

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:55.290 
think it's gonna be a really really good
movie<00:05:54.490> and<00:05:54.639> something<00:05:54.759> I'm<00:05:54.909> very<00:05:54.939> very

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
movie and something I'm very very

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.329 
movie and something I'm very very
excited<00:05:55.449> I<00:05:55.779> mean<00:05:55.990> I'm<00:05:56.169> I'm<00:05:56.469> very<00:05:57.069> rarely

00:05:57.329 --> 00:05:57.339 
excited I mean I'm I'm very rarely

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:58.980 
excited I mean I'm I'm very rarely
excited<00:05:57.849> to<00:05:57.939> see<00:05:58.059> stuff<00:05:58.300> that<00:05:58.330> I'm<00:05:58.509> in<00:05:58.659> I'm

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
excited to see stuff that I'm in I'm

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.510 
excited to see stuff that I'm in I'm
actually<00:05:59.169> very<00:05:59.499> excited<00:05:59.649> about<00:06:00.009> saying<00:06:00.339> and

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
actually very excited about saying and

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.719 
actually very excited about saying and
something<00:06:00.759> is<00:06:00.849> gonna<00:06:00.999> be<00:06:01.199> very<00:06:02.199> I<00:06:02.949> think<00:06:03.550> and<00:06:03.669> I

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
something is gonna be very I think and I

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:05.459 
something is gonna be very I think and I
think<00:06:03.939> it<00:06:04.029> will<00:06:04.089> be<00:06:04.240> as<00:06:04.360> a<00:06:04.599> big<00:06:04.930> step<00:06:05.110> for<00:06:05.259> me<00:06:05.289> as

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:05.469 
think it will be as a big step for me as

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:07.199 
think it will be as a big step for me as
well<00:06:05.619> because<00:06:05.860> you<00:06:05.979> know<00:06:06.009> I'm<00:06:06.550> playing<00:06:06.789> older

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:07.209 
well because you know I'm playing older

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:08.969 
well because you know I'm playing older
for<00:06:07.360> the<00:06:07.419> first<00:06:07.599> time<00:06:07.930> lizards<00:06:08.649> are<00:06:08.770> dead

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:08.979 
for the first time lizards are dead

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:10.589 
for the first time lizards are dead
right<00:06:09.249> aliens<00:06:09.699> Adam<00:06:09.969> planked<00:06:10.330> well<00:06:10.479> I<00:06:10.539> think

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 
right aliens Adam planked well I think

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:14.459 
right aliens Adam planked well I think
put<00:06:11.439> a<00:06:11.469> bit<00:06:11.589> about<00:06:11.740> the<00:06:11.860> age<00:06:11.949> of<00:06:11.979> 25<00:06:13.289> so<00:06:14.289> yeah

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:14.469 
put a bit about the age of 25 so yeah

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:17.100 
put a bit about the age of 25 so yeah
it's<00:06:14.800> it's<00:06:15.309> a<00:06:15.969> big<00:06:16.149> step<00:06:16.270> automate<00:06:16.749> a<00:06:16.779> long<00:06:16.959> way

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
it's it's a big step automate a long way

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.010 
it's it's a big step automate a long way
so<00:06:17.169> hopefully<00:06:17.379> it'll<00:06:17.979> be<00:06:18.430> successful<00:06:18.879> um<00:06:19.449> just

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
so hopefully it'll be successful um just

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.260 
so hopefully it'll be successful um just
be<00:06:20.199> resolute<00:06:20.529> reason<00:06:21.009> very<00:06:21.249> easily<00:06:21.459> yes<00:06:21.819> I'm

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
be resolute reason very easily yes I'm

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.059 
be resolute reason very easily yes I'm
is<00:06:22.809> the<00:06:22.990> kind<00:06:23.199> of<00:06:23.229> film<00:06:23.319> I<00:06:23.499> probably<00:06:23.709> wouldn't

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:24.069 
is the kind of film I probably wouldn't

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:25.649 
is the kind of film I probably wouldn't
see<00:06:24.219> if<00:06:24.370> I<00:06:24.459> wasn't<00:06:24.729> in<00:06:24.789> it
