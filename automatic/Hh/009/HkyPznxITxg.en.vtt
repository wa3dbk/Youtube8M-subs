00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
said hands held high which is one of our

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.819 
said hands held high which is one of our
songs<00:00:46.059> that<00:00:46.420> we've<00:00:46.930> you<00:00:47.469> know<00:00:47.590> kind<00:00:47.769> of

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
songs that we've you know kind of

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.110 
songs that we've you know kind of
sprinkled<00:00:48.190> it<00:00:48.280> in<00:00:48.340> the<00:00:48.430> set<00:00:48.640> here<00:00:48.820> and<00:00:48.910> there

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
sprinkled it in the set here and there

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.330 
sprinkled it in the set here and there
and<00:00:49.359> then<00:00:49.449> decided<00:00:49.989> that<00:00:50.140> it<00:00:50.620> really<00:00:50.920> you<00:00:51.219> know

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
and then decided that it really you know

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.160 
and then decided that it really you know
the<00:00:51.460> album<00:00:51.820> version<00:00:51.850> the<00:00:52.809> live<00:00:52.989> version

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
the album version the live version

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.419 
the album version the live version
wasn't<00:00:53.530> really<00:00:53.769> doing<00:00:53.980> the<00:00:54.070> album<00:00:54.399> version

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
wasn't really doing the album version

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.790 
wasn't really doing the album version
justice<00:00:55.239> because<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:55.870> album<00:00:56.199> version<00:00:56.350> has

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
justice because the album version has

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.450 
justice because the album version has
this<00:00:56.949> effect<00:00:57.250> basically<00:00:57.510> layered<00:00:59.460> almost

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
this effect basically layered almost

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.490 
this effect basically layered almost
like<00:01:00.579> a<00:01:00.609> choir<00:01:00.940> vocal<00:01:01.449> on<00:01:01.660> the<00:01:02.079> on<00:01:02.289> the

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
like a choir vocal on the on the

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.829

stopping<00:01:11.920> in<00:01:11.980> between<00:01:12.040> two<00:01:12.400> songs<00:01:12.670> and<00:01:12.970> I<00:01:13.000> did

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
stopping in between two songs and I did

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.090 
stopping in between two songs and I did
them<00:01:13.360> basically<00:01:14.320> half<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:14.650> song<00:01:14.860> like<00:01:15.070> the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
them basically half the song like the

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.020 
them basically half the song like the
first<00:01:15.369> verse<00:01:15.579> of<00:01:15.820> it<00:01:16.000> ha<00:01:16.150> capella<00:01:16.540> and<00:01:18.030> that

first verse of it ha capella and that
felt<00:01:19.390> great<00:01:19.689> like<00:01:19.720> he<00:01:20.049> had<00:01:20.170> never<00:01:20.320> done<00:01:20.439> it

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
felt great like he had never done it

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.310 
felt great like he had never done it
that<00:01:20.710> way<00:01:20.829> before<00:01:20.979> we<00:01:21.909> never<00:01:22.540> did<00:01:22.720> it<00:01:22.750> after<00:01:22.960> we

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
that way before we never did it after we

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.020 
that way before we never did it after we
actually<00:01:23.680> changed<00:01:24.040> the<00:01:24.130> set<00:01:24.369> to<00:01:24.490> incorporate

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.940 
actually changed the set to incorporate
that<00:01:25.180> verse<00:01:25.509> on<00:01:26.079> a<00:01:26.259> different<00:01:26.680> part<00:01:26.829> of<00:01:26.890> the

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
that verse on a different part of the

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.010 
that verse on a different part of the
set<00:01:27.189> because<00:01:27.460> we<00:01:27.490> that<00:01:27.909> day<00:01:28.119> we<00:01:28.329> did<00:01:28.509> that<00:01:28.720> I

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
set because we that day we did that I

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.800 
set because we that day we did that I
did<00:01:29.439> that<00:01:29.619> and<00:01:29.860> then<00:01:30.009> I<00:01:30.790> think<00:01:31.329> Brad<00:01:31.479> came<00:01:31.720> up

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
did that and then I think Brad came up

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.969 
did that and then I think Brad came up
to<00:01:31.899> me<00:01:31.990> he's<00:01:32.110> like<00:01:32.140> that<00:01:32.350> was<00:01:32.500> really<00:01:32.530> great

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
to me he's like that was really great

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.440 
to me he's like that was really great
like<00:01:33.189> we<00:01:33.280> should<00:01:33.460> try<00:01:33.640> and<00:01:33.790> do<00:01:33.970> something<00:01:34.240> like

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
like we should try and do something like

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.990 
like we should try and do something like
that<00:01:34.509> you<00:01:34.899> know<00:01:35.350> in<00:01:35.470> the<00:01:35.530> future<00:01:35.649> set<00:01:36.040> so<00:01:36.310> that

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
that you know in the future set so that

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.630 
that you know in the future set so that
kids<00:01:37.329> sign<00:01:37.770> essentially<00:01:38.770> changed<00:01:39.219> our<00:01:39.340> set

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
kids sign essentially changed our set

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.429 
kids sign essentially changed our set
for<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:39.969> rest<00:01:40.149> of<00:01:40.299> the<00:01:40.420> touring<00:01:41.079> cycle

the<00:01:47.350> Milton<00:01:48.009> Keynes<00:01:48.159> show<00:01:48.579> we<00:01:49.509> were<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:51.340> just

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
the Milton Keynes show we were it just

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.490 
the Milton Keynes show we were it just
seemed<00:01:51.789> like<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:53.259> math<00:01:53.560> was<00:01:53.920> there<00:01:54.250> to<00:01:55.500> that

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
seemed like the math was there to that

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.810 
seemed like the math was there to that
it<00:01:56.560> was<00:01:56.680> telling<00:01:57.070> us<00:01:57.189> maybe<00:01:57.460> we<00:01:57.640> should

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
it was telling us maybe we should

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.319 
it was telling us maybe we should
probably<00:01:57.909> film<00:01:58.270> this<00:01:58.509> thing<00:01:58.750> because<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:01.210> was
