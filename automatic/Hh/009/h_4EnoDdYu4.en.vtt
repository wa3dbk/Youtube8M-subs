00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
was inspired by using the theme of

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.770 
was inspired by using the theme of
Barbie<00:00:59.350> I<00:00:59.650> was<00:01:00.610> really<00:01:00.790> trying<00:01:01.060> to<00:01:01.210> think<00:01:01.540> of

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
Barbie I was really trying to think of

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.550 
Barbie I was really trying to think of
somebody<00:01:02.880> something<00:01:03.880> that<00:01:04.449> everybody<00:01:05.290> could

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
somebody something that everybody could

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.160 
somebody something that everybody could
pretty<00:01:05.890> much<00:01:06.040> relate<00:01:06.700> to<00:01:06.909> and<00:01:07.270> not<00:01:07.600> have<00:01:07.840> to

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
pretty much relate to and not have to

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.580 
pretty much relate to and not have to
part<00:01:08.439> of<00:01:08.560> a<00:01:08.619> time<00:01:08.859> and<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:10.450> know<00:01:10.539> Barbie<00:01:11.079> has

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
part of a time and you know Barbie has

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.789 
part of a time and you know Barbie has
been<00:01:11.740> around<00:01:11.950> for<00:01:12.310> so<00:01:12.520> long<00:01:13.289> math<00:01:14.289> even<00:01:14.560> had<00:01:14.770> a

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
been around for so long math even had a

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.520 
been around for so long math even had a
Barbie<00:01:15.219> line<00:01:15.429> so<00:01:16.149> that's<00:01:16.689> why<00:01:16.840> I<00:01:16.899> thought<00:01:17.170> this

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
Barbie line so that's why I thought this

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.950 
Barbie line so that's why I thought this
would<00:01:17.740> be<00:01:17.799> really<00:01:18.100> fun<00:01:18.429> and<00:01:18.909> it<00:01:19.600> wouldn't<00:01:19.899> be

would be really fun and it wouldn't be

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.789 
would be really fun and it wouldn't be
too<00:01:20.140> difficult<00:01:20.789> for<00:01:21.789> you<00:01:22.539> guys<00:01:23.109> but<00:01:23.530> I<00:01:23.590> want
