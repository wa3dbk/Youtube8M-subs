00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
running that one gigahertz processor 512

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.360 
running that one gigahertz processor 512
megabytes<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.390> RAM<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.960> then<00:00:46.710> it's<00:00:46.860> got<00:00:47.010> one

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370
