00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
it as well it's kind of like a

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.110 
it as well it's kind of like a
rubberized<00:04:14.070> feel<00:04:14.400> which<00:04:14.610> actually<00:04:14.970> if<00:04:15.060> you

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
rubberized feel which actually if you

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.780 
rubberized feel which actually if you
want<00:04:15.269> to<00:04:15.330> lean<00:04:15.510> it<00:04:15.660> up<00:04:15.750> against<00:04:16.080> something<00:04:16.790> it

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
want to lean it up against something it

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.340 
want to lean it up against something it
holds<00:04:18.150> on<00:04:18.269> it<00:04:18.419> so<00:04:18.570> you<00:04:18.630> don't<00:04:18.959> really<00:04:19.080> need<00:04:19.229> to

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
holds on it so you don't really need to

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.259 
holds on it so you don't really need to
have<00:04:19.410> a<00:04:19.500> stand<00:04:19.830> and<00:04:20.700> then<00:04:20.850> you've<00:04:20.970> got<00:04:21.150> your

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
have a stand and then you've got your

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.409 
have a stand and then you've got your

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
two speakers on the side here which give

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.080 
two speakers on the side here which give
out<00:04:24.540> a<00:04:24.570> really<00:04:24.990> nice<00:04:25.140> sound<00:04:25.410> actually<00:04:26.090> the

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
only thing I will say is it does take a

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.920
