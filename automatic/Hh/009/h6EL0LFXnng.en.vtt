 gross number 3 under expected 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:09.390
 to cover the threads 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.390
 and with the piece that must be elaborated 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.130
 it is important to always make a good 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.549
 work 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:26.170
 so that the houses lucas spectacular 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:28.000

 in the central part with the tape we have 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.530
 then here the other piece that is going to 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.510

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.780
 in the way 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.970
 and then provoke is to arm if we go to 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.130
 put it together these forms 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.220

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.440
 in an enveloping way in this way 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.340
 very easy 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.670
 and always also taking care that it is 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.710
 well covered the plastic and that is not 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.410

 is the BOM for these 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.730
 techniques and instinct makes them a 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.230
 little late you can take note of everything 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.230
