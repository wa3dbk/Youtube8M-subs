do like a plan the shelter because it

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.430 
do like a plan the shelter because it
doesn't<00:00:39.610> retest<00:00:39.940> like<00:00:40.809> call<00:00:41.229> academic

knowledge<00:00:42.010> of<00:00:42.250> the<00:00:42.339> alleged<00:00:42.580> chemistry<00:00:43.089> is

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
knowledge of the alleged chemistry is

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.439 
knowledge of the alleged chemistry is
more<00:00:43.299> altitude<00:00:43.920> because<00:00:44.920> it's<00:00:45.519> your<00:00:46.210> you're

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
more altitude because it's your you're

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.660 
more altitude because it's your you're
in<00:00:46.540> a<00:00:46.600> room<00:00:46.809> where<00:00:47.769> people<00:00:48.250> are<00:00:48.309> doing<00:00:48.489> their

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
in a room where people are doing their

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.219 
in a room where people are doing their
driving<00:00:49.059> theory<00:00:49.420> test<00:00:49.540> and<00:00:49.960> say<00:00:50.049> there's

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:50.229 
driving theory test and say there's

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:51.450 
driving theory test and say there's
learn<00:00:50.379> so<00:00:50.500> quickly<00:00:50.530> and<00:00:51.040> there's<00:00:51.190> lots<00:00:51.280> of

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
learn so quickly and there's lots of

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.939 
learn so quickly and there's lots of
noise<00:00:51.610> and<00:00:51.940> also<00:00:52.780> you<00:00:52.839> get<00:00:53.199> one<00:00:53.470> question<00:00:53.860> of

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
noise and also you get one question of

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.789 
noise and also you get one question of
green<00:00:54.129> and<00:00:54.250> 30<00:00:54.519> seconds<00:00:55.059> long<00:00:55.239> so<00:00:55.540> if<00:00:56.409> the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:56.799 
green and 30 seconds long so if the

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:58.259 
green and 30 seconds long so if the
questions<00:00:57.129> are<00:00:57.220> hard<00:00:57.430> based<00:00:57.760> difficult<00:00:58.180> in

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
questions are hard based difficult in

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.750 
questions are hard based difficult in
the<00:00:58.330> sense<00:00:58.360> that<00:00:58.629> you<00:00:58.960> have<00:00:59.680> to<00:00:59.890> really<00:01:00.129> time

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
the sense that you have to really time

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.539 
the sense that you have to really time
and<00:01:00.970> that's<00:01:01.210> key<00:01:01.449> right<00:01:02.110> it's<00:01:02.890> between<00:01:03.189> I

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:03.549 
and that's key right it's between I

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:05.730 
and that's key right it's between I
think<00:01:03.939> the<00:01:04.360> school<00:01:04.570> they<00:01:04.809> score<00:01:05.049> between<00:01:05.170> 300

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
think the school they score between 300

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.190 
think the school they score between 300
and<00:01:05.799> 500<00:01:06.010> and<00:01:06.640> from<00:01:07.510> med<00:01:07.689> school<00:01:07.720> these<00:01:08.110> days

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
and 500 and from med school these days

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.580 
and 500 and from med school these days
you<00:01:08.500> really<00:01:08.770> to<00:01:08.830> get<00:01:09.009> buff<00:01:09.250> say<00:01:10.149> it's<00:01:10.329> 630<00:01:11.020> yeah

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
you really to get buff say it's 630 yeah

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.130 
you really to get buff say it's 630 yeah
I'd<00:01:11.770> say<00:01:11.799> that<00:01:12.579> took<00:01:12.850> to<00:01:13.179> get<00:01:13.689> offered<00:01:14.020> an

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
I'd say that took to get offered an

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.099 
I'd say that took to get offered an
interview<00:01:14.469> I<00:01:14.829> think<00:01:15.490> most<00:01:15.700> people<00:01:16.119> say<00:01:16.240> 600<00:01:16.929> I

think asked for 630 these days so to

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.940 
think asked for 630 these days so to
clarify<00:01:24.219> this<00:01:24.549> is<00:01:24.880> more<00:01:25.119> of<00:01:25.149> an<00:01:25.270> attitude<00:01:25.950> your

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
clarify this is more of an attitude your

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.099 
clarify this is more of an attitude your
opinion<00:01:27.429> on<00:01:27.520> matters<00:01:27.700> rather<00:01:28.299> than<00:01:28.570> academic

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:29.109 
opinion on matters rather than academic

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:30.480 
opinion on matters rather than academic
knowledge<00:01:29.259> here<00:01:29.619> but<00:01:29.799> I'm<00:01:29.950> still<00:01:30.189> it<00:01:30.429> could

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
knowledge here but I'm still it could

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.179

still<00:01:30.729> be<00:01:30.789> worked<00:01:31.450> on<00:01:31.659> like<00:01:32.140> don't<00:01:32.740> don't

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
still be worked on like don't don't

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:34.950 
still be worked on like don't don't
think<00:01:33.850> that<00:01:34.030> you<00:01:34.090> just<00:01:34.149> should<00:01:34.420> revise<00:01:34.719> from

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
think that you just should revise from

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.289 
think that you just should revise from
just<00:01:35.140> walking<00:01:35.259> /<00:01:35.619> just<00:01:36.249> do<00:01:36.369> a<00:01:36.399> bit<00:01:36.609> but<00:01:37.090> stuff

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299

just walking / just do a bit but stuff
like<00:01:37.329> a<00:01:37.719> hormone<00:01:38.079> section<00:01:38.499> which<00:01:38.649> is<00:01:38.770> really

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
like a hormone section which is really

simple songs every day go ok what this
is<00:01:47.649> all<00:01:47.799> the<00:01:47.889> second<00:01:48.159> that<00:01:48.249> we<00:01:48.369> had<00:01:48.490> available

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
is all the second that we had available

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.899 
is all the second that we had available
reasoning<00:01:49.749> yeah<00:01:50.079> nonverbal<00:01:51.090> maths<00:01:52.090> and

September<00:02:39.019> so<00:02:39.440> I<00:02:39.500> think<00:02:39.590> labels<00:02:40.129> yeah<00:02:41.530> because

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
September so I think labels yeah because

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.150 
September so I think labels yeah because
I<00:02:42.650> tipton<00:02:43.040> dave<00:02:43.190> August<00:02:43.760> which<00:02:44.450> was<00:02:44.780> I<00:02:45.160> think

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
I tipton dave August which was I think

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.619 
I tipton dave August which was I think
just<00:02:46.340> if<00:02:46.459> we<00:02:46.519> went<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.760> school<00:02:47.030> which<00:02:47.359> is<00:02:47.390> yeah

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
just if we went to school which is yeah

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.020 
just if we went to school which is yeah
i<00:02:47.660> think<00:02:47.900> is<00:02:48.019> bad<00:02:48.230> because<00:02:48.829> you<00:02:49.069> don't<00:02:49.280> you

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
i think is bad because you don't you

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.400 
i think is bad because you don't you
have<00:02:50.209> been<00:02:50.359> doing<00:02:50.510> nothing<00:02:50.629> or<00:02:50.959> some<00:02:51.170> a

have been doing nothing or some a
partner<00:02:51.980> we've<00:02:52.370> met<00:02:52.579> won't<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:52.910> take<00:02:53.060> up<00:02:53.269> that

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
partner we've met won't you take up that

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.869 
partner we've met won't you take up that
that's<00:02:53.750> not<00:02:53.840> be<00:02:53.989> healthy<00:02:54.170> if<00:02:54.769> you<00:02:54.980> it<00:02:55.519> does<00:02:55.730> get

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
that's not be healthy if you it does get

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.059 
that's not be healthy if you it does get
more<00:02:56.060> expensive<00:02:56.569> than<00:02:56.750> not<00:02:56.900> mutilated<00:02:57.349> it's

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
more expensive than not mutilated it's

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.270 
more expensive than not mutilated it's
not<00:02:58.280> by<00:02:58.910> much<00:02:59.150> so<00:02:59.780> if<00:02:59.930> you<00:03:00.049> do<00:03:00.260> wait<00:03:00.650> till

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
not by much so if you do wait till

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.400 
not by much so if you do wait till
you're<00:03:01.489> up<00:03:01.549> throughout<00:03:02.510> school<00:03:02.840> for<00:03:03.049> a<00:03:03.200> month

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
you're up throughout school for a month

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.800 
you're up throughout school for a month
then<00:03:03.769> you<00:03:04.430> take<00:03:04.639> it<00:03:04.819> right<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.120> end<00:03:06.430> okay<00:03:07.810> and

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
then you take it right the end okay and

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.349 
then you take it right the end okay and
crushing<00:03:09.560> up<00:03:09.680> perhaps<00:03:09.950> on<00:03:10.209> latest<00:03:11.209> and

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
crushing up perhaps on latest and

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:15.819 
crushing up perhaps on latest and
bioethics<00:03:11.750> that's<00:03:12.200> nothing<00:03:12.500> helped<00:03:14.530> no<00:03:15.530> but<00:03:15.799> i

hopes<00:03:16.160> would<00:03:16.310> be<00:03:16.340> map<00:03:16.700> of<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.030> UK<00:03:17.510> I<00:03:18.049> mean<00:03:18.889> just

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
hopes would be map of the UK I mean just

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.979 
hopes would be map of the UK I mean just
hope<00:03:20.269> if<00:03:20.419> we<00:03:20.510> do<00:03:20.660> was<00:03:21.669> also<00:03:22.669> thinking<00:03:22.970> yeah<00:03:23.540> I

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
hope if we do was also thinking yeah I

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.720 
hope if we do was also thinking yeah I
guess<00:03:24.440> we're<00:03:24.620> thinking<00:03:24.950> is<00:03:25.040> pretty<00:03:25.459> useful

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
guess we're thinking is pretty useful

the answer to look right stupid way

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.690 
the answer to look right stupid way

we all bought which was medical school
in<00:04:31.370> to<00:04:31.520> ease<00:04:31.670> I<00:04:31.910> think<00:04:32.300> they<00:04:32.390> update<00:04:32.810> it<00:04:32.840> every

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
in to ease I think they update it every

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.790 
in to ease I think they update it every
year<00:04:35.090> that's<00:04:35.840> really<00:04:36.050> good<00:04:36.260> not<00:04:36.410> relate<00:04:36.680> to

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
year that's really good not relate to

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.950 
year that's really good not relate to
people<00:04:36.890> to<00:04:37.130> the<00:04:37.220> veena<00:04:37.840> there's<00:04:38.840> three

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
people to the veena there's three

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.430 
people to the veena there's three
sections<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:40.040> first<00:04:40.070> ones<00:04:40.640> like<00:04:41.440> just

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
sections the first ones like just

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.610 
sections the first ones like just
general<00:04:42.950> in<00:04:43.820> verbal<00:04:44.270> nonverbal<00:04:44.390> yeah<00:04:45.290> isn't

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
general in verbal nonverbal yeah isn't

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.580 
general in verbal nonverbal yeah isn't
it<00:04:45.740> and<00:04:46.340> then<00:04:46.520> seconds<00:04:47.060> nuts<00:04:47.960> in<00:04:48.169> science

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
it and then seconds nuts in science

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.590 
it and then seconds nuts in science
which<00:04:49.040> is<00:04:49.190> really<00:04:49.370> is<00:04:49.490> my<00:04:49.669> way<00:04:49.850> we<00:04:50.000> do<00:04:50.150> a<00:04:50.180> level

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
which is really is my way we do a level

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.230 
which is really is my way we do a level
where<00:04:50.750> they<00:04:51.470> soon<00:04:51.830> not<00:04:52.280> everyone<00:04:52.700> taking<00:04:52.970> it

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
where they soon not everyone taking it

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.190 
where they soon not everyone taking it
has<00:04:53.980> gone<00:04:54.980> done<00:04:55.280> most<00:04:55.700> subjects<00:04:56.090> available<00:04:56.510> so

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
has gone done most subjects available so

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.140 
has gone done most subjects available so
mass<00:04:57.950> for<00:04:58.160> instance<00:04:58.460> like<00:04:58.610> maps<00:04:58.850> is<00:04:59.000> no

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
mass for instance like maps is no

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.360

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
requirement to do medicine so the maps

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.860 
requirement to do medicine so the maps
would<00:05:01.610> be<00:05:01.669> around<00:05:02.000> roughly<00:05:02.240> GCSE<00:05:02.900> level<00:05:04.870> it

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
would be around roughly GCSE level it

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.420 
would be around roughly GCSE level it

ela<00:05:13.060> it<00:05:13.510> was<00:05:13.690> a<00:05:13.720> puzzle<00:05:14.560> that<00:05:14.860> large<00:05:15.070> assesses

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
ela it was a puzzle that large assesses

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.760 
ela it was a puzzle that large assesses
well<00:05:15.760> because<00:05:16.120> I<00:05:16.180> did<00:05:16.330> history<00:05:16.660> in<00:05:16.750> RS<00:05:17.080> I<00:05:17.320> think

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
well because I did history in RS I think

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.080 
well because I did history in RS I think
what<00:05:17.890> sa<00:05:18.160> right<00:05:18.340> he<00:05:18.430> was<00:05:18.550> really<00:05:18.730> good<00:05:18.880> and

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
what sa right he was really good and

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.000 
what sa right he was really good and
