there's<00:04:06.040> not<00:04:06.190> really<00:04:06.340> been<00:04:06.549> anything<00:04:06.819> like

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
there's not really been anything like

there's not really been anything like
this<00:04:07.239> in<00:04:07.419> the<00:04:07.510> southwest<00:04:08.459> it<00:04:09.459> felt<00:04:09.760> that<00:04:09.910> there

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
this in the southwest it felt that there

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.580 
this in the southwest it felt that there
was<00:04:10.120> a<00:04:10.150> gap<00:04:10.359> in<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.569> market<00:04:10.930> that<00:04:11.019> we<00:04:11.109> really

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
was a gap in the market that we really

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.009 
was a gap in the market that we really
needed<00:04:11.769> to<00:04:11.889> sort<00:04:12.459> of<00:04:12.489> build<00:04:12.700> I<00:04:13.060> think<00:04:13.299> if<00:04:13.750> we<00:04:13.870> do

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
needed to sort of build I think if we do

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.750 
needed to sort of build I think if we do
it<00:04:14.139> again<00:04:14.319> we<00:04:14.500> probably<00:04:14.650> will<00:04:15.010> extend<00:04:15.459> it<00:04:15.639> so

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
it again we probably will extend it so

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.279 
it again we probably will extend it so
it'll<00:04:15.849> be<00:04:15.910> a<00:04:16.000> weekend<00:04:16.570> or<00:04:16.660> possibly<00:04:17.019> even<00:04:17.109> a

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
it'll be a weekend or possibly even a

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.050 
it'll be a weekend or possibly even a
long<00:04:17.440> weekend<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.010> try<00:04:18.370> and<00:04:18.489> get<00:04:18.639> what<00:04:19.030> we

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
long weekend and try and get what we

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.370 
long weekend and try and get what we
hopes<00:04:19.479> to<00:04:19.630> do<00:04:19.720> is<00:04:19.810> really<00:04:19.930> getting<00:04:20.169> city

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380
