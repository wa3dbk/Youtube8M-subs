 Hello, how are you, I am Mariana and today I come 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.100
 to talk to you about a very special book 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.110
 I'm talking the thief's books 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.540
 markus zusak is a very special book 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.519
 for me he managed to captivate me from the 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.470
 first page and ended up being one of 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:21.349
 my favorite books we have here a 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.119
 book whose narrator is death to her 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.220
 he is struck by a German girl from 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.310
 nine years that you meet in countless 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.919
 occasions certain day alicia the girl 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.710
 German finds a book and without 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:38.719
 think twice take it and take it 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:42.230
 to your home as if it were the most valuable 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:45.589
 that lizio had been found but there 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.179
 A detail elÃ­seos does not know how to read disabled 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.789
 is given in adoption in which their parents 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:52.579
 they are communists and this new family 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.649
 who adopts it is very peculiar 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.809
 Hans who is his father is a painter but 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.570
 Enjoy playing the accordion every time 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:04.120
 can pink her mother have 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:08.380
 character a bit difficult rude 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.930
 but it 's good deep down it 's good 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.970
 we also have rudy who is the best 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.580
 little friend, the one who spends all 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.230
 afternoons and they do a lot of pranks me 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.330
 I love the relationship that exists 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.550
 between the characters as each one is 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.470
 unique and special and each of them 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.480
 have a story to tell you that 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.360
 you achieve love is immediately with 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.920
 each one to see with already well-known theme 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.140
 by many that in the second war 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.350
 worldwide for a this occasion is from 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.130
 the perspective of the Germans and not of 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.550
 the Jews 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.890
 then it shows us that also the 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.010
 Germans suffered in that war and did not 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.930
 only the cold ones like they gave him more 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.350
 protagonism to the Jews that to the 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.500
 Germans then it's a bit nice like 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.940
 this book shows you the story of 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.130
 the Jews but also about the 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.130
 Germans and how they complement each other 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.570
 I do not want to say many things 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.050
 because when I read this book I'm going 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.050
 to cry 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.140
 when I read this book I did not know about 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.450
 nothing at all absolutely nothing did not know 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.310
 what was he trying to imagine I was trying 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.400
 the Second World War 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.319
 and I knew that whoever narrated the story of 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.620
 death then I imagined I was going 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.959
 to be sad just that 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.909
 but it goes beyond sadness this 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:34.049
 book this story goes beyond the 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:37.280
 sadness and the only bad thing that could 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:41.680
 see this book is that 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:45.950
 the funny death begins to give us 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.370
 spoilers and it starts to tell us and it's going to 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:53.890
 pass this and so but I think that in certain 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:57.150
 way the author wanted to prepare us 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:01.390
 for what is going to happen 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.610
 and that made me a little 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:08.410
 He made me cry twice 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:12.040
 situations but I think that that makes it 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.800
 very father very original book very very 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.900
 special do not believe that very beautiful 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.569
 I really liked the way it is 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.590
 written 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:24.629
 even if I gave spoilers it does not matter I say 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.200
 death was not going to be so cool no 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:29.300
 they believe so 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.849
 I do not complain that in that situation 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.890
 I complain I am very very happy with the 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.739
 book and I think that 's what he did too 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.690
 very exciting to continue to want 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.989
 continue reading without a doubt the thief 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:45.550
 books is a treasure that every reader should 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.550
 have in your bookseller 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.060
 many times it is enough for me to know 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.970
 that this book has liked many 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.250
 people to want to read it I do not like it 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.780
 know much about what is going because when 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.849
 to read it does not surprise me or does not reach 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.730
 hook me as much as maybe I 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:08.359
 I would get hooked if I did not know anything 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.189
 books have that information back by 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:13.040
 example I'm not saying something that 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:17.200
 says through the book that it is a 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.200
 character a character that 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.320
 that made me learn a lot that you 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.510
 made lizio learn a lot of things 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.340
 I think here in this story all 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.530
 they learned from everyone and that's something 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:34.290
 beautiful the truth comes to me when 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:37.920
 when the books reflect certain 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.990
 humility true love, as I say 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.370
 that book is very very special to me 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.230
 I would like very much that you too what 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.060
 read if they have not done it because in 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.330
 I really do not know what they're waiting for is the 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.330
 book 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.279
 I am that you will not get safe 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:55.199
 I have met someone who has read it 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:05:00.499
 and that he said you do not know that book 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:00.499
 is badly written badly done bad story 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.760
 very good now if I go I hope that you 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.040
 have liked this video and give it a 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.020
