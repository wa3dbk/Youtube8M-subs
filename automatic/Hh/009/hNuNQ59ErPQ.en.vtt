don't think it's good the point is what

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.550 
don't think it's good the point is what
is<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.330> might<00:02:12.510> spend

pc-engine national chases want $200 150
something<00:02:17.400> like<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.670> up<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.880> 300<00:02:18.120> that's

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
something like that up to 300 that's

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.490 
something like that up to 300 that's
reasonable

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
reasonable

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.740

it's<00:02:19.770> not<00:02:19.860> reasonable<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.250> spend<00:02:20.630> $2,000<00:02:21.630> or

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
it's not reasonable to spend $2,000 or

that's the difference so what is the
