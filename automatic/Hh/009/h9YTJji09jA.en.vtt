00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.369
 fish fillets fresh black pepper

 grated bread type bank that is the type 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.070
 japanese japanese team and also good a 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.429
 little olive oil navas for 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.259
 Align and oven 230 degrees linked to the 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.619
 these mere corrector correct this 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:06.110
 he is very father nor the sauce I can not 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.460
 see it here or it's delicious and this one 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.259
 Well, I'm ready to start with 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.260
 coffee we beat ourselves first the whipped 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.519
 it's from the egg itself as well as you know if 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.100
 you have mentioned the program many times 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.200
 what is the egg white is the most 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.450
 healthy egg in terms of people 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.720
 who suffer from high cholesterol then 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.010
 here is the very taste a little 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.319
 more light 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.780
 besides that it serves well what are we going 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.329
 to put a little water on it and let's 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.239
 use it so that so that it sticks 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.879
 the fish besides that there is a lot of 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:41.090
 protein today the albumin to be 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.519
 specific to sing this is that for me 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.900
 I find it so difficult on a personal level 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.030
 cooking the fish you do not know why 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.670
 because I always see it as such a thing 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.430
 difficult so complicated however this 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.260
 recipe made me very easy very fast and 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.000
 I think it's more recipes like that we need 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.140
 to eat a little more fish eat 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.970
 a little more balanced in our diet 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.579
 of course the part I had a thing 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.470
 people who eat fish claims to have 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.389
 much less saturated fat because it's 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.310
 scientifically proven that the 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:09.739
 fish at the end of the day has less 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.510
 saturated fats than other products 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.340
 animals then if they are going to choose 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.230
 you something for the diet I do them 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.909
 I highly recommend that it be fish and 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.500
 put aside because maybe the 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.840
 chicken and beef a thousand times better 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.519
 Do not skin so much variety and they are so 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.069
 honestly accessible in the truth that 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.440
 if today we are using a nile white 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.359
 but you can honestly use or 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.640
 red snapper or any other type of 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:34.069
 whitefish tilapia 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.140
 You could also be with me 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.300
 account and the little white fisherman what 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.240
 what we are going to do is sink it into 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.490
 clear beaten 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.510
 if I'm fine what was never 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:50.710
 waiting for themselves and here we are going to put it 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:53.110
 to bread ok and without fear I know why 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:56.380
 crush him well that stays well 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:00.130
 stuck the bread I need all the rock and 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.990
 roll and this bread sorry not even though it 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.730
 look like another bread crumb if you give a 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.380
 taste this bread a little different 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.790
 Japanese that was made between two in the 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.770
 most of the supermarkets then it is 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.840
 a little different from the psoe were the 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.120
 usd patients the company type 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.810
 raised that I kiss you one thing I'm in 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.489
 against the traditional breaded because 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.799
 It takes a lot of oil because finally 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.210
 you end up putting it in the oil today 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.880
 this proposal that brings me is 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.310
 incredible because value also then 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.660
 It really does not need oil, 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.370
 let's put a little trickle afterwards to 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.870
 board exactly like me so that 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.880
 do not stick so little on the part of 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.760
 down at the bottom also with 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:40.840
 that and put it in the oven did not cause me 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.880
 ones that I would say about 20 minutes to 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.990
 you do not give me not only we're going to 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.540
 put him 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.970
 20 minutes 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.400
 and also now what are we going to 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.870
 do let's make a salsita then 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.720
 I'm going to remove this the way that I already 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.270
 we use and we are going to make the sauce not 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.400
 the salsa tag that is a very sauce 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.500
 very revealing traditional before this 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.420
 usa that eats a lot with this kind of 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.610
 fish but I love 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.440
 but they usually get very fat as 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.720
 they will have browned because the mayonnaise with 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.640
 all whole fat in store a lot and 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.960
 it will put pressure on you if you do not know that 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.510
 it's a light version and you're going to give it 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.130
 clear account apart the mayonnaise there is no 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.440
 way to make them very light because 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.160
 finally they carry the egg mayonnaise 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.840
 and oil 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.150
 so if you use olive oil and 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.790
 these things good that you can 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.510
 work better we are not going to put you now 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:34.040
 cucumber 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:37.340
 let's also put the spikes with the 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:40.580
 the pecos we are going to put a little celery 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:44.570
 which is the anti good, these are the arts 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:47.810
 and you consume 10 grams of calories 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.640
 7 calories and burning 13 nothing else 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.080
 digest and what to celery too 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.180
 age makes the salsita a 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.690
 little crispy is rich that is the 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.160
 true that if not digit vinagrito a 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.900
 little that we are missing a bit more 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:05.340
 exactly dill 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:08.310
 and we have given everything and little pepper 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.960
 I'm comfortable with this, we mix it 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.729
 we mix all together 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.910
 and also with a little bit of oil 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:17.130
 also already when here decide ok a 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.539
 little bit of oil until the color will say 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.580
 what minute is staying adore this 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:22.560
 late is rich the truth is that it is 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.220
 very easy to do it's a matter of 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.020
 chop and we are today are managing 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.840
