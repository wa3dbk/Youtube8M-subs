continuously<00:01:58.700> you<00:01:59.270> just<00:01:59.540> sit<00:01:59.720> there<00:01:59.750> and

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
continuously you just sit there and

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.650 
continuously you just sit there and
watch<00:02:00.170> me<00:02:00.380> take<00:02:00.620> a<00:02:01.130> shot<00:02:01.370> or<00:02:01.880> paradise<00:02:02.480> of

ordinary<00:02:03.520> and<00:02:04.520> I'll<00:02:04.640> simply<00:02:04.970> just<00:02:05.120> get

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
ordinary and I'll simply just get

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:20.280 
ordinary and I'll simply just get
through

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.979 

I<00:02:20.519> think<00:02:21.519> that<00:02:21.760> some<00:02:22.030> gun<00:02:22.209> sounds<00:02:22.720> louder

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
I think that some gun sounds louder

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.729 
I think that some gun sounds louder
because<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.769> cameras<00:02:25.140> allowed<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.349> that<00:02:26.500> law

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
because the cameras allowed to that law

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.649 
because the cameras allowed to that law
angle<00:02:27.129> to<00:02:27.310> it<00:02:27.400> are<00:02:27.610> slightly<00:02:27.909> ahead<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.629> I

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
angle to it are slightly ahead and I

00:02:28.659 --> 00:03:13.530 
angle to it are slightly ahead and I
think<00:02:28.900> it's<00:02:29.019> catching<00:02:29.230> more<00:02:29.470> than

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.649 

I'm<00:03:14.290> glad<00:03:14.530> it's<00:03:14.769> easy<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.939> fit<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.330> gun<00:03:16.480> I've
