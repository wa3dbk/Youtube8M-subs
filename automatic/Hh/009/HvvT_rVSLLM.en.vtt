00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.250
 yeah I know with anne collod for a 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.809
 little bit what happened in this 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.670
 match it's a little pity but we 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.199
 saw anyway though so on the plane 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.850
 defensive it was holding the road there is a 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.680
 cam difficulty tonight to be able 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.630
 take out some balloons and to be able to 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.900
 attack in this match was not 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.070
 easy we have 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.210
 in five times in a hurry they gave us 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.590
 in a hurry to go out we sinned on 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.449
 little mistake of inattention and that's it 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.090
 paid cash the match like that 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.860
 stay focused and do the maximum 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.870
 of efforts also rather stay focused 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.980
 and do the macho it's a little bit 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.809
 shame is to play matches like 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.070
 that with not all the capacities it is 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.480
 true it was really a real 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.070
 attacker it's a little bit of a pity 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.210
 to make these matches there without this game out 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.460
 that can make the difference 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.530
 in front of me it's annoying but hey we have 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.790
 trust those who were there they 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.440
 gave what they could and his 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.909
 two months it's a shame for us 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.589
 meaning that the team that are matches 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.570
 who arrive at the capacity anyway from 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.920
 bounce back to pick up i would say in 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.449
 the adversity of the results also 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.000
 now way in the whole we did not 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.320
 not been bad there was a good block we got 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.479
 tried to play the shots how 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.790
 how healthy but that's how I say we 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.130
 a sin once and here it is 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:19.850
 leaned cash for bordeaux ok I'll tell you 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:20.329
 thanks in any case thank you to you as 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.590
 his players 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:23.270
 it should see all the players well 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.470
 sure because I want coach pacÃ©en but 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.720
 happy that's right I saw happy with 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.189
 with your staff with the players after the 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.930
 match because it was not already a 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.210
 easy match to win and it took 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.590
 lean towards several game options and 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.609
 to win it and that the 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.979
 players on the pitch too 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:40.069
 yeah of course good it was not a big 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.659
 match I think but hey we were very 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:43.969
 brave very tenacious 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.369
 we had a bit more his mastery in 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:47.899
 second one might have had to do the 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.110
 break because marseille did not have 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.330
 not used but 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.860
 we did not know how to do it so we were 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.120
 was never quiet but I think 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.530
 that victory is deserved 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.880
 yeah do you know her well rate 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.560
 of weight equipment surprises with every 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.430
 match like that you feel good 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.250
 to master it well 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.650
 yeah no but there today we had 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.600
 a lot a lot a lot of will 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.190
 after after it's true that at the level of 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.830
 mastery in the first half it has 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.360
 been difficult but doing 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.160
 move back yaro at the organization level 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.050
 I think it's good for the team 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.880
 everyone did a good second 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.740
 half time and that's how we do 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.240
 did not win this game when we have the 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.620
 anecdotal ranking or so that's 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.150
 important also here I do not know I 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.830
 know that in general we do not care 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.810
 too much but it also proves that work 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.830
 which is done and done well and that's it 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.360
 it is deserved 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.010
 we try to do the best we can 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.030
 obviously we have the european cup which 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.270
 we take a lot of energy 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.840
 an important match on Thursday at bruges where we 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.610
 will play our qual but it's true 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.650
 that with the sequence of matches we 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.260
 is going around a lot and today at 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.870
 share in montpellier where we are really 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.310
 passed through the boys respond 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.260
 present so it's important to have a 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.940
 group of 25 players each time 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.240
 to be able to rely on one and the other 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.040
 other 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.040
 ok thank you and congratulations to you thank you
