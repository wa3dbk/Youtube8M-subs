00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.249
 Polo Hofer memorable de 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:20.520
 today the second part 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.710
 go to the topic of photo book design 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.630
 Photoshop Today I want to show how monty created double pages from the 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.630
 first part of the death threat series 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.100
 but the photo book software gets clean and the photo book then finally 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.510
 also can order 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.730
 I've used the Zetes here for years because it's one 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.010
 relatively common software is the many providers use Seeber as a percent 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.300
 per club Orc 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.290
 pro if that 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.030
 the 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.050
 Suppliers Amazon are like here the Euro Trap oto if that the MOPO like the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.510
 dm-drogerie 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.510
 or other providers are using the same software 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.510
 which is synonymous then set up so I look now here on Cebe 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.840
 Photobooks wants to set up photobook on photo paper 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.430
 This brings more shine and students often have 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.100
 I have it here now 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.790
 the theme photobook XL that is this 30 by 30 centimeters size 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.740
 For this we have the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.289
 created and optimized per double pages 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.960
 I can the double-sided 30 by 30 centimeters has also problem-free 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.080
 Here, the 21 times 21 bookstores leads that shows then as a goal there are 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.080
 show here too now 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.730
 say I want to design without an assistant 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.619
 and since so far with Coburg with that now on the basis of page 2 3 thus show 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.609
 happy now here on page 2 3 of these pre-made percentages 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.479
 Picture Felix Doerr lets himself be an enforcer then pusher then 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.669
 on the keyboard that hated away 

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:13.469
 and have mine now 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:15.429
 just something 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:18.549
 white remains and we are looking for here now 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:20.959
 Mayländer 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.009
 at the Euro will survive 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.999
 photobook 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.999
 amounted 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:29.679
 Iris percent 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:34.279
 new opera come pull my pearl displayed here is also the picture 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:37.979
 to increase that a little 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:41.799
 this double page created at the first part I click the right one 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.119
 Click on it and place Valerio photo as a background on both sides 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:50.229
 and already my picture is here 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:51.630
 in the photo book 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.209
 as complete 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.629
 Inserted double page 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.039
 I can go to the next page 

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:01.189
 Trichet here again the two percent 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:06.090
 Pictures the two pictures Klestil and can now the next double page here 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:07.399
 insert 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:10.249
 and Gahan the book then 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:13.249
 also exists 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.359
 more important but back 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.099
 and no matter 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.759
 the same dress as with the dress 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:27.479
 smaller screen works as long as the aspect ratio is one to 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:29.659
 One is as we put it 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.049
 I can also create a 20 by 21 centimeter book 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.689
 again without an assistant 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:38.549
 the re-election is the double pages 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:39.989
 remove the 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.669
 pre-made practice pictures quest her 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:47.229
 Velcro right-click on the sample to insert lateral 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:50.039
 and select photo as background picture 

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:53.199
 and I also get this inserted wonderfully 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:55.779
 Yes, that 

00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:59.859
 the op photobook design photo book exhibition 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.069
 give 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.269
 next tutorial 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.799
 Pröll one of the next the Taurus I show then too 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.799
 The result should be so secured Photo Gruber notes 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:15.299
 a bit bigger than this 30 by 30 percent picture I stand 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:18.979
 I'm curious how it will be I think the next few days it will be with me 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:19.999
 eintrudelt 

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:23.449
 I will be one percent 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.900
 a few lines above write about the provider, I think 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:30.409
 There is interesting information every day 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:33.559
 to tell and show 

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:38.599
 As always, I look forward to your comments BA provides Mio EUR photo books 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:41.020
 which software uses here 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.150
 February, which features Robert, there is the function I have here now 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.630
 used but also in Euros on the NeuroConn booked Softfair 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:52.789
 and already with 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.409
 directly on board so that percent would get along even without Photoshop 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.670
 if you have any questions, please design with Photoshop or with 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:06.139
 those with other programs 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.599
 then the Aldi just as a comment 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:12.249
 the Lakers crowd listen to that and see you next time
