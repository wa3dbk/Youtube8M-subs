with that part so then when I saw that

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.149 
with that part so then when I saw that
you<00:01:46.880> could<00:01:47.119> build<00:01:47.390> without<00:01:47.929> having<00:01:48.740> that

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
you could build without having that

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.039 
you could build without having that
right<00:01:49.640> artists<00:01:50.210> and<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:51.289> poison<00:01:52.009> and<00:01:52.220> noise

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
right artists and the poison and noise

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.870 
right artists and the poison and noise
you<00:01:54.049> know<00:01:54.200> really<00:01:54.380> excludes<00:01:55.130> other<00:01:55.399> people

just became that I don't even care that
much<00:02:39.170> about<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.799> the<00:02:40.579> cob<00:02:40.910> itself<00:02:41.540> is<00:02:41.870> the

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
much about the the cob itself is the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.000 
much about the the cob itself is the
process<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.489> people<00:02:43.940> getting<00:02:44.239> together

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
sharing and realizing that they can do
