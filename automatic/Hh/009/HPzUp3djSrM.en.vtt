it was a light lace which was great

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.649

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
weather I thought it was gonna be really

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.610 
weather I thought it was gonna be really
hot

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
hot

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.550 
hot

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
it was long to the ground but it had a

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.270 
it was long to the ground but it had a
slip

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
slip

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.660 
slip
that<00:01:57.760> was<00:01:58.000> short<00:01:58.830> so<00:01:59.830> you<00:01:59.920> could<00:02:00.190> kind<00:02:00.430> of<00:02:00.490> see

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
that was short so you could kind of see

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.650 
that was short so you could kind of see
my<00:02:00.820> legs<00:02:01.090> in<00:02:01.450> between<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.470> slip<00:02:03.660> especially

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
my legs in between the slip especially

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.600 
my legs in between the slip especially
with<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:05.110> lighting<00:02:05.500> of<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:06.009> evening<00:02:06.460> I<00:02:06.550> think

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
with the lighting of the evening I think

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.660 
with the lighting of the evening I think
that<00:02:06.880> it<00:02:07.060> did<00:02:07.300> the<00:02:07.450> dress<00:02:07.690> justice<00:02:11.670> it's

that it did the dress justice it's

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.480 
that it did the dress justice it's
really<00:02:13.030> beautiful<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.920> was<00:02:15.070> interesting

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
really beautiful it was interesting

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.650 
really beautiful it was interesting
because<00:02:15.520> she<00:02:15.760> chose<00:02:15.970> something<00:02:16.390> that<00:02:16.420> was

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
because she chose something that was

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.930 
because she chose something that was

back<00:02:25.810> I<00:02:26.370> think<00:02:27.370> that<00:02:27.489> was<00:02:27.580> like<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.730> quite

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
back I think that was like a quite

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.009 
back I think that was like a quite
lovely<00:02:28.540> kind<00:02:28.840> of<00:02:28.930> contrast

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.170 

I<00:02:32.049> think<00:02:32.709> as<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.040> designer<00:02:33.579> I've<00:02:33.760> always<00:02:33.969> been

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
I think as a designer I've always been

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.390 
I think as a designer I've always been
very<00:02:34.420> interested<00:02:34.780> in<00:02:35.349> what<00:02:35.859> the<00:02:35.950> codes<00:02:36.219> of

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
very interested in what the codes of

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.970 
very interested in what the codes of
femininity<00:02:36.819> are<00:02:37.230> what<00:02:38.230> are<00:02:38.349> the<00:02:38.439> things<00:02:38.709> that

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
femininity are what are the things that

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.839 
femininity are what are the things that
make<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:40.120> woman<00:02:40.260> feel<00:02:41.260> like<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:42.159> woman

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
make a woman feel like a woman

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.890 
make a woman feel like a woman
whether<00:02:43.060> it's<00:02:43.299> fit<00:02:43.719> or<00:02:44.079> material<00:02:44.829> or<00:02:45.099> a<00:02:45.189> color

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
whether it's fit or material or a color

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.229 
whether it's fit or material or a color
do<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:46.989> love<00:02:47.230> I<00:02:47.739> do<00:02:47.829> it<00:02:48.129> love<00:02:48.310> it<00:02:48.459> number<00:02:49.060> one<00:02:49.209> I

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
do you love I do it love it number one I

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.330 
do you love I do it love it number one I
think<00:02:49.359> it's<00:02:49.719> understanding<00:02:50.379> how<00:02:50.409> to<00:02:50.650> create

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
think it's understanding how to create

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.379 
think it's understanding how to create
something<00:02:51.519> that<00:02:51.670> makes<00:02:51.969> someone<00:02:52.120> feel

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
something that makes someone feel

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.879 
something that makes someone feel
completely<00:02:52.930> comfortable<00:02:54.180> it's<00:02:55.180> gorgeous

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
completely comfortable it's gorgeous

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:59.970 
completely comfortable it's gorgeous
she'd<00:02:56.889> spend<00:02:57.280> time<00:02:57.909> in<00:02:58.359> the<00:02:58.689> dress<00:02:58.930> at<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.799> Met

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
she'd spend time in the dress at the Met

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.709 
she'd spend time in the dress at the Met
so<00:03:00.189> I<00:03:00.280> think<00:03:00.340> she<00:03:00.790> kind<00:03:00.969> of<00:03:01.000> understood<00:03:01.450> how<00:03:01.689> it

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:01.719 
so I think she kind of understood how it

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.199 
so I think she kind of understood how it
fit<00:03:02.109> she<00:03:02.379> understood<00:03:02.739> how<00:03:02.950> she<00:03:03.010> moved<00:03:03.849> in<00:03:04.090> it

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
fit she understood how she moved in it

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.250 
fit she understood how she moved in it
and<00:03:04.389> I<00:03:04.450> think<00:03:04.510> maybe<00:03:04.689> that's<00:03:04.959> what's<00:03:05.139> so

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
and I think maybe that's what's so

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.330 
and I think maybe that's what's so
special<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:05.680> wasn't<00:03:05.919> about<00:03:06.069> like<00:03:06.220> starting

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
special it wasn't about like starting

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.800 
special it wasn't about like starting
from<00:03:06.639> scratch<00:03:06.970> or<00:03:07.269> creating<00:03:07.629> something

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
from scratch or creating something

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.659 
from scratch or creating something
that's<00:03:07.989> completely<00:03:08.230> bespoke<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.489> was

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:09.669 
that's completely bespoke it was

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:11.670 
that's completely bespoke it was
creating<00:03:10.239> something<00:03:10.599> that<00:03:10.750> she<00:03:10.900> knew<00:03:11.079> she<00:03:11.349> had

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
creating something that she knew she had

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.419 
creating something that she knew she had
an<00:03:12.489> attachment<00:03:13.060> to
