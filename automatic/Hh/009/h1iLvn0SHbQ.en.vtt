00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:25.289
 You look so warm olya 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.869
 consider you lucky what has become 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.650
 vegetarian like that now 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.660
 huge amount of information though 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.579
 hidden but nonetheless all such people 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.570
 don't really become a vegetarian what 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.610
 such a non-piece series is difficult 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.790
 tell me whether humanity will come at all 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.300
 to become vegetarians but thats 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.490
 that vegetarian forehead somehow 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.250
 quietly yes sly that we 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:56.760
 call wrestle positions it seems to me 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.160
 that's great so probably 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.600
 hope it seems to me that everyone is just 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.490
 must understand his measure 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.470
 responsibility of being in this world 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.360
 up to the measure of responsibility that 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.840
 happening around him and how it affects 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.600
 on their surroundings on the environment 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.800
 because yes so seriously and 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.530
 Livestock is the same, too, it 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.170
 pollution cut down 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.170
 unique forests trample and soil and 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.210
 all kinds of waste merge into rivers 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.780
 life it is all destructive 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.610
 affects our planet and what would give 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.920
 we were not looking for whatever mars and we are not 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.990
 mastered in order to finally 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.810
 ruin our planet and further 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.720
 move to a more pleasant place 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:44.460
 nothing will work if we do 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:47.220
 everyone will not begin to understand himself well 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.159
 since you were born on this earth you were born 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.290
 probably not just because you're a chain link 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.780
 called nature and you should 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.659
 understand that if you are in charge 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.350
 this chain is on you much more 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.980
 responsibility than on a rabbit is 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.700
 arguments about ecology and health 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.890
 convinces some but here to say 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.170
 to the people who just saw you 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:17.290
 together with the calf and who are now 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.290
 go to lunch pieces of such a calf 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.400
 Hard to say I would like of course 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.060
 don't shout out any slogans yes people 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:33.410
 stop stop eating meat but 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.870
 this is bloody meat is murder 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.850
 which did not happen before your eyes but 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.610
 your kind of fault because you 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.670
 use it there is a demand it means will 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.950
 offer and therefore in my dining room 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:51.080
 in the restaurant ordering food but limit 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:54.080
 do not even know yourself ask for lunch 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.280
 without meat try to do without meat 1 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.590
 once a week 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.860
 and then you look up to several times 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.740
 and a month and may be our planet 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.920
 will become cleaner and conscience I will become clean 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.959
 and here is one saved calf will 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.350
 walk on the green lawns they roast 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:17.510
 you in the pan what people will say 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:20.570

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.410

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.850

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.050
 sad need to salt pepper 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.120
 preferably another oil to pour and even with 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.470
 then the cucumber will be digestible 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.840
 people have forgotten how to do 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.430

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.840
 read Internet look 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.150
 scroll through the magazines where I have a lot 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.620
 all sorts of information that will help 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.989
 you become a vegetarian 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.060
 and say with regard to your physical 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.989
 preparing you like games 100 big capris 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.479
 boys love sports as much as you 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.790
 help or vice versa you don't feel 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.830
 breakdown well this is such a psychological 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.780
 dependence on animal protein when 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.520
 people think well if you haven't eaten meat well 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.410
 how do you go like bricks 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.960
 will you go and really 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.650
 it's really not true if you just 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.020
 try to eat without animal protein 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.790
 not at least limit yourself to an animal 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.270
 squirrel you will understand how hardy you are 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.910
 become 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.910
 you know when I became completely 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.990
 vegan two and a half years ago 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:51.419
 when I went to the circus with the stars and I'm afraid 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.250
 that if it were not for my veganism I would hardly 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.220
 whether withstood those loads that 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.650
 we kept there all someone more 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.630
 degree tired someone less and when 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.729
 from morning to night this is rehearsing these tricks 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.020
 constantly you somewhere in some 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.830
 physical activity 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.850
 then most certainly came and 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.070
 voiced on the alloy bed to 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.190
 the next morning there was not enough time yet 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.740
 lead some kind of active life according to your 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.200
 main work 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.720
 feel great therefore such 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.539
 delusions that well need to debunk 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:29.430
 I hope that sooner or later before the people 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:32.210
 will come that animal protein aggravate on 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.620
 older as it is called something 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.810
 hypodynamic because after you 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.800
 ate something not so you have nowhere 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.800
 you want to move 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.040
 in Russian
