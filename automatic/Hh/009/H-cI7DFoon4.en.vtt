came from major academic centers
including<00:00:48.850> cambridge<00:00:49.390> Munich<00:00:50.019> on<00:00:50.140> the

University of Chicago to question an

University of Chicago to question an
idea<00:00:53.470> that<00:00:53.949> had<00:00:54.100> dominated<00:00:54.400> science<00:00:55.210> for<00:00:55.530> 150

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
idea that had dominated science for 150

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.420 
idea that had dominated science for 150
years<00:00:56.830> I<00:00:57.690> think<00:00:58.690> Pajaro<00:00:59.050> dunes<00:00:59.339> represented<00:01:00.339> a

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
years I think Pajaro dunes represented a

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.180 
years I think Pajaro dunes represented a
turning<00:01:00.850> point<00:01:00.879> for<00:01:01.390> many<00:01:01.719> of<00:01:01.870> us

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
turning point for many of us

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.160 
turning point for many of us
individually<00:01:03.190> we<00:01:03.790> all<00:01:04.000> had<00:01:04.270> questions<00:01:04.869> about

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
individually we all had questions about

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.230 
individually we all had questions about
evolutionary<00:01:05.830> theory<00:01:06.340> but<00:01:06.790> when<00:01:06.910> we<00:01:07.000> came

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
evolutionary theory but when we came

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.270 
evolutionary theory but when we came
together<00:01:07.479> each<00:01:07.960> person<00:01:08.500> brought<00:01:08.770> something

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
together each person brought something

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.430 
together each person brought something
of<00:01:09.399> their<00:01:09.550> own<00:01:09.580> to<00:01:09.910> the<00:01:10.090> table<00:01:10.360> and<00:01:10.690> suddenly

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
of their own to the table and suddenly

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.590 
of their own to the table and suddenly
we<00:01:11.590> all<00:01:11.830> had<00:01:12.070> a<00:01:12.100> glimpse<00:01:12.520> of<00:01:12.729> a<00:01:13.180> new<00:01:13.390> way<00:01:13.570> of

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
we all had a glimpse of a new way of

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.359 
we all had a glimpse of a new way of
looking<00:01:13.869> at<00:01:14.110> life<00:01:14.170> and<00:01:14.619> none<00:01:14.800> of<00:01:14.830> us<00:01:15.009> had

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
looking at life and none of us had

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.770 
looking at life and none of us had
individually<00:01:16.180> seen<00:01:16.450> before<00:01:16.899> I<00:01:18.539> would<00:01:19.539> have<00:01:19.630> to

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
individually seen before I would have to

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.690 
individually seen before I would have to
say<00:01:19.810> that<00:01:20.170> this<00:01:20.289> was<00:01:20.500> an<00:01:20.649> intense<00:01:21.100> period<00:01:21.460> of

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
say that this was an intense period of

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.760 
say that this was an intense period of
time<00:01:21.910> in<00:01:22.090> my<00:01:22.180> life<00:01:22.420> it<00:01:22.720> just<00:01:23.140> seemed<00:01:23.440> that

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
time in my life it just seemed that

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.389 
time in my life it just seemed that
there<00:01:24.729> was<00:01:25.030> something<00:01:25.479> here<00:01:26.020> much<00:01:26.320> more

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
there was something here much more

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.999 
there was something here much more
intellectually<00:01:27.399> satisfying<00:01:27.640> than<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:29.009> view

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
intellectually satisfying than the view

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.550 
intellectually satisfying than the view
that<00:01:30.039> I<00:01:30.310> had<00:01:30.490> held<00:01:30.789> up<00:01:31.060> until<00:01:31.690> this<00:01:31.930> time

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.500 

looking<00:01:35.560> back<00:01:35.740> on<00:01:35.800> it<00:01:36.010> now<00:01:36.130> I<00:01:36.310> think<00:01:37.000> that<00:01:37.240> gave

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
looking back on it now I think that gave

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.600 
looking back on it now I think that gave
me<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:37.900> motivation<00:01:38.050> to<00:01:38.530> actually<00:01:38.710> look<00:01:39.460> at

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
me the motivation to actually look at

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.100 
me the motivation to actually look at
the<00:01:39.670> evidence<00:01:39.910> and<00:01:40.240> just<00:01:40.510> see<00:01:40.900> where<00:01:41.050> I

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
the evidence and just see where I

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.280 
the evidence and just see where I
thought<00:01:41.680> it<00:01:41.800> pointed<00:01:42.280> I<00:01:45.540> realized<00:01:46.540> that<00:01:46.720> this

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
thought it pointed I realized that this

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.840 
thought it pointed I realized that this
was<00:01:47.470> bigger<00:01:47.680> than<00:01:47.860> any<00:01:48.070> one<00:01:48.190> person<00:01:48.340> or

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
was bigger than any one person or

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.100 
was bigger than any one person or
disciplined<00:01:49.390> and<00:01:49.570> this<00:01:49.720> was<00:01:49.870> the<00:01:49.990> beginning

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
disciplined and this was the beginning

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.560 
disciplined and this was the beginning
of<00:01:50.470> a<00:01:50.860> community<00:01:51.340> of<00:01:51.430> scientists<00:01:52.180> who<00:01:52.270> are<00:01:52.300> now

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
of a community of scientists who are now

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.570 
of a community of scientists who are now
willing<00:01:52.900> to<00:01:53.110> face<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:53.740> fundamental<00:01:54.220> mystery

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
willing to face the fundamental mystery

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:35.820 
willing to face the fundamental mystery
of<00:01:54.880> life's<00:01:55.240> origin

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.920 

I<00:02:35.920> sometimes<00:02:36.640> wonder<00:02:36.910> why<00:02:37.330> anybody<00:02:37.630> talks

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
I sometimes wonder why anybody talks

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.110 
I sometimes wonder why anybody talks
about<00:02:38.170> anything<00:02:38.380> else<00:02:38.710> because<00:02:39.370> this<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:39.880> the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
about anything else because this is the

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.300 
about anything else because this is the
most<00:02:40.300> interesting<00:02:40.930> topic<00:02:41.320> there<00:02:41.500> is<00:02:41.650> where<00:02:42.220> do

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
most interesting topic there is where do

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.250 
most interesting topic there is where do
we<00:02:42.430> come<00:02:42.610> from<00:02:42.670> how<00:02:43.330> did<00:02:43.510> we<00:02:43.630> get<00:02:43.810> here<00:02:44.020> what

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
we come from how did we get here what

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.590 
we come from how did we get here what
brought<00:02:44.530> us<00:02:44.560> into<00:02:44.860> existence<00:02:45.520> what<00:02:46.210> is<00:02:46.330> our

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
brought us into existence what is our

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.730 
brought us into existence what is our
relationship<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:47.560> reality<00:02:47.740> as<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.250> whole<00:02:48.580> you

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
relationship to reality as a whole you

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.320 
relationship to reality as a whole you
look<00:02:50.740> at<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:50.980> incredible<00:02:51.100> diversity<00:02:51.730> and

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
look at the incredible diversity and

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.810 
look at the incredible diversity and
complexity<00:02:52.900> of<00:02:53.020> life<00:02:53.350> and<00:02:53.710> inevitably<00:02:54.310> the

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
complexity of life and inevitably the

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.730 
complexity of life and inevitably the
question<00:02:55.240> arises<00:02:55.510> what<00:02:56.050> brought<00:02:56.410> all<00:02:56.650> this

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
question arises what brought all this

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.150 
question arises what brought all this
into<00:02:57.250> existence<00:02:57.820> was<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:58.690> simply<00:02:58.920> chance<00:02:59.920> and

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
into existence was it simply chance and

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.180 
into existence was it simply chance and
necessity<00:03:00.300> undirected<00:03:01.300> natural<00:03:01.900> forces<00:03:02.410> or

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
necessity undirected natural forces or

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.510 
necessity undirected natural forces or
is<00:03:03.850> there<00:03:04.030> something<00:03:04.270> else<00:03:04.570> going<00:03:04.780> on<00:03:05.170> is

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
is there something else going on is

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.930 
is there something else going on is
there<00:03:06.520> a<00:03:06.550> purpose<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:07.300> plan<00:03:07.750> a<00:03:08.170> design<00:03:08.740> a<00:03:09.130> design

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
there a purpose a plan a design a design

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.870 
there a purpose a plan a design a design
due<00:03:10.270> to<00:03:10.480> an<00:03:10.570> intelligent<00:03:11.140> cause<00:03:11.380> I<00:03:11.770> think<00:03:12.400> that

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
due to an intelligent cause I think that

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:21.120 
due to an intelligent cause I think that
is<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.240> fundamental<00:03:13.480> question<00:03:20.130> the

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
is the fundamental question the

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.760 
is the fundamental question the
scientists<00:03:21.670> who<00:03:21.850> came<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:22.150> Pajaro<00:03:22.720> dunes<00:03:22.840> set

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
scientists who came to Pajaro dunes set

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.710 
scientists who came to Pajaro dunes set
out<00:03:23.890> to<00:03:24.070> reexamine<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.760> mystery<00:03:25.300> of<00:03:25.480> life's

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
out to reexamine the mystery of life's
