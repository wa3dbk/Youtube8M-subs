00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.339
 last week apple presented the 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.530
 world its proposals for 2014 in what 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:11.990
 to smartphones refers to two new 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.420
 iphone created based on two profiles of 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.330
 different user but keeping the 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.970
 characteristic seal of the house perhaps 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.460
 this time we have more doubts about 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.119
 what to do if they buy the new iphone that 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.609
 iphone 5 model that and iphone 5 c two 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.970
 powerful very capable phones but with 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:34.850
 two very different objectives for a 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.860
 side we have the iphone 5 efe a terminal 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.200
 that follows in the line of elegance the 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.540
 sobriety high quality finishes 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.510
 and an incredibly hardware section 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.400
 breaker where the 64-bit processor 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.190
 and the fingerprint recognition sensor 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.740
 fingerprints are the big players 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.840
 the other side that you bet 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.270
 apple facing a younger client 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.210
 dynamic and active results in a 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.700
 Model called iphone 5 colorful ce with 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.350
 option to change casings using 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.960
 the tough polycarbonate like 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.880
 hedge material that yes at the level of 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.579
 Hardware does not offer any advance 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.520
 about the current iphone5 elegance 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:15.770
 quality and power or dynamism color and 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.180
 resistance maybe this is the 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.600
 approach of many of you 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.759
 when you ask yourself which one to buy 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.310
 you have to include another variable more than 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.310
 weight the price the difference between 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.740
 basic models of the iphone 5 s and 5 c is 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.479
 of 100 euros or dollars both for the 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.399
 free modality as for 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.619
 subsidies under permanence in a 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.140
 contract in Spain there are no prices 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.479
 officers under contract but we can 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.659
 get an idea knowing that in the USA 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.990
 in model 5 c you can get it from 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:51.020
 $ 99 against $ 299 from 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.869
 iphone 5 s always clear is with a 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.709
 24-month stay contract with 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.709
 which one would you be?
