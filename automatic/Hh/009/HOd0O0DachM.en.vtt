your tank if you have a plan to take the

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.800 
your tank if you have a plan to take the

plants will absorb more nutrients and

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.260 
plants will absorb more nutrients and
that<00:02:15.930> will<00:02:16.110> kind<00:02:16.319> of<00:02:16.440> minimize<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.700> here

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
that will kind of minimize the here

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.240 
that will kind of minimize the here
algae<00:02:18.540> growth<00:02:18.720> or<00:02:19.020> completely<00:02:19.530> eliminated

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
algae growth or completely eliminated

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.550 
algae growth or completely eliminated

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810

even<00:03:21.840> know<00:03:21.989> what<00:03:22.140> they're<00:03:22.290> doing<00:03:22.560> so<00:03:23.549> there<00:03:24.090> is

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
even know what they're doing so there is

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.110 
even know what they're doing so there is
this<00:03:24.590> like<00:03:25.590> time<00:03:25.980> period<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.400> would<00:03:26.549> call<00:03:26.790> I

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
this like time period I would call I

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.569 
this like time period I would call I
would<00:03:27.480> call<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.140> healing<00:03:28.380> phase<00:03:28.769> and<00:03:29.070> it's

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
would call it the healing phase and it's

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.370 
would call it the healing phase and it's
when<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:29.850> get<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.030> fish<00:03:30.360> from<00:03:30.600> Petsmart<00:03:30.959> or<00:03:31.350> a

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
when you get a fish from Petsmart or a

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.050 
when you get a fish from Petsmart or a
huge<00:03:32.360> pet<00:03:33.360> shop<00:03:33.780> chain<00:03:34.140> store<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:34.739> know

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
huge pet shop chain store you know

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.090 
huge pet shop chain store you know
that's<00:03:36.060> been<00:03:36.360> in<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.630> tank<00:03:36.870> with<00:03:37.380> hundreds<00:03:38.010> of

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
that's been in a tank with hundreds of

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.410 
that's been in a tank with hundreds of
other<00:03:38.280> fish<00:03:38.519> probably<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.269> you<00:03:40.230> know<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.769> the

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
other fish probably and you know it the

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.190 
other fish probably and you know it the
environments<00:03:42.420> been<00:03:42.570> disrupted<00:03:43.079> because

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
environments been disrupted because

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.600 
environments been disrupted because
people<00:03:43.769> are<00:03:43.860> constantly<00:03:44.130> putting<00:03:44.430> their

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
people are constantly putting their

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.610 
people are constantly putting their
hands<00:03:44.760> in<00:03:44.910> there<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.180> grab<00:03:45.329> fish<00:03:45.600> out<00:03:45.810> they

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
hands in there to grab fish out they

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.590 
hands in there to grab fish out they
probably<00:03:46.829> haven't<00:03:47.070> been<00:03:47.160> feet<00:03:47.519> fed<00:03:48.120> very<00:03:48.329> well

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
probably haven't been feet fed very well

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.729 
probably haven't been feet fed very well
because<00:03:48.930> there's<00:03:49.079> so<00:03:49.230> many<00:03:49.320> other<00:03:49.500> fish

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
because there's so many other fish

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.920 
because there's so many other fish
around<00:03:49.980> them<00:03:50.160> so<00:03:50.700> when<00:03:51.329> you<00:03:51.420> get<00:03:51.540> your<00:03:51.660> fish

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
around them so when you get your fish

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.770 
around them so when you get your fish
from<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.680> big<00:03:53.160> store<00:03:53.459> like<00:03:53.640> that<00:03:53.670> for<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.540> first

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
from a big store like that for the first

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.120 
from a big store like that for the first
couple<00:03:55.019> weeks<00:03:55.260> I<00:03:55.440> would<00:03:55.500> say<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.829> fish<00:03:55.980> is

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
couple weeks I would say the fish is

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.229 
couple weeks I would say the fish is
going<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.310> be<00:03:56.400> going<00:03:56.579> through<00:03:56.790> kind<00:03:56.970> of<00:03:57.090> like<00:03:57.209> a

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
going to be going through kind of like a

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.440 
going to be going through kind of like a
healing<00:03:57.720> phase<00:03:57.930> he'll<00:03:58.860> be<00:03:59.010> you<00:03:59.970> know<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.209> fins

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
healing phase he'll be you know the fins

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.120 
healing phase he'll be you know the fins
on<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.930> fish<00:04:01.079> will<00:04:01.260> probably<00:04:01.560> be<00:04:01.650> all<00:04:01.799> messed

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
on the fish will probably be all messed

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.610 
on the fish will probably be all messed
up<00:04:02.510> sometimes<00:04:03.510> you<00:04:03.930> know<00:04:04.019> that's<00:04:04.350> if<00:04:04.500> you're

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
up sometimes you know that's if you're

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.110 
up sometimes you know that's if you're
very<00:04:04.890> selective<00:04:05.370> of<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.549> fish<00:04:05.700> you<00:04:05.820> get<00:04:05.940> from

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
very selective of the fish you get from

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.699 
very selective of the fish you get from
Petsmart<00:04:06.450> if<00:04:06.780> you<00:04:06.930> you<00:04:07.260> know<00:04:07.350> look<00:04:07.530> at<00:04:07.620> the

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
Petsmart if you you know look at the

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.289 
Petsmart if you you know look at the
ones<00:04:07.890> that<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.130> buy<00:04:08.160> which<00:04:08.549> most<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.120> time

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
ones that you buy which most the time

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.479 
ones that you buy which most the time
you<00:04:09.450> do<00:04:09.600> but<00:04:09.930> it's<00:04:10.829> really<00:04:10.980> hard<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.340> notice

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
you do but it's really hard to notice

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.250 
you do but it's really hard to notice
really<00:04:11.940> small<00:04:12.209> details<00:04:12.630> until<00:04:12.900> you<00:04:12.959> put<00:04:13.140> them

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
really small details until you put them

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.840 
really small details until you put them
in<00:04:13.380> your<00:04:13.440> tank<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:13.829> you<00:04:13.890> actually<00:04:14.070> take<00:04:14.790> a

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
in your tank and you actually take a

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.839 
in your tank and you actually take a
good<00:04:15.060> look<00:04:15.239> at<00:04:15.390> them<00:04:15.570> so<00:04:16.340> the<00:04:17.340> healing<00:04:17.519> phase

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
good look at them so the healing phase

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.670 
good look at them so the healing phase
for<00:04:18.330> me<00:04:18.450> I<00:04:18.479> would<00:04:18.720> say<00:04:18.870> is<00:04:18.989> about<00:04:19.200> two<00:04:19.440> weeks

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
for me I would say is about two weeks

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.160 
for me I would say is about two weeks
and<00:04:19.830> usually<00:04:20.190> that's<00:04:20.370> what<00:04:20.549> happens<00:04:20.849> with

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
and usually that's what happens with

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.110 
and usually that's what happens with
the<00:04:21.350> fish<00:04:21.530> that<00:04:21.560> I<00:04:21.800> get<00:04:22.040> they're<00:04:22.910> malnourished

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
the fish that I get they're malnourished

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.470 
the fish that I get they're malnourished
you<00:04:23.810> know<00:04:24.040> they're<00:04:25.040> the<00:04:25.760> fins<00:04:26.030> don't<00:04:26.270> really

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
you know they're the fins don't really

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.970 
you know they're the fins don't really
look<00:04:26.600> that<00:04:26.840> great<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.290> coloring<00:04:27.710> doesn't

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
look that great the coloring doesn't

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.680 
look that great the coloring doesn't
look<00:04:28.100> that<00:04:28.130> great<00:04:28.430> and<00:04:28.730> it's<00:04:29.150> just<00:04:29.210> because<00:04:29.660> of

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
look that great and it's just because of

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.360 
look that great and it's just because of
you<00:04:30.110> know<00:04:30.200> the<00:04:30.410> poor<00:04:30.620> diet<00:04:30.890> that<00:04:31.160> they're

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
you know the poor diet that they're

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.900 
you know the poor diet that they're
there<00:04:31.610> Fred<00:04:31.880> at<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.480> pet<00:04:32.930> store<00:04:33.140> so<00:04:34.070> in<00:04:34.790> about

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
there Fred at the pet store so in about

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.060 
there Fred at the pet store so in about
two<00:04:35.180> weeks<00:04:35.210> time<00:04:35.450> I'm<00:04:35.750> pretty<00:04:35.960> sure<00:04:36.170> that<00:04:36.500> all

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
two weeks time I'm pretty sure that all

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.950 
two weeks time I'm pretty sure that all
the<00:04:37.610> fish<00:04:37.790> the<00:04:38.030> new<00:04:38.120> fish<00:04:38.300> that<00:04:38.480> I<00:04:38.540> got<00:04:38.720> will

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
the fish the new fish that I got will

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.570 
the fish the new fish that I got will
really<00:04:39.470> come<00:04:39.620> back<00:04:39.650> to<00:04:39.830> life<00:04:40.160> they'll<00:04:40.430> gain

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
really come back to life they'll gain

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.760 
really come back to life they'll gain
more<00:04:40.790> weight<00:04:40.970> and<00:04:41.240> their<00:04:41.990> colors<00:04:42.320> will<00:04:42.500> look<00:04:42.650> a

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
more weight and their colors will look a

reactor<00:05:35.000> called<00:05:35.360> the<00:05:35.570> mr1<00:05:36.260> or<00:05:36.590> I<00:05:37.070> think<00:05:37.430> it's

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
reactor called the mr1 or I think it's

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.730 
reactor called the mr1 or I think it's
an<00:05:37.850> x-ray<00:05:38.330> or<00:05:38.750> one<00:05:38.990> or<00:05:39.110> something<00:05:39.320> like<00:05:39.500> that

it's a really nice meaty reactor it's
made<00:05:41.810> out<00:05:41.930> of<00:05:41.960> acrylic<00:05:42.140> and<00:05:42.680> it's<00:05:42.890> really

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
made out of acrylic and it's really

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.490 
made out of acrylic and it's really
solid<00:05:44.180> you<00:05:44.480> know<00:05:44.660> the<00:05:44.810> build<00:05:44.990> quality<00:05:45.230> is

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
solid you know the build quality is

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.800 
solid you know the build quality is
really<00:05:45.680> really<00:05:45.950> good<00:05:46.190> and<00:05:46.430> I<00:05:46.460> really<00:05:47.270> really

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
really really good and I really really

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.050 
really really good and I really really
want<00:05:48.140> one<00:05:48.320> because<00:05:48.470> all<00:05:49.280> the<00:05:49.520> media<00:05:49.790> reactors

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
want one because all the media reactors

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.150 
want one because all the media reactors
that<00:05:50.180> I<00:05:50.210> bought<00:05:50.480> they<00:05:50.720> break<00:05:51.050> and<00:05:51.380> the<00:05:51.710> plastic

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
that I bought they break and the plastic

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.390 
that I bought they break and the plastic
is<00:05:52.280> very<00:05:52.370> brittle<00:05:52.850> and<00:05:53.350> even<00:05:54.350> after<00:05:54.650> two<00:05:55.010> you

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
is very brittle and even after two you

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.790 
is very brittle and even after two you
know<00:05:55.600> times<00:05:56.600> of<00:05:56.780> doing<00:05:56.960> maintenance<00:05:57.200> on<00:05:57.500> them

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
know times of doing maintenance on them

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.770 
know times of doing maintenance on them
is<00:05:58.040> when<00:05:58.550> they<00:05:58.700> finally<00:05:59.180> break<00:05:59.330> it's<00:05:59.570> just

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
is when they finally break it's just

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.600 
is when they finally break it's just
they're<00:06:00.770> not<00:06:00.800> made<00:06:01.160> that<00:06:01.340> way

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
they're not made that way

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.200 
they're not made that way
so<00:06:01.730> the<00:06:02.420> mr1<00:06:02.990> of<00:06:03.380> the<00:06:03.710> next<00:06:04.310> reason<00:06:04.580> the<00:06:04.970> next

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210 
so the mr1 of the next reason the next

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.040 
so the mr1 of the next reason the next
root<00:06:05.360> mr1

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
root mr1

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.000 
root mr1
are<00:06:06.430> there<00:06:07.430> those<00:06:08.360> mini<00:06:08.600> reactors<00:06:09.110> I<00:06:09.380> from

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.010
