00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.120
 normal 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.890
 That also finds that a Dutch championship is to set our customers 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.409
 our distribution centers 

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:36.969
 and at times how fast they rent a truck 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.530
 after all, other people at work also motivate the ex feyenoord 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.710
 welcome together with our residence times to shorten the trucks and cyclists 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.320
 I am happy to have the best distribution centers every week 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.540
 end of the competition 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.680
 is the best distribution center for Dutch champion students 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.050
 C1000 also employees that a country with a very good ability 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.760
 call attention to the market 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.200
 with proposals 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.760
 forest at 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.990
 this one is 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.990
 solve the mood of life and death in that we 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.740
 the channel has a range of 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.110
 then get it 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.090
 instead of just being quieter then you can be the one that has the 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.470
 French Navy that dell know it and with it 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.510
 in his first steps on the articles which date the numbers are one 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.160
 if any and belize on this field 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.130
 we can do a lot with a scanner 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.630
 received there 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.900
 the benefits in the meantime are on the one hand and speeding up the group 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.740
 from different suppliers 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.120
 2 you can think of a top athlete to free drivers 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.560
 it is just that there are better things to pull and two hot 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.830
 and the chance of errors is also considerably reduced 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.420
 because there is advance 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.450
 know what I received and I need a manual for that to attack 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.370
 the mat in deventer that danger 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.360
 but the old way of receiving we thought I was from the 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.329
 supplier sent to the logistics service provider 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:11.969
 this made the advance not exactly what the car was in practice and therefore 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:13.129
 we had to 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.550
 every platoon half past seven in books and even though make the link between the 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.260
 physical counting and the associated administrative data 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.280
 Then you should think of the TNT number of pollen on the pellets and the and endangered 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:29.509
 we have also seen from practice that the 80 is the result of research 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:32.599
 can save percent of time through violating the pen 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.359
 climbing in combination with Nazis of the right 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.590
 there we want to combine the benefits of a meaningful life with it 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:42.659
 area of ​​lighting but it is important to sell speech 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:43.249
 to make 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:47.699
 To give an example is morse data, you must make clearer agreements 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:50.699
 what level should order so that it is also unambiguous 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.769
 in the event of disturbances in the marquee 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.769
 because not for you 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.149
 Dennis 2015 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:04.409
 busy for a year and a half to hit the east side of the reception and with that 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:05.769
 of his message 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.870
 unfortunately I can state that most are heading in the same direction 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.959
 and on almost 10 percent of all purchase orders we still have a long way to go 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.089
 to go 

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:18.709
 but the that everyone the same way he plays guitar from mark more and more 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.519
 the side 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.759
 Gerard fully confident that it is resisting this year 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:24.379
 so well off
