but it uses a flatted fifth to start
with<00:01:07.610> so<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.880> uses<00:01:09.150> power<00:01:09.510> cords<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.260> it

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
it's one notch better than 11 so it's if

your fingerboard fairly well then its

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.240 
your fingerboard fairly well then its
DNA<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.880> 14<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.540> five<00:01:30.810> but<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.740> starts<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.130> an

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
DNA it's 14 in five but it starts on an

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.100 
DNA it's 14 in five but it starts on an
A<00:01:32.340> flat<00:01:32.549> or<00:01:32.909> g<00:01:33.270> sharp<00:01:33.540> whatever<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.930> want<00:01:34.049> to

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
A flat or g sharp whatever you want to

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.480 
A flat or g sharp whatever you want to
call<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.500> actually<00:01:34.650> call<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.100> an<00:01:35.189> A<00:01:35.280> flat

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
call it I actually call it an A flat

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.450 
call it I actually call it an A flat
because<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.119> should<00:01:36.329> be<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.920> key<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.159> D

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
because it should be a in the key of D

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.620 
because it should be a in the key of D
but<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.090> goes<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.509> flat<00:01:40.549> which<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.729> eleventh

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
but it goes a flat which is eleventh

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.230 
but it goes a flat which is eleventh
fret<00:01:42.780> down<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> tenth<00:01:44.250> fret<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:48.090> then

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
fret down to the tenth fret and and then

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.460 
fret down to the tenth fret and and then
a<00:01:48.270> slide<00:01:48.630> out<00:01:48.659> from<00:01:49.579> the<00:01:50.579> 8th<00:01:50.970> fret<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:52.259> that's

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
slide and then to the d so the first

part<00:04:24.040> as<00:04:24.250> well<00:04:25.240> it's<00:04:26.190> more<00:04:27.190> complicated<00:04:27.640> than

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
part as well it's more complicated than

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.200 
part as well it's more complicated than
this<00:04:28.180> but<00:04:28.570> to<00:04:28.750> simplify<00:04:29.260> it<00:04:29.320> it's<00:04:29.620> a<00:04:29.800> d7<00:04:30.460> and<00:04:31.169> a

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
this but to simplify it it's a d7 and a

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.960 
this but to simplify it it's a d7 and a
c7<00:04:34.210> so<00:04:34.840> that's

room<00:04:58.170> with<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:58.680> muties<00:04:59.010> stroke<00:05:00.710> because<00:05:01.710> it

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
room with the muties stroke because it

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:20.150 
room with the muties stroke because it
feels<00:05:02.130> really<00:05:02.400> empty<00:05:02.490> without<00:05:19.010> then<00:05:20.010> when<00:05:20.100> you

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
feels really empty without then when you

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:27.909 
feels really empty without then when you
get<00:05:20.250> to<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.460> course

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.839

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:29.849 
sometimes you put the chromatic passing

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:32.510 
sometimes you put the chromatic passing
on<00:05:30.180> and<00:05:30.300> you'll<00:05:30.449> go<00:05:30.539> see<00:05:30.780> these<00:05:30.990> sharp<00:05:31.530> D<00:05:32.310> like
