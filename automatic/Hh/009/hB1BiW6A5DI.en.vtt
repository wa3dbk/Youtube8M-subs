00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.590
 the general society has carried out laboratory tests to 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.500
 to eliminate drug residues also called energetics 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.800
 contained in the edition 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.050
 amounting to more than 700,000 euros this project was supported by the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.689
 rating agencies because a draw 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.370
 up to 240 million euros 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.580
 opera is a company specialized in design and construction 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.210
 a water treatment plant 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.920
 so that created in January 2008 is a Toulouse company 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.370
 and the purpose of the company is to develop innovative techniques 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.610
 which ensure a better protection of our environment and 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.840
 so human health since the inception of the company we have 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.870
 redo the strategic choice to develop new techniques while 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.750
 first by the implementation 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.040
 a team-based research and development service on 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.900
 recruitments specific to all this allowed us to file three patents 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.180
 so is world time who's the lot they say 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.990
 the object of the lot and 18 years the elimination of the elect or optics contained in 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.880
 the other cases what left our biotic 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.100
 the shutter and nobuaki that we will cite as an example 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.280
 antibiotics drugs pesticides synthetic hormones 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.700
 it can proceed to a setting it based on a prototype reactor which is 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.770
 finding downstream of job creation 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.960
 the interest of the membrane actors tilburg stone that of retaining all 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.350
 suspended matter the amendment a screen a physical barrier she 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.520
 retains all the particles we have bruno at the exit of the uncle membranes 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.520
 allows thies in two parts 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.240
 we pass then it's scary in the photochemical reactor 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.340
 and German 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.000
 photochemical tractors and my flaws make swell with this 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.359
 energy 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:11.469
 break the molecules 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:15.909
 a chain reaction that will lead to the formation of carbon dioxide 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.249
 of water it of mineral acids 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:21.879
 so products that are not harmful to the environment this project will have 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.199
 could not see the day without a team of partners particularly involved 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:27.230
 as 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.760
 from paul-sabatier university with his photochemistry laboratory the agency of 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.540
 adour-garonne water makes it air from the European community the institute the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.640
 the anti-cancerous claudie group of toulouse Toulouse great toulouse 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.859
 welcome all this under the mastery of craft of the association 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.779
 it's an innovative method that 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:51.389
 it remains rather confidential although today's day the press 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:55.489
 and then the Russians that if trades bottomless an echo more and more broad at 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.489
 level of specific treatment of medical effluents 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.109
 as a forerunner and we celebrate 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.499
 show it 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:07.009
 the innovation in this area as in the medical field bettors 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:08.299
 after all these months 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.359
 experiences we are totally not scared 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.549
 to size and a water treatment plant that will eliminate 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.670
 the excess of bioethics in the world of industry and in the world of water 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:22.089
 drinking the last straight is to eliminate the excess of god 

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:25.089
 which is located in effluents including hospitable 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.399
 in the form of a mixture of organic matter at the moment world 

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:30.749
 all residues 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:32.129
 the medicated 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.939
 from donations only from the metabolism of patients who are treated at home 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:41.379
 directly make the gurus parent the German circuit 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.869
 since the are directed to 

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:46.609
 the de ginestous wastewater treatment plant 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.449
 where sludge is treated 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:53.149
 this step is very important as it was in its time 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.719
 the treatment of radioactive effluents 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:00.499
 an important step because it is part of the fight against 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:01.379
 pollution 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.229
 going in the direction of sustainable development I think that 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:05.579
 gold ap run 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:10.009
 will lead% and on its studies its processes a regulation which will be 

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:13.309
 coercive enough 8% of hospitals 

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:16.309
 and it is absolutely necessary to enroll in this cycle 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.109
 who could it seem to me and percent they have 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.139
 and promising vote of hope in 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:24.669
 faubert of our planet 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.110
 these innovative devices to eliminate guineans djindjic 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.700
 has been taken into account and the integrity the construction of the future clinic 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:32.780
