 the peace ride are friends of 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.960
 olaf ludwig also stayed in cycling 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.669

 was close to thirty years ago 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:32.940
 invincible at that time when he maybe the

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.710
 couple of years also great peace ride 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.570
 moments including this cycling 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.100
 enthusiasm is never believe again 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:56.510
 olaf ludwig 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:00.760
 to the extent that we are now from 96 on 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:03.379
 had it was from 96 to 22 23 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.590
 certainly not because there is always only 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.509
 once a max schmeling the first 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.479

 marcel smock at the tour de france 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.990
 won as already 2013 the erfurter 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.430
 outside germany a superstar like 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.350
 also tony martin with his two 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.780
 Success storytelling was more successful 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.369
 German cycling pros never shied 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.759
 You can still forget the past 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.170
 not escape 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:34.130
 I always argue only for a fair 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.100
 dealing with cycling as well 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.060
 other sports and I believe that 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.759
 between the other sports one 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.479
 Radsport already made a difference 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.619
 I'm not on any of the cycling 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.810
 other sports show 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.700
 in the new so clean coming 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.319
 German profi generation is currently 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.909
 no tour de france overall winner in 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.590
 view which is maybe very good 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.659
 but the boys and John degenkolb 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.520
 should be fair again in the media 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.780
 chance and not from the beginning 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.530
 be slowed down 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.969
 So if it is because Tour winner needs that 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.740
 then it will be reported again 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:09.399
 Poverty certificate for the whole 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.399
 journalism
