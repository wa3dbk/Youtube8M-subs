 retouched dinha with mouth base to 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.500

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.270
 applied this is a salmon a little bit 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.390
 lighter than the other 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.310
 I love that it's very buttery has 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.250
 also the nude colors I do not like much 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.610
 to me because it gets very dry 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.070
 O my kick but there are people who like 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.619
 Do you think you like me or do not I? 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.400
 I do not like it, but it's good that it's beautiful until 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.369
 go 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.600
 I love vibrant colors that heal and 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:40.700
 living the type claudia ray stays 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.700
 magnificent you like too 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.270
 in my life i will not say no 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.270
 have money 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:07.190
 Let's not sign your red lipstick. 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.570
 red lipstick to have to have 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.850
 be carefull otherwise it gets horrible 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.400
 no conditions just a red has 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.340
 be very well spent because otherwise 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.150
 it gives a dirty and bad impression 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:27.680
 made 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:29.930
 iml then they will pass right there goes 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.390
 pass red lipstick is good always 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.790
 using pencils if you do not have a 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.860
 same lipstick tone as a 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.600
 approximate because this will pass lipstick 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.870
 on top and then he will end up paying 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.110
 agreement there I do not have the same color O 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.050
 man a little darker but I like 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.390
 this shade a little bigger this shade 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.830
 that the dark side fact then I go 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.739
 to spend with my side a little more 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:01.220
 then observe personal I trade 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.620
 passing from the middle to the ends 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.410
 because I think it's much easier this way and 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.470
 Then after halfway through, I'll fill up. 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.440
 filling by following the outline of the mouth 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.890
 and also fills the entire middle of the mouth 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.650
 his mouth even with his pencil to 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.400
 fix your lipstick well and make it last 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:25.549
 enough and after passing a pencil in 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.989
 my whole mouth i step button with a lot 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.450
 We care for people because we can 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:33.160
 to erase even more the one that is 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.160
 liquid plus one more little secret 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.180
 do not forget to take off the excess lipstick 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.700
 not to let your teeth red 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.950
 have to stay the same is well 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.820
 white on the inside of the mouth 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.460
 without lipstick and to finish is just to pass 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.070
 a concealer around the mouth 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:56.940
 removing all the boizinhos leaving the 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:59.160
 our beat so perfect I love to pass 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.900
 a corrective with this sigma brush is 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:06.090
 p88 fits perfectly into the 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.580
 my lips in all the clothes of the 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.800
 face and it stays like this then we 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.180
 comes with touches on lipstick is this 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.810

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:19.220
 I love red lipstick it gets so full. 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.220
 of hearts in the air 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:31.010
 you can also wear a neutral look with 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:36.530
 an ounce-type pet scarf 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:38.300

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.980

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.170

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:21.140
 then people liked the tips are 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.470
 Simple tips but a lot of people have 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.880
 sure that you do not touch these things 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.520
 Can we do some makeup? 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.460
 can make all the difference and one 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.330
 makeup simply by changing the color of the 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.000
 lipstick 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.920
 Look at the difference that each person gets 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.540

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.040

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.730
 with the same color tone as your skin 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.800
 lipsticks based on a simple exchange of 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.410

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.380
