00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.770
 good guys we're still here you see 15 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:08.290
 people five in the afternoon we have here 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.510
 a building where are we 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.130
 It does not look good but it's good that it's 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.900
 all snowy 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.049
 this is how we want to look and there is light 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.660
 of the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.039
 the streetlight as you are seeing all good 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.849
 is practically all this park that 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.849
 there is here 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:31.829
 all this is practically elevated and 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:37.790
 It is not cold the truth of having to 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:37.790
 carry like this 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.570
 well it 's all snowed and I say no 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:46.980
 it's cold they said that there was 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.760
 I've been doing pretty bad but hey 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:55.370

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:59.090

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.059

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.100

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.440

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.690
 airport that we have come with a gps 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.390
 which does not work because it does not have 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.720
 updated is the last straw so it's up to us 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.250
 pull mobile maps of whatever and 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.550

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.040

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:34.280

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.560
 We live as we have found 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.570
 our colleagues 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.649

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.660
 more videos in the payne channel than 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.400

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:00.090
 something that is in the dark 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.270

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.270
