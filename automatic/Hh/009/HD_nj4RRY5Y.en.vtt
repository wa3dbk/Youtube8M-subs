I<00:01:36.060> know<00:01:36.300> it<00:01:36.600> sounds<00:01:36.840> thrilling<00:01:37.020> but<00:01:37.230> it's

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
I know it sounds thrilling but it's

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.590 
I know it sounds thrilling but it's
actually<00:01:37.710> very<00:01:37.950> interesting<00:01:38.360> and<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.450> looks

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
actually very interesting and it looks

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.300 
actually very interesting and it looks
at<00:01:39.720> how<00:01:39.840> information<00:01:40.170> seeking<00:01:40.590> isn't<00:01:41.010> like<00:01:41.130> a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
at how information seeking isn't like a

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.850 
at how information seeking isn't like a
distinct<00:01:41.820> process<00:01:42.390> where<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.080> have<00:01:43.110> one

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
distinct process where you have one

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.100 
distinct process where you have one
information<00:01:44.250> question<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.540> search<00:01:45.870> for

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
information question and you search for

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.840 
information question and you search for
one<00:01:46.380> piece<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.710> information<00:01:46.800> to<00:01:47.340> answer<00:01:47.730> it

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
one piece of information to answer it

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.790 
one piece of information to answer it
it's<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.330> much<00:01:48.540> more<00:01:48.810> complicated<00:01:49.530> thing

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
it's a much more complicated thing

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.470 
it's a much more complicated thing
that's<00:01:50.160> wrapped<00:01:50.400> up<00:01:50.580> in<00:01:50.730> our<00:01:50.850> general<00:01:51.180> human

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
that's wrapped up in our general human

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.080 
that's wrapped up in our general human
behavior<00:01:51.870> so<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.110> basically<00:01:52.320> like<00:01:52.440> browsing

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
behavior so it's basically like browsing

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.790 
behavior so it's basically like browsing
and<00:01:54.090> if<00:01:54.630> you're<00:01:54.870> interested<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.410> kind<00:01:55.530> of

and if you're interested in that kind of

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.350 
and if you're interested in that kind of
thing<00:01:55.920> then<00:01:56.070> it's<00:01:56.220> absolutely<00:01:56.910> freakin

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
thing then it's absolutely freakin

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.600 
thing then it's absolutely freakin

good<00:02:24.989> basic<00:02:25.260> grounding<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:26.010> this<00:02:26.160> stuff<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.459> I

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
good basic grounding in this stuff and I

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.070 
good basic grounding in this stuff and I
know<00:02:26.640> not<00:02:26.940> everybody's<00:02:27.420> interested<00:02:27.810> in<00:02:27.900> it

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
know not everybody's interested in it

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.750

but I find it absolutely freakin
fascinating<00:02:30.569> so<00:02:31.260> they<00:02:31.410> go<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.739> few<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.220> the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
fascinating so they go a few of the

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.290 
fascinating so they go a few of the
books<00:02:32.489> that<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.670> have<00:02:32.760> been<00:02:33.060> reading<00:02:33.180> recently

books that I have been reading recently
for<00:02:33.780> university<00:02:34.349> obviously<00:02:34.709> that's<00:02:35.190> not<00:02:35.370> all

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
for university obviously that's not all

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:36.800 
for university obviously that's not all
the<00:02:35.670> reading<00:02:35.940> I'll<00:02:36.060> be<00:02:36.150> doing<00:02:36.390> because<00:02:36.660> this

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
the reading I'll be doing because this

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.900 
the reading I'll be doing because this
was<00:02:37.110> just<00:02:37.350> for<00:02:37.530> some<00:02:37.799> books<00:02:38.010> for<00:02:38.340> one<00:02:38.519> module

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
was just for some books for one module

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.160 
was just for some books for one module
of<00:02:39.060> many<00:02:39.269> modules<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:39.870> haven't<00:02:40.110> even

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
of many modules and I haven't even

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.780 
of many modules and I haven't even
touched<00:02:40.410> on<00:02:40.620> academic<00:02:41.100> journal<00:02:41.400> articles

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
touched on academic journal articles

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.949 
touched on academic journal articles
which<00:02:41.940> is<00:02:42.060> where<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.209> get<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.510> bulk<00:02:42.720> of<00:02:42.840> my

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
which is where I get the bulk of my

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.050 
which is where I get the bulk of my
reading<00:02:43.230> material<00:02:43.650> from<00:02:43.860> but<00:02:44.610> I<00:02:44.790> thought<00:02:44.910> it

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
reading material from but I thought it

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.490 
reading material from but I thought it
would<00:02:45.180> give<00:02:45.299> you<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.420> good<00:02:45.690> idea<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:46.019> some<00:02:46.380> of

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
would give you a good idea of some of

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.860 
would give you a good idea of some of
the<00:02:46.560> topics<00:02:46.830> that<00:02:47.280> somebody<00:02:48.090> in<00:02:48.269> information
