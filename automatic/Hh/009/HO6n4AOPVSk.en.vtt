00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:05.940
 because I think you want to present me 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.740
 a friend if you want to introduce yourself to the 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.660
 life and rolland 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.660
 oliver ron to this dj we will contribute 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.000
 in that producer of the song and the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.449
 themes of which are the cristina and the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.340
 party that I present this year in ibiza 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.870
 christina and every Sunday we had 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.079
 in the moma as the moma we will discuss 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.570
 ibiza we entered that party which is 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.489
 the quintessential strong DJ today 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.110
 roland the one that prepared me all that 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.940
 now he has a james school here in 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.559
 oviedo effectively because they have 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.350
 the fashioned thing of the dishes what of the 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.070
 music 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.600
 house the clubs are no longer heard 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.210
 so much to david bisbal at night but 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.980
 another type of music truly actively to 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.930
 see the subject of electronics is very 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.199
 important then we're always going to 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.479
 have that night redoubt to dance and 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.580
 adequate talent that will never die 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.470
 it's never going to go out of style so now 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.360
 same as there is the theme of the office 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.940
 Jockeys on the rise because it is very media 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.350
 and we are on television continuously 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.890
 and we are because you dance what 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.890
 want 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:33.950
 how do we start we explain this we are going to 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.899
 see are the typical vinyls of always 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.050
 yes but let's say it's a way of 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.670
 pass the analog to digital then 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.560
 this is called a tractor and we're going to click 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.929
 some issues with it come then nothing 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.060
 simply any subject that are the 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:49.789
 topics are on the computer 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.380
 on your computer you can pass it to 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.229
 analog format 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.600
 the deer does not lose the romanticism of 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.979
 DJing the DJ then is one thing that 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.780
 the clubs are used a lot now that 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.649
 we think so we look at what we put in 10 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.030
 hawes is worth seeing a little bit to see 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.229
 example we look here where you 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.270
 you want yes 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.209
 because the song that is making me 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.490
 of cristina and this summer to 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:20.700
 present them because I will pass then 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.700
 this Friday when man 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.400
 good 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.960
 I know you all play here and you're going to put 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.960
 speed changing the subject 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.030
 good 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:07.020
 and after effects to you that 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:09.950
 you play for example you have also the 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.950
 typical high 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:18.299
 the progressive house then here is 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.299
 where he is cheering and up with it 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.269
 two 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.250
 directly 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.430
 and then now I wanted to continue 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.209

00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:01.370

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.370

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:13.620
 others the speed more or less 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.959
 Today is fun to learn how to create 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.639
