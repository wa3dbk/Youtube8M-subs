00:00:06.177 --> 00:00:08.452
 This computer as a print server 

00:00:08.452 --> 00:00:10.728
 Let's configure it for use 

00:00:12.307 --> 00:00:14.443
 Install the print server service 

00:00:14.443 --> 00:00:18.065
 Perform from "Server role management" 

00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:24.335
 Click "Add or remove roles" 

00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:29.396
 Server Configuration Wizard is displayed 

00:00:29.861 --> 00:00:31.579
 Click "Next" 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.898
 A screen to check the connection status is displayed. 

00:00:36.873 --> 00:00:39.567
 The "Server Role" screen opens 

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:44.907
 "File server" or "DNS server" 

00:00:45.604 --> 00:00:47.508
 "DHCP server" etc 

00:00:47.508 --> 00:00:50.805
 You can see that it is already configured 

00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:55.263
 Here, select "Print server" 

00:00:57.353 --> 00:00:59.118
 Click "Next" 

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:04.319
 "Printer and printer driver" screen was displayed 

00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:06.873
 When you configure the print server 

00:01:07.524 --> 00:01:08.499
 User is the first time 

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:11.192
 When connecting to this print server 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.004
 Automatically from the server 

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:16.672
 You can download the driver 

00:01:17.322 --> 00:01:18.669
 For that reason here 

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:22.477
 There are two options to choose from 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.471
 "Windows 2000 and 

00:01:26.471 --> 00:01:29.954
 With Windows XP Client Only 

00:01:29.954 --> 00:01:34.459
 For Windows 2000 and Windows XP users only 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:38.638
 Configure to Download the Printer Driver 

00:01:39.428 --> 00:01:41.800
 In "All Windows Clients" 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.350
 Other versions of clients 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.350
 Target for download 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.810
 However, in that case 

00:01:49.273 --> 00:01:51.180
 Run additional wizards 

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:53.080
 For those clients 

00:01:53.081 --> 00:01:55.910
 I have to prepare a driver 

00:01:57.911 --> 00:01:58.790
 here 

00:01:58.793 --> 00:02:03.670
 "Windows 2000 and Windows XP clients only" 

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:06.220
 I want to select 

00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:08.830
 Click "Next" 

00:02:10.264 --> 00:02:13.700
 A screen to confirm your selection was displayed 

00:02:14.583 --> 00:02:17.180
 Click "Next" as it is 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.240

00:02:23.081 --> 00:02:24.710
 Click "Next" 

00:02:26.332 --> 00:02:29.630
 "Local printer or network printer" 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.090
 The specification screen was displayed 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.670
 Here we are connected to this computer 

00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:39.610
 Try to configure to use a local printer 

00:02:39.614 --> 00:02:44.680
 Click "Next" to proceed with the printer installation 

00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:49.320
 When you install the printer software 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.360
 A screen for specifying the printer share name is displayed 

00:02:54.475 --> 00:02:57.910
 Specify a friendly share name here 

00:03:03.763 --> 00:03:05.760
 As you proceed through the wizard 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.310
 The completion screen is displayed 

00:03:09.568 --> 00:03:10.540
 Click Finish 

00:03:10.543 --> 00:03:14.210
 Complete the "Add Printer Wizard" 

00:03:16.255 --> 00:03:19.320
 "This server has become a print server" 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.810
 It shows 

00:03:21.781 --> 00:03:24.520
 Click “Finish” to close the screen 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.440
 So from Windows XP client 

00:03:29.862 --> 00:03:32.700
 Let's use this shared printer 

00:03:33.577 --> 00:03:35.020
 What you are currently viewing 

00:03:35.388 --> 00:03:37.110
 I have joined this domain 

00:03:37.107 --> 00:03:40.260
 Windows XP client screen 

00:03:42.308 --> 00:03:45.790
 Open "Acteck domain" by double click 

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:51.740
 "SV-acteck" in the window 

00:03:51.735 --> 00:03:54.850
 The name of the server was displayed 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:57.960
 Then open by double click 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.900
 Then besides the shared folder 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.550
 Shared printer is also displayed 

00:04:05.714 --> 00:04:10.030
 "Aktech Shared Printer" and the shared name are displayed 

00:04:11.704 --> 00:04:14.490
 Let's double-click this icon 

00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:21.130
 Then, the printer driver is downloaded. 

00:04:21.132 --> 00:04:21.830
 Done 

00:04:22.293 --> 00:04:24.800
 Printer window has been displayed 

00:04:26.983 --> 00:04:30.230
 Let's also check the contents of the printer and fax 

00:04:31.302 --> 00:04:33.070
 From the "Start" menu 

00:04:33.067 --> 00:04:36.080
 Open the "Printer and Fax" settings 

00:04:38.407 --> 00:04:41.980
 Printer configured on "SV-acteck" 

00:04:41.983 --> 00:04:43.190
 Be available 

00:04:43.191 --> 00:04:46.770
 I could confirm that the software was embedded 

00:04:48.392 --> 00:04:51.180
 Thus Windows Server 2003 

00:04:51.178 --> 00:04:53.690
 When configured as a print server 

00:04:54.243 --> 00:04:56.240
 Not only sharing the printer 

00:04:56.797 --> 00:04:59.820
 You can also download the driver automatically 

00:04:59.816 --> 00:05:01.630
 Very convenient 

00:05:03.763 --> 00:05:05.300
 Training Video 

00:05:05.296 --> 00:05:07.760
 Windows Server 2003 Volume 2 

00:05:07.757 --> 00:05:09.060
 That is all 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.190
 In the third volume 

00:05:11.705 --> 00:05:13.240
 Client settings 

00:05:13.237 --> 00:05:14.960
 Object management 

00:05:14.955 --> 00:05:17.000
 User folder operation 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:20.530
 We will deliver content such as policy settings 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.620
 Please take a look 

00:05:23.036 --> 00:05:24.850
 Thank you very much
