structure that the smaller version of
this<00:01:31.910> set<00:01:32.150> was<00:01:32.360> so<00:01:32.780> there<00:01:33.170> is<00:01:33.350> architecture

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
this set was so there is architecture

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.540 
this set was so there is architecture
but<00:01:34.280> it's<00:01:34.430> it's<00:01:34.970> 65<00:01:35.600> feet<00:01:35.810> above<00:01:36.470> us<00:01:36.530> and<00:01:37.310> just

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
but it's it's 65 feet above us and just

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.020 
but it's it's 65 feet above us and just
see<00:01:37.760> under<00:01:38.000> here<00:01:38.210> then<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:40.310> cause<00:01:40.580> which<00:01:40.880> are

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
see under here then the cause which are

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.230 
see under here then the cause which are
basically<00:01:42.640> scaffolding<00:01:43.640> frames<00:01:43.910> like<00:01:44.150> the

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
basically scaffolding frames like the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.760 
basically scaffolding frames like the
