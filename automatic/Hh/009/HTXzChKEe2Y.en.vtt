here is if ups Pelican case suppose that
would<00:00:10.980> be<00:00:11.219> in<00:00:12.559> every<00:00:13.559> one<00:00:13.590> meter<00:00:13.950> with<00:00:14.160> butter

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
would be in every one meter with butter

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.090 
would be in every one meter with butter

black all right please 1 meter 2 meters
3<00:00:20.100> meters<00:00:21.050> four<00:00:22.050> meters<00:00:22.580> so<00:00:23.580> I'm<00:00:23.640> gonna<00:00:23.760> try<00:00:24.000> it

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
3 meters four meters so I'm gonna try it

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.160 
3 meters four meters so I'm gonna try it
at<00:00:24.180> 3<00:00:24.390> meters<00:00:24.539> for<00:00:24.960> 5<00:00:25.230> minutes<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.550> see<00:00:27.170> any

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
at 3 meters for 5 minutes and see any

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:45.860 
at 3 meters for 5 minutes and see any
water<00:00:28.410> leaks<00:00:31.340> is<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.610> first<00:00:44.149> ok<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.210> good<00:00:45.719> at

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
water leaks is the first ok so good at

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.830 
water leaks is the first ok so good at
radar<00:00:46.320> we've<00:00:46.710> got<00:00:46.829> some<00:00:47.070> rocks<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.520> here<00:00:47.840> these

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
radar we've got some rocks in here these

00:00:48.840 --> 00:01:06.649 
radar we've got some rocks in here these
are<00:00:49.110> 4<00:00:49.320> meter<00:00:56.510> 3<00:00:57.510> meters<00:01:05.240> okay<00:01:06.240> well<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.540> was

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
are 4 meter 3 meters okay well it was

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.530 
are 4 meter 3 meters okay well it was
the<00:01:06.780> first<00:01:07.020> test<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.500> 3<00:01:07.890> meters<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the first test in 3 meters and the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.320 
the first test in 3 meters and the
breather<00:01:09.900> hole<00:01:10.110> here<00:01:10.460> with<00:01:11.460> my<00:01:11.610> white<00:01:11.820> tissue

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.210 

so<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.720> maybe<00:01:16.080> we'll<00:01:17.479> do<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.630> formula<00:01:18.930> 1<00:01:19.229> see

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
so just maybe we'll do the formula 1 see

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.710 
so just maybe we'll do the formula 1 see
if<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.430> leaks

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.330 

okay<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:24.590> here's<00:01:25.400> the<00:01:25.460> full<00:01:25.760> meter<00:01:26.000> test<00:01:27.340> you

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
okay so here's the full meter test you

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.300 
okay so here's the full meter test you
can<00:01:28.490> see<00:01:28.670> it's<00:01:28.850> got<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.090> last<00:01:29.330> string<00:01:30.310> tie

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
can see it's got the last string tie

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.210 
can see it's got the last string tie
measurement<00:01:32.180> on<00:01:32.420> up<00:01:32.540> so<00:01:32.780> it's<00:01:32.960> it's<00:01:33.950> four

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
measurement on up so it's it's four

00:01:34.220 --> 00:02:09.320 
measurement on up so it's it's four
meters<00:01:34.490> underwater<00:01:35.290> to<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:36.380> top<00:01:36.560> of<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:36.770> case

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.600 

I<00:02:09.360> just<00:02:10.110> gave<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.619> bit<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.979> clean<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.490> think

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
I just gave a bit of a clean I think

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.870 
I just gave a bit of a clean I think
some<00:02:13.130> dirty<00:02:14.130> bits<00:02:14.340> might<00:02:14.580> have<00:02:14.700> gotten

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
some dirty bits might have gotten

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:25.430 
some dirty bits might have gotten
secondly<00:02:18.200> just<00:02:19.200> in<00:02:19.380> here<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:24.020> might<00:02:25.020> try<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.290> one

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
secondly just in here I might try it one

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.100 
secondly just in here I might try it one
more<00:02:25.500> time<00:02:25.620> give<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.340> joy<00:02:26.550> out<00:02:26.870> clean<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.020> up

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
more time give it a joy out clean it up

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:39.009 
more time give it a joy out clean it up
make<00:02:28.290> sure<00:02:28.530> there's<00:02:28.739> no<00:02:28.890> that's<00:02:29.450> in<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.780> seal

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.020 

okay<00:02:40.019> this<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.830> second<00:02:41.430> test<00:02:41.700> at<00:02:42.260> 4<00:02:43.260> meters

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
okay this is the second test at 4 meters

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.490 
okay this is the second test at 4 meters
the<00:02:45.030> first<00:02:45.300> one<00:02:45.510> having<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.989> little<00:02:46.290> bit<00:02:46.410> of

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
the first one having a little bit of

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.020 
the first one having a little bit of
water<00:02:46.650> come<00:02:46.920> in<00:02:47.100> but<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.310> think<00:02:47.580> it's<00:02:47.760> because<00:02:47.940> I

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
water come in but I think it's because I

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.440 
water come in but I think it's because I
didn't<00:02:48.300> clean<00:02:48.750> around<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.170> seals<00:02:49.760> edge<00:02:50.760> very

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
didn't clean around the seals edge very

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.009 
didn't clean around the seals edge very
clean<00:02:51.840> when<00:02:52.470> with<00:02:53.010> having<00:02:53.310> these<00:02:53.430> rocks<00:02:54.019> bits

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
clean when with having these rocks bits

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.259 
clean when with having these rocks bits
of<00:02:55.200> rocky<00:02:55.500> bit<00:02:55.680> which<00:02:55.890> I've<00:02:56.640> just<00:02:56.700> opened<00:02:57.000> it

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
of rocky bit which I've just opened it

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.250 
of rocky bit which I've just opened it
out<00:02:57.420> let's<00:02:58.170> see<00:02:58.319> it's<00:02:58.470> dry<00:02:58.650> inside<00:03:00.260> little

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
out let's see it's dry inside little

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.550 
out let's see it's dry inside little
bits<00:03:01.709> in<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.980> corner<00:03:02.340> just<00:03:03.049> get<00:03:04.049> stuck<00:03:04.319> there

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
bits in the corner just get stuck there

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.520 
bits in the corner just get stuck there
from<00:03:04.890> when<00:03:05.130> you<00:03:05.220> open<00:03:05.549> it<00:03:05.870> from<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.959> rock<00:03:07.260> bits

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
from when you open it from the rock bits

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.309 
from when you open it from the rock bits
to<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.769> inside<00:03:08.130> I<00:03:08.489> think<00:03:09.480> last<00:03:09.840> time<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:10.049> closed

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
to the inside I think last time I closed

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.050 
to the inside I think last time I closed
it<00:03:10.500> was<00:03:10.590> some<00:03:10.769> of<00:03:10.799> them<00:03:11.040> in<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.310> in<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.790> seal

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
it was some of them in the in the seal

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.690 
it was some of them in the in the seal
area<00:03:12.480> in<00:03:13.470> down<00:03:13.680> there<00:03:13.829> for<00:03:14.010> five<00:03:14.190> minutes<00:03:14.220> in

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
area in down there for five minutes in

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.370 
area in down there for five minutes in
us<00:03:14.820> I<00:03:15.060> would<00:03:15.630> say<00:03:15.810> it's<00:03:15.930> bone-dry

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
us I would say it's bone-dry

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.090 
us I would say it's bone-dry
I<00:03:17.600> would<00:03:18.600> say<00:03:18.750> there's<00:03:18.959> no<00:03:19.019> not<00:03:19.709> one<00:03:19.890> drop

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
I would say there's no not one drop

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:30.319 
I would say there's no not one drop
gotten<00:03:20.549> back<00:03:20.790> in<00:03:20.970> there<00:03:22.040> so<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:24.709> guess<00:03:29.329> longer

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
gotten back in there so I guess longer

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:40.780 
gotten back in there so I guess longer
teeth

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.380 

okay<00:03:41.420> I've<00:03:41.540> just<00:03:41.569> opened<00:03:42.170> it<00:03:43.030> after<00:03:44.030> half<00:03:44.239> an

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
okay I've just opened it after half an

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.890 
okay I've just opened it after half an
hour<00:03:44.569> or<00:03:44.780> four<00:03:45.019> meters<00:03:45.230> I<00:03:45.790> don't<00:03:46.790> say<00:03:47.060> it's

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
hour or four meters I don't say it's

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.990 
hour or four meters I don't say it's
bone-dry<00:03:50.680> it's<00:03:51.680> just<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:52.129> dust<00:03:52.519> and<00:03:52.909> stuff

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
bone-dry it's just the dust and stuff

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.630 
bone-dry it's just the dust and stuff
from<00:03:53.299> before<00:03:53.799> from<00:03:54.799> these<00:03:55.069> rocks<00:03:55.310> that<00:03:55.459> have

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
from before from these rocks that have

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.869 
from before from these rocks that have
been<00:03:55.760> in<00:03:55.909> the<00:03:56.560> blackness<00:03:57.560> but<00:03:58.129> there's<00:03:58.760> no

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
been in the blackness but there's no
