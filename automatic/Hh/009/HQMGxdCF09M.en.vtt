00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.770

 Finally, there is also the whole thing 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.060

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.570
 complete that is 250 grams 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.880

 Mozzarella is part of us 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.160
 still simmer and thereby would be 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.430
 then tomatoes just give way 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.530
 we go out then so here and now 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.360

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.840
 about minutes ago so that 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.060
 Food is ready and looks like this 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.819
 So you see, tomatoes are nice 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:31.230
 allowed to become because the noodles that 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.510

 So that's hardly the case 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.890
 Calorie is the only thing that actually works 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.750

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.700

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.799
 it does not get it then just tastes good 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.660
