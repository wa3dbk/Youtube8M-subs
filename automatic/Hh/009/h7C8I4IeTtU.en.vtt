00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.120
 well these are from 2 to 1 lived the five 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:06.100
 and thirty three 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.469
 that everyone gave me goes to me 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.690
 xbox live to me I do not know how many friends and 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:12.700
 that basically because this video goes to 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.380
 the people who do not really work do not 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.700
 I know if this is doing at level 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.560
 we could say global or level by 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.350
 some countries or others but good for 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:27.370
 true how good twitter is to burst 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.930
 of people who do not for him the this the 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.790
 online mostly Americans today 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.490
 basically not followed in Spain was 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.500
 going or not to me nobody has put me 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.720
 nothing and me in fact, because we wanted 360 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.550
 start without any problem so good 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.650
 for those who do not go then say that 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.380
 good has suffered seems to be an attack of 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:48.100
 two this is an attack basically 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.720
 what it does is to collapse the system and 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.270
 others or the servers 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.340
 and all this this has already happened ny compression 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.720
 others recently and it seems that by 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.120
 the same 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.820
 with the same group of 'hackers' 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.790
 we could say no squad bidding that 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.030
 As I say, he did it with on the sting 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.810
 totti socket with psn complete good the 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.909
 different already 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.140
 companies platforms games and so on 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.000
 how good it seems to be that good 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.920
 two attacks because it is not that they are 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.990
 good according to the experts because neither 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.759
 make it a very difficult thing to do and 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.369
 simply to prevent them 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.820
 it also has a difficult solution in certain 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.049
 sense since good because it is as if 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.090
 thousands and thousands and thousands of people by 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.799
 focus on what has been the same 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.390
 page we could say and it's over 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.159
 collapse not because this is arranged then 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.780
 maybe having more and see if in addition 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.220
 well I 'm not an expert I'm not going to 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.140
 tell you here the solution or anything for the 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.530
 style but I think what he did is and 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.409
 at the time it was to expand the servers 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.020
 and not what what he did I think it was 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.280
 hire an outside company or something 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.899
 so to provide them more 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.700
 servers just in case I do not remember 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.770
 very well what they did but 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.780
 some extra move like this they started like this 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.210
 How good are we going Xbox Live is 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.040
 basically put that why I leave you good 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.039
 this area keeps falling as I say 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.750
 how do I leave the twitter of the people who 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.060
 is putting those in xbox and so on 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.390
 that you see that people are not going 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.000
 I leave you also the link of the news of 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.319
 this and nothing guys but nothing can 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.660
 continue as I say the conversation of 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.130
 twitter of people complaining and others and 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.470
 Well I hope that here in Spain as there 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.950
 has fallen and there are not many affected 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.970
 good in no country 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.400
 Spanish speaker so good nothing more 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.850
 kids this week we see in the next 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.850
 and our next
