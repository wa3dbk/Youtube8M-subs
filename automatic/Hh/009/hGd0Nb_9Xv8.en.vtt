00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
happening soon so what I wanted to do

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.460 
happening soon so what I wanted to do
was<00:00:34.580> make<00:00:34.730> a<00:00:34.790> short<00:00:35.150> video<00:00:35.360> today<00:00:35.870> talking

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
was make a short video today talking

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.799 
was make a short video today talking
about<00:00:36.920> some<00:00:37.250> of<00:00:37.370> my<00:00:37.550> thoughts<00:00:37.879> on<00:00:38.210> team<00:00:38.510> play

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
about some of my thoughts on team play

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.500 
about some of my thoughts on team play
and<00:00:39.110> playing<00:00:39.739> the<00:00:39.980> objective<00:00:40.070> in<00:00:40.730> battlefield

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
and playing the objective in battlefield

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.000 
and playing the objective in battlefield
4<00:00:41.600> because<00:00:42.110> I<00:00:42.170> think<00:00:42.230> the<00:00:42.440> two<00:00:42.620> of<00:00:42.650> them<00:00:42.890> are

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
4 because I think the two of them are

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.979 
4 because I think the two of them are
quite<00:00:43.129> synonymous<00:00:43.790> really<00:00:44.210> but<00:00:44.660> I<00:00:44.690> don't<00:00:44.870> want

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
quite synonymous really but I don't want

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.079 
quite synonymous really but I don't want
this<00:00:45.080> to<00:00:45.140> be<00:00:45.320> a<00:00:45.350> long<00:00:45.650> ass<00:00:45.860> video<00:00:46.190> boring<00:00:46.940> you

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.089 
this to be a long ass video boring you

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.479 
this to be a long ass video boring you
like<00:00:47.269> some<00:00:47.900> kind<00:00:48.110> of<00:00:48.170> sermon<00:00:48.800> but<00:00:48.920> I<00:00:48.980> did<00:00:49.250> want

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
like some kind of sermon but I did want

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.930 
like some kind of sermon but I did want
to<00:00:49.790> just<00:00:50.059> share<00:00:50.960> some<00:00:51.350> of<00:00:51.379> my<00:00:51.680> ideas<00:00:51.980> around

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
to just share some of my ideas around

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.450 
to just share some of my ideas around
this<00:00:53.269> concept<00:00:53.570> and<00:00:54.080> why<00:00:54.320> I<00:00:54.350> think<00:00:54.949> team<00:00:55.190> play

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
this concept and why I think team play

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.590 
this concept and why I think team play
is<00:00:55.790> so<00:00:56.449> important<00:00:57.050> in<00:00:57.199> battlefield<00:00:57.710> 4<00:00:58.269> so<00:00:59.269> i

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
is so important in battlefield 4 so i

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.299 
is so important in battlefield 4 so i
think<00:00:59.989> is<00:01:00.110> pretty<00:01:00.409> and<00:01:00.589> arguable<00:01:01.250> that

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
think is pretty and arguable that

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.820 
think is pretty and arguable that
battlefield<00:01:01.909> 4<00:01:02.269> is<00:01:02.300> designed<00:01:02.900> as<00:01:03.170> a<00:01:03.229> team<00:01:03.530> game

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
battlefield 4 is designed as a team game

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.520 
battlefield 4 is designed as a team game
its<00:01:04.519> presence<00:01:05.210> in<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.960> class<00:01:06.229> system

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
its presence in the class system

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.380 
its presence in the class system
available<00:01:07.130> to<00:01:07.340> you<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:07.610> a<00:01:07.729> different<00:01:08.180> gadgets

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
available to you and a different gadgets

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.750 
available to you and a different gadgets
you<00:01:08.810> have<00:01:09.049> you<00:01:09.200> have<00:01:09.229> the<00:01:09.500> engineers<00:01:09.979> the

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
you have you have the engineers the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.270 
you have you have the engineers the
medics<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:12.080> support<00:01:12.470> guys<00:01:12.680> drop<00:01:13.070> in<00:01:13.190> a

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
medics and the support guys drop in a

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.580 
medics and the support guys drop in a
moet<00:01:13.490> cetera<00:01:14.120> so<00:01:14.659> in<00:01:14.780> that<00:01:14.900> sense<00:01:15.170> it's

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
moet cetera so in that sense it's

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.770 
moet cetera so in that sense it's
obvious<00:01:16.070> it's<00:01:16.280> designed<00:01:16.729> to<00:01:16.909> be<00:01:17.030> a<00:01:17.180> team<00:01:17.510> game

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
obvious it's designed to be a team game

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.120 
obvious it's designed to be a team game
helping<00:01:18.260> each<00:01:18.380> other<00:01:18.560> out<00:01:18.740> because<00:01:18.920> you

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
helping each other out because you

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.279 
helping each other out because you
shouldn't<00:01:19.430> be<00:01:19.670> able<00:01:19.789> to<00:01:19.909> do<00:01:20.060> everything<00:01:20.360> as

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
shouldn't be able to do everything as

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.340 
shouldn't be able to do everything as
one<00:01:22.039> class<00:01:22.399> in<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:23.000> game<00:01:23.180> and<00:01:23.390> still<00:01:23.810> win<00:01:24.140> or

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
one class in the game and still win or

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.670 
one class in the game and still win or
succeed<00:01:24.890> now<00:01:25.820> I<00:01:26.119> get<00:01:26.509> it<00:01:26.539> getting<00:01:27.140> kills<00:01:27.380> is

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
succeed now I get it getting kills is

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.550 
succeed now I get it getting kills is
fun<00:01:28.130> but<00:01:28.579> I<00:01:28.640> would<00:01:28.909> argue<00:01:28.939> that<00:01:29.659> it's<00:01:30.259> not

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
fun but I would argue that it's not

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.080 
fun but I would argue that it's not
about<00:01:30.770> what<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.070> game<00:01:31.250> is<00:01:31.280> designed<00:01:31.609> and

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
about what the game is designed and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.510 
about what the game is designed and
meant<00:01:32.329> to<00:01:32.479> be<00:01:32.750> but<00:01:33.170> actually<00:01:33.619> it's<00:01:33.829> just<00:01:34.070> much

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
meant to be but actually it's just much

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.840 
meant to be but actually it's just much
more<00:01:34.939> fun<00:01:35.329> when<00:01:35.750> you<00:01:35.960> play<00:01:35.990> with<00:01:36.500> a<00:01:36.560> team<00:01:36.950> isn't

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
more fun when you play with a team isn't

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.730 
more fun when you play with a team isn't
it<00:01:37.909> more<00:01:38.060> exhilarating<00:01:38.409> when<00:01:39.409> you're<00:01:39.530> playing

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
it more exhilarating when you're playing

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.279 
it more exhilarating when you're playing
the<00:01:39.950> game<00:01:39.979> and<00:01:40.430> it's<00:01:40.579> hard<00:01:40.909> for<00:01:41.030> but<00:01:41.869> your<00:01:41.990> team

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
the game and it's hard for but your team

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.069 
the game and it's hard for but your team
pulled<00:01:42.680> together<00:01:42.890> and<00:01:43.429> between<00:01:44.119> you<00:01:44.539> you<00:01:44.810> arm

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
pulled together and between you you arm

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.560 
pulled together and between you you arm
objectives<00:01:45.859> you<00:01:46.039> cap<00:01:46.369> flags<00:01:46.759> and<00:01:47.030> you<00:01:47.210> win<00:01:47.420> the

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
objectives you cap flags and you win the

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.539 
objectives you cap flags and you win the
game<00:01:47.780> even<00:01:48.350> if<00:01:48.409> you<00:01:48.530> don't<00:01:48.859> win<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.189> game<00:01:49.369> but

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
game even if you don't win the game but

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.669 
game even if you don't win the game but
it's<00:01:49.700> a<00:01:49.820> damn<00:01:50.119> close<00:01:50.509> game<00:01:50.840> aren't<00:01:51.500> those<00:01:51.619> the

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
it's a damn close game aren't those the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:54.490 
it's a damn close game aren't those the
memorable<00:01:52.490> battlefield<00:01:53.060> experiences<00:01:53.960> rather

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
memorable battlefield experiences rather

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.410 
memorable battlefield experiences rather
than<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:54.920> times<00:01:55.159> when<00:01:55.490> you<00:01:55.640> get<00:01:55.789> say<00:01:56.030> a<00:01:56.060> 10

that's<00:03:17.990> what<00:03:18.140> you<00:03:18.260> meant<00:03:18.410> to<00:03:18.560> do<00:03:18.770> it's

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
that's what you meant to do it's

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.420 
that's what you meant to do it's
rewarding<00:03:19.940> to<00:03:19.970> do<00:03:20.480> that<00:03:20.750> as<00:03:20.870> well<00:03:21.310> but<00:03:22.310> i<00:03:22.340> also

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
rewarding to do that as well but i also

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.970 
rewarding to do that as well but i also
think<00:03:22.790> team<00:03:23.300> play<00:03:23.570> is<00:03:23.840> its<00:03:24.050> own<00:03:24.230> reward<00:03:24.500> and

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
think team play is its own reward and

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.920 
think team play is its own reward and
that's<00:03:25.190> really<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.610> overall<00:03:26.240> message<00:03:26.480> of

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
that's really the overall message of

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.160 
that's really the overall message of
this<00:03:27.260> video<00:03:27.770> team<00:03:28.370> play<00:03:28.580> rocks<00:03:28.910> actually<00:03:29.720> when

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
this video team play rocks actually when

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.410 
this video team play rocks actually when
you're<00:03:30.350> playing<00:03:30.560> as<00:03:30.800> a<00:03:30.830> team<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:31.340> is<00:03:31.520> more<00:03:32.090> fun

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
you're playing as a team it is more fun

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
definitely for me at least and i think

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.850 
definitely for me at least and i think
many<00:03:34.790> of<00:03:34.880> you<00:03:35.030> must<00:03:35.360> agree<00:03:35.720> with<00:03:35.959> that<00:03:35.990> if<00:03:36.320> even

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
many of you must agree with that if even

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.410 
many of you must agree with that if even

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
those are my views on team play and

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.300 
those are my views on team play and
playing<00:04:08.600> the<00:04:08.750> objective<00:04:08.840> in<00:04:09.440> battlefield<00:04:10.250> 4

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
playing the objective in battlefield 4

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.699 
playing the objective in battlefield 4
how<00:04:11.030> much<00:04:11.270> this<00:04:11.480> team<00:04:11.840> play<00:04:12.080> initiative

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
how much this team play initiative

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.760 
how much this team play initiative
really<00:04:13.489> achieves<00:04:13.970> remains<00:04:14.780> to<00:04:15.080> be<00:04:15.110> seen<00:04:15.500> but

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
really achieves remains to be seen but

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.770 
really achieves remains to be seen but
the<00:04:16.070> way<00:04:16.280> I<00:04:16.310> see<00:04:16.459> it<00:04:16.820> it's<00:04:17.060> laying<00:04:17.540> the

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
the way I see it it's laying the

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.380 
the way I see it it's laying the
groundwork<00:04:18.200> for<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:18.980> next<00:04:19.340> battlefield<00:04:19.820> game

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
groundwork for the next battlefield game

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.659 
groundwork for the next battlefield game
and<00:04:20.690> it's<00:04:20.989> all<00:04:21.140> about<00:04:21.470> providing<00:04:21.950> a<00:04:22.250> bit<00:04:22.460> more

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
and it's all about providing a bit more

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.120 
and it's all about providing a bit more
reward<00:04:23.180> for<00:04:23.720> those<00:04:23.840> people<00:04:24.350> that<00:04:24.380> do<00:04:24.650> play<00:04:24.919> the

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
reward for those people that do play the

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.460 
reward for those people that do play the
objective<00:04:25.730> so<00:04:26.180> when<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.510> new<00:04:26.630> game<00:04:26.930> comes<00:04:27.230> out

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
objective so when the new game comes out

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.560 
objective so when the new game comes out
and<00:04:27.800> it<00:04:28.100> comes<00:04:28.310> to<00:04:28.460> unlocking<00:04:28.820> weapons<00:04:29.390> and

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
and it comes to unlocking weapons and

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.659 
and it comes to unlocking weapons and
ranking<00:04:30.020> up<00:04:30.169> perhaps<00:04:30.650> reward<00:04:31.130> people<00:04:31.430> a

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
ranking up perhaps reward people a

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.540 
ranking up perhaps reward people a
little<00:04:31.940> bit<00:04:32.090> more<00:04:32.570> with<00:04:33.350> team<00:04:33.830> played<00:04:34.220> type

little bit more with team played type

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.640 
little bit more with team played type
styles<00:04:35.090> of<00:04:35.240> play<00:04:35.360> so<00:04:35.960> if<00:04:36.050> you've<00:04:36.169> got<00:04:36.410> people

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
styles of play so if you've got people

capping flags defendant flags

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.730 
capping flags defendant flags
reward<00:04:39.250> them<00:04:39.490> more<00:04:39.790> so<00:04:40.330> that<00:04:40.360> they<00:04:41.200> rank<00:04:41.530> up

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
reward them more so that they rank up

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.770 
reward them more so that they rank up
quicker<00:04:42.100> and<00:04:42.400> unlock<00:04:42.820> their<00:04:43.060> weapons<00:04:43.510> and

quicker and unlock their weapons and
attachments<00:04:44.470> quicker<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:44.980> therefore<00:04:45.700> it

attachments quicker and therefore it

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.030 
attachments quicker and therefore it
kind<00:04:46.390> of<00:04:46.510> changes<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.080> mentality<00:04:47.830> in<00:04:47.920> the

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
kind of changes the mentality in the
