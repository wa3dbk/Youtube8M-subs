00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:05.569 
and this is Mariana Cassidy I have it in

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.100 
and this is Mariana Cassidy I have it in
my<00:00:06.049> little<00:00:07.059> tout<00:00:08.059> because<00:00:08.719> you<00:00:08.809> don't<00:00:08.929> want<00:00:09.050> to

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
my little tout because you don't want to

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.900 
my little tout because you don't want to
put<00:00:09.230> it<00:00:09.320> directly<00:00:09.380> on<00:00:09.710> the<00:00:09.740> deck<00:00:10.070> sometime

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
put it directly on the deck sometime

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.280 
put it directly on the deck sometime
there's<00:00:11.090> residue<00:00:11.390> on<00:00:11.630> here<00:00:11.840> so<00:00:11.960> if<00:00:12.019> you<00:00:12.080> put<00:00:12.230> it

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
there's residue on here so if you put it

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.770 
there's residue on here so if you put it
on<00:00:12.380> the<00:00:12.530> deck<00:00:12.740> you<00:00:13.400> leave<00:00:13.550> a<00:00:13.580> ring<00:00:13.910> of<00:00:14.210> acid

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
on the deck you leave a ring of acid

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.380 
on the deck you leave a ring of acid
basically<00:00:15.139> and<00:00:15.530> you'll<00:00:15.710> stain<00:00:16.099> the<00:00:16.250> deck<00:00:16.460> you

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
basically and you'll stain the deck you

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.450 
basically and you'll stain the deck you
also<00:00:17.539> don't<00:00:17.750> want<00:00:17.960> to<00:00:18.050> spill<00:00:19.039> any<00:00:19.189> on<00:00:19.279> your

also don't want to spill any on your
deck<00:00:19.669> either<00:00:19.849> because<00:00:20.150> it'll<00:00:20.300> actually<00:00:20.329> stain

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
deck either because it'll actually stain

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.620

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.299 

I'm<00:00:43.110> going<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.320> do<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> acid<00:00:43.800> demand<00:00:44.070> test

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
I'm going to do the acid demand test

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.630 
I'm going to do the acid demand test
with<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:45.020> five-way<00:00:46.020> test<00:00:46.289> kit<00:00:46.559> I'm<00:00:47.399> going<00:00:47.550> to

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
with this five-way test kit I'm going to

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.490 
with this five-way test kit I'm going to
add<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:48.090> couple<00:00:48.600> drops<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.199> chlorine

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
add a couple drops of the chlorine

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.000 
add a couple drops of the chlorine
neutralizer<00:00:50.030> five<00:00:51.030> drops<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.570> solution<00:00:52.019> to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
neutralizer five drops of solution to

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.350 
neutralizer five drops of solution to
and<00:00:55.010> I'm<00:00:55.070> going<00:00:55.220> to<00:00:55.250> shake<00:00:55.490> it<00:00:55.640> around<00:00:55.730> and

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
and I'm going to shake it around and

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.260 
and I'm going to shake it around and
this<00:00:57.140> one<00:00:57.320> here<00:00:57.500> has<00:00:57.650> a<00:00:57.680> pH<00:00:58.070> of<00:00:58.370> about<00:01:00.130> 8.2<00:01:01.270> so

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
this one here has a pH of about 8.2 so

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.220 
this one here has a pH of about 8.2 so
for<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.510> s<00:01:02.600> of<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:02.810> night<00:01:02.930> we're<00:01:03.050> going<00:01:03.170> to

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
for the s of the night we're going to

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.770 
for the s of the night we're going to
use<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:03.470> same<00:01:03.710> water<00:01:04.489> sample<00:01:05.030> we're<00:01:05.570> going<00:01:05.690> to

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
use the same water sample we're going to

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.390 
use the same water sample we're going to
add<00:01:05.840> solution<00:01:06.260> through<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:06.740> count<00:01:06.950> two<00:01:07.100> drops

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
add solution through and count two drops

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.180 
add solution through and count two drops
until<00:01:07.670> it<00:01:08.120> gets<00:01:08.380> go<00:01:09.380> to<00:01:09.440> color<00:01:09.650> change<00:01:09.950> it<00:01:10.100> to

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
until it gets go to color change it to

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.180 
until it gets go to color change it to
seven<00:01:10.400> point<00:01:10.640> four<00:01:10.910> I<00:01:11.180> had<00:01:12.140> a<00:01:12.170> two<00:01:12.410> drops<00:01:12.740> there

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
seven point four I had a two drops there

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.560 
seven point four I had a two drops there
I<00:01:13.720> swirl<00:01:14.720> it<00:01:14.750> around<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:15.650> that<00:01:16.270> looks<00:01:17.270> like

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
I swirl it around and that looks like

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.140 
I swirl it around and that looks like
it's<00:01:17.810> about<00:01:18.440> where<00:01:18.920> I<00:01:18.950> want<00:01:19.280> it<00:01:19.370> so<00:01:19.610> two<00:01:19.850> drops

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
it's about where I want it so two drops

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.410 
it's about where I want it so two drops
changes<00:01:20.660> seven<00:01:20.990> point<00:01:21.200> four<00:01:22.060> so<00:01:23.060> this<00:01:23.180> five

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
changes seven point four so this five

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.970 
changes seven point four so this five
and<00:01:23.600> one<00:01:23.720> test<00:01:23.930> comes<00:01:24.230> with<00:01:24.350> a<00:01:24.410> NASA<00:01:24.620> demand

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
and one test comes with a NASA demand

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.609 
and one test comes with a NASA demand
chart<00:01:25.310> this<00:01:25.910> pool<00:01:26.150> is<00:01:26.210> about<00:01:26.270> 25,000<00:01:27.260> gallons

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
chart this pool is about 25,000 gallons

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.550 
chart this pool is about 25,000 gallons
so<00:01:28.520> if<00:01:28.610> I<00:01:28.670> go<00:01:28.820> over<00:01:28.850> here<00:01:29.180> it<00:01:29.300> says<00:01:29.479> I<00:01:29.630> need<00:01:29.690> with

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
so if I go over here it says I need with

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.230 
so if I go over here it says I need with
two<00:01:30.710> drops<00:01:31.010> changing<00:01:31.520> it<00:01:31.610> at<00:01:31.700> some<00:01:31.820> point<00:01:31.850> for

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
two drops changing it at some point for

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.970 
two drops changing it at some point for
you<00:01:32.300> two<00:01:32.630> and<00:01:32.930> a<00:01:33.110> half<00:01:33.290> pints

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.260 

it's<00:01:39.490> very<00:01:39.610> important<00:01:39.910> to<00:01:39.970> know<00:01:40.060> how<00:01:40.210> many

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
it's very important to know how many

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.700 
it's very important to know how many
gallons<00:01:40.480> of<00:01:40.720> water<00:01:40.900> in<00:01:41.080> your<00:01:41.170> pool<00:01:41.380> so<00:01:41.530> I<00:01:41.560> have

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
gallons of water in your pool so I have

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.160 
gallons of water in your pool so I have

being by varies this one here I like to
get<00:01:50.920> in<00:01:51.040> from<00:01:51.190> the<00:01:51.250> pool<00:01:51.430> soccers<00:01:51.850> are<00:01:51.970> much

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
get in from the pool soccers are much

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.590 
get in from the pool soccers are much
stronger

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
stronger

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.219 
stronger
this<00:01:53.170> one's<00:01:53.380> 31%<00:01:54.130> neurotic<00:01:54.640> acid<00:01:55.140> when<00:01:56.140> you

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
this one's 31% neurotic acid when you

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.540 
this one's 31% neurotic acid when you
pour<00:01:56.440> the<00:01:56.470> acid<00:01:56.650> you're<00:01:56.920> going<00:01:57.040> to<00:01:57.100> walk<00:01:57.310> away

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
pour the acid you're going to walk away

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.150 
pour the acid you're going to walk away
from<00:01:58.120> as<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:59.560> pour<00:01:59.770> you're<00:01:59.860> going<00:01:59.979> to<00:02:00.040> walk

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
from as you pour you're going to walk

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.590 
from as you pour you're going to walk
away<00:02:00.310> in<00:02:00.460> one<00:02:00.610> direction<00:02:00.729> and<00:02:01.150> don't<00:02:01.210> double

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
away in one direction and don't double

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.210 
away in one direction and don't double
back<00:02:01.750> because<00:02:02.170> then<00:02:02.320> you'll<00:02:02.560> get<00:02:02.830> hit<00:02:03.010> by<00:02:03.160> the

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
back because then you'll get hit by the

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.370 
back because then you'll get hit by the
fumes<00:02:03.610> you<00:02:04.479> want<00:02:04.750> to<00:02:04.810> port<00:02:05.020> in<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.140> deepest

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
fumes you want to port in the deepest

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.330 
fumes you want to port in the deepest
part<00:02:05.590> of<00:02:05.620> the<00:02:05.710> pool<00:02:05.860> so<00:02:06.040> I'm<00:02:06.100> going<00:02:06.220> to<00:02:06.280> go

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
part of the pool so I'm going to go

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.380 
part of the pool so I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:06.550> pour<00:02:06.729> it<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:06.940> I'm<00:02:07.090> going<00:02:07.210> to<00:02:07.240> walk

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
ahead and pour it and I'm going to walk

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.800 
ahead and pour it and I'm going to walk
to<00:02:07.630> my<00:02:07.660> right<00:02:08.280> as<00:02:09.280> as<00:02:09.729> I<00:02:09.789> pour<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.450> teams

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
to my right as as I pour it the teams

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.750 
to my right as as I pour it the teams
are<00:02:10.990> going<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.140> actually<00:02:12.010> go<00:02:12.130> off<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:12.610> my<00:02:12.640> left

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
are going to actually go off to my left

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.260 
are going to actually go off to my left
here<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:14.800> can<00:02:14.950> actually<00:02:15.100> see<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.640> toxic<00:02:16.090> gas

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
here you can actually see the toxic gas

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.550 
here you can actually see the toxic gas
I'm<00:02:16.450> not<00:02:16.480> sure<00:02:16.720> if<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.840> video<00:02:17.050> will<00:02:17.200> show<00:02:17.410> it

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
I'm not sure if the video will show it

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.140 
I'm not sure if the video will show it
because<00:02:17.800> I<00:02:17.860> can<00:02:18.070> see<00:02:18.100> it<00:02:18.340> rising<00:02:18.850> from<00:02:19.000> the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
because I can see it rising from the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.660 
because I can see it rising from the
pool

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.059 

and<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.510> track<00:02:27.750> or<00:02:27.930> tablets<00:02:28.290> do<00:02:28.440> have<00:02:28.620> acid

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
and the track or tablets do have acid

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.740 
and the track or tablets do have acid
and<00:02:29.250> they<00:02:29.340> release<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:29.819> slowly<00:02:30.180> in<00:02:30.420> your<00:02:30.450> pool

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
and they release it slowly in your pool

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.530 
and they release it slowly in your pool
as<00:02:31.050> they<00:02:31.350> melt<00:02:31.580> that's<00:02:32.580> why<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.850> pH<00:02:33.300> in<00:02:33.510> your

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
as they melt that's why the pH in your

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.380 
as they melt that's why the pH in your
pool<00:02:33.840> tends<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.650> stay<00:02:34.890> in<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.819> ideal<00:02:36.090> range

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
pool tends to stay in the ideal range

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.310 
pool tends to stay in the ideal range
when<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.170> use<00:02:37.290> track<00:02:37.620> or<00:02:37.800> tablets
