five her death punch has sworn in the
first<00:00:53.460> album<00:00:53.910> yeah<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:56.960> not<00:00:57.960> as<00:00:58.199> much<00:00:58.410> as<00:00:58.469> they

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
first album yeah but not as much as they

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.990 
first album yeah but not as much as they
done<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.160> album<00:00:59.399> I'll<00:00:59.910> admit<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.840> but

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
done in this album I'll admit to it but

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.679 
done in this album I'll admit to it but
in<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.629> album<00:01:03.899> they'd<00:01:04.640> successfully<00:01:05.689> uses

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
in this album they'd successfully uses

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.890 
in this album they'd successfully uses
sold<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.350> lot<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.830> swearing<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.900> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
sold a lot of swearing in it and the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.920 
sold a lot of swearing in it and the
reason<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.380> like<00:01:10.590> we're<00:01:10.799> an<00:01:10.830> MF<00:01:11.360> that<00:01:12.360> song<00:01:12.630> is

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
reason is like we're an MF that song is

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.950 
reason is like we're an MF that song is
just<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.320> build<00:01:13.590> up<00:01:13.830> your<00:01:13.860> anger<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:15.450> make

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
just to build up your anger and to make

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.480 
just to build up your anger and to make
you<00:01:15.990> feel<00:01:16.380> just<00:01:16.490> angry<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.520> guess<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:19.159> if<00:01:20.159> it

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
you feel just angry I guess and if it

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.580 
you feel just angry I guess and if it
didn't<00:01:20.820> swear<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.930> would<00:01:22.110> have<00:01:22.200> given<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.560> a

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
didn't swear it would have given you a

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.499 
didn't swear it would have given you a
different<00:01:23.159> feeling<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.670> song<00:01:23.850> not<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> big

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
different feeling to the song not a big

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.330 
different feeling to the song not a big
difference<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.200> feeling<00:01:25.350> but<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.920> different

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
difference in feeling but a different

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.230 
difference in feeling but a different
feeling<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.909> fact<00:01:30.090> that

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
feeling in that I like the fact that

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.890 
feeling in that I like the fact that
they<00:01:30.450> swear<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> lot<00:01:31.310> because<00:01:32.310> they

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
they swear a lot because they

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.429 
they swear a lot because they
successfully<00:01:33.900> do<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.670> now<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:36.229> mean<00:01:37.229> they<00:01:37.350> don't

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
successfully do it now I mean they don't

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.800 
successfully do it now I mean they don't
have<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.979> do<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.250> they<00:01:39.000> don't<00:01:39.180> have<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.509> swear<00:01:39.780> I

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
have to do it they don't have to swear I

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.609 
have to do it they don't have to swear I
mean<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.560> guess<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.220> kind<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.430> cutting<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.970> a

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
mean I guess it is kind of cutting it a

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.830 
mean I guess it is kind of cutting it a
shortcut<00:01:43.619> because<00:01:44.070> swear<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.060> does<00:01:45.240> add<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
shortcut because swear it does add the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.139 
shortcut because swear it does add the
anger<00:01:45.960> up<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.649> bleeding<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.880> was<00:01:48.030> an

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
anger up like the bleeding that was an

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.249 
anger up like the bleeding that was an
angry<00:01:48.270> song<00:01:49.520> it<00:01:50.520> was<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.149> kind<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.750> emotional

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
angry song it was a kind of emotional

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.399 
angry song it was a kind of emotional
song<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.680> win<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.970> was<00:01:54.420> one<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.659> their<00:01:54.750> best<00:01:54.780> but

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
song to win it was one of their best but

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.749 
song to win it was one of their best but
they<00:01:55.590> didn't<00:01:55.829> use<00:01:55.920> any<00:01:56.070> swearing<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.640> I

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759
