00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
tendency to look at things in very

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.050 
tendency to look at things in very
black-and-white<00:01:10.070> extremes<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.700> because

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
black-and-white extremes just because

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.120 
black-and-white extremes just because
this<00:01:12.420> part<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.110> league<00:01:13.290> didn't<00:01:13.710> come<00:01:13.890> true

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
this part of the league didn't come true

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.070 
this part of the league didn't come true
doesn't<00:01:14.460> necessarily<00:01:15.090> discredit<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.780> entire

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
doesn't necessarily discredit the entire

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.200 
doesn't necessarily discredit the entire
thing<00:01:16.220> going<00:01:17.220> back<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.549> where<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.729> think<00:01:18.060> these

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
thing going back to where I think these

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.999 
thing going back to where I think these
leagues<00:01:18.509> originally<00:01:19.049> came<00:01:19.259> from<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.710> truly

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
leagues originally came from I truly

believe<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.610> probably<00:01:21.090> from<00:01:21.360> some<00:01:21.600> sort

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
believe this is probably from some sort

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.260

of<00:01:21.869> Namco<00:01:22.290> employee<00:01:22.740> from<00:01:23.369> probably<00:01:23.970> not<00:01:24.119> from

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
of Namco employee from probably not from

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.700

awakening but that's really could be

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.649 
awakening but that's really could be
three<00:01:44.430> characters<00:01:44.909> depending<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.420> your<00:01:45.509> point

on<00:03:11.060> hidden<00:03:11.660> characters<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:12.350> spoilers<00:03:12.740> at

on hidden characters and spoilers at

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.650 
on hidden characters and spoilers at
this<00:03:13.040> point<00:03:13.310> from<00:03:13.820> the<00:03:13.940> very<00:03:14.060> beginning<00:03:14.570> of

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
this point from the very beginning of

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.570 
this point from the very beginning of
Smash<00:03:14.870> Brothers<00:03:15.140> force<00:03:15.590> development<00:03:16.100> he's

Smash Brothers force development he's

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.010 
Smash Brothers force development he's
basically<00:03:17.030> said<00:03:17.330> he<00:03:17.420> doesn't<00:03:17.630> see<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:17.990> point

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
basically said he doesn't see the point

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.720 
basically said he doesn't see the point
in<00:03:18.320> having<00:03:18.380> any<00:03:18.740> sort<00:03:18.890> of<00:03:18.980> single<00:03:19.370> player<00:03:19.460> or

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
in having any sort of single player or

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.670 
in having any sort of single player or
story<00:03:20.090> elements<00:03:20.630> because<00:03:21.200> they'll<00:03:21.380> just<00:03:21.530> be

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
story elements because they'll just be

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.770 
story elements because they'll just be
spoiled<00:03:22.100> on<00:03:22.220> YouTube<00:03:22.640> within<00:03:22.940> a<00:03:23.000> day<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.450> I'm

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
spoiled on YouTube within a day and I'm

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.050 
spoiled on YouTube within a day and I'm
sure<00:03:24.050> that<00:03:24.260> probably<00:03:24.740> weighs<00:03:25.460> on<00:03:25.640> his<00:03:25.820> mind

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
sure that probably weighs on his mind

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.580 
sure that probably weighs on his mind
when<00:03:26.270> he<00:03:26.300> thinks<00:03:26.660> about<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:27.080> Internet<00:03:27.440> at

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
when he thinks about the Internet at

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.650 
when he thinks about the Internet at
large<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.490> hidden<00:03:28.730> roster<00:03:29.120> as<00:03:29.210> well<00:03:29.420> and

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
large and the hidden roster as well and

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.780 
large and the hidden roster as well and
really<00:03:29.930> at<00:03:30.050> this<00:03:30.290> point<00:03:30.410> what<00:03:30.860> is<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.460> good<00:03:31.730> of

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
really at this point what is the good of

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.700 
really at this point what is the good of
having<00:03:32.090> a<00:03:32.360> hidden<00:03:32.600> roster<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:32.900> lager<00:03:33.170> sure<00:03:33.500> it's

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
having a hidden roster a lager sure it's

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.680 
having a hidden roster a lager sure it's
exciting<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.340> see<00:03:34.370> who's<00:03:34.760> in<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.030> game<00:03:35.240> but

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
exciting to see who's in the game but

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.210 
exciting to see who's in the game but
let's<00:03:35.900> be<00:03:36.080> honest<00:03:36.350> these<00:03:36.530> are<00:03:36.710> games<00:03:37.010> that

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
let's be honest these are games that

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.670 
let's be honest these are games that
cost<00:03:37.520> sixty<00:03:38.030> dollars<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:38.990> probably<00:03:39.260> want<00:03:39.620> to

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
cost sixty dollars you probably want to

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.650 
cost sixty dollars you probably want to
know<00:03:39.830> who<00:03:40.070> you<00:03:40.220> get<00:03:40.460> to<00:03:40.580> play<00:03:40.790> as<00:03:40.970> before<00:03:41.510> you

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
know who you get to play as before you

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.810 
know who you get to play as before you
buy<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:41.870> game<00:03:42.230> it's<00:03:42.710> not<00:03:42.920> so<00:03:43.130> much<00:03:43.160> fun<00:03:43.640> to

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
buy the game it's not so much fun to

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.310 
buy the game it's not so much fun to
sort<00:03:44.030> of<00:03:44.180> throw<00:03:44.330> your<00:03:44.510> money<00:03:44.540> in<00:03:44.840> like<00:03:44.990> it's<00:03:45.170> a

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
sort of throw your money in like it's a

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.810 
sort of throw your money in like it's a
vending<00:03:45.860> machine<00:03:45.890> you<00:03:46.220> hope<00:03:46.400> you<00:03:46.580> get<00:03:46.730> the

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
vending machine you hope you get the

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.670 
vending machine you hope you get the
right<00:03:46.970> one<00:03:47.240> with<00:03:47.570> fighting<00:03:47.960> games<00:03:48.170> I<00:03:48.320> kind<00:03:48.530> of

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
right one with fighting games I kind of

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.200 
right one with fighting games I kind of
feel<00:03:48.860> like<00:03:48.920> there's<00:03:49.370> no<00:03:49.490> point<00:03:49.910> to<00:03:50.030> having

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
feel like there's no point to having

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.910 
feel like there's no point to having
hidden<00:03:50.450> characters<00:03:50.930> because<00:03:51.290> it<00:03:51.470> really<00:03:51.650> just

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
hidden characters because it really just

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.650 
hidden characters because it really just
screws<00:03:52.310> with<00:03:52.520> the<00:03:52.610> tournament<00:03:53.060> scene<00:03:53.270> in<00:03:53.450> the

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
screws with the tournament scene in the

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.450 
screws with the tournament scene in the
long<00:03:53.900> run<00:03:53.930> meaning<00:03:54.590> that<00:03:54.620> if<00:03:54.830> you<00:03:54.950> play<00:03:55.130> a<00:03:55.160> game

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
long run meaning that if you play a game

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.190 
long run meaning that if you play a game
in<00:03:55.640> a<00:03:55.700> tournament<00:03:56.120> you<00:03:56.420> have<00:03:56.450> to<00:03:56.840> make<00:03:56.990> sure

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
in a tournament you have to make sure

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.230 
in a tournament you have to make sure
that<00:03:57.440> someone<00:03:57.710> has<00:03:57.890> a<00:03:57.920> full<00:03:58.340> finish<00:03:58.700> save<00:03:58.940> file

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
that someone has a full finish save file

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.780 
that someone has a full finish save file
on<00:03:59.510> their<00:03:59.660> system<00:04:00.140> or<00:04:00.560> memory<00:04:00.950> card<00:04:01.190> or<00:04:01.580> what

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
on their system or memory card or what

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.430 
on their system or memory card or what
have<00:04:01.970> you<00:04:02.000> and<00:04:02.180> it<00:04:02.450> really<00:04:02.630> it's<00:04:02.900> pointless

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
have you and it really it's pointless

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
only two newcomers that we seem to be

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.610 
only two newcomers that we seem to be
aware<00:04:27.300> of<00:04:27.360> and<00:04:27.660> yeah<00:04:27.900> I<00:04:27.930> do<00:04:28.080> still<00:04:28.470> believe

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
aware of and yeah I do still believe

aware of and yeah I do still believe
that<00:04:28.800> this<00:04:29.070> is<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.310> very<00:04:29.580> very<00:04:29.850> very<00:04:30.000> high

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
that this is a very very very high

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.719 
that this is a very very very high
possibility<00:04:30.900> that<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:31.979> gavotte<00:04:32.220> sue<00:04:32.370> leak<00:04:32.520> is

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
possibility that the gavotte sue leak is

think honestly like as far as like
returning<00:05:28.500> characters<00:05:29.010> it's<00:05:29.190> probably<00:05:29.490> gonna

returning characters it's probably gonna

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:32.390 
returning characters it's probably gonna
be<00:05:29.910> nested<00:05:30.419> probably<00:05:31.260> going<00:05:31.470> to<00:05:31.530> be<00:05:31.710> Falco

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400

be nested probably going to be Falco
maybe<00:05:33.060> not<00:05:33.330> wolf<00:05:33.690> will<00:05:34.590> probably<00:05:35.099> get

maybe not wolf will probably get

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.070 
maybe not wolf will probably get
Ganondorf<00:05:35.849> back<00:05:36.090> at<00:05:36.300> least<00:05:36.449> that's<00:05:36.659> my<00:05:36.750> hope

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
Ganondorf back at least that's my hope

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.830 
Ganondorf back at least that's my hope
but<00:05:37.830> yeah<00:05:38.159> the<00:05:38.400> the<00:05:38.430> roster<00:05:39.120> smash<00:05:39.419> bros<00:05:39.659> is

going<00:05:40.050> to<00:05:40.110> probably<00:05:40.440> still<00:05:40.800> be<00:05:40.830> pretty<00:05:41.310> big

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:32.360 
we are coming to the end of the road as

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.179 
we are coming to the end of the road as
far<00:07:32.599> as<00:07:32.779> the<00:07:32.960> roster<00:07:33.379> comes<00:07:33.590> with<00:07:33.770> smash<00:07:33.949> bros

00:07:34.179 --> 00:07:34.189

and i would say there's a good chance

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.390 
and i would say there's a good chance
that<00:07:36.110> we're<00:07:36.229> going<00:07:36.379> to<00:07:36.469> see<00:07:36.650> the<00:07:36.770> final<00:07:36.919> roster

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:37.400
