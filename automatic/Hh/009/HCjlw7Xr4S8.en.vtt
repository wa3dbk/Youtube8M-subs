00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
have the rmx-1000 I believe that would

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.380 
have the rmx-1000 I believe that would
be<00:01:06.770> the<00:01:07.770> pioneer<00:01:08.160> remix<00:01:08.460> box<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.000> there's

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
be the pioneer remix box and there's

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.790 
be the pioneer remix box and there's
cotton<00:01:09.510> there<00:01:09.690> might<00:01:09.780> be<00:01:09.810> drivers<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.650> as

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
cotton there might be drivers on that as

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.980 
cotton there might be drivers on that as
well<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.250> make<00:01:12.030> sure<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.300> it<00:01:12.390> works<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
well to make sure that it works and the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.630 
well to make sure that it works and the
vsts<00:01:13.470> would<00:01:13.650> be<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:13.830> there<00:01:14.010> as<00:01:14.070> well<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.370> ships

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
vsts would be on there as well the ships

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.220 
vsts would be on there as well the ships
with<00:01:14.820> VST<00:01:15.230> so<00:01:16.230> it<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.890> work<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.840> da<00:01:18.840> double<00:01:19.110> use

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 
with VST so it can work in da double use
