00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.180
 Y 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.180
 yes 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.180
 do not 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:18.570
 93 20 what we have done is we want 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.940
 shed off the four practices that 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.940
 has for him to adhere 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.560
 as we see here 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.570
 we must retire to the four practices and 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.570
 here we have it soldier 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.570
 and let's look at how the soldiers 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.550
 and today we see that we have put it in 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.890
 so to speak upside down 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.680
 so that it gives us the polarity that 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.590
 we need the negative pin is this 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.070
 that is here from our position the 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.590
 right hand 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.200
 and the other would be the positive so that we 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.849
 can load without any problem 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.030
 then let's assemble what I'm going to 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.030
 try out 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.780
 here we have already loading the spears and z 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.980
 we must load 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.980
 in a normal way 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.110
 and now we are going to try to be able 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.120
 help him hurt with some glue 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.310
 something while we get the original 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.810
 service in arauca technical service 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.810
 professional mobile phone
