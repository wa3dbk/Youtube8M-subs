00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
know if that would mean anything but it

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.890

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
is sort of like I I guess you could say

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.690 
is sort of like I I guess you could say
in<00:03:06.200> general<00:03:06.440> or<00:03:07.010> something<00:03:07.160> like<00:03:07.340> that<00:03:07.400> you

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
in general or something like that you

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.430 
in general or something like that you
know<00:03:07.730> is<00:03:08.060> this<00:03:08.300> but<00:03:08.600> he's<00:03:08.720> obviously<00:03:08.959> going<00:03:09.380> to

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
know is this but he's obviously going to

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.140 
know is this but he's obviously going to
be<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.620> main<00:03:09.860> ghost<00:03:10.190> in<00:03:10.430> this<00:03:10.550> whole<00:03:10.760> season

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
be the main ghost in this whole season

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.180 
be the main ghost in this whole season
no<00:03:11.690> matter<00:03:11.870> what<00:03:12.110> he<00:03:12.320> will<00:03:12.500> be<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.739> main<00:03:12.890> ghost

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
no matter what he will be the main ghost

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.979 
no matter what he will be the main ghost
um<00:03:15.100> but<00:03:16.100> he's<00:03:16.670> not<00:03:16.820> the<00:03:16.880> master<00:03:17.390> of<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.540> ghosts

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
um but he's not the master of the ghosts

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.140 
um but he's not the master of the ghosts
so<00:03:18.440> he's<00:03:18.980> going<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.220> be<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.430> main<00:03:19.610> character

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.820 
so he's going to be the main character
of<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.330> ghosts<00:03:20.810> obviously<00:03:21.410> but<00:03:21.530> he's<00:03:21.680> not

back
but<00:04:07.170> I<00:04:07.410> don't<00:04:07.920> think<00:04:08.160> he<00:04:08.310> will<00:04:08.490> he<00:04:09.300> is<00:04:09.420> my

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
but I don't think he will he is my

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.880 
but I don't think he will he is my
favorite<00:04:09.960> character<00:04:10.110> but<00:04:10.470> i<00:04:10.500> do<00:04:10.620> not<00:04:10.830> think

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
favorite character but i do not think

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.700 
favorite character but i do not think
the<00:04:11.280> Overlord<00:04:11.730> will<00:04:11.880> come<00:04:12.090> back<00:04:12.300> um<00:04:13.170> at<00:04:13.650> least

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
the Overlord will come back um at least

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.190 
the Overlord will come back um at least
in<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.280> show<00:04:14.520> because<00:04:15.450> technically<00:04:15.930> I<00:04:16.110> guess

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
in the show because technically I guess

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.340 
in the show because technically I guess
he<00:04:16.650> would<00:04:16.890> never<00:04:17.070> be<00:04:17.400> gone<00:04:17.640> but<00:04:17.940> I<00:04:18.270> don't<00:04:19.170> think

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
he would never be gone but I don't think

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.440 
he would never be gone but I don't think
he'll<00:04:19.440> return<00:04:19.739> in<00:04:19.800> the<00:04:19.980> show<00:04:20.190> but<00:04:20.610> you<00:04:21.420> know

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
he'll return in the show but you know

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.420 
he'll return in the show but you know
there's<00:04:21.840> always<00:04:21.989> hopes<00:04:22.380> like<00:04:22.920> within<00:04:23.250> the

week which I think it will air every
week<00:05:18.360> I<00:05:18.570> don't<00:05:18.870> think<00:05:18.930> they'll<00:05:19.170> do<00:05:19.320> a<00:05:19.350> another

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
week I don't think they'll do a another

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.920 
week I don't think they'll do a another
week<00:05:20.130> thing<00:05:20.400> I<00:05:20.520> can<00:05:20.700> do<00:05:20.820> is<00:05:20.850> determine<00:05:21.270> but

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
week thing I can do is determine but

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.420 
week thing I can do is determine but
varies<00:05:22.230> every<00:05:22.470> week<00:05:22.650> it<00:05:22.830> will<00:05:22.890> basically<00:05:23.100> be

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
varies every week it will basically be

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.100 
varies every week it will basically be
