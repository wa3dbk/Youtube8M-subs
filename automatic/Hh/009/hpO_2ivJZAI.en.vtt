00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:12.040
 hello, let's talk about what the 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.960
 Chocolates colors and how to achieve it 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.600
 the fundamental thing is first to know where 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.600
 We will work without a hair 100% 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.720
 gray hair or in a hair 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.810
 use a natural hair if we are going to work 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:30.279
 in a natural hair and the person has 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:33.730
 a base for example 5 a base 6 a 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:37.480
 base 7 which is what we are going to do if the 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.620
 school is within 5 in a hair 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.420
 we can work it from the 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.950
 next way look for a good 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:47.590
 chocolate can be of primor alfa 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.750
 pardela his work with this is wrong of 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.470
 chocolates 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:01:00.640
 prim where are spectacular sail by 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:03.990
 example we can use a 60 71 67 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.900
 here you can see the colors 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:11.100
 so if you usually work a base 5 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.100
 Natural I can work it as a tone 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.890
 on tone 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.930
 apply in five brand chocolates 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.780
 that you are going to work with water from 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.620
 ten volumes the hair is virgin let's 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.600
 start first 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.920
 if we're going to make a tone about everything we're going 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.760
 to wash the hair has to be 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.670
 clean and you apply means and tips and 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.280
 root and massage that would be if we go 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.200
 to make tones especially if our 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.580
 model has a base 5 and you want 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.290
 make a chocolate 6 we are going to work 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.970
 choosing the 6 chocolate that is by 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.690
 example if I'm going to work with finesse 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.510
 I'm going to work and I'm going to apply the 6 22 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.870
 but there we are going to work with oxidant 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.870
 of 20 volumes because because I what 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.180
 I'm going to do is clarify a tone if I go 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.670
 to work with water of 10 I will work 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.530
 on the same tone it is decided rich in 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.840
 the 5 he applied a 6 22 I will be a 5 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.940
 22 because because I'm not going to clarify a 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.780
 tone only will it move me going to 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.710
 get a chocolate height 5 if I want 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.580
 pse achieve 22 have to work 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:25.670
 with oxidizer of 20 returns in the case that 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.360
 is now a 722 already and I'm going to work 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.730
 with an oxidant of 30 volumes 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.610
 but if it's a virgin hair I'm going to start 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.790
 applying first in tips and a half of 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.010
 about 20 minutes and then I'm going to work 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.959
 in what is root so when I 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:48.150
 I work in a natural color if I want 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:50.280
 apply a 6 22 with a 63 with a 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.109
 centimeter of red there is no kind of 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.709
 problem because because within what 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:57.599
 is the height of the chocolate there is deposit 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.189
 red if you subscribe a neutral chocolate 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.769
 I'm not going to apply red and I'm going to do 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:04.409
 mix can be chocolate with a 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.380
 little bit of gold and it's going to be a little 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:10.040
 creativity of you 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.740
 now yes I am going to work I want to achieve 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.530
 a very chocolate but in a head that 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.140
 has 100% gray that I'm going to simple 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.780
 person that for me is easier if the 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:25.970
 person wants to do 16 22 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:31.270
 or 167 sailing or a 6 35 of alfafar I'm going to 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:33.040
 apply half of 622 and half of 6 because 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.260
 because if I'm not here new to take 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.960
 well the way to my way of working is 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.730
 with 100% facing the color that the 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.760
 person wants to choose in this case a 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.850
 622 to apply half of 6 and half of 0 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.340
 22 if the person wants to make a 5 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.910
 half of 5 halves 522 and you want to do 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:55.180
 a 7 heights and with chocolate half of 7 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.460
 and half of 7 22 always analyzing the 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.990
 long hair and what they have 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.710
 the tips because if the person who 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:06.040
 has 100 of general channel at the tips 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:08.710
 has a 5 and usually applies a 7 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.940
 this is not clear to me what is going 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.920
 to be clear and with the camerata 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.200
 perfect but not here because, because 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.420
 the only silver form in the dark is 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.600
 that hair that is doing even more 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.549
 noise a soft discoloration also 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.670
 when there is desire and I have done many 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.740
 sometimes it is for example that always in 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.510
 half of 6 how do we realize that we are going to 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.420
 make a chocolate height 6 I put 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.330
 for example half of 6 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.040
 a room of 631 fourth of six 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.950
 chocolate 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.689
 a centimeter and honey red to give 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.580
 plus 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:43.919
 more light to that color because because 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.139
 we are working on a white hair not 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:49.110
 It is the same when we work in a 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:51.569
 natural hair that already has the 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.669
 reddish pigmentation then if I 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.110
 I put the 6 chocolate I will stay 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.659
 beautiful because I 'm already working 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.689
 within a natural base that has 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:02.249
 reddish pigmentation now with work in 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:05.939
 a white hair that does not have 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:08.369
 pigmentation I have to create 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:11.669
 that pigmentation and making that mixture 

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:13.619
 color is going to be perfect what 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.839
 you have to be careful not to overdo it 

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:17.759
 with red because if I'm not going to stay 

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:19.800
 already a brown 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:21.449
 throwing the reddish always have 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.470
 Be careful with that if it was a centimeter 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:27.200
 It's a centimeter, nothing more 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:30.920
 and we are always going to work with 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.960
 oxidants of 20 volumes is a myth that 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.240
 who say that if I prepare a 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.670
 tincture to load water of 30 we will 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.130
 take me will take exactly the same as 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.750
 what happens that maybe the environment 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.930
 will apply a little march be the form 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.000
 to work with me is to work with 20 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.890
 volumes that likewise in other videos 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.540
 I'm going to apply to you how 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.250
 we have to do the theme of the 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.500
 combination of oxidants so that 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.080
 It will serve us when we go 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.910
 to apply in tips and that already has a 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.090
 retouch of color that we are going to do the 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.730
 Here we see a chocolate height 5 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:08.240
 I'm going to apply five half of 5 thousand 35 22 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:10.970
 a little bit of red or 163 when I go to 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.220
 apply in tips I'll if it does not work or 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.950
 I no longer have more color prepare that 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.050
 color with water of 10 volume or with 20 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.790
 because because with the water of 20 I'm going 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.720
 to wash apart from punishing hair 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.780
 uselessly 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.580
 I want to achieve my shine I will work 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.240
 oxides of 10 because it is for 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.280
 make a tone on tone and give it shine 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.690
 generally when I talk about why 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.940
 tip application from 20 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.830
 minutes if I but it becomes clear 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.320
 quite already by washing and I have a 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.990
 area that is clearer if what I'm going to 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:46.130
 to do is to make the color the root and here 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:48.260
 Apply the color on the front and 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.660
 the part of what are the sides of the neck 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.180
 he applied it later to the color so that 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.340
 I'm matching if there's too little 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.140
 difference I hope you have been left 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.720
 clear these concepts of how to achieve from 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:03.080
 chocolate we can make the many 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:05.450
 blends and achieve a unique color you have to 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.340
 let loose to notice what you are 

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:09.740
 doing the mixture of colors and you 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.470
 they're going to see that they're not going to have any kind 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:17.419
 of problem any doubt write to me 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:19.669
 to the mail to help you and I'm going to 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:21.979
 upload videos that are exclusively for 

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:24.530
 the platform so that you can 

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:27.590
 see and let's see a lot of 

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:29.870
 modern techniques and videos so that 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.120
 you learn all the secrets in 

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:35.690
 what is the colorimetry I send them a 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:38.120
 very big greeting and we will continue with 

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.400
 other techniques that I'm going to 

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:44.350
 show during the course of 

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.350
 colorimetry a big hug for all
