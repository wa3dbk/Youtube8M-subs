hey<00:00:00.570> this<00:00:00.780> b-minus<00:00:01.380> and<00:00:01.589> in<00:00:01.829> this<00:00:01.979> video<00:00:02.340> I'm

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
hey this b-minus and in this video I'm

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.649 
hey this b-minus and in this video I'm
going<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:02.669> be<00:00:02.760> talking<00:00:02.909> about<00:00:03.149> something

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
going to be talking about something

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.329 
going to be talking about something
really<00:00:03.929> really<00:00:04.350> important<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:05.279> really

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
really really important and really

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.789 
really really important and really
useful<00:00:05.609> I'm<00:00:06.480> going<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.839> be<00:00:06.930> talking<00:00:07.350> about<00:00:07.379> the

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
useful I'm going to be talking about the

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.580 
useful I'm going to be talking about the
seven<00:00:08.280> different<00:00:08.760> factors<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:09.750> can<00:00:09.929> apply<00:00:10.260> to

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
seven different factors you can apply to

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.640 
seven different factors you can apply to
b-boy<00:00:11.160> moves<00:00:11.550> so<00:00:12.090> check<00:00:12.360> it<00:00:12.480> out<00:00:12.570> now<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.200> factor

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
b-boy moves so check it out now a factor

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.709 
b-boy moves so check it out now a factor
is<00:00:13.799> kind<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.160> abstract<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:15.179> instead<00:00:15.660> of

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
is kind of abstract so instead of

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.420 
is kind of abstract so instead of
telling<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.379> about<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.010> just<00:00:17.160> talking

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
telling you about it and just talking

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.970 
telling you about it and just talking
about<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.090> will<00:00:18.330> show<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:19.230> let<00:00:19.710> me<00:00:19.740> go

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
about it I will show you so let me go

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.880 
about it I will show you so let me go
down<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.369> list<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:21.210> first<00:00:21.689> factor<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.769> this

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
down the list this first factor in this

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.220 
down the list this first factor in this
case<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.460> might<00:00:23.880> have<00:00:24.240> talked<00:00:24.720> about<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.109> before

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
case I might have talked about it before

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.650 
case I might have talked about it before
in<00:00:25.590> other<00:00:25.710> videos<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.430> Lovells<00:00:27.029> now<00:00:27.420> there<00:00:27.599> are

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
in other videos is Lovells now there are

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.210 
in other videos is Lovells now there are
actually<00:00:27.720> five<00:00:28.080> different<00:00:28.109> levels<00:00:28.590> though<00:00:29.010> to

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
actually five different levels though to

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.950 
actually five different levels though to
show<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.519> real<00:00:29.880> quickly<00:00:30.179> I'll<00:00:30.599> give<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.900> a

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
show you real quickly I'll give you a

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.979 
show you real quickly I'll give you a
couple<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.289> examples<00:00:31.349> for<00:00:32.309> any<00:00:32.640> move<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.809> can

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
couple of examples for any move you can

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.299 
couple of examples for any move you can
actually<00:00:34.140> turn<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.680> into<00:00:34.800> five<00:00:35.070> different

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
actually turn it into five different

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.400 
actually turn it into five different
moves<00:00:35.670> by<00:00:35.880> defines<00:00:36.329> five<00:00:36.630> different<00:00:36.899> levels

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
moves by defines five different levels

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.619 
moves by defines five different levels
so<00:00:37.890> if<00:00:38.190> I'm<00:00:38.370> gonna<00:00:38.670> do<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.030> Scorpion<00:00:39.510> like

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
so if I'm gonna do the Scorpion like

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.060 
so if I'm gonna do the Scorpion like
this<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:41.629> can<00:00:42.629> actually<00:00:42.809> do<00:00:43.230> five<00:00:43.829> different

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
this I can actually do five different

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.490 
this I can actually do five different
levels<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.690> use<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> low<00:00:46.110> version

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
levels of it I can use a low version

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.410 
levels of it I can use a low version
like<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:49.160> or<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.280> do<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.879> hike<00:00:51.059> version

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
like this or I can do the hike version

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.069 
like this or I can do the hike version
like<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:55.550> okay<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:57.000> second<00:00:57.329> factor<00:00:57.629> here<00:00:57.840> is

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
like this okay the second factor here is

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.410 
like this okay the second factor here is
speed<00:00:58.379> now<00:00:58.920> depending<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.520> what<00:00:59.760> you<00:01:00.000> do<00:01:00.180> if

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
speed now depending on what you do if

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.990 
speed now depending on what you do if
you<00:01:00.660> contrast<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.500> move<00:01:01.739> from<00:01:02.460> going<00:01:02.820> really

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
you contrast the move from going really

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.420 
you contrast the move from going really
fast<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.870> really<00:01:04.199> slow<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.769> then<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.040> speed

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
fast to really slow and then you speed

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.160 
fast to really slow and then you speed
it<00:01:05.519> up<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:06.299> create<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.600> really<00:01:06.869> dynamic

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
it up it can create a really dynamic

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.830 
it up it can create a really dynamic
effect<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.369> for<00:01:08.610> example<00:01:09.090> if<00:01:09.390> I'm<00:01:09.540> gonna<00:01:09.720> do

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
effect so for example if I'm gonna do

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.740 
effect so for example if I'm gonna do
something<00:01:10.140> like<00:01:10.229> this

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.600 

okay<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:18.110> hopefully<00:01:18.350> you<00:01:18.560> get<00:01:18.800> to<00:01:18.860> see<00:01:19.190> that<00:01:19.370> I

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
okay so hopefully you get to see that I

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.430 
okay so hopefully you get to see that I
slowed<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.480> move<00:01:20.660> down<00:01:20.840> into<00:01:21.140> something

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
slowed the move down into something

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.530 
slowed the move down into something
intricate<00:01:21.890> and<00:01:22.400> then<00:01:22.640> I<00:01:22.730> speed<00:01:23.030> it<00:01:23.060> up<00:01:23.270> the

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
intricate and then I speed it up the

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.690 
intricate and then I speed it up the
third<00:01:23.630> one<00:01:23.810> here<00:01:23.960> it<00:01:24.080> is<00:01:24.200> direction<00:01:24.680> now<00:01:25.250> the

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
third one here it is direction now the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.240 
third one here it is direction now the
obvious<00:01:26.210> ones<00:01:26.900> are<00:01:27.170> of<00:01:27.350> course<00:01:27.560> you<00:01:27.710> do<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:27.980> top

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
obvious ones are of course you do a top

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.550 
obvious ones are of course you do a top
rock<00:01:28.460> step<00:01:28.760> one<00:01:29.030> way<00:01:29.180> you<00:01:29.690> step<00:01:29.930> one<00:01:30.110> way<00:01:30.290> and

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
rock step one way you step one way and

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.050 
rock step one way you step one way and
then<00:01:30.620> you<00:01:30.740> step<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.100> other<00:01:31.130> way<00:01:31.400> and<00:01:31.580> the

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
then you step the other way and the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.610 
then you step the other way and the
second<00:01:32.420> most<00:01:32.630> obvious<00:01:33.080> is<00:01:33.260> of<00:01:33.380> course

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
second most obvious is of course

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.390 
second most obvious is of course
footwork<00:01:34.250> so<00:01:34.490> you<00:01:34.580> can<00:01:34.730> do<00:01:34.910> kick<00:01:35.420> out<00:01:36.190> and<00:01:37.190> do

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
footwork so you can do kick out and do

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.510 
footwork so you can do kick out and do
the<00:01:37.520> same<00:01:37.700> thing<00:01:37.910> other<00:01:38.270> way

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.640 

all<00:01:43.520> right<00:01:43.670> so<00:01:44.090> you<00:01:44.150> do<00:01:44.360> the<00:01:44.540> move<00:01:44.780> both<00:01:45.380> ways

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
all right so you do the move both ways

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.270 
all right so you do the move both ways
the<00:01:46.430> next<00:01:46.729> one<00:01:46.850> here<00:01:47.060> is<00:01:47.090> sighs<00:01:47.870> a<00:01:48.280> classic

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
the next one here is sighs a classic

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.510 
the next one here is sighs a classic
example<00:01:49.880> is<00:01:50.060> mini<00:01:50.390> swag<00:01:50.690> versus<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.710> big<00:01:52.280> or

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
example is mini swag versus the big or

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.430 
example is mini swag versus the big or
master<00:01:52.970> slide<00:01:53.180> so<00:01:53.450> many<00:01:53.660> swipe<00:01:53.960> can<00:01:54.170> go<00:01:54.290> like

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
master slide so many swipe can go like

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.910 
master slide so many swipe can go like
this<00:01:57.070> okay<00:01:58.070> and<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:59.119> big<00:01:59.570> version<00:02:00.229> of<00:02:00.500> that<00:02:00.650> is

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
this okay and the big version of that is

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.180 
this okay and the big version of that is
well<00:02:04.810> simple<00:02:05.810> right<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.380> next<00:02:06.560> one<00:02:06.680> here<00:02:06.950> is

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
well simple right the next one here is

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.609 
well simple right the next one here is
angle<00:02:07.850> and<00:02:08.330> this<00:02:08.570> one<00:02:08.750> is<00:02:08.899> a<00:02:08.929> little<00:02:09.290> bit<00:02:09.410> more

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
angle and this one is a little bit more

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.260 
angle and this one is a little bit more
difficult<00:02:10.040> to<00:02:10.100> explain<00:02:10.610> so<00:02:10.790> let<00:02:10.940> me<00:02:11.030> show<00:02:11.209> you

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
difficult to explain so let me show you

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.300 
difficult to explain so let me show you
you<00:02:11.780> can<00:02:11.930> do<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.170> regular<00:02:12.530> applejack<00:02:13.100> and

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
you can do the regular applejack and

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.300 
you can do the regular applejack and
have<00:02:13.459> your<00:02:13.670> body<00:02:13.900> facing<00:02:14.950> basically<00:02:15.950> facing

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
have your body facing basically facing

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.090 
have your body facing basically facing
front<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:17.150> angle<00:02:17.540> is<00:02:17.690> of<00:02:18.350> course<00:02:18.709> I<00:02:18.890> guess

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
front and the angle is of course I guess

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.670 
front and the angle is of course I guess
you<00:02:19.280> can<00:02:19.459> say<00:02:19.670> zero<00:02:20.540> degrees<00:02:21.019> so<00:02:21.410> I'm<00:02:21.530> doing

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
you can say zero degrees so I'm doing

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.170 
you can say zero degrees so I'm doing
the<00:02:21.950> Applejack<00:02:22.640> with<00:02:22.850> this<00:02:23.980> okay<00:02:24.980> but<00:02:25.790> if<00:02:26.030> I

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
the Applejack with this okay but if I

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.390 
the Applejack with this okay but if I
ankle<00:02:26.989> my<00:02:27.140> body<00:02:27.410> a<00:02:27.530> little<00:02:27.769> bit<00:02:27.920> differently

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
ankle my body a little bit differently

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.729 
ankle my body a little bit differently
it<00:02:28.550> will<00:02:28.640> look<00:02:28.790> something<00:02:28.940> like<00:02:29.150> this<00:02:32.680> okay<00:02:33.680> so

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
it will look something like this okay so

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.009 
it will look something like this okay so
you<00:02:34.100> can<00:02:34.280> tell<00:02:34.489> that<00:02:34.730> making<00:02:35.390> that<00:02:35.540> shift<00:02:35.840> and

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
you can tell that making that shift and

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.710 
you can tell that making that shift and
changing<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.709> angle<00:02:36.890> for<00:02:37.640> my<00:02:37.760> upper<00:02:38.030> body<00:02:38.180> the

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
changing the angle for my upper body the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.870 
changing the angle for my upper body the
entire<00:02:38.900> flow<00:02:39.560> in<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.100> movement<00:02:40.489> turns<00:02:40.730> into

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
entire flow in the movement turns into

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.580 
entire flow in the movement turns into
something<00:02:41.150> different<00:02:41.600> then<00:02:41.900> this<00:02:42.050> one<00:02:42.320> is

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
something different then this one is

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.949 
something different then this one is
depth<00:02:43.010> now<00:02:43.430> for<00:02:43.850> depth<00:02:44.090> it's<00:02:44.330> different<00:02:44.750> from

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
depth now for depth it's different from

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.190 
depth now for depth it's different from
directions<00:02:45.800> or<00:02:46.120> levels<00:02:47.120> because<00:02:47.510> instead<00:02:48.050> of

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
directions or levels because instead of

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.370 
directions or levels because instead of
going<00:02:48.440> up<00:02:48.650> or<00:02:49.190> down<00:02:49.250> or<00:02:49.910> left<00:02:50.269> to<00:02:50.630> right<00:02:50.660> you're

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
going up or down or left to right you're

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.640 
going up or down or left to right you're
going<00:02:51.620> front<00:02:52.100> and<00:02:52.310> back<00:02:52.670> so<00:02:53.120> an<00:02:53.450> example<00:02:53.650> depth

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
going front and back so an example depth

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.000 
going front and back so an example depth
is<00:02:54.890> a<00:02:55.760> nice<00:02:55.970> life<00:02:56.209> or<00:02:56.450> nice<00:02:57.440> light<00:02:57.709> trick

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
is a nice life or nice light trick

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.710 
is a nice life or nice light trick
something<00:02:58.400> like<00:02:58.519> that<00:02:58.670> looks<00:02:58.820> like<00:02:58.970> this

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
something like that looks like this

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.710 
something like that looks like this
or<00:03:01.680> something<00:03:01.980> look<00:03:02.100> like<00:03:02.130> this<00:03:05.240> okay<00:03:06.240> the

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
or something look like this okay the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.710 
or something look like this okay the
last<00:03:06.900> one<00:03:07.050> here<00:03:07.380> is<00:03:07.590> sequence<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:09.000> sequence<00:03:09.510> to

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
last one here is sequence so sequence to

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.820 
last one here is sequence so sequence to
explain<00:03:10.080> in<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.380> best<00:03:10.590> way<00:03:10.770> is<00:03:11.040> think<00:03:12.320> a<00:03:13.320> tape

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
explain in the best way is think a tape

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:14.810 
explain in the best way is think a tape
that<00:03:14.100> you're<00:03:14.190> playing

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
that you're playing

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.120 
that you're playing
if<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.210> press<00:03:15.450> play<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:16.260> sequence<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:16.950> going

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
if you press play the sequence is going

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.940 
if you press play the sequence is going
forward<00:03:17.520> but<00:03:18.030> if<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:18.360> press<00:03:18.740> backwards<00:03:19.740> or

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
forward but if you press backwards or

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.310 
forward but if you press backwards or
rewind<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:21.330> starts<00:03:21.600> playing<00:03:21.720> backwards

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
rewind and it starts playing backwards

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.960 
rewind and it starts playing backwards
that's<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.830> sequence<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.550> going<00:03:23.760> backwards

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
that's the sequence and going backwards

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.810 
that's the sequence and going backwards
so<00:03:24.660> a<00:03:24.690> prime<00:03:24.990> example<00:03:25.020> an<00:03:25.800> original<00:03:26.340> example<00:03:26.790> I

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
so a prime example an original example I

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:35.270 
so a prime example an original example I
have<00:03:26.940> made<00:03:27.090> up<00:03:27.240> is<00:03:27.390> something<00:03:27.570> like<00:03:27.780> this<00:03:34.280> okay

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
have made up is something like this okay

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.220 
have made up is something like this okay
all<00:03:35.640> right<00:03:35.820> so<00:03:36.000> that's<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.450> seven<00:03:36.870> different

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
all right so that's the seven different

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.710 
all right so that's the seven different
factors<00:03:37.650> for<00:03:37.950> b-boying<00:03:38.490> movements<00:03:39.120> if<00:03:39.270> you

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
factors for b-boying movements if you

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.050 
factors for b-boying movements if you
apply<00:03:40.110> either<00:03:40.470> one<00:03:40.920> two<00:03:41.490> or<00:03:41.790> even<00:03:41.820> three

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
apply either one two or even three

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.300 
apply either one two or even three
different<00:03:42.870> factors<00:03:43.110> too<00:03:43.530> many<00:03:43.710> ones<00:03:43.950> that<00:03:44.190> you

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
different factors too many ones that you

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.920 
different factors too many ones that you
have<00:03:44.550> you<00:03:45.000> start<00:03:45.240> creating<00:03:45.510> something

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
have you start creating something

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.370 
have you start creating something
original<00:03:46.410> and<00:03:47.270> likely<00:03:48.270> nobody<00:03:48.660> else<00:03:48.990> has<00:03:49.170> ever

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
original and likely nobody else has ever

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.740 
original and likely nobody else has ever
seen<00:03:49.770> it<00:03:49.890> so<00:03:50.340> go<00:03:50.520> ahead<00:03:50.670> give<00:03:51.270> that<00:03:51.420> a<00:03:51.450> try

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
seen it so go ahead give that a try

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.930 
seen it so go ahead give that a try
hopefully<00:03:52.170> it<00:03:52.290> else<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:52.890> hope<00:03:53.460> you<00:03:53.640> like<00:03:53.790> this

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
hopefully it else I hope you like this

did in this workshop I talked about
concepts<00:04:00.750> like<00:04:00.960> how<00:04:01.320> do<00:04:01.380> you<00:04:01.770> create<00:04:02.100> original

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
concepts like how do you create original

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.000 
concepts like how do you create original
moves<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.270> the<00:04:03.630> techniques<00:04:04.140> for<00:04:04.380> training<00:04:04.800> to

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
moves and the techniques for training to

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.250 
moves and the techniques for training to
double<00:04:05.340> your<00:04:05.550> improvement<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:06.300> lastly<00:04:06.989> how
