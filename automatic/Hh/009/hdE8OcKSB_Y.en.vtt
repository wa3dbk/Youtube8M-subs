00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
to be like a plasticy paper material

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.660 
to be like a plasticy paper material
over<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:52.979> back<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.310> photo

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
over the back of the photo

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.490 
over the back of the photo
whatever<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.450> case<00:01:54.600> underneath<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.170> was<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
whatever the case underneath it was the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.020 
whatever the case underneath it was the
paper<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.770> was<00:01:55.950> looking<00:01:56.159> for<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.820> just

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
paper I was looking for so I just

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.429 
paper I was looking for so I just
applied<00:01:57.210> more<00:01:57.420> water<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.930> began<00:01:58.259> to

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
applied more water and began to

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.410 
applied more water and began to
carefully<00:01:58.890> rub<00:01:59.100> off<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.490> back<00:01:59.759> of<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.149> photo

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
carefully rub off the back of the photo

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.219 
carefully rub off the back of the photo
and<00:02:00.659> rubbed<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.500> did<00:02:02.040> for<00:02:02.969> what<00:02:03.719> seemed<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:03.990> be<00:02:04.140> a

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
and rubbed I did for what seemed to be a

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.319 
and rubbed I did for what seemed to be a
pretty<00:02:04.649> ridiculous<00:02:05.189> amount<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.490> time<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.270> I

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
pretty ridiculous amount of time and I

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.089 
pretty ridiculous amount of time and I
kind<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.600> started<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.020> suck<00:02:07.229> honestly

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
kind of started the suck honestly

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.400 
kind of started the suck honestly
because<00:02:08.280> nothing<00:02:08.819> was<00:02:09.360> happening<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.929> then<00:02:10.349> I

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
because nothing was happening and then I

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.470 
because nothing was happening and then I
came<00:02:10.470> across<00:02:10.679> another<00:02:11.340> layer<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.790> paper<00:02:11.910> that

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
came across another layer of paper that

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.890 
came across another layer of paper that
I<00:02:12.510> had<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.780> remove<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.819> back<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:15.000> revin<00:02:15.270> just

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900
