may<00:02:26.319> get<00:02:26.500> taken<00:02:26.829> down<00:02:26.860> very<00:02:27.340> very<00:02:27.400> early<00:02:27.730> but

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
may get taken down very very early but

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:29.670 
may get taken down very very early but
the<00:02:28.420> probe<00:02:28.689> and<00:02:28.989> those<00:02:29.140> earrings<00:02:29.439> have<00:02:29.590> the

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
the probe and those earrings have the

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.699 
the probe and those earrings have the
same<00:02:29.890> movement<00:02:30.340> speed<00:02:30.549> as<00:02:30.730> soon<00:02:31.480> as<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:32.620> know

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
same movement speed as soon as you know

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:33.720 
same movement speed as soon as you know
what<00:02:32.829> I<00:02:32.920> thought<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.159> have<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.310> same<00:02:33.430> movement

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
what I thought to have the same movement

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.949 
what I thought to have the same movement
speed<00:02:33.879> so<00:02:34.000> it<00:02:34.030> already<00:02:34.180> down<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.569> 10<00:02:34.750> hit

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
speed so it already down to 10 hit

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.780 
speed so it already down to 10 hit
points<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:35.319> that<00:02:35.349> probe<00:02:36.010> should<00:02:36.250> be<00:02:36.400> able<00:02:36.700> to

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
points so that probe should be able to

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.759 
points so that probe should be able to
make<00:02:37.180> it<00:02:37.390> away<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.079> start<00:02:38.409> regenerating

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
make it away and start regenerating

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:39.960 
make it away and start regenerating
those<00:02:39.129> shields<00:02:39.340> but<00:02:39.549> it<00:02:39.640> looks<00:02:39.819> as<00:02:39.909> though

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
those shields but it looks as though

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.030 
those shields but it looks as though
that<00:02:40.269> is<00:02:40.450> not<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.870> case<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.260> probe<00:02:41.500> is<00:02:41.890> the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
that is not the case the probe is the

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.069 
that is not the case the probe is the
little<00:02:42.459> bit<00:02:42.790> slower<00:02:43.060> than<00:02:43.329> those<00:02:43.599> servings

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
little bit slower than those servings

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.270 
little bit slower than those servings
and<00:02:44.200> now<00:02:44.560> those<00:02:44.709> zealots<00:02:44.890> going<00:02:45.099> to<00:02:45.159> go<00:02:45.220> ahead

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
and now those zealots going to go ahead

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.250 
and now those zealots going to go ahead
and<00:02:45.459> try<00:02:45.549> to<00:02:45.609> engage<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.180> able<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.569> just<00:02:46.750> shoo

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
run in to run to a run by and that's

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.470 
run in to run to a run by and that's
going<00:02:51.069> to<00:02:51.129> go<00:02:51.220> ahead<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:51.430> run<00:02:51.760> by<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.209> try<00:02:52.420> to

going to go ahead and run by and try to

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.660 
going to go ahead and run by and try to

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
deal some damage on to the main base

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.970 
deal some damage on to the main base
here<00:02:55.000> so<00:02:55.389> we<00:02:55.510> only<00:02:55.930> have<00:02:56.200> a<00:02:56.230> couple<00:02:56.319> probes<00:02:56.859> and

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
here so we only have a couple probes and

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.289 
here so we only have a couple probes and
that<00:02:57.129> is<00:02:57.280> it<00:02:57.430> will<00:02:57.579> see<00:02:57.700> how<00:02:57.909> much<00:02:58.090> damage

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
that is it will see how much damage

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.690 
that is it will see how much damage
those<00:02:58.569> folks<00:02:58.780> are<00:02:58.840> able<00:02:59.079> to<00:02:59.139> deal<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.310> very

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
those folks are able to deal and very

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.069 
those folks are able to deal and very
nicely<00:03:01.000> done<00:03:01.239> doing<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.599> little<00:03:01.810> bit<00:03:02.049> of

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
nicely done doing a little bit of

back one zealot down to a mere 11 hit
points<00:03:37.690> but<00:03:37.840> those<00:03:37.959> shields<00:03:38.199> will<00:03:38.500> start<00:03:38.739> to

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799

regenerate as those roaches try to
scamper<00:03:40.989> and<00:03:41.260> chase<00:03:41.500> down<00:03:41.769> that<00:03:42.299> those<00:03:43.299> two

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
scamper and chase down that those two

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.420 
scamper and chase down that those two

zealots so those two zealots gonna start

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.890 
zealots so those two zealots gonna start
out<00:03:45.579> running<00:03:46.030> those<00:03:46.209> roaches<00:03:46.449> as<00:03:46.750> those

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
continuing the pushback and it looks as

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.510 
continuing the pushback and it looks as
