00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
similar to cross-country skiing it's

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.860 
similar to cross-country skiing it's
more<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.200> shuttle<00:00:34.710> effect<00:00:35.450> the<00:00:36.450> short<00:00:36.690> real

quick how looks like standing still is
gonna<00:00:39.030> be<00:00:39.210> more<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:40.140> pivot<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.800> foot

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
gonna be more of a pivot of the foot

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.229 
gonna be more of a pivot of the foot
turning<00:00:41.430> with<00:00:41.579> she's<00:00:41.910> looking<00:00:42.149> you're

without adding no acceleration to your

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.370 
without adding no acceleration to your
turn<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.680> will<00:01:07.950> slow<00:01:08.640> down

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.720 

another<00:01:14.380> former<00:01:14.800> term<00:01:15.010> but<00:01:15.280> real<00:01:15.430> quick<00:01:15.610> I'm

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
another former term but real quick I'm

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
another former term but real quick I'm
gonna<00:01:15.850> show<00:01:16.000> you<00:01:16.060> how<00:01:16.210> to<00:01:16.270> turn<00:01:16.420> that's

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.050 
gonna show you how to turn that's
basically<00:01:17.650> your<00:01:18.040> the<00:01:18.340> basic<00:01:18.580> irregular<00:01:18.880> turn

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
basically your the basic irregular turn

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.310 
basically your the basic irregular turn
and<00:01:19.270> you<00:01:19.330> notice<00:01:19.570> I'm<00:01:19.720> slow<00:01:19.960> down<00:01:20.140> while<00:01:20.230> I'm

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
and you notice I'm slow down while I'm

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.710 
and you notice I'm slow down while I'm
trying<00:01:20.560> to<00:01:20.650> because<00:01:21.280> of<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.210> fact<00:01:22.240> that<00:01:22.540> I'm

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
trying to because of the fact that I'm

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:44.609 
trying to because of the fact that I'm
gonna<00:01:22.810> add<00:01:22.990> no<00:01:23.140> power<00:01:23.410> to<00:01:23.530> my<00:01:23.620> turn

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.730 

and<00:01:44.979> that<00:01:45.219> is<00:01:45.310> basically<00:01:45.609> just<00:01:45.700> a<00:01:46.119> regular<00:01:46.740> jug

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
and that is basically just a regular jug

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.279 
and that is basically just a regular jug
little<00:01:48.009> turn<00:01:48.159> and<00:01:48.939> then<00:01:49.090> a<00:01:49.119> turn<00:01:49.450> if<00:01:49.840> you<00:01:50.079> want

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
little turn and then a turn if you want

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:51.569 
little turn and then a turn if you want
to<00:01:50.380> keep<00:01:50.530> your<00:01:50.770> speed<00:01:51.009> up<00:01:51.039> so<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:51.369> speak

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
to keep your speed up so to speak

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.399 
to keep your speed up so to speak
or<00:01:51.700> somewhat<00:01:52.060> of<00:01:52.179> your<00:01:52.299> speed<00:01:52.539> up<00:01:52.750> his<00:01:53.229> law

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
or somewhat of your speed up his law

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.109 
or somewhat of your speed up his law
practice<00:01:53.619> even<00:01:54.250> I<00:01:54.369> have<00:01:54.579> little<00:01:54.759> issues<00:01:55.000> with

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
practice even I have little issues with

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.599 
practice even I have little issues with
us<00:01:55.240> sometimes<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:55.689> is<00:01:56.679> basically<00:01:57.100> how<00:01:57.460> it's

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:57.609 
us sometimes to is basically how it's

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:00.510 
us sometimes to is basically how it's
done<00:01:57.759> is<00:01:58.270> you<00:01:58.539> turn<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.920> direction<00:02:00.100> with<00:02:00.429> the

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
done is you turn the direction with the

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.090 
done is you turn the direction with the
foot<00:02:00.729> returning<00:02:01.119> with<00:02:01.270> but<00:02:02.039> instead<00:02:03.039> of

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
foot returning with but instead of

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.679 
foot returning with but instead of
pivoting<00:02:03.579> immediately<00:02:04.149> when<00:02:04.270> it's<00:02:04.390> finished

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
pivoting immediately when it's finished

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.870 
pivoting immediately when it's finished
you're<00:02:04.840> gonna<00:02:04.929> push<00:02:05.409> out<00:02:05.619> with<00:02:05.829> it<00:02:06.009> and<00:02:06.700> come

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
you're gonna push out with it and come

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:44.250 
you're gonna push out with it and come
into<00:02:07.149> it<00:02:10.860> push<00:02:16.049> to<00:02:17.049> angle<00:02:17.560> your<00:02:18.840> push<00:02:42.750> myself<00:02:43.750> a
