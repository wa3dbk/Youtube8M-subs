00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.880
 I'm going to tell you a little bit what in the 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.450
 Felt course or conformation of 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.369
 Felt you can learn for example 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:21.160
 you can shape any kind of 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.470
 form with special rules to hats 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.450
 for example this hat so classic 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.380
 what is fedora model 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:32.460
 the last we have here in front 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.790
 or you can even make pamelas from 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.250
 felt 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.010
 so for this the first thing that 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.300
 we will have to have is a last of 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.760
 wood 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.170
 today there are wooden forms of 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.329
 cork in which are much more 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.480
 affordable because if we would not have 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.340
 that go to these ways like the one that's 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.579
 Linden wood that is the best wood 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.890
 but the price goes up a lot but 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.970
 good in the courses you will have 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.550
 the forms given by hop hernÃ¡ndez 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.360
 so for that we have the elements 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.240
 main 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.420
 one is the cone that can be both the 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.090
 cone like the capelina can be of 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.750
 felt or large felt wool 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.840
 quality like antelope or felt 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.080
 normal as the rabbit or the wool that 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.520
 It is also much more affordable and very 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.770
 manageable 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.950
 then the elements to use 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.159
 basic we need are first 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.140
 place as we have already said the norm in 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.800
 second place 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:42.130
 the element of wool or felt in third 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.550
 place a brush to remove all 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.360
 leftover hairs and that fits us well 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:51.310
 clean the material that we are going to work 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.580
 then we use in this 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.680
 workshop gum arabic because there are other 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.990
 people who use other hardener 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.750
 It is much harder as is the tail of 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.119
 carpenter but they do not give that softness and 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.300
 that texture that really should have a 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.340
 hat after manipulable 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.820
 then the gum arabic we have it well 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.060
 in stone or in powder all this you can 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.820
 purchase on the website of hawker ie 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.830
 who sees you will be very easy to acquire 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:26.400
 materials then 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.940
 It is necessary and basic that the felt is 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.440
 work hard for this we need 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.760
 iron plates 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.980
 with a minimum weight of 3 kilos and these 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.950
 plates have to be put on the fire 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.920
 when they are completely already boiling 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.700
 these plates are the ones that we are going to 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.190
 use to iron the felt and 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.210
 form turned then once the 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:58.150
 We bake the felt when it is already with 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:01.180
 his ready put then then already 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.030
 we will put the jute rope or 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.030
 as you will see in the making 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:12.800
 has a slot here you will get the 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:16.550
 rush with stainless steel nails 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.930
 which the nails we have already 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.540
 You will see in the photos how everything is 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:26.230
 once we have made the cup 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:31.180
 and we already have it and we have removed all 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:33.609
 the nails and ironing we passed it to 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.909
 Steam that steam what is going to give you that 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:39.670
 give the felt then 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:44.050
 we will pass it to the day the wing can be 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.060
 narrow wide brim 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.880
 many people think that it is 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.040
 convenient to always have the ones that are 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.080
 very expensive to get and very difficult 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.450
 I think that for this is the 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.060
 imagination simply with a 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.810
 wooden tray for example as a 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.360
 That I have here 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.660
 then you can make a flat 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.840
 that will give you for example type the hat 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:12.290
 of indiana jones will be the hat 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.510
 completely fallen from behind and you 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.470
 you will give the width that you want 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.470
 same to win 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.150
 and then finally I think that just 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.180
 we have the theme of the decoration of the 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.670
 hat I like personally in 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.730
 winter a green hat then put 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.640
 Austrian materials trimmings will be 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.160
 they can put pens and they can put 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:40.100
 draped felt like here you see here 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.950
 for example you see this the subject a little 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.980
 Austrian 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:48.190
 then here we are seeing we can 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:52.420
 put velvet to leave it as more 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:56.620
 flirtatious that already to the taste of each person 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:05:00.250
 and I think that with this I am encouraging you 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.530
 to that the craftsmanship above all is not 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.260
 lose does not mean that you go to 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:08.890
 live on this but if you know how to do 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:13.180
 base that is the craft this will give you 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:16.450
 mobility to be able to then any 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:20.020
 hat that you buy or that you have in 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:22.960
 the store being able to sell to the public 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.110
 game of a jacket that has that 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.900
 lady since you know so much 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.990
 embed what it means to shrink the 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.090
 hat as you widen that for them and 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.890
 that you will need this element so 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.270
 millinery important called 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.610
 widens door 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.569
 Well, I hope you liked the 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.419
 information 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:49.879
 and I'll tell you the flower course and the 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.879
 course of hits until later
