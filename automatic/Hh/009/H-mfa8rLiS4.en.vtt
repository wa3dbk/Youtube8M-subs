today I'm just going to be showing you
how<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.340> draw<00:00:11.670> objects<00:00:12.650> this<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.799> how<00:00:13.950> you<00:00:14.009> draw

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
how to draw objects this is how you draw

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.109 
how to draw objects this is how you draw
a<00:00:14.610> be<00:00:15.109> how<00:00:16.109> I'm<00:00:16.230> going<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.470> start<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:17.039> using<00:00:18.029> a

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
a be how I'm going to start is using a

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.679 
a be how I'm going to start is using a
pencil<00:00:18.330> by<00:00:19.109> using<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.439> pencil<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.420> drawing<00:00:21.420> a

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
pencil by using a pencil and drawing a

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.089 
pencil by using a pencil and drawing a
simple<00:00:22.199> circle<00:00:22.800> in<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.010> center<00:00:23.369> first

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
simple circle in the center first

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.859 
simple circle in the center first
there's<00:00:26.099> just<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.310> rough<00:00:26.519> guideline<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.750> way

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
there's just a rough guideline the way

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.500 
there's just a rough guideline the way
you<00:00:27.930> want<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.170> start<00:00:29.330> and<00:00:30.330> then<00:00:31.790> that's<00:00:32.790> just<00:00:33.090> a

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
you want to start and then that's just a

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:41.030 
you want to start and then that's just a
semicircle<00:00:34.290> attaching<00:00:37.219> the<00:00:38.219> circle<00:00:39.829> and<00:00:40.829> then

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
semicircle attaching the circle and then

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:50.670 
semicircle attaching the circle and then
I'm<00:00:41.190> going<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.460> be<00:00:42.500> drawing<00:00:43.500> just<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.040> simple

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.320 

kind<00:00:51.250> of<00:00:51.340> leaf<00:00:52.710> point<00:00:53.710> man<00:00:54.520> this<00:00:54.820> is<00:00:54.970> just<00:00:55.120> the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.330 
kind of leaf point man this is just the

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.760 
kind of leaf point man this is just the
the<00:00:55.600> bottom<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.530> third<00:00:56.770> abdomen<00:00:57.520> of<00:00:58.290> the<00:00:59.290> B<00:00:59.500> so

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
the bottom the third abdomen of the B so

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.430 
the bottom the third abdomen of the B so
that'll<00:00:59.980> be<00:01:00.070> the<00:01:00.100> head<00:01:00.400> the<00:01:01.180> body<00:01:01.360> and<00:01:01.840> the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
that'll be the head the body and the

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:20.820 
that'll be the head the body and the
tail<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:07.600> then<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:08.020> eyes

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.100 

and<00:01:21.430> I'll<00:01:21.670> just<00:01:21.910> be<00:01:22.120> doing<00:01:22.300> the<00:01:22.900> antenna<00:01:23.410> just

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
and I'll just be doing the antenna just

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:34.410 
and I'll just be doing the antenna just
keeping<00:01:26.110> it<00:01:26.230> quite<00:01:26.650> symmetrical

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.880 

and<00:01:35.200> then<00:01:35.850> obviously<00:01:36.850> I'll<00:01:37.570> just<00:01:37.890> quickly

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
and then obviously I'll just quickly

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.950 
and then obviously I'll just quickly
rough<00:01:39.369> out<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.560> wings<00:01:41.799> and<00:01:42.960> generally

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
rough out the the wings and generally

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.999 
rough out the the wings and generally
used<00:01:44.380> to<00:01:45.390> keep<00:01:46.390> it<00:01:46.540> as<00:01:46.659> an<00:01:46.840> angle<00:01:47.200> so<00:01:47.560> if<00:01:47.860> you

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
used to keep it as an angle so if you

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.920 
used to keep it as an angle so if you
draw<00:01:48.250> if<00:01:48.490> you<00:01:48.610> just<00:01:48.880> pretend<00:01:49.030> that<00:01:49.479> you're

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
draw if you just pretend that you're

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.359 
draw if you just pretend that you're
drawing<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.440> point<00:01:51.340> from<00:01:51.909> the<00:01:52.030> center<00:01:52.060> and

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
drawing a point from the center and

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.350 
drawing a point from the center and
downwards<00:01:54.369> like<00:01:54.490> this<00:01:54.840> like<00:01:55.840> an<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:56.170> shape<00:01:56.470> that

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
downwards like this like an a shape that

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:05.090 
downwards like this like an a shape that
we<00:01:58.360> wear<00:01:58.750> your<00:01:58.960> wings<00:02:00.240> will<00:02:01.240> be<00:02:01.390> weighted<00:02:01.869> so

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.059 

draw<00:02:06.100> a<00:02:07.950> third<00:02:08.950> in<00:02:10.019> front<00:02:11.019> of<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.380> circle<00:02:11.890> and

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
draw a third in front of the circle and

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:23.570 
draw a third in front of the circle and
meet<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:14.230> wings<00:02:14.470> round<00:02:14.920> so

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.380 

that<00:02:24.580> kind<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:24.880> shape

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
that kind of shape

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.110 
that kind of shape
and<00:02:25.780> then<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:27.190> can<00:02:27.310> do<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.580> same<00:02:27.760> on<00:02:28.000> the

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
and then you can do the same on the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.050 
and then you can do the same on the
other<00:02:28.150> side<00:02:30.540> cuff<00:02:31.540> just<00:02:32.200> curving<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.610> the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
other side cuff just curving the the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.830 
other side cuff just curving the the
wings<00:02:38.880> then<00:02:39.880> I'm<00:02:40.030> just<00:02:40.210> gonna<00:02:40.300> mark<00:02:40.540> out<00:02:40.810> where

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
wings then I'm just gonna mark out where

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.890 
wings then I'm just gonna mark out where
the<00:02:41.640> legs<00:02:42.640> are<00:02:42.820> going<00:02:42.850> to<00:02:43.060> be<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:46.420> first<00:02:46.690> set

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
the legs are going to be the first set

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.480 
the legs are going to be the first set
of<00:02:47.020> legs<00:02:47.200> will<00:02:47.500> be<00:02:47.820> somewhere<00:02:48.820> near<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.120> head

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
of legs will be somewhere near the head

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:57.180 
of legs will be somewhere near the head
and<00:02:51.490> then<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:55.570> second<00:02:55.990> set<00:02:56.470> would<00:02:56.950> be

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
and then the second set would be

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.030 
and then the second set would be
somewhere<00:02:57.940> near<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.239> body<00:02:58.450> this<00:02:59.440> is<00:02:59.560> going<00:02:59.980> to

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
somewhere near the body this is going to

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.500 
somewhere near the body this is going to
be<00:03:00.160> behind<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.730> wing<00:03:00.880> so<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:01.180> won't<00:03:01.360> be<00:03:01.480> able

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
be behind the wing so you won't be able

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.180 
be behind the wing so you won't be able
to<00:03:01.660> see<00:03:01.810> very<00:03:02.020> much<00:03:02.170> of<00:03:02.230> it<00:03:02.440> but<00:03:02.620> like<00:03:02.800> just

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
to see very much of it but like just

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.380 
to see very much of it but like just
marking<00:03:03.610> them<00:03:03.820> out<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.709> then<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:06.400> third<00:03:07.090> set

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
marking them out and then the third set

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.610 
marking them out and then the third set
will<00:03:07.720> just<00:03:08.700> essentially<00:03:09.700> be<00:03:10.000> from<00:03:10.540> there<00:03:11.080> but

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
will just essentially be from there but

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.160 
will just essentially be from there but
you<00:03:11.739> won't<00:03:11.890> be<00:03:12.040> seeing<00:03:12.280> it<00:03:12.510> from<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.660> wing<00:03:13.840> so

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
you won't be seeing it from the wing so

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.110 
you won't be seeing it from the wing so
you<00:03:14.260> just<00:03:14.440> imagine<00:03:15.280> that<00:03:15.550> there's<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:15.880> leg

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
you just imagine that there's a leg

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.240 
you just imagine that there's a leg
coming<00:03:16.420> from<00:03:16.600> there<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:16.989> it<00:03:17.380> will<00:03:17.560> stick<00:03:18.070> out

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
coming from there and it will stick out

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:28.070 
coming from there and it will stick out
here<00:03:21.209> so<00:03:22.440> they're<00:03:23.440> coming<00:03:23.680> out<00:03:23.799> here<00:03:24.010> this

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:35.060 

and<00:03:28.740> then<00:03:30.950> draw<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.010> legs<00:03:32.490> straight<00:03:32.940> in<00:03:34.070> the

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
and then draw the legs straight in the

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:41.360 
and then draw the legs straight in the
head<00:03:35.250> like<00:03:35.490> this<00:03:38.060> keep<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.180> quite<00:03:39.390> even<00:03:40.370> and

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
head like this keep it quite even and

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:48.010 
head like this keep it quite even and
then<00:03:41.490> angle<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:42.120> feet<00:03:42.360> outwards<00:03:43.260> like<00:03:43.590> this<00:03:43.770> I

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.480 

will<00:03:49.020> do<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.260> same<00:03:49.470> for<00:03:51.860> the<00:03:52.860> second<00:03:53.310> set<00:03:53.460> of

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
will do the same for the second set of

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:59.330 
will do the same for the second set of
legs<00:03:53.820> and<00:03:54.560> go<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.710> feet<00:03:56.690> and<00:03:57.830> that<00:03:58.830> will<00:03:59.130> be

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
legs and go the feet and that will be

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.860 
legs and go the feet and that will be
the<00:03:59.520> rough<00:03:59.700> guideline<00:04:00.240> of<00:04:01.340> your<00:04:02.340> be<00:04:02.720> so<00:04:03.720> I'm

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
the rough guideline of your be so I'm

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.780 
the rough guideline of your be so I'm
going<00:04:04.020> to<00:04:04.080> draw<00:04:05.240> the<00:04:06.240> wings<00:04:06.480> first<00:04:07.550> let<00:04:08.550> me<00:04:08.580> use

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
going to draw the wings first let me use

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.900 
going to draw the wings first let me use
a<00:04:08.820> slightly<00:04:09.420> thicker<00:04:09.720> pen<00:04:10.100> and<00:04:11.100> just<00:04:11.340> use

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
a slightly thicker pen and just use

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:33.290 
a slightly thicker pen and just use
those<00:04:12.240> pencil<00:04:12.780> lines<00:04:31.340> using<00:04:32.340> a<00:04:32.490> thin<00:04:32.730> pen<00:04:32.970> a

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
those pencil lines using a thin pen a

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.270 
those pencil lines using a thin pen a
thinner<00:04:34.050> pen<00:04:34.290> our<00:04:35.030> mark<00:04:36.030> out

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
thinner pen our mark out

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.800 
thinner pen our mark out
the<00:04:37.880> eyes<00:04:38.030> I'm<00:04:38.510> just<00:04:38.570> going<00:04:39.280> crosshatch<00:04:40.810> the

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
the eyes I'm just going crosshatch the

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.230 
the eyes I'm just going crosshatch the
eyes

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.809 

Oh<00:04:48.500> essentially<00:04:49.500> me<00:04:49.889> if<00:04:50.099> you<00:04:50.310> want<00:04:50.520> to<00:04:50.610> draw<00:04:50.789> a

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819 
Oh essentially me if you want to draw a

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.180 
Oh essentially me if you want to draw a
flier<00:04:51.120> this<00:04:51.389> would<00:04:51.599> be<00:04:51.900> the<00:04:52.530> rough<00:04:52.740> guideline

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
flier this would be the rough guideline

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.159 
flier this would be the rough guideline
of<00:04:53.370> flight<00:04:53.699> and<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:56.150> you<00:04:57.150> can<00:04:57.330> make<00:04:57.870> these

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
of flight and and you can make these

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.800 
of flight and and you can make these
antennae<00:04:58.949> a<00:04:59.190> little<00:04:59.490> bit<00:04:59.610> smaller<00:04:59.940> but<00:05:00.660> this

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
antennae a little bit smaller but this

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.409 
antennae a little bit smaller but this
would<00:05:01.050> be<00:05:01.639> essentially<00:05:02.639> the<00:05:02.789> fly<00:05:03.000> at<00:05:03.330> the

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
would be essentially the fly at the

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.820 
would be essentially the fly at the
carrot<00:05:03.750> the<00:05:05.060> characteristics<00:05:06.060> of<00:05:06.270> a<00:05:06.830> bee

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
carrot the characteristics of a bee

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.460 
carrot the characteristics of a bee
would<00:05:08.099> make<00:05:08.580> it<00:05:08.819> a<00:05:09.000> little<00:05:09.210> bit<00:05:09.389> more<00:05:09.569> fairy<00:05:09.900> so

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
would make it a little bit more fairy so

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:16.100 
would make it a little bit more fairy so
I<00:05:10.770> just<00:05:11.069> add<00:05:11.280> a<00:05:11.340> little<00:05:11.610> bit<00:05:11.729> more<00:05:11.819> detail<00:05:15.110> and

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
I just add a little bit more detail and

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.670 
I just add a little bit more detail and
then<00:05:16.470> this<00:05:16.620> would<00:05:16.830> be<00:05:16.949> darker<00:05:17.810> so<00:05:18.810> just<00:05:19.470> add

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
then this would be darker so just add

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.999 
then this would be darker so just add
more<00:05:22.220> shading<00:05:23.220> just<00:05:23.490> flicking<00:05:24.389> the<00:05:25.199> pen<00:05:25.440> or

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
more shading just flicking the pen or

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.140 
more shading just flicking the pen or
using<00:05:26.430> the<00:05:26.550> side<00:05:26.789> of<00:05:27.060> the<00:05:27.180> pen<00:05:28.909> and<00:05:29.909> then<00:05:30.000> I'll

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
using the side of the pen and then I'll

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.770 
using the side of the pen and then I'll
just<00:05:30.330> continue<00:05:30.539> it'd<00:05:30.990> be<00:05:31.169> like<00:05:32.360> just<00:05:33.360> creating

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
just continue it'd be like just creating

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.730 
just continue it'd be like just creating
little<00:05:35.630> curls<00:05:36.630> at<00:05:36.900> the<00:05:36.990> end<00:05:37.080> of<00:05:37.199> the<00:05:37.259> feet<00:05:37.470> to

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
little curls at the end of the feet to

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:45.610 
little curls at the end of the feet to
just<00:05:38.699> show<00:05:38.849> off<00:05:38.970> the<00:05:39.680> the<00:05:40.680> little<00:05:42.650> feet<00:05:43.650> marks

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
just show off the the little feet marks

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.950 
just show off the the little feet marks
I'm<00:05:46.620> gonna<00:05:46.860> go<00:05:46.979> back<00:05:47.639> to<00:05:47.669> using<00:05:48.180> a<00:05:48.270> pencil<00:05:48.479> and

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
I'm gonna go back to using a pencil and

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.820 
I'm gonna go back to using a pencil and
I'm<00:05:49.650> just<00:05:49.860> going<00:05:50.009> to<00:05:50.039> map<00:05:50.250> out<00:05:50.460> how<00:05:50.699> to<00:05:51.240> draw

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
I'm just going to map out how to draw

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.129 
I'm just going to map out how to draw
the<00:05:52.830> veins<00:05:53.099> within<00:05:53.460> the<00:05:53.789> wings<00:05:54.139> sometimes

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
the veins within the wings sometimes

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:58.490 
the veins within the wings sometimes
them<00:05:55.380> it's<00:05:55.560> it's<00:05:55.830> quite<00:05:56.340> easy<00:05:56.490> to<00:05:57.229> just<00:05:58.229> look

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
them it's it's quite easy to just look

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:06.100 
them it's it's quite easy to just look
at<00:05:58.650> the<00:05:59.009> reference<00:05:59.460> of<00:05:59.729> a<00:06:00.800> bee's<00:06:01.800> wing<00:06:02.159> and<00:06:03.500> I

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
at the reference of a bee's wing and I

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.560 
at the reference of a bee's wing and I
would<00:06:07.110> simply<00:06:07.800> just<00:06:08.009> you<00:06:08.699> know<00:06:08.789> just<00:06:09.270> start

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
would simply just you know just start

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.010 
would simply just you know just start
drawing<00:06:09.990> a<00:06:10.080> line<00:06:10.259> until<00:06:11.219> halfway<00:06:11.550> of<00:06:12.539> the<00:06:12.840> wing

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
drawing a line until halfway of the wing

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.670 
drawing a line until halfway of the wing
and<00:06:13.909> and<00:06:14.909> draw<00:06:15.120> a<00:06:15.150> line<00:06:15.330> in<00:06:15.509> between<00:06:15.539> the<00:06:16.469> wing

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
and and draw a line in between the wing

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.510 
and and draw a line in between the wing
edge<00:06:17.130> of<00:06:17.550> the<00:06:17.699> wing

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.480 

and<00:06:22.509> then<00:06:22.720> adding<00:06:23.530> the<00:06:23.650> veins<00:06:23.889> just<00:06:24.250> be<00:06:24.460> a

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
and then adding the veins just be a

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:30.240 
and then adding the veins just be a
little<00:06:24.699> bit<00:06:24.789> creative<00:06:25.120> about<00:06:25.569> it<00:06:25.810> can<00:06:26.500> I<00:06:29.250> would

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
little bit creative about it can I would

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:38.730 
little bit creative about it can I would
just<00:06:30.490> simply<00:06:32.610> like<00:06:33.610> a<00:06:33.669> treat<00:06:34.030> let<00:06:34.330> the<00:06:37.740> veins

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
just simply like a treat let the veins

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:49.879 
just simply like a treat let the veins
just<00:06:38.889> branch<00:06:39.400> out<00:06:40.710> let's<00:06:41.710> see

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:49.889 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:52.760 

and<00:06:50.490> then<00:06:50.699> we'd<00:06:51.629> do<00:06:51.780> the<00:06:51.930> same<00:06:51.960> on<00:06:52.650> the<00:06:52.740> other

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770 
and then we'd do the same on the other

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:58.189 
and then we'd do the same on the other
side<00:06:53.120> and<00:06:54.120> using<00:06:54.569> a<00:06:54.629> thin<00:06:54.840> pen<00:06:55.080> I'll<00:06:56.990> draw<00:06:57.990> this

00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 
side and using a thin pen I'll draw this

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:04.939 
side and using a thin pen I'll draw this
out<00:07:00.050> and<00:07:01.050> that's<00:07:01.259> how<00:07:01.409> you<00:07:01.620> draw<00:07:02.340> a<00:07:02.639> B
