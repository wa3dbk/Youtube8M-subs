00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.800
 Translation by singbada @ tumblr 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:12.800
 Although the wind tangles my finely combed hair 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:23.800
 I feel like I'm wearing sunshine because my heart has become warm 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:34.300
 Even when when I try to predict love with flower leaves - one, two 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:45.800
 The answer is always the same because I love you 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.800
 It feels like a hum that's been imprinted on my mind without my knowledge 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.500
 It feels like a rain drop that's been imprinted without a sound 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:07.700
 You've smeared into my heart just like that 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.500
 It feels like your name has been imprinted on my lips 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.000
 It sounds like the best word to hear 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:29.700
 You're always seen in my eyes, love you 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.500
 When I hold your hand while walking a long road 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:51.700
 I get the feeling that I want to walk slower 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.800
 It feels like a hum that's been imprinted on my mind without my knowledge 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.500
 It feels like a rain drop that's been imprinted without a sound 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:12.600
 You've smeared into my heart just like that 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.800
 It feels like your name has been imprinted on my lips 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 It sounds like the best word to hear 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:34.600
 You're always seen in my eyes, love you 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:45.400
 Even when when I try to predict love with flower leaves - one, two 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:57.000
 The answer is always the same because I love you 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:10.000
 I will always love you
