now that we have the pleats done on the
front<00:00:02.730> of<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.120> bag<00:00:03.300> we<00:00:03.929> have<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.740> cut<00:00:04.950> out<00:00:05.100> the

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
front of the bag we have to cut out the

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.750 
front of the bag we have to cut out the

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
inside and you're going to fold it just

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.120 
inside and you're going to fold it just
like<00:00:09.000> you<00:00:09.120> did<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.389> other<00:00:09.540> one<00:00:10.010> we're<00:00:11.010> going

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
like you did the other one we're going

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.400 
like you did the other one we're going
to<00:00:11.219> use<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.490> same<00:00:11.730> pattern<00:00:12.110> but<00:00:13.110> we're

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
to use the same pattern but we're

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
to use the same pattern but we're
actually<00:00:13.590> going<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.630> cut<00:00:15.630> this<00:00:15.870> smaller<00:00:16.770> since

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
actually going to cut this smaller since

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.859 
actually going to cut this smaller since
it's<00:00:17.640> going<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.940> be<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.150> inside<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.690> bag

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
it's going to be the inside of the bag

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.380 
it's going to be the inside of the bag
and<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.289> inside<00:00:19.710> won't<00:00:19.920> be<00:00:20.100> pleated<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:21.270> it

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
and the inside won't be pleated so it

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.640 
and the inside won't be pleated so it
has<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.900> be<00:00:22.080> smaller<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.160> order<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.460> fit<00:00:24.650> I'm

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650

bottom

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.310 

what<00:01:44.760> I've<00:01:44.850> done<00:01:45.000> now<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.240> was<00:01:45.390> taking<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
what I've done now I was taking the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.249 
what I've done now I was taking the
fabric<00:01:47.250> for<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.549> inside<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.960> went<00:01:49.170> ahead

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
fabric for the inside and I went ahead

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.050 
fabric for the inside and I went ahead
and<00:01:49.409> pleated<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:49.950> was<00:01:50.189> going<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.610> gather<00:01:50.790> it

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
and pleated it I was going to gather it

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.990 
and pleated it I was going to gather it
but<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.299> figured<00:01:51.770> let's<00:01:52.770> save<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> whole<00:01:53.310> new

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
but I figured let's save a whole new

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.390 
but I figured let's save a whole new
step<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.630> we'll<00:01:55.229> just<00:01:55.409> do<00:01:55.710> exactly<00:01:56.130> what<00:01:56.280> we

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
step and we'll just do exactly what we

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.100 
step and we'll just do exactly what we
did<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.790> outside<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.420> inside<00:01:57.509> but

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
did on the outside to the inside but

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.109 
did on the outside to the inside but
this<00:01:58.920> time<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.310> pleats<00:01:59.549> are<00:01:59.700> going<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.000> be

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
this time the pleats are going to be

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.480 
this time the pleats are going to be
slightly<00:02:00.420> smaller<00:02:00.659> since<00:02:01.590> we<00:02:01.830> did<00:02:01.979> cut<00:02:02.280> this

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
slightly smaller since we did cut this

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.880 
slightly smaller since we did cut this
smaller<00:02:03.380> for<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.530> inside<00:02:04.970> so<00:02:05.970> just<00:02:06.710> gonna<00:02:07.710> get

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
smaller for the inside so just gonna get

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.820 
smaller for the inside so just gonna get
set<00:02:08.220> up<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.720> sew<00:02:09.720> across<00:02:09.840> just<00:02:10.319> like<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.679> did

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
set up and sew across just like you did

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.090 
set up and sew across just like you did
before<00:02:10.860> I'm<00:02:11.730> going<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.300> sew<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:13.230> two<00:02:13.500> sides<00:02:13.860> of

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
before I'm going to sew the two sides of

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.699 
before I'm going to sew the two sides of
the<00:02:14.340> inside<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.910> bag<00:02:15.090> together<00:02:15.930> just<00:02:16.470> like

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
the inside of the bag together just like

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.340 
the inside of the bag together just like
I<00:02:16.830> did<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.130> outside<00:02:17.550> time<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.300> sew<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.569> inside

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
I did the outside time to sew the inside

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.070 
I did the outside time to sew the inside
and<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:19.950> side<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.370> bags<00:02:20.550> together<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.780> we

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
and a side of the bags together and we

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.559 
and a side of the bags together and we
probably<00:02:22.380> learn<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.459> more<00:02:23.640> trickier<00:02:24.150> parts

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
probably learn the more trickier parts

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.970 
probably learn the more trickier parts
just<00:02:24.930> sewing<00:02:25.230> this<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:26.519> have<00:02:26.790> this<00:02:27.980> inside

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
part I have it inside out so that when I

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.070

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
sew it together across this along the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.110 
sew it together across this along the
top<00:03:11.430> how<00:03:12.120> what<00:03:12.269> I<00:03:12.299> did<00:03:12.570> is<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:12.870> flip<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.500> bag

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
side that still needs to be starting at

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.930 
side that still needs to be starting at
the<00:03:21.269> top<00:03:21.799> and<00:03:22.799> that's<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.430> outside<00:03:23.579> of<00:03:23.850> the
