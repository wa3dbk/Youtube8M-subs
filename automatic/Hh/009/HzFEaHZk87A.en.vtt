see some meters you can see them here

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.699 
see some meters you can see them here
going<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:55.959> this<00:02:56.680> is<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.420> input<00:02:58.420> signal<00:02:58.930> that

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
going and this is the input signal that

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.630 
going and this is the input signal that
