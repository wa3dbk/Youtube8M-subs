00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.880
 Nuclear medicine operates in the area of ​​imaging and therapy in the 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.490
 total is to ascend the sprinter and nuclear doctor he explains that 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.370
 currently there are two types of conventional nuclear medicine that 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.710
 between the available diagnostic imaging methods 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.400
 teaching extension create this awareness and scenography 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.660
 in vitro diagnosis and so far the state radio has to press the 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.930
 Flemish Medical specialty in the area of ​​diagnostic imaging 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.499
 Dear 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:34.030
 geek with the diagnosis medical diagnoses by image 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.070
 and come 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.980
 and also in the area of ​​therapy the main diagnostic method by 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.170
 image anne sinclair actions waist daughters we can name some of them 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.460
 for example cited the meteorology 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.230
 surgery would reflect the rally 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.780
 celebrate the 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.640
 and what is it about 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.420
 these these methods because the site now are almost payments to the company 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.060
 conventional 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.460
 other methods by imaging and chemistry use 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.570
 of more modern equipment of the type 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.360
 pet scan 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.100
 which then carries out the advanced application cycle pathways in medicine 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.810
 Nuclear Medicine is targeted at several areas such as I was cardiac logic 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.530
 many diseases can be diagnosed and treated through 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.530
 nuclear medicine 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.540
 before a patient suspected of having 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.820
 there is then 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.500
 the specific medication finally in clear through cerebral cpmf 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.870
 transitional period which it has played an important 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.410
 in differential diagnosis 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.690
 of types of dementia is that the patient can then 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.840
 in the other the other timetable of application of the rule of the nuclear mind 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.710
 in cardiology for example 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.710
 in the diagnosis of the disease until coroné 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.840
 already through set design 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.340
 cardiac 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.679
 so if it is possible 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.739
 of diagnostics 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.750
 coronary artery disease if this type of 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:17.059
 existing 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:21.879
 many other applications, but it depends heavily on the environment and 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.279
 clinical situation of the moment that is unique 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:27.359
 when that patient so impaired 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.119
 with the method which type of geography 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:32.519
 that patient can be submitted 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.599
 for performing procedures in this medical specialty almost do not exist 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.439
 restrictions 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.939
 these exams may be presented as an alternative to those who use 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:45.709
 iodinated contrast and that offer understandings in some patients the 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.869
 countries 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:52.109
 you are allergic too much for us are minimal 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:58.189
 different from that of relations for example that happen until the 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:03.469
 for him there is practically no type of reaction to the eye drugs that 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:08.119
 are the drugs used rihanna again in parliament we sit 

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:09.469
 insecure 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:13.569
 m in relation to this as it is explained that as soon as she spells she has a 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.740
 differential compared to the years of radio graphs 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.979
 the x-ray 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:21.949
 made through the exchange of energy 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:28.409
 it was there that the morphology of that organ that 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.069
 we are interested in evaluating 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.389
 for example only an x-ray 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.009
 d'urso 

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:39.489
 so that you will then examine the action of the atomic coalition 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:44.219
 that the fractured site does not occur the morphology of that 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:47.169
 success whether they were or not 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:52.319
 to the detriment of the fast-track sector if, for example, in the year 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.149
 with an anatomical detail is not like escaping 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:59.339
 what is the functioning how is it working at kilos 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:02.779
 if there are changes 

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:04.769
 is always positive 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.509
 in water pathophysiology in the function of that only requires changes 

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:11.219
 on here 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:13.789
 can be detected 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:15.799
 at first 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.069
 and there the set has that role 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:21.880
 the conduct of nuclear medicine examinations are quite simple 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:26.349
 in the clinic itself this was the time of 30 minutes the first patient receives 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:30.189
 is the medicine called radiopharmaceuticals 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.900
 either by 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.039
 venous disease in the report also to take into account the clinical 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.680
 nanda nuclear clinical indication 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.210
 it's the exam 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.580
 and then I spent trying to be directed to the movie theater 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:50.860
 the union says then ah I think the spelling 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.550
 Maria and then and these exams are referred to the doctor a specialist 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.379
 of the area 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:00.129
 so better 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:04.569
 the award will be issued by that concept to receive this we forward your 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:06.189
 doctor 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:10.899
 specialist at the time the doctor who accompanies the world understands that he 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.979
 So the diagnosis can be speed-loving. 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:19.719
 recently reminds the developer of its full developer in the production of 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.559
 radioactive material used in the preparation of the radiopharmaceutical 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:27.150
 receive a very good amount below what people 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.990
 need to be able to attend the patients so what we do is a team 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.240
 doctor 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.950
 it is impossible and of the 3 thousand optimize to the maximum the virginity examinations to 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.020
 body exam examination to meet all who need 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.560
 so it is important that there be caution in the indication of two years that want it 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.810
 use this method are exams 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.810
 they always marry me with other medical specialists 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:54.349
 the general practitioner the explosion of a mortar 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:56.439
 I also indicate these animals 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:59.459
 they even have quite specific indications 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:02.030
 on the team really 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.689
 must be used in a way 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:08.110
 is correct when aid is well used 

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:11.839
 can more is the patient who needs 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.409
 this type d 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:15.119
 even wasting
