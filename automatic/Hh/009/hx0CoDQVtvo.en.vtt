I've<00:01:47.840> no<00:01:48.840> idea<00:01:48.869> what<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.410> range<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.800> this

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
I've no idea what the range of this

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.550 
I've no idea what the range of this
thing<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.640> prefer<00:01:51.450> working<00:01:51.840> with<00:01:52.110> three

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
thing is I prefer working with three

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
thing is I prefer working with three
holes<00:01:52.970> because<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.330> can't<00:01:55.170> get<00:01:55.470> any<00:01:55.740> more<00:01:56.190> any

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
holes because I can't get any more any

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.560 
holes because I can't get any more any
more<00:01:57.360> better<00:01:57.960> sounds<00:01:58.440> out<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:59.030> and<00:02:01.160> I<00:02:02.570> have

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
more better sounds out of it and I have

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.260 
more better sounds out of it and I have
absolutely<00:02:04.229> no<00:02:04.530> idea<00:02:04.560> if<00:02:05.160> it<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.580> possible<00:02:05.880> to

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
absolutely no idea if it is possible to

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.310 
absolutely no idea if it is possible to
choose<00:02:06.479> these<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:07.429> can<00:02:08.429> meet<00:02:08.580> from<00:02:08.729> read<00:02:08.910> notes

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
choose these I can meet from read notes

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.210 
choose these I can meet from read notes
so<00:02:10.320> um<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:11.840> display<00:02:12.840> something<00:02:13.140> on<00:02:13.470> it<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.950> I

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
so um I display something on it and I

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.310 
so um I display something on it and I
hope<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.959> works

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
hope it works

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.130 
hope it works
very<00:02:17.100> important<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.820> is<00:02:18.060> how<00:02:18.390> hard<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:18.900> blow

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
very important is is how hard you blow

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.460 
very important is is how hard you blow
so<00:02:19.830> if<00:02:20.070> you<00:02:20.250> blow<00:02:20.459> quite<00:02:21.180> hard<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:21.720> might<00:02:22.020> get

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
so if you blow quite hard you might get

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.560 
so if you blow quite hard you might get
a<00:02:22.739> higher<00:02:23.459> note<00:02:24.320> so<00:02:25.430> many<00:02:26.430> songs<00:02:26.910> will<00:02:27.209> become

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
a higher note so many songs will become

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:41.660 
a higher note so many songs will become
possible<00:02:27.920> like<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:30.060> Mario<00:02:30.330> spin<00:02:40.310> if<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.459> only

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
possible like the Mario spin if you only

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.810 
possible like the Mario spin if you only
blow<00:02:42.000> hot<00:02:42.269> it<00:02:42.540> will<00:02:42.780> be<00:02:42.900> enough<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:44.130> get

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
blow hot it will be enough to to get

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.030 
blow hot it will be enough to to get
songs<00:02:45.120> out<00:02:45.360> of<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:46.019> I<00:02:46.440> hope<00:02:48.650> not<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.830> icy

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
songs out of this and I hope not the icy

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.060 
songs out of this and I hope not the icy
ocarina<00:02:50.850> will<00:02:51.150> be<00:02:51.440> famous<00:02:52.440> among<00:02:52.829> the

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
ocarina will be famous among the

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.560 
ocarina will be famous among the
Internet<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:55.640> I'll<00:02:56.640> see<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.030> next<00:02:57.060> video
