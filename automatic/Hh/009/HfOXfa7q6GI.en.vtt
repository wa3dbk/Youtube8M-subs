these little knobs if you actually want
to<00:00:26.250> zoom<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.609> on<00:00:26.760> here<00:00:27.060> underneath<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:28.380> little

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
to zoom in on here underneath the little

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.510 
to zoom in on here underneath the little
thought<00:00:28.769> pads<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.939> what<00:00:30.119> these<00:00:30.330> do<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.660> they

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
thought pads and what these do is they

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.639 
thought pads and what these do is they
let's<00:00:32.520> say<00:00:32.640> loosen<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.480> tension<00:00:33.719> sensitivity

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
let's say loosen the tension sensitivity

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.889 
let's say loosen the tension sensitivity
so<00:00:35.550> if<00:00:35.640> there's<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.880> specific<00:00:36.090> game<00:00:36.600> let's<00:00:36.809> say

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
so if there's a specific game let's say

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.150 
so if there's a specific game let's say
a<00:00:36.930> first-person<00:00:37.320> shooter<00:00:37.739> where<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:37.980> want

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
a first-person shooter where you want

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.440 
a first-person shooter where you want
your<00:00:38.280> right<00:00:38.460> stick<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.850> be<00:00:38.940> as<00:00:39.120> stiff<00:00:39.329> as

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
your right stick to be as stiff as

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.970 
your right stick to be as stiff as
possible<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.379> just<00:00:40.410> turn<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.890> right

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
possible you just turn it to the right

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.369 
possible you just turn it to the right
and<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.000> thumbstick<00:00:42.450> becomes<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:43.079> little<00:00:43.260> more

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
and the thumbstick becomes a little more

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.830 
and the thumbstick becomes a little more
stiff<00:00:43.920> if<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.550> wanted<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.879> loosen<00:00:45.030> up<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.719> go

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
stiff if you wanted to loosen up you go

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.029 
stiff if you wanted to loosen up you go
ahead<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:45.989> flip<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.680> other<00:00:46.770> way<00:00:46.950> around

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
ahead and flip it the other way around

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.910 
ahead and flip it the other way around
and<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.969> becomes<00:00:48.180> very<00:00:48.329> loose<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.379> second

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
and it becomes very loose the second

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.819 
and it becomes very loose the second
feature<00:00:50.129> happens<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.180> be<00:00:51.360> these<00:00:51.899> uh<00:00:51.960> what<00:00:52.649> he's

feature happens to be these uh what he's

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.450 
feature happens to be these uh what he's
called<00:00:54.110> multifunction<00:00:55.110> buttons<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.710> they're

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
called multifunction buttons and they're

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.790 
called multifunction buttons and they're
located<00:00:56.969> where<00:00:57.180> generally<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.079> triggers<00:00:58.590> are

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
located where generally the triggers are

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.650 
located where generally the triggers are
except<00:00:59.520> if<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.699> turn<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> controller<00:01:00.300> around

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
except if you turn a controller around

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.510 
except if you turn a controller around
where<00:01:01.530> you're<00:01:01.680> going<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.890> notice<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.309> you

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
a button actually we also have the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.749 
a button actually we also have the
non-slip<00:01:28.320> rubber<00:01:28.439> finish<00:01:29.040> alright<00:01:29.579> I'm<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
non-slip rubber finish alright I'm the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.429 
non-slip rubber finish alright I'm the
prize<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.270> that's<00:01:30.450> basically<00:01:30.689> similar<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.320> our

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
prize so that's basically similar to our

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.649 
prize so that's basically similar to our
minds<00:01:31.680> as<00:01:31.860> well<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.280> actually<00:01:33.060> something

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
minds as well and actually something

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.390 
minds as well and actually something
that<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:33.990> don't<00:01:34.110> see<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.650> prototype<00:01:35.070> at

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
that you don't see in this prototype at

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.230 
that you don't see in this prototype at
the<00:01:35.490> moment<00:01:35.729> because<00:01:35.909> it's<00:01:36.060> still<00:01:36.210> a

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the moment because it's still a

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.810 
the moment because it's still a
prototype<00:01:36.560> it's<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.710> d-pad<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.280> improved

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
prototype it's a d-pad and improved

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.850 
prototype it's a d-pad and improved
d-pad<00:01:39.210> because<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.869> lot<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.170> gamers<00:01:40.530> complained

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
d-pad because a lot of gamers complained

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.620 
d-pad because a lot of gamers complained
about<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.280> defensive<00:01:41.939> being<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.360> bit<00:01:42.600> too

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
about the defensive being a bit too

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.719 
about the defensive being a bit too
wobbly<00:01:43.020> why<00:01:43.530> not<00:01:43.770> very<00:01:43.979> precise<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.579> right

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
wobbly why not very precise the right

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.760 
wobbly why not very precise the right
action<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.570> what<00:01:45.810> we're<00:01:45.990> actually<00:01:46.200> doing<00:01:46.530> at

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
action so what we're actually doing at

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.530 
action so what we're actually doing at
the<00:01:46.890> moment<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.729> can't<00:01:47.939> see<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.180> here<00:01:48.390> is

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the moment you can't see it here is

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.330 
the moment you can't see it here is
basically<00:01:48.720> doing<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.590> different<00:01:49.920> defend<00:01:50.159> we're

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
basically doing a different defend we're

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.190 
basically doing a different defend we're
in<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.490> style<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.970> playstation<00:01:51.600> like<00:01:52.170> a

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
in the style of the playstation like a

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.590 
in the style of the playstation like a
four<00:01:52.560> discrete<00:01:52.890> button<00:01:53.430> kind<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.180> d-pad<00:01:54.570> and

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
four discrete button kind of d-pad and

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.600 
four discrete button kind of d-pad and
that<00:01:54.869> rory<00:01:55.170> attempts<00:01:55.740> which<00:01:56.130> gives<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.460> just

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
that rory attempts which gives you just

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.270 
that rory attempts which gives you just
a<00:01:56.759> much<00:01:57.329> more

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
a much more

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.250 
a much more
control<00:01:59.060> over<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.510> deal<00:01:59.659> with<00:02:00.170> the

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
control over the deal with the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.590 
control over the deal with the
directional<00:02:00.710> pad<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.250> so<00:02:02.210> those<00:02:02.360> are<00:02:02.479> going

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
directional pad and so those are going

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.969 
directional pad and so those are going
to<00:02:02.659> be<00:02:02.720> as<00:02:02.840> snappy<00:02:03.110> as<00:02:03.260> the<00:02:03.650> rest<00:02:03.830> of<00:02:03.890> these

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
to be as snappy as the rest of these

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.609 
to be as snappy as the rest of these
month<00:02:04.250> but<00:02:04.460> as<00:02:04.610> well<00:02:04.850> yeah<00:02:05.290> it's<00:02:06.290> a<00:02:06.350> hyper

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
month but as well yeah it's a hyper

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.770 
month but as well yeah it's a hyper
respond<00:02:07.100> technology<00:02:07.700> as<00:02:07.880> we<00:02:08.030> call<00:02:08.240> it<00:02:08.270> it's

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
respond technology as we call it it's

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.660 
respond technology as we call it it's
basically<00:02:09.110> just<00:02:09.380> a<00:02:09.709> little<00:02:09.950> shorter<00:02:10.459> travel

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
basically just a little shorter travel

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.750 
basically just a little shorter travel
time<00:02:11.319> so<00:02:12.319> you<00:02:12.380> can<00:02:12.470> actuate<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.100> controls<00:02:13.610> a

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
time so you can actuate the controls a

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.870 
time so you can actuate the controls a
lot<00:02:13.910> faster<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.890> they<00:02:15.890> give<00:02:16.640> you<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.760> better

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
lot faster and they give you a better

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.090 
lot faster and they give you a better
tactile<00:02:17.450> inaudible<00:02:18.020> feedback<00:02:18.230> when<00:02:18.980> you

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
tactile inaudible feedback when you

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.040 
tactile inaudible feedback when you
actually<00:02:19.280> actually<00:02:19.550> because<00:02:20.180> when<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:20.930> were

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
actually actually because when you were

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.530 
actually actually because when you were
talking<00:02:21.260> about<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.830> remapping<00:02:22.819> write

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
talking about the remapping write

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.020 
talking about the remapping write
something<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.290> actually<00:02:24.500> is<00:02:25.100> a<00:02:25.459> lot<00:02:25.760> more

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
something that actually is a lot more

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.840 
something that actually is a lot more
useful<00:02:26.300> than<00:02:26.540> mapping<00:02:27.440> into<00:02:27.680> a<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:28.040> acts<00:02:28.340> when

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
useful than mapping into a and acts when

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.670 
useful than mapping into a and acts when
we<00:02:29.000> find<00:02:29.270> its<00:02:29.420> message<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.200> these<00:02:30.320> trigger

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
we find its message to these trigger

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.300 
we find its message to these trigger
buttons<00:02:31.070> so<00:02:31.580> all<00:02:32.150> right<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:32.870> when<00:02:33.769> you<00:02:33.920> map<00:02:34.280> it

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.750 
headset and as you said it's wireless so
that's<00:03:21.709> pretty<00:03:21.980> much<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.160> main<00:03:22.370> reason<00:03:22.670> why

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
that's pretty much the main reason why

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.340 
that's pretty much the main reason why
we're<00:03:22.940> just<00:03:22.970> using<00:03:23.269> restaurants<00:03:24.170> that<00:03:24.230> are

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
we're just using restaurants that are

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.020 
we're just using restaurants that are
supposed<00:03:24.680> to<00:03:24.739> discrete<00:03:25.190> surround<00:03:25.489> that<00:03:25.549> right

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
supposed to discrete surround that right

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.819 
supposed to discrete surround that right
because<00:03:26.329> at<00:03:26.540> surround<00:03:26.900> sound<00:03:27.049> because<00:03:27.260> if<00:03:27.650> you

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
because at surround sound because if you

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.190 
because at surround sound because if you
use<00:03:28.190> actually<00:03:28.579> discrete<00:03:29.030> surround<00:03:29.329> sound<00:03:29.630> the

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
use actually discrete surround sound the

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.229 
use actually discrete surround sound the
drives<00:03:30.530> will<00:03:30.799> just<00:03:31.190> try<00:03:31.340> it<00:03:31.430> drain<00:03:31.730> a<00:03:31.760> lot<00:03:32.030> of

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
drives will just try it drain a lot of

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.120 
drives will just try it drain a lot of
power<00:03:32.480> out<00:03:32.780> of<00:03:32.810> it<00:03:32.989> and<00:03:33.170> then<00:03:33.350> actually<00:03:33.950> yeah

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
power out of it and then actually yeah

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.440 
power out of it and then actually yeah
you<00:03:34.190> can<00:03:34.459> use<00:03:34.579> it<00:03:34.670> for<00:03:34.760> 20<00:03:35.030> minutes<00:03:35.269> and<00:03:35.329> then

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
you can use it for 20 minutes and then

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.930 
you can use it for 20 minutes and then
put<00:03:35.660> it<00:03:35.810> away<00:03:35.870> so<00:03:36.530> a<00:03:36.799> vicious<00:03:37.220> ransom<00:03:37.609> was<00:03:37.730> just

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
put it away so a vicious ransom was just

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.840 
put it away so a vicious ransom was just
bad<00:03:38.180> at<00:03:38.209> alternative<00:03:38.900> here<00:03:39.340> when<00:03:40.340> we<00:03:40.579> won't

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.580 
say wireless it's not a hundred percent
tree<00:03:43.579> it's<00:03:43.730> sammie<00:03:44.000> wireless<00:03:44.510> because<00:03:45.049> you

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
tree it's sammie wireless because you

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.140 
tree it's sammie wireless because you
know<00:03:45.680> with<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:45.920> experts<00:03:46.489> the<00:03:46.579> audience<00:03:47.000> will

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
know with the experts the audience will

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.330 
know with the experts the audience will
it<00:03:47.239> up<00:03:47.329> into<00:03:47.570> two<00:03:47.600> right<00:03:48.049> right<00:03:48.350> um<00:03:48.650> so<00:03:49.130> it's

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
it up into two right right um so it's

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.099 
it up into two right right um so it's
the<00:03:49.670> in-game<00:03:50.000> audio<00:03:50.269> and<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:50.959> voice

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
the in-game audio and the voice

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.470 
the in-game audio and the voice
communication<00:03:51.890> right<00:03:52.280> for<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.880> indiamart<00:03:53.359> is

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
communication right for the indiamart is

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.030 
communication right for the indiamart is
absolutely<00:03:53.989> wireless<00:03:54.380> but<00:03:54.590> if<00:03:54.709> you<00:03:54.799> do<00:03:55.010> want

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
your optical out into the base station

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.010 
your optical out into the base station
and<00:04:18.880> power<00:04:19.880> up<00:04:20.030> the<00:04:20.420> base<00:04:20.540> station<00:04:20.720> you're

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020 
and power up the base station you're

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.110 
and power up the base station you're
basically<00:04:21.440> good<00:04:21.650> to<00:04:21.800> go<00:04:21.980> what<00:04:22.520> you<00:04:22.640> are<00:04:22.790> what

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
do an audio pass through from the base

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.710 
do an audio pass through from the base
station<00:04:27.170> to<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.680> TV<00:04:28.100> so<00:04:28.700> you<00:04:28.730> hook<00:04:29.210> up<00:04:29.360> your<00:04:29.450> TV

q3 2010 it's a bit difficult to plan
that<00:06:25.080> because<00:06:25.350> like<00:06:25.950> we're<00:06:26.130> working<00:06:26.400> with

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
that because like we're working with

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.100 
that because like we're working with
Microsoft<00:06:27.030> so<00:06:27.360> everything<00:06:27.810> has<00:06:27.930> to<00:06:28.080> go

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
Microsoft so everything has to go

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.440 
Microsoft so everything has to go
through<00:06:28.410> a<00:06:28.470> certain<00:06:29.220> approval<00:06:29.910> process

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.450 
through a certain approval process

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.660 
through a certain approval process
absolutely<00:06:31.140> so<00:06:31.860> in<00:06:31.980> addition<00:06:32.100> to<00:06:32.340> our<00:06:32.430> own

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:32.670 
absolutely so in addition to our own

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.220 
absolutely so in addition to our own
quality<00:06:33.210> controls<00:06:33.600> we<00:06:33.720> have<00:06:33.810> to<00:06:33.930> go<00:06:34.020> through

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
quality controls we have to go through

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.880 
quality controls we have to go through
Microsoft<00:06:34.680> so<00:06:35.100> it<00:06:35.460> takes<00:06:36.240> a<00:06:36.360> bit<00:06:36.480> of<00:06:36.510> time<00:06:36.600> but

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:36.890 
Microsoft so it takes a bit of time but

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.250 
Microsoft so it takes a bit of time but
q3<00:06:37.890> is<00:06:37.920> a<00:06:38.100> very<00:06:38.700> solid<00:06:39.060> day<00:06:39.210> back<00:06:39.450> next<00:06:39.840> LA<00:06:40.020> Kris
