00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.990 
guess on the right hand side is the
longer<00:01:50.860> that<00:01:50.890> your<00:01:51.220> beard<00:01:51.400> is<00:01:51.460> going<00:01:51.549> to<00:01:51.670> be<00:01:51.790> so

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
longer that your beard is going to be so

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.280 
longer that your beard is going to be so
if<00:01:52.090> you<00:01:52.180> use<00:01:52.390> a<00:01:52.659> no<00:01:53.409> shaver<00:01:54.340> beard<00:01:54.960> or<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:56.020> big

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
if you use a no shaver beard or a big

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.560 
if you use a no shaver beard or a big
bar<00:01:56.979> full<00:01:57.280> with<00:01:57.610> a<00:01:57.640> razor<00:01:57.939> I<00:01:58.060> guess<00:01:58.240> your<00:01:58.390> beard

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
bar full with a razor I guess your beard

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.330 
bar full with a razor I guess your beard
will<00:01:58.689> be<00:01:58.780> shorter<00:01:59.140> if<00:01:59.259> you<00:01:59.350> use<00:01:59.470> a<00:01:59.500> smaller<00:02:00.130> one

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
will be shorter if you use a smaller one

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.039 
will be shorter if you use a smaller one
that<00:02:00.490> will<00:02:00.579> be<00:02:00.670> larger<00:02:01.090> I'll<00:02:01.450> know<00:02:01.689> which<00:02:01.869> way

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
that will be larger I'll know which way

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.539 
that will be larger I'll know which way
they<00:02:02.229> want<00:02:02.350> depend<00:02:02.740> on<00:02:02.860> it<00:02:02.979> but<00:02:03.130> it<00:02:03.250> looks<00:02:03.490> like

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
they want depend on it but it looks like

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:04.859 
they want depend on it but it looks like
it's<00:02:03.759> using<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.060> second<00:02:04.509> bar<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:04.750> it's

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
it's using the second bar and it's

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.679 
it's using the second bar and it's
pretty<00:02:05.110> decently<00:02:05.770> ranged<00:02:06.759> right<00:02:06.939> there<00:02:07.149> and

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
pretty decently ranged right there and

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.440 
pretty decently ranged right there and
then<00:02:07.780> if<00:02:07.869> we<00:02:07.960> move<00:02:08.110> on<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.560> number<00:02:09.280> six<00:02:10.209> right

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
then if we move on to number six right

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.060 
then if we move on to number six right
here<00:02:10.479> number<00:02:10.959> five<00:02:11.140> you<00:02:11.320> can<00:02:11.440> actually<00:02:11.590> choose

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
here number five you can actually choose

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.250 
here number five you can actually choose
the<00:02:12.489> to<00:02:12.730> do<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.180> playoff<00:02:13.540> beard<00:02:13.780> growth<00:02:14.049> if

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
the to do the playoff beard growth if

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.630 
the to do the playoff beard growth if
your<00:02:14.470> team<00:02:14.650> does<00:02:14.860> make<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.489> playoffs

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
your team does make it to the playoffs

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.150 
your team does make it to the playoffs
it<00:02:16.030> will<00:02:16.180> extend<00:02:16.540> out<00:02:16.959> which<00:02:17.620> is<00:02:17.769> pretty<00:02:17.919> nice

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
it will extend out which is pretty nice

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.879 
it will extend out which is pretty nice
to<00:02:18.370> see<00:02:18.609> and<00:02:18.820> even<00:02:19.570> you<00:02:19.750> can<00:02:19.989> go<00:02:20.139> as<00:02:20.290> far<00:02:20.530> as<00:02:20.680> to

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:20.889 
to see and even you can go as far as to

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:21.910 
to see and even you can go as far as to

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
selected but this time they are actually

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.920 
selected but this time they are actually
going<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.489> be<00:02:40.610> giving<00:02:40.850> us<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.150> color<00:02:41.780> wheel

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930

one thing I wanted to note there it
seems<00:03:21.650> as<00:03:21.920> though<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.130> potential<00:03:22.910> system

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
seems as though the potential system

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.690 
seems as though the potential system
that<00:03:23.690> they<00:03:23.720> had<00:03:24.019> last<00:03:24.680> year<00:03:24.920> which<00:03:25.250> is<00:03:25.280> the

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
that they had last year which is the

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.729 
that they had last year which is the
franchise<00:03:26.630> players<00:03:26.989> you<00:03:27.290> know<00:03:27.410> elite

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
franchise players you know elite

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.520 
franchise players you know elite
potential<00:03:28.250> players<00:03:28.430> high<00:03:29.000> medium<00:03:29.630> or<00:03:29.750> low<00:03:29.810> it

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
potential players high medium or low it

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.170 
potential players high medium or low it
looks<00:03:30.829> like<00:03:30.890> that<00:03:31.160> potential<00:03:31.670> system<00:03:32.000> is

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
looks like that potential system is

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.940 
looks like that potential system is
going<00:03:32.359> to<00:03:32.630> be<00:03:32.810> making<00:03:32.989> a<00:03:33.290> return<00:03:33.320> this<00:03:33.920> year

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
going to be making a return this year

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.240 
going to be making a return this year
which<00:03:34.459> you<00:03:35.209> know<00:03:35.359> I'm<00:03:35.570> not<00:03:35.769> too<00:03:36.769> happy<00:03:37.040> about
