00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
and depending on where he is such as his

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.170 
and depending on where he is such as his
schoolhouse<00:01:02.039> service<00:01:02.760> or<00:01:03.239> his<00:01:03.359> home<00:01:05.030> he<00:01:06.030> can

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
do different items so let's just say

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.420 
do different items so let's just say
let's<00:01:09.000> go<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.619> school<00:01:10.619> there's<00:01:10.979> two<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.310> them

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
let's go to school there's two of them

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.149 
let's go to school there's two of them
which<00:01:11.670> function<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.869> school<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.350> I'm<00:01:13.560> just

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
which function is a school and I'm just

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.890 
which function is a school and I'm just
still<00:01:14.430> trying<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.670> figure<00:01:14.970> out<00:01:15.000> what<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
still trying to figure out what the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.230 
still trying to figure out what the
difference<00:01:15.990> between<00:01:16.350> these<00:01:16.619> two<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.090> so<00:01:18.090> let's

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
difference between these two is so let's

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.330 
difference between these two is so let's
just<00:01:18.360> pick<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.540> one<00:01:18.810> here

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.010 

and<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.060> can<00:01:27.210> see<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> little<00:01:27.810> school

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
once there you can see those the ABC

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.320 
once there you can see those the ABC
chalkboard<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.399> there<00:01:41.700> are<00:01:41.820> many<00:01:41.970> different

downward and you choose how many there
are<00:02:07.459> so<00:02:08.459> therefore<00:02:15.319> and<00:02:16.319> then<00:02:17.069> this<00:02:17.280> one<00:02:17.459> you

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
are so therefore and then this one you

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:27.559 
are so therefore and then this one you
choose<00:02:18.269> different<00:02:18.510> shapes<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.700> match<00:02:20.700> it

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.330

and say you can push the escape button

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.750 
and say you can push the escape button
and<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.700> goes<00:02:29.819> back<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.060> mode<00:02:30.599> screen<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:31.760> you

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
and it goes back to mode screen and you

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.130 
and it goes back to mode screen and you
can<00:02:32.939> check<00:02:33.150> how<00:02:33.420> much<00:02:33.569> he's<00:02:33.750> learned<00:02:33.930> his

that game I had just shown you the

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.979 
that game I had just shown you the
alphabet<00:02:41.189> of<00:02:41.640> how<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.209> help<00:02:42.420> how<00:02:42.659> well<00:02:42.840> he's

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
alphabet of how to help how well he's

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.190 
alphabet of how to help how well he's
doing<00:02:43.170> in<00:02:43.349> math<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:45.840> discipline<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.440> art

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
doing in math and the discipline and art

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.280 
doing in math and the discipline and art
and<00:02:49.760> so<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:50.849> can<00:02:51.180> take<00:02:51.629> him<00:02:51.810> back<00:02:51.840> on<00:02:52.200> the
