00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.140
 hello I am, I am and I am the extra 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.630
 an original super cool idea and very 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.900
 easy to do for valentine today 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.790
 I bring a sweet sushi recipe yes of the 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.740
 sweet sushi so let's surprise 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.780
 our couples if they want to see how it 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.869
 makes this delicious recipe let's see 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.070
 how it is done 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.400
 we started to beat an egg in a 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.400
 container 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.580
 we add a glass of milk 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.050
 and a glass of sugar remember that all 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.350
 our measure will be of a glass 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.350
 medium 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.840
 we tossed two glasses of flour and 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.840
 we mix super good 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.329
 and we put the tail on, I used a 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.520
 envelope of tail cao but if not what 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.520
 you can put three tablespoons 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.840
 in a large pan we take a little 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.590
 of butter so we do not get burned 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.590
 our crepes 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.860
 we started preparing the filling of 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.950
 our sushi we take a quarter of cheese 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.879
 in cream and a spoonful of sugar and what 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.879
 we mix super good 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.110
 better mix with a spoon because 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.049
 with the rods you can not because 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.980
 went all in so it would be better 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.980
 a spoon that easier 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.970
 i 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.950
 we started cutting our pancakes 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.720
 we cut the sides like this forming a 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.720
 square as I am doing 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.940
 we take our mat from their 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.800
 informing him of kitchen plastic 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:18.570
 we put our creams or pancakes and 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.570
 we started to spread the cream cheese 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.810
 if you do not have the mat, nothing happens 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.810
 we roll it with your hand and you're done 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.650
 we cut to feel the fruit that more 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.650
 like it and we put it in the center 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.540
 we started to roll our sushi but 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.280
 compressing fine so when 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.520
 let's cut we do not get fired 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.520
 creams 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.760
 i 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.480
 We started cutting our sushi with a 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:36.000
 knife that cuts well like that in the hour 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.000
 to cut do not miss any fruit 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:08.099
 we would stay like this now in a container 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:11.239
 small we throw our chocolate that 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:11.239
 I would simulate soy 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.570
 to make the presentation more beautiful 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.000
 forget to put the chopsticks 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.400
 So it's more beautiful and original and ready 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.040
 we are finished if you like the idea that 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.750
 it's super original so nothing if it has 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.790
