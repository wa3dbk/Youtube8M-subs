00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.790
 I spend a big part of my life 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.589
 profession to criticize video games 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.389
 depending on which format and with 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.610
 which goal I'm going to see this 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.469
 criticism always different if 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.780
 I robin which video games over 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.760
 heavy rain Mr. goal then that is not 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.859
 factual and fair dispute 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.270
 with all aspects of the game my 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.580
 I have opinion at this time 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.650
 already formed and the video services 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.750
 me then only on this opinion 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.740
 as entertaining as possible 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.779
 to bring the man 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.790
 However, when I write test reports 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.680
 then my approach looks 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.540
 of course fundamentally different from me 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.520
 try not completely objectively 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.040
 to approach the matter because that's all 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.079
 basically a thing of impossibility 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.480
 represents a game after objective 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.550
 criticized 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.160
 means all of them 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.020
 to ignore emotional aspects and it 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.600
 instead, like a toaster alone 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.289
 based on its functional competence too 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.180
 assess 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.430
 in this way of proceeding 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.469
 all artistic aspects of a 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.750
 video game completely excluded and 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.960
 ignored in the case of playing like 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.400
 journey mia or shadow of the colossus 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.510
 Therefore, this system comes very fast 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.189
 to its limits 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.350
 none of these games is a game 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.760
 mechanically especially strong anyway 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.770
 However, they are in my opinion 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.520
 the most impressive play of all 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.770
 times 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.689
 cernys beautiful and partly already 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.729
 almost spiritual journey through a 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.619
 Let the land be perfect 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.750
 rather short and does not require much from me 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.119
 more than the stick in the direction of travel 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.950
 to keep and little demanding 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.790
 jump and sneak passages 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.770
 complete 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.960
 he uses his well-known 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.000
 Game mechanics and character squads around 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.829
 as unique as it is surprising 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.360
 to tell the story in this 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.399
 form only in a video game 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.619
 works and not completely independent 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.600
 from the moderate technology could pack 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.850
 I would have been on the colossus offering me 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.280
 meanwhile a gigantic world in 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.140
 absolutely nothing happens 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.420
 was often criticized because of us 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.310
 Video games are used to them 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.740
 new tasks and tasks on each corner 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.049
 present adventure in shadow of the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.000
 colossus is the omnipresent feeling 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.849
 but a whole one of loneliness 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.800
 essential element of the teaching world 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.380
 is therefore an excellent feature 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.060
 point up without their emotional impact 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.860
 the players would enjoy these games 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.510
 lose their biggest strengths 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.550
 a prominent victim of this 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.230
 Approach was 2012 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.230
 released first person shooter 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.180
 Almost every test spec 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.560
 spoke of the emotional effect of 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.450
 play and how to do it with one 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.740
 unique and important message 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.500
 a statement about this entire 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.390
 industry gives up so it actually has 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.730
 already done more than any other 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.680
 person shooter of the last years 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.180
 but because spec ops the line is not 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.430
 at the same time with the 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.600
 staging of call of duty and the 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.670
 until the last shot 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.100
 perfected gameplay by gears of 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.570
 it was able to keep up with it 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.460
 sixth and seventh ratings 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.380
 fed up because his strengths are not 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.290
 always easily measurable game features 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.330
 lay the game celebrities of all the 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.780
 magazine punished those at their 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.280
 are exactly dependent on it 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.630
 all subjective impressions of the 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.880
 to exclude testers 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.590
 Not everybody works that way 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.240
 tester refers to his reviews 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.550
 past experiences with one 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.620
 whether consciously or unconsciously when it does 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.180
 the possibilities would be objectively correct 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.100
 to write play tests 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.900
 then they would have to be in consequence 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.390
 from it also generally as correct 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.880
 be viewed at absolutely every test 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.500
 whether it be objective or not 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.760
 However, people who are not with the 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.010
 agree 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.750
 that is in the nature of the matter we 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.910
 do not play video games in one 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.680
 vacuum due to our past 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.720
 Experiences, we fans are certain 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.820
 genres have within this chance 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.320
 certain preferences and others 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.100
 features in principle even 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.350
 not suffer 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.750
 therefore there is no sense as 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.680
 review to try out these experiences 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.959
 hide 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.360
 it 's just impossible and leads to 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.880
 a sheer objectivity absolutely 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.500
 Nobody helps in my tests call 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.470
 That's why I'm always very clear 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.130
 opinion without trying 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.300
 general statements 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.070
 filter out 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.410
 Feeding too subjective and 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.970
 often stressful reviews for you 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.310
 as consumers, however, very much 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.200
 Helpful are who giga now 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.540
 he knows a few weeks already 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.669
 which games taste I have one 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.010
 I know that I'm not a big fan of final 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.200
 fantasy 13 or david cage for that though 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.100
 big metal gear would be solid fan 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.720
 So I test 15 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.330
 and that I really liked it 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.830
 then fans of final fantasy 13 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.720
 probably skeptical 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.670
 In principle, they seem to be one 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.740
 to have a different taste than me 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.470
 So it could be that final 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.140
 fantasy 15 despite my positive criticism 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.300
 do not like it so subjective 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.650
 then the people do not criticize 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.020
 agree with them because they 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.270
 based on the taste of the author a lot 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.140
 can better judge if you are with him 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.300
 are of opinion 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.820
 by the way, it's actually the other way around 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.070
 also possible to like the game of 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.470
 a critic was received negatively 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.420
 but the lack of critical ability many 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.700
 player and he suddenly starting 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.550
 defense reflex offers enough material 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.850
 for a separate episode of robin versus 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.470
 hello this is a and car 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.150
 Animal had seen between that 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.770
 the end caps pity that before you yes her 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.090
 be smart people but i want to 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.980
 even smart people can make mistakes 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.810
 they can in fact sometimes people on 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.120
 complain if they criticize 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.460
 because criticism sometimes not so 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.960
 good the greatest strength of a part of the 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.580
 community, i have the feeling and 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.000
 I wanted to talk about that 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.530
 made 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 in the new episode of robin des 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.070
 video games down there we now have the 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.640
 press away in this video now 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.580
 it's your turn 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.260
 To everyone must at some point so then 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.580
 there are two more videos that are 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.650
 it was particularly exciting there are things 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.900
 like fun, and if you like it all 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.040
 Look closely, you will also find chocolate 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.760
 because a lot of fun 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.760
 bye
