00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.300
 has two 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.220
 after starting 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.220

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.700
 marquez 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.510
 so that everything can create nothing 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.370
 in the positions of 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.830
 when these extravagances in person we move forward the same so you see it 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.830

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.530
 often 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.190
 to a greater degree 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.140
 at length 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.040
 etienne names the sce is called first box below is the thinnest one 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.880
 thousand flame 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.700
 the one that follows 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.520
 it's called like that 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.520

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.299
 about his life yes 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.959
 there are times in online music notebooks 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:22.569
 Banks arrived to find sheet music 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.159
 the notes is not written in Spanish 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.459
 they will find it in English 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.099
 by then here we see it written 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.219
 for what 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:32.249
 They can see 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:34.449
 easily 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:37.839
 in order percent bravo above the expo 2000 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.109
 in the series or rather 

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:48.339
 an ace 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:55.399
 now let's be in order 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:59.639
 the sector will be present 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.729
 the step to the appointment 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:03.249
 the kutxa bank 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.489
 we also have that here 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.449
 that is all 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:09.960
 spent the following hours 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.289
 cash 

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:14.749
 English lyrics were distributed 

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:16.229
 also law be 

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:20.829
 Betis Arafat at a point of the goalkeeper sar because Portugal does not matter yes the 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.189
 more English or Spanish day 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.209
 oo france or whatever you always know 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.689
 that square in others 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:31.789
 that is used 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:35.019
 to translate it sitel or clothes is good that propenda saints 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:37.379
 in Spanish 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.659
 and then they have not come into sauce hours 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:41.859
 among them 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.689
 these are others have 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.889
 each one in its place and sustainable 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.739
 jesus usÃ³n 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.919
 it's a half tone 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.909
 greater than the previous one to say something 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.909
 and there was a piano 

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:01.839
 let's say this spring 

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:09.119
 that state 

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:11.469
 this scene 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:13.119
 so 

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:15.039
 everything is essential 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:16.530
 here is in america 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.309
 that is a bra 

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:21.309
 that's merit not after finger 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.200
 righ now 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.809
 before network 

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:26.499
 after this and from here 

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:29.499
 it is no longer valid 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.479
 because it is composed of measuring everything chewed sustained 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.229
 immediate until 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.919
 they meditated osment 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.539
 that is something basic of the music it is important that they learn before 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:46.819
 start with the chords or something over the phone 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:49.710
 in the future 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.990
 to understand it better because if I tell them it was irrigated 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.699
 imanol type because juan de arco rival 

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:00.589
 dv 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:03.139
 from rl 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:06.479
 there is another tone because we have other measures 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.309
 which would be resistant 

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.689
 so we have all two sharp 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:15.050
 resist well 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.479
 now as you see 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.229
 he does not have 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:20.409
 a bold 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:22.189
 so 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:24.289
 community has 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.120
 a room like that 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.120
 well that means that a thousand 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:31.949
 afa 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:35.300
 aena the work we did not walk complete like him 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.289
 I will not do 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.699
 denny afa there are medicines that's why we're here so I put it to that 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:44.699
 move away unsustainable ninot 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.710
 after that fatal moment sun so another 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:54.150
 who are they 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.110
 there is another tone 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.969
 while still intact 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:59.550
 but the hand 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.550
 I said 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.409
 aena is then 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:07.559
 nini 

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:09.300
 not even 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.719
 they have their salaries something very important 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:13.020
 it surprises me 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.129
 that we go back to the guitar strings 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:18.129
 learning what this government has done 

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:19.669
 you will be able 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:20.940
 identify the cosmonauts
