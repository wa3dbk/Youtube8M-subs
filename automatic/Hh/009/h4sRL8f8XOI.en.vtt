00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.679
 mario kart is back the game of 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:09.120
 favorite races of people who do not like 

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:10.410
 no racing games is definitely 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.999
 back on wii or with a 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.889
 shimmering presentation that makes it 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:15.419
 certainly very cute to watch 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.400
 it's a game that is very cute to 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.110
 look but level gameplay that is 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.490
 he in this episode 6 of a show that 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.110
 happens to be the best show of 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.460
 video game review ever released 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.290
 belgium we will ask you the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.810
 simple question of where this mario 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.550
 kart ci who is the mario kart wii himself 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.440
 found in relation to the pantheon of the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.690
 mario kart thing is that that's what 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.469
 you will know in this episode 6 of 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.469
 cruel critics 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.270
 since 92 the mario kart series you 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.160
 proposes to do tricks and 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.270
 detours on these paved portions of the 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.280
 mushroom kingdom that we can see 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.540
 finally only in the mario kart games 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.400
 because if you have already noticed what 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.230
 goes for soil in this country there you 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.970
 certainly know that lava is not 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.620
 badly the brick is not bad but 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.180
 the asphalt is much better at least if 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.800
 you never want to do it 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.630
 race on with small map 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.470
 so here's a card game finally 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.490
 it's not really a card game 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.750
 could not play belote you 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.100
 can not play poker could not 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.620
 playing the battle is however you 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.200
 can do the aa battle of karting 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.490
 because you have cards and little ones 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.500
 submarines and things that you 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.729
 can drive in a universe where we have 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.520
 decided that this time we are alone in 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.900
 play antigravity as in f zero but 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.700
 we did not invite captain falcon 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.680
 because you have to believe that if you want 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.420
 to have a series that survives at nintendo 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.160
 you have every interest in 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.750
 boss got back on motorcycle is a 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160
 gold idea the f zero series it was not 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.630
 an idea to him he does not like and 0 and 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.220
 find it a bit vulgar find it a 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.500
 little more than trying to make a beautiful 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.729
 pure arcade air racy is 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.320
 hard to play where people can 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.880
 not send you fucking bonuses 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.470
 stupid in the mouth because let's admit the 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.730
 there was a time when nintendo had a 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.590
 series of racing games it was not 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.060
 Mario kart will never be mario kart 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.410
 it was zero because the mario games 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.930
 kart is fighting games in the arena 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.850
 on ribbon think for a brief moment 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.040
 so here we are with a game it's 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.989
 certainly the 8th so-called suite of 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.850
 mario kart and mario kart 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.709
 8 is mario kart on wii or and that 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.299
 turns very pretty it's very cute and he 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.590
 there are lots of things that are interesting 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.510
 to do except that not really no 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.340
 more so here it is a very game 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.530
 friendly who is well done and who 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.720
 you ask this simple little problem it's 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.420
 what's going on in a series when 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.940
 we try to try to recast his 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.190
 fundamentals around a geek who goes to 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.230
 the back of the fundamental geeks of the 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.150
 k series the fact is that this is not 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.010
 as much a mario kart as it could have 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.450
 to be a mario kart and that any 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.590
 series player made raw will be able to 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.180
 to say it's still con that they have 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.280
 foot us 0 in the air to do that 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.870
 because it's not as good of a pure 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.130
 point of view of the remarkable things 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.410
 and that are phenomenal because 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.090
 let's admit the mario kart is the game where 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.350
 you run okay then after 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.580
 someone sends you a bonus in the 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.570
 mouth and that will teach you to try to 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.739
 drive in a racing game that is 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.160
 not a racing game and it's not 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.110
 serious 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.299
 so here you have mario kart wii is a 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.190
 nintendo game and idy software developers 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.200
 group number one is people who are 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.220
 responsible for nintendogs cd mario kart 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.010
 and who also help in all this 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.330
 bandai namco games as weird as 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.130
 it may seem they probably have 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.540
 helped with 3d or something like that 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.920
 you will know it by discovering the 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.540
 generic game that we will have it 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.270
 bought that you will have finished it by you 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.880
 same band of little rascals so that's 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.650
 a title that runs is here by kosuke 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.780
 yabuki rhin that only has four possible 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.570
 games of which mario kart wii you mario kart 7 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.860
 mario kart wii and twilight princess the 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.540
 game for people who were not a fan 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.460
 of twilight that was maybe not 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.390
 no longer totally fan of zelda no 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.370
 more but it was a very game 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.630
 friendly and its products by hideki 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.060
 konno the guy he is in the room 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.130
 position of having to enter the cash 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.300
 in the titin of the company nintendo 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.020
 because he's the one doing the games 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.660
 who are selling 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.250
 he worked on a lot of super mario he 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.680
 to the entire mario series 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.780
 catching his terrible terrible bag and 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.459
 it's a man who knows what he's doing there 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.660
 always do the same game they try 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.070
 to make mario kart 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.600
 so this time he did a mario 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.950
 kart inspired by f0 and was not 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.049
 particularly serious because it 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.150
 works fine and he did it all 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.340
 that on the bass end is a game that 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.290
 you are deeply who are spitting you 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.000
 to the mouth that insults you who is 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.200
 very very hard who did not want you 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.180
 can finish it and that in addition 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.280
 require that you play a system 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.410
 solo that has not moved closer to 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.850
 20 years to unlock the system 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.590
 of customization you will need 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.810
 to be able to have fun online or 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.280
 against your friends in split screen that's 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.750
 a game like this is an old school game 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.250
 and that's also what makes the big 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.140
 quality of a title like mario kart 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.690
 is that mario kart operates on his 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.990
 own value system mario kart did 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.760
 like real live competition that him 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.290
 even despite what these guys are trying to 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.930
 tell you with sonic all stars racing 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.880
 transforms to associate that it's a game 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.979
 who as long as there is a mario kart 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.570
 can position itself against others 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.860
 mario kart and as such it's a 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.330
 excellent heartache it is in addition a 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.430
 mario kart who is the first mario kart 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.130
 so-called idg dins turn in 720p 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.360
 nato in 720p and 60 frames the second 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.160
 because that's how we do 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.479
 Mario kart and all the choices 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.370
 techniques that were carried out in order to 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.860
 realize this game were made in order to 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.020
 offer you the best experience 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.640
 possible gameplay in this mario kart 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.830
 sic and this mario kart 8 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.050
 and here but what can we say 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.000
 what it's sad that 0 is dead for 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.800
 give your life to mario kart and mario kart 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.910
 it's been a long time since they're 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.729
 as good as they were during 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.750
 merckaert 64 double dash it was not 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.450
 terrible mario kart 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.760
 it's a nice game but it's a 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.140
 little mario kart wii plus mario kart 7 and 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.700
 the twelve-ball replays that we can 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.700
 play I played juen July same 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.840
 soucy all to yourself short is a game 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.790
 nice but it's kind of the first 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.190
 mario kart of the youtube generation the 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.840
 goal is to become possibly viral 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.310
 by videos that will advertise the game 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.290
 that they will sell the incredible 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.090
 abilities that you will have to sell 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.620
 maybe the wiiu because it's the game 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.330
 who is trying to save 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.370
 sales of the wii or because 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.570
 definitely make a console without play it 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.710
 does not help out games because 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.700
 people they do not buy the console 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.900
 because there is no game and that 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.770
 certainly people who produce 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.030
 games do not play because they 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.390
 are going to imagine that it's not going to sell the 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.210
 console 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.160
 gold mario kart wii you finally know one of 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.630
 three or four games out on wii or 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.370
 who are as good as they are supposed to 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.570
 to be you should buy it it's a 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.430
 excellent game with music 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.500
 friendly fuji puppies atsuko 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.050
 Assault yole akamatsu and illiassou to 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.450
 who he attacks he is certainly not 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.130
 the son of the other, and that's good ben 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.990
 it's sad for f zero but it was necessary 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.210
 know this is that if you are not 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.770
 miyamoto at nintendo are you going 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.970
 to fuck your ideas will never be 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.610
 recognized for their great value 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:44.620
 and here we are in a world where 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:48.690
 decidedly mario kart is saved but at 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.690
 what price my god but at what price
