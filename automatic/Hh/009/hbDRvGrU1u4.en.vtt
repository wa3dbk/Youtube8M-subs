there's<00:02:36.799> going<00:02:36.920> to<00:02:37.010> be<00:02:37.069> one<00:02:37.340> screw<00:02:37.760> right<00:02:38.030> in

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
there's going to be one screw right in

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.140 
there's going to be one screw right in
here<00:02:38.420> you<00:02:38.450> go<00:02:38.599> one<00:02:38.780> on<00:02:38.870> this<00:02:38.959> view<00:02:39.970> looks<00:02:40.970> like

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
here you go one on this view looks like

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.640 
here you go one on this view looks like
it's<00:02:41.269> going<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.660> same<00:02:41.900> type<00:02:42.140> of<00:02:42.170> screwed<00:02:42.560> as

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
it's going the same type of screwed as

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:49.150 
it's going the same type of screwed as
the<00:02:42.739> last<00:02:42.950> one<00:02:45.970> indeed<00:02:46.970> is<00:02:47.799> now<00:02:48.799> I<00:02:48.829> should<00:02:49.129> be

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
the last one indeed is now I should be

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.069 
the last one indeed is now I should be
able<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:49.400> lift<00:02:49.579> this<00:02:49.819> up<00:02:50.150> and<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.810> mess

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
able to lift this up and the mess

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.440 
able to lift this up and the mess
actually<00:02:51.620> there's<00:02:51.739> no<00:02:51.859> screw<00:02:52.130> right<00:02:52.250> here<00:02:53.350> so

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
actually there's no screw right here so

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.259 
actually there's no screw right here so
hang<00:02:56.450> on<00:02:56.600> screw<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:57.049> one<00:02:57.850> now<00:02:58.850> it<00:02:59.090> should<00:02:59.239> be

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
hang on screw that one now it should be

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.410 
hang on screw that one now it should be
used<00:02:59.480> to<00:02:59.540> be<00:02:59.600> a<00:02:59.630> little<00:02:59.959> bit<00:03:00.079> straight<00:03:00.500> up<00:03:01.420> so

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
used to be a little bit straight up so

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.680 
used to be a little bit straight up so
this<00:03:02.480> is<00:03:02.630> very<00:03:02.810> similar<00:03:03.079> to<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:04.269> other<00:03:05.269> part

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
this is very similar to the other part

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.400 
this is very similar to the other part
this<00:03:05.870> is<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:06.109> DVD<00:03:06.380> DVD<00:03:07.030> drive<00:03:08.230> just<00:03:09.230> the

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
this is the DVD DVD drive just the

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.110 
this is the DVD DVD drive just the
casing<00:03:10.540> alright<00:03:11.540> there's<00:03:12.139> that<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:13.430> now

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
casing alright there's that and now

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.550 
casing alright there's that and now
we've<00:03:14.269> actually<00:03:14.420> got<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.930> motherboard<00:03:15.380> of

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
we've actually got to the motherboard of

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.599 
we've actually got to the motherboard of
the<00:03:16.340> whole<00:03:16.519> thing<00:03:16.900> now<00:03:18.040> if<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:19.190> remember<00:03:19.489> when

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
the whole thing now if you remember when

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.670 
the whole thing now if you remember when
I<00:03:19.639> took<00:03:19.730> apart<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.030> PlayStation<00:03:20.750> it<00:03:21.530> was

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
I took apart the PlayStation it was

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.530 
I took apart the PlayStation it was
incredibly<00:03:22.069> complicated<00:03:22.430> this<00:03:22.790> one<00:03:23.060> not<00:03:23.329> so

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
incredibly complicated this one not so

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.740 
incredibly complicated this one not so
much

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
much

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.229 
much
it's<00:03:24.380> basically<00:03:24.919> just<00:03:25.040> a<00:03:25.370> computer<00:03:25.849> the<00:03:25.970> setup

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
it's basically just a computer the setup

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.710 
it's basically just a computer the setup
is<00:03:26.359> very<00:03:26.690> similar<00:03:27.579> so<00:03:28.579> you<00:03:29.090> can<00:03:29.239> see<00:03:29.389> over<00:03:29.419> here

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
is very similar so you can see over here

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.780 
is very similar so you can see over here
we've<00:03:30.049> got<00:03:30.079> the<00:03:30.230> power<00:03:30.530> in<00:03:31.370> fact<00:03:31.519> these<00:03:31.730> are

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
we've got the power in fact these are

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.610 
we've got the power in fact these are
this<00:03:32.030> is<00:03:32.090> actually<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:32.720> same<00:03:32.989> sort<00:03:33.349> of<00:03:33.380> power

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
this is actually the same sort of power

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.229 
this is actually the same sort of power
connectors<00:03:34.069> that<00:03:34.220> you<00:03:34.280> would<00:03:34.400> see<00:03:34.579> from<00:03:34.849> a

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
connectors that you would see from a

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.309 
connectors that you would see from a
real<00:03:36.079> computer<00:03:37.660> so<00:03:38.660> if<00:03:38.780> we<00:03:38.900> want<00:03:39.079> to<00:03:39.139> actually

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
real computer so if we want to actually

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.370 
real computer so if we want to actually
take<00:03:39.650> all<00:03:39.829> of<00:03:40.010> this<00:03:40.130> part<00:03:41.109> we're<00:03:42.109> going<00:03:42.290> to

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
take all of this part we're going to

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.990 
take all of this part we're going to
have<00:03:42.829> to<00:03:42.980> do<00:03:43.099> a<00:03:43.130> couple<00:03:43.430> things<00:03:43.459> one<00:03:43.819> we're

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
have to do a couple things one we're

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.190 
have to do a couple things one we're
going<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.180> have<00:03:44.269> to<00:03:44.359> be<00:03:44.450> unplug<00:03:44.989> the

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
going to have to be unplug the

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.150 
going to have to be unplug the
motherboard<00:03:45.769> power<00:03:46.310> supply<00:03:47.060> here<00:03:47.980> we're<00:03:48.980> also

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
motherboard power supply here we're also

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.550 
motherboard power supply here we're also
going<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.549> have<00:03:49.639> to<00:03:49.730> unplug<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.150> controller

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
going to have to unplug the controller

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.470 
going to have to unplug the controller
ports<00:03:51.560> there's<00:03:52.489> going<00:03:52.609> to<00:03:52.669> be<00:03:52.730> one<00:03:52.910> here<00:03:53.239> and

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
ports there's going to be one here and

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.550 
ports there's going to be one here and
then<00:03:54.380> one<00:03:54.590> here<00:03:55.329> finally<00:03:56.329> the<00:03:56.510> second<00:03:57.049> or<00:03:57.530> the

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
then one here finally the second or the

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.350 
then one here finally the second or the
power<00:03:57.890> switches

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
power switches

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.560 
power switches
and<00:03:59.690> so<00:04:00.170> now<00:04:00.290> we've<00:04:00.410> got<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:01.090> power<00:04:02.090> section

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
and so now we've got the power section

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.990 
and so now we've got the power section
completely<00:04:03.220> um<00:04:05.320> unhooked<00:04:06.610> so<00:04:07.610> we<00:04:07.790> take<00:04:07.970> that

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
completely um unhooked so we take that

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.810 
completely um unhooked so we take that
apart<00:04:08.390> simply<00:04:09.260> unscrew<00:04:09.740> all<00:04:09.770> the<00:04:10.040> screws<00:04:10.370> is

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
apart simply unscrew all the screws is

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:18.370 
apart simply unscrew all the screws is
going<00:04:10.970> to<00:04:12.490> 1c<00:04:14.590> these<00:04:15.590> two<00:04:16.989> might<00:04:17.989> only<00:04:18.140> be<00:04:18.260> two

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
going to 1c these two might only be two

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.320 
going to 1c these two might only be two
let's<00:04:18.709> just<00:04:18.890> take<00:04:19.040> these<00:04:19.160> two<00:04:19.370> off<00:04:19.400> these<00:04:20.299> are

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
let's just take these two off these are

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:21.970 
let's just take these two off these are
all<00:04:20.480> the<00:04:20.630> same<00:04:20.750> screws<00:04:21.080> as<00:04:21.230> the<00:04:21.350> previous<00:04:21.739> kind

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
all the same screws as the previous kind

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.010 
all the same screws as the previous kind
so<00:04:22.660> shouldn't<00:04:23.660> have<00:04:23.750> to<00:04:23.840> worry<00:04:23.960> about

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
so shouldn't have to worry about

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.670 
so shouldn't have to worry about
separating<00:04:24.440> those<00:04:24.620> selasa<00:04:25.430> there<00:04:26.560> there<00:04:27.560> we

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
separating those selasa there there we

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.470 
separating those selasa there there we
go<00:04:30.340> this<00:04:31.340> should<00:04:31.520> come<00:04:31.670> straight<00:04:31.940> off<00:04:31.970> now

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
go this should come straight off now

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.680 
go this should come straight off now
you're<00:04:33.320> very<00:04:33.380> careful<00:04:33.710> with<00:04:33.950> power<00:04:34.420> after<00:04:35.420> all

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
you're very careful with power after all

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.790 
you're very careful with power after all
there's<00:04:35.840> these<00:04:35.930> huge<00:04:36.020> capacitors<00:04:36.740> in<00:04:36.860> here<00:04:37.010> so

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
there's these huge capacitors in here so

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.310 
there's these huge capacitors in here so
try<00:04:39.800> and<00:04:39.980> connect<00:04:40.280> any<00:04:40.520> of<00:04:40.640> these<00:04:41.320> cables

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
try and connect any of these cables

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.830 
try and connect any of these cables
before<00:04:42.440> you<00:04:42.680> touch<00:04:42.890> anything<00:04:43.090> and<00:04:44.090> just<00:04:44.120> be

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
before you touch anything and just be

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.120 
before you touch anything and just be
very<00:04:44.870> careful<00:04:45.200> about<00:04:45.380> steps<00:04:45.650> into<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:45.860> bottom

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
very careful about steps into the bottom

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.000 
very careful about steps into the bottom
so<00:04:46.910> you<00:04:47.030> have<00:04:47.180> it<00:04:47.300> that's<00:04:47.390> the<00:04:47.510> power<00:04:48.010> yeah

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
so you have it that's the power yeah

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.310 
so you have it that's the power yeah
pretty<00:04:49.220> similar<00:04:49.550> to<00:04:49.610> a<00:04:50.030> PC<00:04:50.690> power<00:04:50.870> supply<00:04:51.170> just

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
pretty similar to a PC power supply just

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.360 
pretty similar to a PC power supply just
only<00:04:51.920> two<00:04:52.220> outputs<00:04:53.770> place<00:04:54.770> that<00:04:54.980> off<00:04:55.130> to<00:04:55.280> the

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
only two outputs place that off to the

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.950 
only two outputs place that off to the
side<00:04:57.640> so<00:04:58.640> now<00:04:58.910> I'm<00:04:59.030> going<00:04:59.240> to<00:04:59.330> just<00:04:59.600> take<00:04:59.780> off

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
side so now I'm going to just take off

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:06.610 
side so now I'm going to just take off
the<00:05:00.250> IDE<00:05:02.110> port<00:05:03.460> or<00:05:04.720> plug<00:05:05.720> in<00:05:05.900> so<00:05:06.350> this<00:05:06.530> is

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
the IDE port or plug in so this is

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.900 
the IDE port or plug in so this is
actually<00:05:06.950> standard<00:05:07.340> the<00:05:07.460> same<00:05:07.610> thing<00:05:07.790> you'd

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
actually standard the same thing you'd

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.980 
actually standard the same thing you'd
see<00:05:08.090> in<00:05:08.150> a<00:05:08.210> computer<00:05:08.570> as<00:05:09.280> well<00:05:10.280> is<00:05:10.490> this<00:05:10.990> CD

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
see in a computer as well is this CD

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.230 
see in a computer as well is this CD
power<00:05:12.520> so<00:05:13.520> we're<00:05:13.640> going<00:05:13.730> to<00:05:13.790> take<00:05:13.910> that<00:05:14.090> off

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
power so we're going to take that off

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.480 
power so we're going to take that off
now<00:05:15.169> we're<00:05:15.380> pretty<00:05:15.620> much<00:05:15.830> left<00:05:16.100> with<00:05:16.310> the

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
now we're pretty much left with the

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
now we're pretty much left with the
motherboard<00:05:16.820> and<00:05:17.440> take<00:05:18.440> the<00:05:18.590> motherboard<00:05:18.980> out

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
motherboard and take the motherboard out

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.850 
motherboard and take the motherboard out
see<00:05:20.510> you<00:05:20.570> shouldn't<00:05:20.810> be<00:05:20.870> too<00:05:21.050> difficult<00:05:21.080> first

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
see you shouldn't be too difficult first

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:22.810 
see you shouldn't be too difficult first
of<00:05:21.980> all<00:05:22.040> we're<00:05:22.160> going<00:05:22.250> to<00:05:22.310> want<00:05:22.460> to<00:05:22.490> take<00:05:22.640> the

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
of all we're going to want to take the

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.990 
of all we're going to want to take the
fan<00:05:23.720> out<00:05:24.440> here<00:05:24.740> so<00:05:24.919> unplug<00:05:25.220> little<00:05:25.520> fan

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
fan out here so unplug little fan

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.020 
fan out here so unplug little fan
thing<00:05:26.690> the<00:05:26.960> fan<00:05:27.169> looks<00:05:27.380> like<00:05:27.530> it's<00:05:27.650> just

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
thing the fan looks like it's just

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.510 
thing the fan looks like it's just
hooked<00:05:29.030> on<00:05:29.270> yeah<00:05:29.919> so<00:05:30.919> looks<00:05:31.220> like<00:05:31.250> we're<00:05:31.430> going

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
hooked on yeah so looks like we're going

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.120 
hooked on yeah so looks like we're going
to<00:05:31.610> need<00:05:31.730> a<00:05:31.760> flathead<00:05:32.560> no<00:05:33.560> actually<00:05:33.919> the<00:05:33.980> fan

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
to need a flathead no actually the fan

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.820 
to need a flathead no actually the fan
just<00:05:34.280> like<00:05:34.370> should<00:05:34.940> lift<00:05:35.090> straight<00:05:35.330> up<00:05:35.680> so<00:05:36.680> it

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
just like should lift straight up so it

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:44.650 
just like should lift straight up so it
looks<00:05:37.040> like<00:05:37.660> um<00:05:43.090> yeah<00:05:44.090> let's<00:05:44.360> see<00:05:44.480> how<00:05:44.600> does

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
looks like um yeah let's see how does

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.210 
looks like um yeah let's see how does
this<00:05:44.780> work<00:05:44.990> I<00:05:45.110> think<00:05:45.140> I<00:05:45.590> think<00:05:45.950> we<00:05:46.040> have<00:05:46.130> to

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
this work I think I think we have to

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.580 
this work I think I think we have to
push<00:05:46.460> in<00:05:46.669> the<00:05:46.910> tool<00:05:47.750> thing<00:05:47.990> but<00:05:48.169> actually<00:05:48.350> I

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
push in the tool thing but actually I

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.200 
push in the tool thing but actually I
don't<00:05:48.980> think<00:05:49.190> we<00:05:49.310> have<00:05:49.460> to<00:05:49.610> take<00:05:49.760> the<00:05:49.850> fan<00:05:50.060> out

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
don't think we have to take the fan out

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.170 
don't think we have to take the fan out
and<00:05:50.680> you<00:05:51.680> shouldn't<00:05:51.980> ever<00:05:52.040> need<00:05:52.340> to<00:05:52.490> anyway<00:05:52.760> so

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
and you shouldn't ever need to anyway so

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.480 
and you shouldn't ever need to anyway so
we've<00:05:53.300> got<00:05:53.450> everything<00:05:53.690> unplugged<00:05:54.400> let's<00:05:55.400> go

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
we've got everything unplugged let's go

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:56.560 
we've got everything unplugged let's go
ahead<00:05:55.580> and<00:05:55.790> unscrew<00:05:55.880> the<00:05:56.150> motherboard

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
ahead and unscrew the motherboard

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.360 
ahead and unscrew the motherboard
there's<00:05:56.720> gonna<00:05:56.840> be<00:05:56.930> quite<00:05:57.530> a<00:05:57.590> few<00:05:57.860> screws<00:05:58.190> on

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
there's gonna be quite a few screws on

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.390 
there's gonna be quite a few screws on
this<00:05:58.520> one<00:05:59.169> there's<00:06:00.169> one<00:06:00.350> these<00:06:00.890> are<00:06:01.130> still<00:06:01.370> the

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
this one there's one these are still the

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.220 
this one there's one these are still the
same<00:06:01.610> type<00:06:01.820> of<00:06:01.850> screws<00:06:02.770> two<00:06:03.770> screws

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.230 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:15.030 

three<00:06:10.950> four<00:06:11.950> I<00:06:13.620> imagine<00:06:14.620> this<00:06:14.680> is<00:06:14.740> quite

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.040 
three four I imagine this is quite

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:38.940 
three four I imagine this is quite
boring<00:06:15.540> five<00:06:19.950> six<00:06:25.620> seven<00:06:30.000> eight<00:06:31.000> nine<00:06:37.950> it

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
boring five six seven eight nine it

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.410 
boring five six seven eight nine it
looks<00:06:39.430> like<00:06:39.550> there's<00:06:39.700> going<00:06:39.730> to<00:06:39.850> be<00:06:39.910> two<00:06:40.150> more

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:40.420 
looks like there's going to be two more

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:46.470 
looks like there's going to be two more
screws<00:06:40.690> for<00:06:41.670> eleven<00:06:42.930> right<00:06:43.930> in<00:06:44.170> here<00:06:45.270> on<00:06:46.270> the

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:46.480 
screws for eleven right in here on the

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:56.820

type of screw very convenient Thank You
Microsoft<00:07:00.030> so<00:07:01.030> now<00:07:01.150> the<00:07:01.210> motherboard<00:07:01.690> should

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
Microsoft so now the motherboard should

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.380 
Microsoft so now the motherboard should
be<00:07:02.490> undone<00:07:03.490> so<00:07:03.670> you're<00:07:03.760> going<00:07:03.910> to<00:07:03.970> lift<00:07:04.150> it<00:07:04.270> up

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:04.390 
be undone so you're going to lift it up

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.110 
be undone so you're going to lift it up
a<00:07:04.510> lip<00:07:04.690> on<00:07:04.810> this<00:07:05.110> side<00:07:05.350> first<00:07:05.590> and<00:07:06.090> want<00:07:07.090> to

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 
a lip on this side first and want to

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.410 
a lip on this side first and want to
sort<00:07:07.330> of<00:07:08.550> pull<00:07:09.550> it<00:07:09.700> out<00:07:09.910> it's<00:07:10.180> gonna<00:07:10.300> be<00:07:10.390> a

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:10.420 
sort of pull it out it's gonna be a

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:11.850 
sort of pull it out it's gonna be a
little<00:07:10.600> awkward<00:07:10.840> because<00:07:11.260> we<00:07:11.530> have<00:07:11.710> the

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:11.860 
little awkward because we have the

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.670 
little awkward because we have the
connectors<00:07:12.310> in<00:07:12.430> here<00:07:13.050> but<00:07:14.050> you<00:07:14.320> should<00:07:14.350> just

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 
connectors in here but you should just

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.800 
connectors in here but you should just
be<00:07:14.770> able<00:07:14.830> to<00:07:14.950> pull<00:07:15.100> it<00:07:15.160> right<00:07:15.190> out<00:07:15.510> so<00:07:16.510> there<00:07:16.690> we

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:16.810 
be able to pull it right out so there we

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:17.940 
be able to pull it right out so there we
go<00:07:16.840> I<00:07:16.930> shouldn't<00:07:17.230> hold<00:07:17.290> it<00:07:17.440> by<00:07:17.500> the<00:07:17.560> heatsink

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:17.950 
go I shouldn't hold it by the heatsink

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.670 
go I shouldn't hold it by the heatsink
this<00:07:18.910> is<00:07:19.180> the<00:07:19.360> motherboard<00:07:19.780> here<00:07:20.020> you<00:07:20.440> got<00:07:20.560> the

this is the motherboard here you got the

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.850 
this is the motherboard here you got the

CPU and the GPU under these heat sinks

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.140 
CPU and the GPU under these heat sinks
pretty<00:07:23.860> standard<00:07:24.280> actually<00:07:24.700> incredibly

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:25.150 
pretty standard actually incredibly

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:30.180
