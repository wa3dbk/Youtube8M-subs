00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:03.360

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.999

 or 8 iPod Touch 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.839
 have fun with the video 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:24.560
 everyone's like 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.099
 the case costs 14 99 m, there is 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.509
 next year 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.800
 first thing about others 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.800
 in other shops are not because unfortunately 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.660
 Carlo with the brawn-box in parliament 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.200
 is included 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.960
 now that Klaas 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.960
 without Fritz Trulli or accessories 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.610
 To Faymann's MeÃŸkirch 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.130
 but it was still cut out 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.840
 Cacau Bathen 1 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.170
 Covered according to Stepic Grasp covered 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.510
 Underdog area free 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.750
 and of course 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.210
 also free for displays 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.190
 Nigel Mansell iPod 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.190
 pester us 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.220
 So the concept stays good in the Grace 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.220
 Nice not out or something 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.229
 As you can see, Kammerer is still perfect 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.610
 no problems with the microphone 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.210
 space 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.210
 Woman waiting to be quarreled 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.450
 That's why I asked for it 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.550
 and here is also still referring 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.550
 Can Werder 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.700
 there are buttons can also be used very well 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.049
 and of course, the block can be 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.949
 use 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:23.509
 and you can too 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:26.209
 connect to headphones 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.209
 and you can also use it well 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.699
 a disadvantage for me but there are already the smallest 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:41.249
 in fact 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:44.319
 pulls he is very very strong in front of Sulander big bag 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.469
 otherwise it is really very good device and for the price can be 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.549
 Nothing 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.539
 also recommend 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:57.869
 Benny not disturb for the time being 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:59.399
 like me soldiers 

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:01.169
 to buy a case 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.819
 Protecting the iPod not only 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.369
 Drazan but also violations 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:09.559
 drop under it 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:13.109
 even more often already fallen down since the same of two three weeks 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.639
 used 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.639
 and you see 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.829
 may have damage 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:29.059
 that's it going to have recovered from these 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:32.019
 on boxing and video video 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.009
 I believe that everyone does not like it 

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:35.829
 and to have people first
