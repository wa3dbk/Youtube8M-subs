00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
it's the smoothing one so like I said my

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.500 
it's the smoothing one so like I said my
hair<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.210> really<00:00:33.960> dry<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.469> really<00:00:34.739> coarse<00:00:35.160> uh

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
hair is really dry and really coarse uh

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.619 
hair is really dry and really coarse uh
so<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.899> bleach<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.550> so<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.730> makes<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.180> even

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
so and I bleach it so that makes it even

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.520 
so and I bleach it so that makes it even
more<00:00:40.140> dry<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:40.890> coarse<00:00:41.250> um<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:43.140> thick

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
more dry and coarse um and it's thick

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.580 
more dry and coarse um and it's thick
too<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.789> like<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.390> when<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:46.440> get<00:00:46.530> it

smoothed<00:00:47.100> out<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:48.329> think<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.750> stuff<00:00:48.989> was

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
smoothed out and I think this stuff was

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.670 
smoothed out and I think this stuff was
great<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.920> for<00:00:50.910> what<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.750> title<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.559> it

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
great it for what the title is of it it
