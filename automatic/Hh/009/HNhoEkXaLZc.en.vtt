that was

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.920 
that was
instead<00:05:14.590> of<00:05:14.710> using<00:05:16.050> non<00:05:17.050> copying<00:05:17.850> stuff<00:05:18.930> if

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
instead of using non copying stuff if

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.220 
instead of using non copying stuff if
you<00:05:20.020> guys<00:05:20.170> don't<00:05:20.380> want<00:05:20.590> to<00:05:20.650> do<00:05:20.800> that<00:05:22.140> and<00:05:23.140> you

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
closed eye you can do the open eye on

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.410 
closed eye you can do the open eye on
one<00:05:34.000> side<00:05:34.620> copy<00:05:35.620> to<00:05:35.860> the<00:05:35.980> other<00:05:36.100> side<00:05:36.370> and<00:05:37.240> then

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.420 
one side copy to the other side and then

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.310
