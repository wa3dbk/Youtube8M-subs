improvements just the same figure that

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.969 
improvements just the same figure that
is<00:01:25.049> robe<00:01:25.970> rocky<00:01:26.970> 2<00:01:27.240> figure<00:01:27.570> here<00:01:27.869> same<00:01:28.710> thing

to go with the defeat to clever lying

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.210 
to go with the defeat to clever lying
figure<00:01:36.990> which<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.229> cool<00:01:37.439> because<00:01:37.680> he's<00:01:38.100> going

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
figure which is cool because he's going

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
so the first three figures are exactly

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.560 
so the first three figures are exactly
the<00:01:42.329> same

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
the same

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.910 
the same
rocky<00:01:42.990> 1<00:01:43.140> 2<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.439> 3<00:01:43.470> now<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.850> rocky<00:01:45.030> 4<00:01:45.450> figure

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
rocky 1 2 and 3 now the rocky 4 figure

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.800 
rocky 1 2 and 3 now the rocky 4 figure
they<00:01:46.920> improved<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:48.329> really<00:01:48.540> like<00:01:48.659> this

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
figure let me go over what they improved

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.319 
figure let me go over what they improved
you<00:01:50.430> remember<00:01:50.700> from<00:01:51.350> rocky<00:01:52.350> series<00:01:52.619> 4<00:01:53.329> this

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
you remember from rocky series 4 this

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.630 
you remember from rocky series 4 this
was<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.689> figure<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.079> got<00:01:55.290> but<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.280> was<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
was the figure you got but it was the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.139 
was the figure you got but it was the
exact<00:01:57.299> same<00:01:57.600> head<00:01:58.259> sculpt<00:01:58.710> as<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.549> Rocky<00:01:59.790> 3

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
exact same head sculpt as the Rocky 3

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.440 
exact same head sculpt as the Rocky 3
Rocky<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.170> he<00:02:02.040> didn't<00:02:02.250> have<00:02:02.430> boxing<00:02:03.149> gloves

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
Rocky and he didn't have boxing gloves

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.660 
Rocky and he didn't have boxing gloves
so<00:02:04.350> first<00:02:04.649> thing<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.860> do<00:02:04.979> was<00:02:05.100> they<00:02:05.219> put<00:02:05.399> gloves

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
so first thing to do was they put gloves

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.370 
so first thing to do was they put gloves
on<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.030> rocky<00:02:06.210> 4<00:02:06.570> figure<00:02:06.869> which<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.170> cool

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
on the rocky 4 figure which is cool

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.219 
on the rocky 4 figure which is cool
secondly<00:02:07.979> they<00:02:08.940> have<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.149> new<00:02:09.569> head<00:02:09.720> sculpt<00:02:10.110> on

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
secondly they have a new head sculpt on

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.040 
secondly they have a new head sculpt on
them<00:02:10.349> now<00:02:10.530> by<00:02:11.280> new<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.910> mean<00:02:12.239> this<00:02:12.599> is<00:02:12.810> the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
them now by new I mean this is the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.350

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
paint changes what they did here was

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.930 
paint changes what they did here was

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.360 
they put the rocky 3 slash rocky 4 head
sculpt<00:02:48.360> on<00:02:48.540> here<00:02:49.050> so<00:02:49.230> he<00:02:49.410> looks<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.830> little<00:02:50.130> bit

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
sculpt on here so he looks a little bit

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.390 
sculpt on here so he looks a little bit
older<00:02:50.700> what<00:02:50.880> she<00:02:51.060> should<00:02:51.360> so<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.320> rocky<00:02:52.500> 4<00:02:53.040> and

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
older what she should so the rocky 4 and

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.730 
older what she should so the rocky 4 and
the<00:02:53.790> rocky<00:02:54.090> 5<00:02:54.330> figure<00:02:54.720> they<00:02:54.900> improved<00:02:55.260> on<00:02:55.440> and

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
the rocky 5 figure they improved on and

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.010 
the rocky 5 figure they improved on and
then<00:02:56.580> you<00:02:56.670> have<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:57.210> Rocky<00:02:57.480> Balboa<00:02:57.510> figure

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
then you have the Rocky Balboa figure

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.220 
then you have the Rocky Balboa figure
which<00:02:58.140> is<00:02:58.290> exactly<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.830> same<00:02:58.860> figure<00:03:00.230> so

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
which is exactly the same figure so

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.910 
which is exactly the same figure so
