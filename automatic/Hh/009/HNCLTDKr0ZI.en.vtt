00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
had a camcorder attached to this

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.460 
had a camcorder attached to this
custom-made<00:01:23.400> metal<00:01:23.970> brace<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.930> extends

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
custom-made metal brace that extends

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.920 
custom-made metal brace that extends
four<00:01:25.770> inches<00:01:26.160> above<00:01:26.400> my<00:01:26.460> head<00:01:26.640> now<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.600> cam

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
four inches above my head now the cam

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.510 
four inches above my head now the cam
core<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.230> a<00:01:28.290> live<00:01:28.530> feed<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.040> monitor

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
core is a live feed to this monitor

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.400 
core is a live feed to this monitor
which<00:01:29.940> now<00:01:30.120> enables<00:01:30.600> me<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.750> see<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.170> world

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
which now enables me to see the world

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.320 
which now enables me to see the world
through<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.100> eyes<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.490> six<00:01:32.820> foot<00:01:33.150> three

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
through the eyes of a six foot three

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.429 
through the eyes of a six foot three
inch<00:01:33.750> man

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.149 

so<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.740> what<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.219> like<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.820> be<00:01:38.939> tall<00:01:39.270> a

little bit your perspective is just

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.230 
little bit your perspective is just
slightly<00:01:43.229> different<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.950> quickly<00:01:44.640> realize

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
slightly different I quickly realize

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.539 
slightly different I quickly realize
that<00:01:45.569> for<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> tall<00:01:46.200> person<00:01:46.469> the<00:01:47.100> simplest
