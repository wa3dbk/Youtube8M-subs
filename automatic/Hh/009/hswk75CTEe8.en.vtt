troublemaker

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.860 

this<00:02:22.340> is<00:02:22.550> what<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.760> neighbor<00:02:22.970> guy<00:02:23.180> gave<00:02:23.450> me<00:02:23.480> a

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
this is what the neighbor guy gave me a

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.270 
this is what the neighbor guy gave me a
dog<00:02:24.710> kennel

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
dog kennel

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.710 
dog kennel
I<00:02:26.140> turned<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.260> panels<00:02:27.650> inside<00:02:28.040> out

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.300 

and<00:02:33.140> now<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.500> dog<00:02:33.910> kennel<00:02:35.440> is<00:02:36.440> being<00:02:36.830> used<00:02:37.100> to

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
and now the dog kennel is being used to

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.699 
and now the dog kennel is being used to
keep<00:02:37.460> dogs<00:02:37.790> away<00:02:38.120> from<00:02:38.450> my<00:02:38.570> livestock

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.240 

so<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:43.280> now<00:02:43.489> feel<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:43.730> little<00:02:44.150> bit<00:02:44.420> safer<00:02:45.250> about

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
so I now feel a little bit safer about

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.580 
so I now feel a little bit safer about
going<00:02:46.700> ahead<00:02:46.819> and<00:02:47.090> picking<00:02:47.420> up<00:02:47.540> probably<00:02:48.170> yeah

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
going ahead and picking up probably yeah

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.149 
going ahead and picking up probably yeah
another<00:02:49.250> two<00:02:49.489> three<00:02:49.640> hands<00:02:51.010> give<00:02:52.010> him

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 
another two three hands give him

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.070 
another two three hands give him
something<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:52.610> do

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.800
