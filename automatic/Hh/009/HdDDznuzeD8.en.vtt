over<00:00:45.800> the<00:00:45.890> summer<00:00:46.040> I<00:00:46.220> was<00:00:46.550> researching<00:00:46.850> sony

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
over the summer I was researching sony

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.630 
over the summer I was researching sony
ericsson<00:00:47.870> liveview<00:00:48.230> and<00:00:48.770> how<00:00:49.220> it<00:00:49.370> could

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
ericsson liveview and how it could

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.330 
ericsson liveview and how it could
potentially<00:00:50.410> interweave<00:00:51.410> itself<00:00:51.800> into

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
potentially interweave itself into

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.670 
potentially interweave itself into
fashion<00:00:52.820> I'm<00:00:53.510> really<00:00:53.720> excited<00:00:54.050> about<00:00:54.440> the

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
fashion I'm really excited about the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.740 
fashion I'm really excited about the
sony<00:00:55.100> ericsson<00:00:55.550> project<00:00:55.970> mainly<00:00:56.150> because<00:00:56.360> all

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
sony ericsson project mainly because all

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.590 
sony ericsson project mainly because all
of<00:00:56.780> my<00:00:56.900> designs<00:00:57.350> so<00:00:57.650> far<00:00:58.090> have<00:00:59.090> been<00:00:59.120> to<00:00:59.449> do

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
of my designs so far have been to do

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.510 
of my designs so far have been to do
with<00:00:59.809> technology<00:01:00.110> and<00:01:00.559> fabrics<00:01:01.129> and<00:01:01.370> what's

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
with technology and fabrics and what's

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.070 
with technology and fabrics and what's
happening<00:01:01.850> in<00:01:01.970> the<00:01:02.059> world<00:01:02.090> right<00:01:02.360> now<00:01:02.510> how<00:01:03.020> the

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
happening in the world right now how the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.020 
happening in the world right now how the
movement<00:01:03.379> of<00:01:03.770> technology<00:01:04.519> is<00:01:04.610> coming<00:01:04.910> through

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
movement of technology is coming through

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.139 
movement of technology is coming through
fashion<00:01:05.510> so<00:01:06.020> this<00:01:06.530> should<00:01:06.650> be<00:01:06.710> great<00:01:07.149> android

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
fashion so this should be great android

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:10.330 
fashion so this should be great android
and<00:01:08.450> sueno<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:08.990> $15<00:01:09.530> able<00:01:09.920> to<00:01:10.100> create

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
and sueno to $15 able to create

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.060 
and sueno to $15 able to create
something<00:01:10.369> that's<00:01:10.790> really<00:01:11.259> forward<00:01:12.259> in<00:01:12.530> terms
