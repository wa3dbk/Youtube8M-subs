00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
years I've been a liquid cut up my pace

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.479 
years I've been a liquid cut up my pace
right<00:02:26.329> now<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.810> probably<00:02:27.680> say<00:02:27.980> every<00:02:28.250> year<00:02:28.459> I

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
right now I probably say every year I

right now I probably say every year I
get<00:02:28.609> anywhere<00:02:29.120> for<00:02:29.299> my<00:02:29.420> ten<00:02:29.690> centimeters<00:02:30.230> more

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
get anywhere for my ten centimeters more

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.410 
get anywhere for my ten centimeters more
and<00:02:30.650> then<00:02:30.769> the<00:02:31.069> goal<00:02:31.280> is<00:02:31.459> to<00:02:31.639> 30<00:02:31.880> and<00:02:32.060> I'm<00:02:32.150> about
