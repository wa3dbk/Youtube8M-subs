00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
hanging off it is the DPF I'll just

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.240 
hanging off it is the DPF I'll just
point<00:03:41.420> and<00:03:41.630> look<00:03:41.780> on<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.079> camera<00:03:42.290> it's<00:03:43.010> that

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
to the ECU and you'll see when I hit OK

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.330 
to the ECU and you'll see when I hit OK
it<00:04:24.750> will<00:04:24.780> idle<00:04:25.290> up<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.560> engine<00:04:25.890> will<00:04:26.010> run<00:04:26.160> for

it will idle up the engine will run for
about<00:04:26.430> 15<00:04:26.880> minutes<00:04:27.090> and<00:04:27.300> put<00:04:27.450> it<00:04:27.540> through<00:04:27.660> a

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
about 15 minutes and put it through a

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.070 
about 15 minutes and put it through a
force<00:04:27.930> regen<00:04:28.470> mode

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.390 

and<00:04:34.080> you<00:04:34.200> can<00:04:34.320> hear<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.590> engine<00:04:34.710> now<00:04:35.070> running

and you can hear the engine now running

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.070 
and you can hear the engine now running
a<00:04:35.490> lot<00:04:35.640> higher<00:04:35.850> you<00:04:36.660> need<00:04:36.810> to<00:04:36.900> have<00:04:36.990> an

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
a lot higher you need to have an

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.320 
a lot higher you need to have an
environment<00:04:37.680> where<00:04:37.830> you<00:04:37.950> can<00:04:38.160> suck<00:04:39.120> out<00:04:39.270> all

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
environment where you can suck out all

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.690 
environment where you can suck out all
the<00:04:39.510> exhaust<00:04:39.840> gasses<00:04:40.320> which<00:04:40.500> is<00:04:40.650> why<00:04:40.830> it's

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
the exhaust gasses which is why it's

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.780 
the exhaust gasses which is why it's
facing<00:04:42.000> into<00:04:42.360> our<00:04:42.480> dyno<00:04:42.720> room<00:04:42.990> so<00:04:43.230> we<00:04:43.350> use<00:04:43.530> the

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
facing into our dyno room so we use the

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.890 
facing into our dyno room so we use the
evacuated<00:04:44.790> fan<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.270> get<00:04:45.420> rid<00:04:45.570> of<00:04:45.600> all<00:04:45.810> the

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
evacuated fan to get rid of all the

evacuated fan to get rid of all the
black<00:04:46.110> soot<00:04:46.410> that's<00:04:46.530> going<00:04:46.740> to<00:04:46.800> come<00:04:46.950> out<00:04:46.980> the

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
black soot that's going to come out the

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.060 
black soot that's going to come out the
exhaust<00:04:47.520> and<00:04:48.300> in<00:04:48.660> about<00:04:48.840> 10<00:04:49.110> to<00:04:49.140> 15<00:04:49.620> minutes<00:04:49.950> it

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
exhaust and in about 10 to 15 minutes it

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.910 
exhaust and in about 10 to 15 minutes it
will<00:04:50.130> completed<00:04:50.850> the<00:04:50.940> regen<00:04:51.360> mode<00:04:51.630> and<00:04:51.960> if

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
you about that a lot of people don't

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.680 
you about that a lot of people don't
understand<00:05:32.490> or<00:05:32.640> workshops<00:05:33.060> don't<00:05:33.240> understand

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
understand or workshops don't understand

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.360 
understand or workshops don't understand
these<00:05:33.870> days<00:05:34.110> with<00:05:34.350> modern<00:05:34.680> turbo<00:05:34.980> diesel

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
these days with modern turbo diesel

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.510 
these days with modern turbo diesel
engines<00:05:35.760> when<00:05:36.480> you<00:05:36.780> do<00:05:37.350> an<00:05:37.500> oil<00:05:37.650> change<00:05:37.770> you

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
engines when you do an oil change you

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.160 
engines when you do an oil change you
have<00:05:38.640> to<00:05:38.760> tell<00:05:39.000> the<00:05:39.150> EC<00:05:39.480> you've<00:05:39.720> done<00:05:39.900> an<00:05:40.020> all

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
have to tell the EC you've done an all

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.720 
have to tell the EC you've done an all
change<00:05:40.500> because<00:05:40.590> over<00:05:40.920> a<00:05:41.010> period<00:05:41.250> of<00:05:41.370> time<00:05:41.550> the

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.730 
change because over a period of time the

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.270

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
issue does a calculation for time

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.830 
issue does a calculation for time
traveled<00:05:44.850> and<00:05:45.000> distance<00:05:45.360> travel<00:05:45.780> for<00:05:46.440> the

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
which dilutes the engine oil because

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:56.930 
which dilutes the engine oil because
they<00:05:55.530> run<00:05:55.650> such<00:05:55.920> high<00:05:56.100> combustion<00:05:56.700> to

they run such high combustion to
pressures<00:05:57.720> the<00:05:58.470> engine<00:05:58.950> oil<00:05:59.070> in<00:05:59.340> a<00:05:59.490> diesel<00:05:59.730> and

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
pressures the engine oil in a diesel and

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.360 
pressures the engine oil in a diesel and
effectively<00:06:01.200> gets<00:06:01.380> watered<00:06:01.800> down<00:06:01.830> with

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
doesn't do its job as well because it's

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.900 
doesn't do its job as well because it's

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:09.879 
very diluted it's important you make
