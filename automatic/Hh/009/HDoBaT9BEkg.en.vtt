00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.020
 firm 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.980
 nice all guys I talked to you welcome 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.210
 to the special 1500 members in the five 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.430
 Best gameplay ever 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.020
 first of all c3 thank you really 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.550
 so much for this goal because you are 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.200
 were fantastic to help me 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.180
 to reach it I thank you very much 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.640
 anyway we start immediately at the number place 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.930
 5 we find this gameplay that maybe 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.739
 you have seen why it is quite recent 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.180
 to a 125 2 carried out on nick tondin 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.040
 killed or confirmed what makes it 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.870
 nice is that carried out together only and 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.600
 with rewards that are not Pisan 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.740
 swarm is still very well done 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.350
 also because I was at level thirty e 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.720
 so I didn't have many lost rewards 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.000
 and appropriate then nice gameplay to the number 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.860
 4 we find a gameplay that time was 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.960
 the best I've ever done 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.030
 it is a nuclear in two 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.820
 minutes just split two minutes 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:03.079
 120 seconds with 80 support kills e 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.729
 11,000 experience points guys well 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.140
 11,000 experience points and this is the 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.850
 time just as mentioned before was of a 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.850
 best gameplay 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.590
 fortunately I managed to overcome it 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.040
 however it remains a great gameplay 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.580
 boys at the third position we find a 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.260
 Epic gameplay that the gameplay that 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.479
 we say did open the channel is 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.549
 was my first gameplay on youtube is 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.409
 in my opinion it is very very nice because 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.570
 perhaps the result cannot be understood 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.020
 but from the circumstances yes indeed 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.000
 it's a 47 1 in solo on deathmatch 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.040
 and this is really my opinion very much 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.560
 very good because the boys without 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.689
 group will make 40 7 occasions and then between 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.049
 the other didn't even use the rewards 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:47.150
 which of swarm saccani as I used to before 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.400
 the simple stealth helicopter the visa 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.540
 such peat is the warthog so really 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.729
 a gameplay to consider 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.770
 a gameplay that maybe many of you 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.299
 they had underestimated why they didn't have 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.189
 understood the circumstances in which I had 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.170
 played which are very very circumstances 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.060
 difficult and then maybe to put the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.830
 third position there has also been a while 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.689
 affective side because this guys 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.909
 site gameplay that should be done in 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.709
 first 70 registered via first substance 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.230
 he writes on the canal and it seemed nice to me 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.180
 present it as a thank you video 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.640
 for the 1500 boys as you can see 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.510
 accrued ratio there are 47 deaths 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.310
 very very good 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.500
 at the second position we find a 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.380
 Italian record as I think 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.170
 or a core of team deathmatches 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.030
 in just two minutes it is events 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.470
 I think the Italian record is not me 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.270
 I am up to date anyway I believe that 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.950
 it is because it is a nuclear in 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.410
 deathmatch to point in two minutes and 20 ma 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.360
 to calculate clear without group with of i 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.280
 comrades had not helped indeed 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.930
 companions were very very poor and 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.959
 many times they stole my enemies 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.330
 the game you can see the van 41 8 was 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.800
 really all on our side 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.150
 however I managed to bring in 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.950
 term this nuclear my very opinion 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.240
 very nice because like the first one 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.700
 gameplay you have seen in this video 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.130
 it was level 30 I did n't have an e elvis 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.050
 jackal athens therefore a great deal 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.090
 gameplay a great g gameplay played 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.190
 with a weapon almost always collected by for 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.110
 earth precisely I had started with the ms m 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.300
 ce not with the pdv but I will go to complete the 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.970
 gameplay with the pdv so guys first 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.880
 to move to the first position I would like 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.590
 thank you new low just like that 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.630
 number one the best gameplay of 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.090
 always for me dino boys you can 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.370
 figure it out which one you will ever be already 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.860
 in fact seeing the boys it is about 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.140
 core that brought me my first world 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.200
 record or nuclear only in deathmatch 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.610
 in teams with the former coach enel no one 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.320
 nobody had ever done it on youtube 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.450
 he had never done it but not even up 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.010
 no one had ever tried youtube 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.110
 the first game I succeeded 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.840
 kids something really a lot 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.640
 very nice to see to play was 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.830
 really nice now I managed to 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.420
 to take advantage of all the slightest mistakes 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.299
 of the enemies that many times will make gods 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.760
 films like this, however, are 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.230
 details why a package can be had 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.750
 many defects sea sea ​​remains 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.250
 in any case my play is absurd precisely my 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.600
 nicer gameplay than ever are not 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.880
 never managed to bring such gameplay 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.340
 nice on the canal hoping maybe in 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.890
 future with call of duty ghost I succeed 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.860
 to offer you other videos of this caliber 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.989
 other gameplay so we say absurd 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.769
 we hope that other temples are so beautiful 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:17.600
 so precisely and I hope nothing anyway 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.519
 this thanks video for the 1500s 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.200

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.610
 comment 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.470

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.930
