00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.799
 Well, praise this book, my darling 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:10.110
 No, we will scold her, but it 's good 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:16.789
 bad book 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:21.439
 the beauty of a bad book praise arrogant 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.439
 praise mock 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.370
 hello in this video top me 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.340
 took the dark side of my nature 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.610
 which means that, following the example of our Fuhrer 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.570
 dark empire I have to scold 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:47.070
 one of my favorite books choice 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.510
 was not easy but still I decided that 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.150
 worth today to scold in this video 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.309
 a book that you could repeatedly 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.570
 see lately and in my 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:01.320
 shopping and in various other videos this 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.670
 hobbit john ronald ruell tolkien and 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.530
 the first thing in my opinion is sure 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.860
 need to be noted if we are talking about 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.070
 shadow side hawi then this is it 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.710
 the origin is generally a hobbit tale 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.100
 looks quite distinctive however 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.220
 unclear rumors that have come down to us after all 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.540
 this story has its progenitor and 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.900
 exactly the fairytale snow white and the seven dwarfs and 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.580
 Tolkien be all daughters life 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.829
 a good hobbit would have been 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.799
 the best traditions of modern complex 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:38.520
 fan fiction I can tell you when 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:41.590
 the hobbit is not worth reading unequivocally 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.649
 imagine the picture you saw 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.399
 epic drama lord of the rings then 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.520
 Peter Jackson 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.359
 Another warning and released another 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.880
 the trilogy proudly headlined her hobbit a 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:58.030
 now imagine the lord of the rings 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.639
 this is a heroic epic epic fantasy and 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.100
 if you take up the book after the movie 

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:05.469
 in principle, you will not lose anything 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.410
 this is what was stated in the movie you 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:11.050
 you will find in the book but here if you 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.350
 take up the hobbit book after the movie 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:18.310
 then you at least expect bewilderment 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.770
 like from a fairy tale obviously bold 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.319
 judging by the topic that is raised there 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.020
 on the events that occur there 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.740
 by those cardboard characters who are there 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.080
 dwell 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.330
 really easy to bewildered 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.390
 and even in irritation after all 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.040
 peter jackson what have you done with 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.129
 the source of the dispute is not turned out 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.400
 very epic and cool but the hobbit book 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.500
 quite 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.530
 to disappoint you if you looked 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.950
 the film and tuned in to the epic wave 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.260
 fantasy in the continuation of the lord of the rings 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.400
 the hobbit is still a fairy tale for children with 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.609
 simple language easily magical and 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.590
 very very lucky heroes also 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:03.609
 I strongly recommend not reading 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.659
 hobbit yes indeed places just talk 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:09.079
 if you somehow react sharply to 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.959
 infringement 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.989
 women's rights that is if you are active 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.510
 profess feminism 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:21.200
 the only thing i repeat is the only one 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.450
 the woman in the book is lobelia: sad when 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.670
 vikings which accounts for the distant 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.879
 relative of bilbo baggins 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.280
 and that sleeps and sees that you are bilbo 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.470
 disappeared in the faraway lands to get hold of 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.159
 not just his silver spoon set 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.409
 but the whole estate does not agree the most 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:41.900
 iridescent self-centered feminine 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:44.720
 image in general, the work of Tolkien is not 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.389
 boast very bright and 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.359
 memorable figurative women like that 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:53.120
 so the heroic epic genre hints that 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:56.599
 in middle earth as in any medieval 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.760
 world instead of women usually at home or in 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:01.269
 as a hostess or as a lady 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.970
 hearts anyway in some 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.949
 active fighting she participation is not 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.909
 takes 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:11.000
 the only female character who 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:14.810
 still go against the system and the elven 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.530
 rain order ruler rohan but it's 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.539
 all the same 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.940
 the exception and most female 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.780
 characters but if we don't go deep 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.610
 silmarillion 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.590
 and take only hobbits lord of the rings 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.130
 so here are most female characters 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.260
 but they are not quite 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:33.520
 expressive and if you are looking there 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:37.970
 female character that personifies 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.460
 more active image then you enter it 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.610
 won't find exactly in the hobbit even with 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:46.669
 housewives problems lobelia how are you not 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.150
 strongly disposed to itself even in it 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.099
 the vein 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.129
 but that's probably all that I can 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:54.679
 scold the hobbit in this particular 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:58.509
 I hope this moment was useful for you 

00:04:54.679 --> 00:05:00.110
 video links to masterminds and 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:02.300
 commanders dark and light 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.399
 parties and i will leave in the comments 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.759
 be sure to go and meet 

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:08.330
 them but somewhere higher or lower in your 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.719
 tape 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:15.199
 waiting for you to visit and my bright side 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:17.209

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.779

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:19.779
 until
