00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
outlook for the industry is that the

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.350 
outlook for the industry is that the
shortage<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.530> pilots<00:00:52.920> or<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.579> requirement

shortage of pilots or the requirement
for<00:00:54.390> pilots<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.309> 216,000<00:00:56.309> over<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> next<00:00:56.730> 20

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
for pilots is 216,000 over the next 20

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.779 
for pilots is 216,000 over the next 20
years<00:00:57.289> that<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.739> accounts<00:00:59.100> for<00:00:59.190> about<00:00:59.309> 40

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
years that that accounts for about 40

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.090 
years that that accounts for about 40
percent<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.390> global<00:01:00.750> shortage<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.649> pilots

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
percent of the global shortage in pilots

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.090 
percent of the global shortage in pilots
so<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> very<00:01:03.329> integral<00:01:03.960> part<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.439> the

so it's a very integral part to the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.280 
so it's a very integral part to the
