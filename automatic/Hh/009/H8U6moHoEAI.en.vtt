The Serve
Up down Saab

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.040
Who me know everyone
You would either have much

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.040
From us the general player
Players who are doing much

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.580
You will serve the less prone
Of this up-and-down Saab

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.260
Maximum feature up-and-down
It is written you so me

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.220
It is up on a rotating
Down will be under rotation

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.089
In so same pretend
On the rotation Saab and lower rotation Serve

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:37.829
Saab that can distinguish
You will be Tteyuu

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.039
It is of such great serve
And do But such thing Tteyuu

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:42.079
Today of its Saab
For way

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.600
Players you are using surprisingly now
Because it is less

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.179
Effect I think that is very high
Those steps this time

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:50.239
Although I have stepped on three
The manner in which it is possible to quite easily

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.949
Has introduced
First step is the first one

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.170
The first is first of fore-handed
Please doing Serve

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.249
This Saab this fore-handed
First is that this can be

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:03.079
Is the minimum conditions
Saab can fore-handed

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.980
And this is continuously about 10 balls
Once we can enter into common

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.250
Please go to step 2 now
In immediately now step 2

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.830
Now of the up-down Saab
People of this up

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.530
I think that it wanna do a little
Your earlier steps 1

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.030
Serve the fore-handed this is
This simple swing

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.810
In Saab hit the fore-handed
Finally the face of the racket

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.850
Please be rubbing up on
It is this kind of feeling

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.460
Please be rubbing up on
A little top spin

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.730
I put forward rotation
Tteyuu I feel

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.880
Rub on rubbing to top
I was rubbing up in this

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.560
To image specific rub is
Moment immediately construction that was above

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.100
It is I feel it 's up and down
The lower part of the upper and lower

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.770
Only pretend under rotation
It is a little feeling to add

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.960
Up and down up and down
Up and down up and down

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.880
The Fu Tteyuu
The'm a great up and down movement important

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.810
In up down up and down
This practice swing doing this

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.200
Amazing it is important
It is this kind of gesture

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.730
Above rotation under rotation on a rotating
Rotation on a rotating under rotation under

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.700
The issue is on at this time
Immediately below the in such Fu

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.700
How to put out this underlying
The Hayakere if enough to fast

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.160
Of the up-down Saab
And accuracy becomes higher

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.190
Or above or below the other party
Will be difficult to understand

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.060
Immediately the moment you put above
I put out the face of the lower

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.140
Put under the moment you put on the
Under the moment you put on the

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.450
By rubbing the top only
It is this kind of state

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.870
Koyaru and up down Saab
I will go well

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.870
By Tteyuu
Will be difficult to understand

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.370
Tsu far okay even momentarily
Little moment

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.270
Did you mean the under-ish be
Think also if Re Align me to the other party

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.770
This is another win
Serve over rotation immediately

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.760
Since the ball is fast
while the other party is lost

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.400
Come anymore ball
Pawn and in gently combined Toko

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.430
In feeling up was the do's over
You or me or skip

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.430
It is this kind of feeling
So much amount of rotation

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.340
Top spin tightly and
Even if you can not be subjected

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.160
Of the moment that was raised above
This immediately I put under

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.610
If this speed is faster
I takes effect to the other party

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.230
Be reminiscent of the lower rotation
Since it Deki doing this

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.310
The Hayakere if it is fine fast
A little under Poku

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.020
You also can look
But this last

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:00.020
Is an upper rotation
This is all on a rotating

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.020
Is that this speed
By rubbing at the time of the above when the above

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.989
I down immediately shook under
Of the up-down in the Tteyuu

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.069
You can memorize up
Firmly how to move up and down

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.940
Please be aware
The following are the steps 3

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.840
Now of the up-down Saab
The Are You a down

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.840
The Are You multiply the lower rotary
This is also up to the earlier of Step 2

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.100
When the application is put out alive
And by pretending that shook the above now

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.660
Raise the racket on Now
That it me put down quickly

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.380
Please do
The short racket

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.280
Keep in to the up-and-down movement
When you rub when on the top and bottom

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.270
Of the up-down Saab
On the up

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.310
When you rub when under
Of the up-down Saab

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:48.310
Will me out under rotation of the down
The first time you set up is Long Serve

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.440
Keep in poised feel like going
The fore beating of racket

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.090
issue the surface when you issue
If you issue doing this

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.449
Up is down easy to do
Of the up-down Saab

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.990
Upwards to reverse the direction of down
Because it is a camouflage

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.050
Faster up to last
Only moment to impact

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.919
And immediately cushion under
This so as to put the upper

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.699
This so as to put the upper
Tteyuu I feel

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.900
So it is difficult to understand in it
Up down Saab

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.550
I think that it can be made
Finally, I want to caution

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.160
Of this up-and-down Saab
Under rotation in the direction of down

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.290
Actually be turned off so much
Can is not

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.199
So strong under rotation
In it is honest hang

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:38.460
Is difficult
So pretend on this

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.790
the racket in the state
and fore-handed in the wake state

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.580
Long Serve Ya in the same state
A similar plane as up system

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.070
As it is under-ish feel
To feel like multiplying

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.380
So much rotation so will you
I am not applied strongly

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.180
But the top players of the world
When we look up down Saab

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.009
Under rotation so much
Even without it hanging

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:03.460
Just do not know whether above or below
Looks like pretty good for the lower

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.449
Even a little under rotation
And if it is possible to be thought that it is above

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.380
In thought that's on the up
Even doing this

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.750
When you were a little below
I think you fell

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.850
If you were face to go to press this
So up down Saab

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.280
As I am successful
So so much strong

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.830
Under rotation is the up-and-down Saab
Although I can not and will hang

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.949
With about a little bend the lower
I am enough effectiveness

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.650
So up and down
At the time that the extremes of Serve

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.430
Since it pretty effectiveness
Amount of rotation so much

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.280
And that the I mean Ii~tsu and not have to worry about
If I have your consciousness

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.340
In this up-and-down Saab
And wanna ask working

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.530
I think you
We also have a try

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:39.130
Please try it
