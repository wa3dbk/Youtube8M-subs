running<00:00:49.289> via<00:00:49.469> -<00:00:49.710> because<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.730> what<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.030> can

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
running via - because so what you can

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.360 
running via - because so what you can
see<00:00:51.420> here<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.170> standard<00:00:52.770> block<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.280> a

in-house as well one of the big things
here<00:01:27.439> is<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:29.159> height<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.360> width<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.840> this

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
here is the height and the width of this

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
engine a lot higher and a lot wider so

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.789 
engine a lot higher and a lot wider so
what<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.740> an<00:01:37.890> ideal<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.460> race<00:01:38.640> engine<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.299> a

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
what is an ideal and a race engine is a

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.100 
what is an ideal and a race engine is a
bent-over<00:01:40.799> manifold<00:01:41.670> which<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.030> not<00:01:42.930> what

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
bent-over manifold which is not what

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.929 
bent-over manifold which is not what
you'd<00:01:43.259> normally<00:01:43.380> run<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.920> v8<00:01:44.189> supercar<00:01:44.700> but

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
you'd normally run in a v8 supercar but

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
about halfway down the engine and it's

touching the top of the air box so to

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.649 
touching the top of the air box so to

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
get the optimum length of trumpet if it

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.240 
get the optimum length of trumpet if it
was<00:02:00.869> afraid<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.439> would<00:02:01.590> actually<00:02:01.740> protrude

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
was afraid it would actually protrude

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.219 
was afraid it would actually protrude
out<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.520> bonnet<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.299> not<00:02:03.540> ideal<00:02:03.840> from<00:02:04.079> a

out the bonnet so not ideal from a

out the bonnet so not ideal from a

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
design standpoint but unfortunately one

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.449 
design standpoint but unfortunately one

of those constraints that we have to

we<00:02:54.299> have<00:02:54.510> taken<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.829> the<00:02:56.459> whole<00:02:56.609> driving

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
we have taken the the whole driving

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.759 
we have taken the the whole driving

because<00:02:59.069> us<00:02:59.970> as<00:03:00.209> drivers<00:03:00.870> have<00:03:01.379> managed<00:03:02.220> to

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
because us as drivers have managed to

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.640 
because us as drivers have managed to
break<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:03.000> chain<00:03:03.239> a<00:03:03.269> few<00:03:03.569> times<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.500> we've

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
break the chain a few times so we've

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.819 
break the chain a few times so we've
actually<00:03:04.739> made<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.069> few<00:03:05.310> mods<00:03:06.049> since<00:03:07.049> earlier

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
actually made a few mods since earlier

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.770 
actually made a few mods since earlier
this<00:03:07.890> season<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.640> made<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.299> whole<00:03:09.450> drive

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
this season and made the whole drive

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.440 
this season and made the whole drive
system<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.560> lot<00:03:10.739> more<00:03:10.920> durable<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:11.430> as<00:03:11.879> of<00:03:12.420> now

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450

camshaft setup versus the manifold and
the<00:04:04.440> port<00:04:04.709> right<00:04:05.040> now<00:04:05.280> there's<00:04:05.519> still<00:04:05.579> quite<00:04:05.879> a

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
the port right now there's still quite a

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.699 
the port right now there's still quite a
bit<00:04:06.000> of<00:04:06.209> development<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.870> do<00:04:06.989> there<00:04:07.230> but

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
bit of development to do there but

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.860 
bit of development to do there but
hopefully<00:04:07.889> later<00:04:08.639> this<00:04:08.879> year<00:04:09.239> we<00:04:09.720> can

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
hopefully later this year we can

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.569 
hopefully later this year we can
actually<00:04:09.930> get<00:04:10.410> all<00:04:10.560> that<00:04:10.769> stuff<00:04:10.919> signed<00:04:11.310> off

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
actually get all that stuff signed off

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.150 
actually get all that stuff signed off
and<00:04:11.849> and<00:04:12.060> have<00:04:12.480> just<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.840> one<00:04:13.019> spec<00:04:13.440> across

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
and and have just the one spec across

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:25.540 
and and have just the one spec across
all<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.489> engines

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.659 

very<00:04:26.419> early<00:04:26.780> days<00:04:26.990> in<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:27.800> development<00:04:28.490> of

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
very early days in the development of

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.550 
very early days in the development of
this<00:04:28.819> engine<00:04:29.240> it<00:04:29.990> feels<00:04:30.229> like<00:04:30.410> we've<00:04:30.530> been

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
this engine it feels like we've been

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.890 
this engine it feels like we've been
racing<00:04:31.099> this<00:04:31.190> engine<00:04:31.550> for<00:04:31.789> four<00:04:32.449> years<00:04:32.720> now

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
racing this engine for four years now

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.110 
racing this engine for four years now
but<00:04:33.050> we've<00:04:33.199> only<00:04:33.289> done<00:04:33.590> four<00:04:34.250> or<00:04:34.280> so<00:04:34.550> around<00:04:34.819> so

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
but we've only done four or so around so

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.120 
but we've only done four or so around so
very<00:04:35.360> early<00:04:35.449> days<00:04:35.949> not<00:04:36.949> quite<00:04:37.220> where<00:04:37.550> we

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
very early days not quite where we

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.200 
very early days not quite where we
potentially<00:04:40.130> like<00:04:40.340> it<00:04:40.490> to<00:04:40.610> be<00:04:40.729> but<00:04:40.910> a<00:04:40.970> huge

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
potentially like it to be but a huge

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.510 
potentially like it to be but a huge
amount<00:04:41.360> of<00:04:42.080> potential<00:04:42.530> left<00:04:42.889> in<00:04:43.069> the<00:04:43.160> engine

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
amount of potential left in the engine

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.089 
amount of potential left in the engine
that<00:04:43.699> we<00:04:43.819> need<00:04:44.000> to<00:04:44.380> knuckle<00:04:45.380> down<00:04:45.500> and<00:04:45.919> and

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 
that we need to knuckle down and and

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:48.010 
that we need to knuckle down and and
spend<00:04:46.550> more<00:04:46.759> time<00:04:46.819> with<00:04:47.030> R&amp;D<00:04:47.569> and<00:04:47.960> the

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
spend more time with R&amp;D and the

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.320 
spend more time with R&amp;D and the
development<00:04:48.889> especially<00:04:49.400> of<00:04:49.819> the<00:04:49.940> cylinder

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
head and the manifold what you see here

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.089 
head and the manifold what you see here
is<00:04:52.430> basically<00:04:52.610> our<00:04:53.599> very<00:04:53.930> first<00:04:54.259> attempt<00:04:54.800> at

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
is basically our very first attempt at

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.180 
is basically our very first attempt at
the<00:04:55.250> engine<00:04:56.050> so<00:04:57.050> we're<00:04:57.229> very<00:04:57.259> very<00:04:57.650> confident

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
the engine so we're very very confident

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.189 
the engine so we're very very confident
that<00:04:58.310> later<00:04:58.610> in<00:04:58.789> the<00:04:58.880> year<00:04:59.150> once<00:04:59.630> we<00:04:59.780> finesse

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
that later in the year once we finesse

we've designed the cars and the engines

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:17.800 
we've designed the cars and the engines
