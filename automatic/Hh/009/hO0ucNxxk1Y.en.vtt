Bray<00:02:33.710> even<00:02:33.740> still<00:02:34.370> is<00:02:34.640> so<00:02:34.850> many<00:02:35.060> I<00:02:35.300> think<00:02:36.170> the

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
Bray even still is so many I think the

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.430 
Bray even still is so many I think the
dynamic<00:02:37.130> come<00:02:37.340> Dallas<00:02:37.760> will<00:02:38.540> be<00:02:38.690> completely

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
dynamic come Dallas will be completely

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.890 
dynamic come Dallas will be completely
different<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.300> maybe<00:02:41.300> it's<00:02:41.540> me<00:02:41.690> kind<00:02:41.870> of

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
different and maybe it's me kind of

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.150 
different and maybe it's me kind of
looking<00:02:42.140> at<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.290> crystal<00:02:42.590> ball<00:02:42.709> in<00:02:43.040> the

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
looking at the crystal ball in the

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.600 
looking at the crystal ball in the
future

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
future

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.730 
future
but<00:02:44.390> I<00:02:44.420> think<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.750> traditional<00:02:45.230> dream<00:02:45.530> match

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
but I think the traditional dream match

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.440 
but I think the traditional dream match
is<00:02:45.980> going<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.280> skew<00:02:46.520> a<00:02:46.550> little<00:02:46.670> bit<00:02:46.970> I<00:02:47.150> think

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
is going to skew a little bit I think

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.600 
is going to skew a little bit I think
it's<00:02:47.630> going<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:47.990> involve<00:02:48.290> an<00:02:49.070> up-and-coming

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
it's going to involve an up-and-coming

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.760 
it's going to involve an up-and-coming
superstar<00:02:50.240> that<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.480> W<00:02:50.780> universe<00:02:51.200> embraces

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
superstar that the W universe embraces

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.130 
superstar that the W universe embraces
versus<00:02:52.670> maybe<00:02:52.910> an<00:02:53.090> unlucky<00:02:53.330> guy<00:02:53.600> in<00:02:53.660> a<00:02:53.870> black

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
versus maybe an unlucky guy in a black

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.699 
versus maybe an unlucky guy in a black
