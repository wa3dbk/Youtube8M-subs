00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hi how do 12 come out in this video that does not 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.649
 I have a quick notice that apple has 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.360
 started selling suddenly without warning 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.540
 and without anything there are still fifth photos 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.590
 generation of 16GB 729 dollars and good 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.250
 as you can see here on the page 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:24.500
 business apple we go to ipod 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.900
 and we go to ipod touch by now 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.830
 in case we want to buy and power pages 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.500
 of the page only for those who live in the USA 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.330
 that does not center the page is not and good 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.830
 as we can here we have 32 and 64 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.040
 gigabytes but now we have a new 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.660
 option that is 16 gigabytes since we 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.720
 we're good as if they did not know before 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.239
 apple was selling about 32 64 and now I 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.660
 it also says gigabytes a weight 229 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.680
 Dollars 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.590
 before it was 32 gigs for 300 dollars and 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:59.059
 now they are two good at 229 and now they are 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:02.360
 229 16 gb 1 my opinion is that if it is that 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.570
 It is preferable to buy the 32 gigas 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.220
 since only for 70 dollars can 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:12.690
 decide to see if you double the capacity 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:14.460
 of what is said came to say 32 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.050
 it's very little difference but good 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.990
 for those who want an ipod touch the 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.430
 newer with a good camera and that 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.910
 did a little place do not have much 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.160
 a good budget to buy a 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.290
 ipod can be a good option I do not know 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:33.030
 commented on two colors how were the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.940
 ipod riding 384 let's go with this 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.040
 color as you see if we leave with that the 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.540
 processor and all that same thing we're going to 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.510
 Gallery 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.720
 as the only photo that is not of that 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.450
 color silver and black a color that 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.720
 they sell and the spots connect it another 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.720
 same 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.600
 and up here good, this seems to me 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.110
 it's something new that the top part of 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.940
 side of the button here brings us the 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.230
 microphone I think they are new color already 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.480
 you have already added other errors 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.610
 but I do not think we're not sure 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.700
 but equally good is kareem and this will 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.890
 wanted in the video so they can 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.110
 enter and see a little more about this 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.020
 new novelty in apple and good so that 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.970
 see that apple is a very company we give 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.070
 the surprises of the chaste and 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.630
 potosÃ­ gigabytes 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.830
 Well, the answer that many 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.440
 surprises more 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.540
 but friends I hope you like it too 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.160
 let very light be scared comment what 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.870
 commented with I want you to have children that 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.480
 was going to be next video channel left but 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.370

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.820
