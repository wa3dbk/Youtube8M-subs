00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
to keep the truck basically like what it

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.810 
to keep the truck basically like what it
came<00:01:09.750> from<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.049> factory<00:01:10.409> not<00:01:11.100> allowed<00:01:11.369> many

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
came from the factory not allowed many

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.020 
came from the factory not allowed many
modifications<00:01:12.689> obviously<00:01:13.290> we've<00:01:13.560> got<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:14.030> roll

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
modifications obviously we've got a roll

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.149 
modifications obviously we've got a roll
cage<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.810> safety<00:01:16.439> equipment<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.009> main

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
cage in it safety equipment is the main

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.090 
cage in it safety equipment is the main
thing<00:01:17.540> but<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.659> suspension<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.409> pretty<00:01:19.920> much

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
thing but the suspension is pretty much

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.280 
thing but the suspension is pretty much
stock<00:01:20.430> it's<00:01:21.270> been<00:01:21.450> lowered<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.930> little<00:01:21.960> bit

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
stock it's been lowered a little bit

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.840 
stock it's been lowered a little bit
we're<00:01:22.500> allowed<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.740> do<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.189> but<00:01:23.430> no<00:01:23.610> body

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
we're allowed to do that but no body

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.570 
we're allowed to do that but no body
panel<00:01:24.270> changes<00:01:24.780> nothing<00:01:25.590> for<00:01:25.740> aerodynamics

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
panel changes nothing for aerodynamics

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.609 
panel changes nothing for aerodynamics
we<00:01:27.030> put<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> bed<00:01:27.420> cover<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:27.960> but<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.439> actually

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
we put a bed cover on it but it actually

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.880 
we put a bed cover on it but it actually
found<00:01:29.130> through<00:01:30.000> testing<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:31.650> runs

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
found through testing that it runs

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.319 
found through testing that it runs
faster<00:01:32.460> with<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> front<00:01:32.880> part<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> bed

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
faster with the front part of the bed

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.649 
faster with the front part of the bed
cover<00:01:33.570> off<00:01:33.840> because<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.860> gives<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> little

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
cover off because it gives you a little

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.249 
cover off because it gives you a little
turbulence<00:01:36.659> back<00:01:36.840> there<00:01:37.079> that's

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
turbulence back there that's

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.929 
turbulence back there that's
advantageous<00:01:38.390> the<00:01:39.390> D<00:01:39.570> part<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:41.490> size<00:01:41.729> of

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
advantageous the D part is the size of

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.460 
advantageous the D part is the size of
the<00:01:42.060> engine<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:43.229> means<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:43.740> can<00:01:43.890> run<00:01:44.100> from

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
the engine that means we can run from

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.600 
the engine that means we can run from
261<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:47.040> 305<00:01:47.909> cubic<00:01:48.450> inches<00:01:49.130> this<00:01:50.130> one<00:01:50.310> here<00:01:50.520> is
