00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.840
 Blatter weakened 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.490
 seven goals 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.530
 Resin to celebrate the team 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.530
 Job starts playing the song around her 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.230
 Exactly I just play the page from top to bottom bands reversal 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.230
 you the Trave are still right and what they can do 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:22.569
 Steam laws replacement concept that one is the depth side 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.760
 this should 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.210
 this shared 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.330
 the page 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.060
 Pippas page 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.910
 and the EU is holding 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.860
 OK 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.280
 index finger 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.280
 in the first and on this page 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.810
 According to the site, galls feel 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.510
 on 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.770
 like the handball 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.410
 steamed on the sides 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.410
 the pages completely off 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.350
 so that too cold or child 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.960
 take care of the rector 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.330
 let's go with the heel of the hand he hopes 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.970
 that made Soldo heard 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.070
 Kunz suffer 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.570
 with the little finger 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.570
 in the fifth and 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:16.869
 what is very important to her is that the remaining pages were muffled 10 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:20.149
 with the palm of your hand 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:24.299
 The bottom should be so terrible that the underdogs should 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.909
 can stand 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.909
 first 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.409
 since the 5 and then comes but is open 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.390
 around with the 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.470
 middle finger 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.039
 on the sixth and 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:46.039
 on GGS page will be percent on the a2 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:50.199
 Cameron we just hit it 

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:53.759
 it takes without triumph 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:02.259
 Let's go with the right hand 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:05.259
 but dampen in a timely manner 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:08.649
 except for the fast entry list 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:10.969
 and make a hammam and on the 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:13.969
 on her side in the 13th and with the middle finger 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.479
 navigate it 

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:24.479
 meantime 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.079
 the Lauterer mills 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:54.259
 we draw 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:57.259
 and in the past 13 percent 

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:03.289
 Sound is heard 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.969
 then right after a product again 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:11.969
 with the digital sector 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.450
 serious changes on it 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.450
 and 36 

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:28.070
 others call him down 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.979
 Let's go to the idea 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.400
 colorful against five 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.400
 and 2 - 7th 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.389
 but again from 4 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.389
 around him 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:54.809
 So huge 8 

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:02.669
 a 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.169
 Manila 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.169
 lives once a week in Munich 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:12.089
 Harry is in the 5th 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:14.089
 to become both Finns 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:17.050
 when games are still going 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.050
 so be 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:25.029
 two times it sounds with innovations brand 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:44.789
 the norms are 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:47.789
 the Bund 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.870
 lots 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:00.919
 besides, there was only one victory 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:01.990
 but in the 2nd 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.990
 with the right hand takes and fame 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:16.439
 Although then comes the hardest part of 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.870
 We are sorted around with the ring finger at 12 o'clock and now we go with the 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.909
 index finger 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:25.879
 proposed
