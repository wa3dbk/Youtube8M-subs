00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.459
 Why else hair back? 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.880
 That's why I'm going to have to be well. 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.880
 done 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.239
 the back can be a little annoying 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.250
 to make her leave I know but the 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.900
 people have to be persistent to stay 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.030
 with beautiful hair so we will not have 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.569
 laziness we will vote this arm there for 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.569
 work out in 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.720

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.270
 know the dryer that the use of taiff brand 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.290
 His model is 6 thousand is not the most 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.290
 strong but it's very cool 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.420
 good 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.980
 to thigh leaves about a 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.050
 format that I want to depend only on 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.810
 people tidying seats or glue with 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.390
 Do you think better health advises you to use 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.040
 gel because if you use gel with 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.170
 brushed hair his tendency is 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.510
 back it will come back to the natural way 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.250
 because it is very wet and everything else then 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.290
 The best thing to always choose is a 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.620
 product to be able to use for 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.680

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.200
 so lets start by applying a 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.420
 little glue on hand 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.270

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:35.270
