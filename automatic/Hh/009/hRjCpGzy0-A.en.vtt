developed<00:01:57.640> that<00:01:57.820> well<00:01:58.060> he<00:01:58.720> has<00:01:58.840> this

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
developed that well he has this

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.510 
developed that well he has this
estrangement<00:01:59.530> from<00:01:59.680> his<00:01:59.830> father<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.430> they're

guess you could argue that he learns
that<00:02:07.390> his<00:02:07.540> father<00:02:07.750> really<00:02:08.110> loves<00:02:08.379> him<00:02:08.709> but

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979

character development department but at

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.350 
character development department but at

well<00:02:37.630> despite<00:02:38.470> assurances<00:02:38.650> that<00:02:39.130> this<00:02:39.430> movie

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
well despite assurances that this movie

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.820
