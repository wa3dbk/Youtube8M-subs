okay so I'm just going to run you
through<00:00:07.319> now<00:00:07.680> some<00:00:07.950> of<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.130> accessories<00:00:08.519> that

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
through now some of the accessories that

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.259 
through now some of the accessories that
you<00:00:09.090> would<00:00:09.240> use<00:00:09.540> for<00:00:10.160> trimming<00:00:11.160> door<00:00:11.670> stops<00:00:12.000> or

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
you would use for trimming door stops or

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.970 
you would use for trimming door stops or
skirting<00:00:12.929> board<00:00:13.170> when<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.679> were<00:00:13.769> laying

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
skirting board when you were laying

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.140 
skirting board when you were laying
either<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.490> tiled<00:00:14.969> floor<00:00:15.179> or<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.690> laminate<00:00:16.650> floor

either a tiled floor or a laminate floor

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.510 
either a tiled floor or a laminate floor
there's<00:00:18.150> three<00:00:18.539> accessories<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:20.369> would

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
there's three accessories that you would

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.710 
there's three accessories that you would
ideally<00:00:21.390> use<00:00:21.920> three<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.100> e<00:00:23.130> cup<00:00:23.430> blades

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
ideally use three of the e cup blades

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.279 
ideally use three of the e cup blades
either<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.550> universal<00:00:26.550> blade<00:00:26.760> for<00:00:27.510> wood<00:00:28.109> and

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
either the universal blade for wood and

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.370 
either the universal blade for wood and
metal<00:00:29.990> this<00:00:30.990> blade<00:00:31.320> has<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:33.079> bi-metal<00:00:34.079> blade

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
metal this blade has a bi-metal blade

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.220 
metal this blade has a bi-metal blade
has<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> hardened<00:00:35.250> cutting<00:00:35.640> edge<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.540> but

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
has a hardened cutting edge on it but

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.260 
has a hardened cutting edge on it but
because<00:00:37.440> it's<00:00:37.590> designed<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.340> cut<00:00:38.790> metal<00:00:39.030> as

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
because it's designed to cut metal as

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.930 
because it's designed to cut metal as
well<00:00:39.300> as<00:00:39.570> timber<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.530> has<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> wave<00:00:41.010> form<00:00:41.670> on<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
well as timber it has a wave form on the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.490 
well as timber it has a wave form on the
front<00:00:42.180> edge<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.809> will<00:00:43.079> find<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.379> it

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
front edge so you will find that it

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.700 
front edge so you will find that it
gives<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> slightly<00:00:44.129> coarser<00:00:44.700> cut<00:00:45.710> there's

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
gives you a slightly coarser cut there's

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.569 
gives you a slightly coarser cut there's
the<00:00:47.480> new<00:00:48.480> long<00:00:48.960> life<00:00:49.200> timber<00:00:49.739> blades<00:00:49.950> again

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
the new long life timber blades again

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.010 
the new long life timber blades again
they're<00:00:50.789> made<00:00:50.910> from<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.180> same<00:00:51.390> material<00:00:51.989> as

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
they're made from the same material as

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.740 
they're made from the same material as
the<00:00:52.309> universal<00:00:53.309> blade<00:00:53.489> but<00:00:54.420> because<00:00:54.660> they

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
the universal blade but because they

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.420 
the universal blade but because they
have<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.960> geometry<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.949> wood<00:00:56.129> cutting

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
have the geometry of a wood cutting

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.189 
have the geometry of a wood cutting
blade<00:00:56.640> they'll<00:00:56.879> give<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.210> much<00:00:57.420> finer<00:00:57.870> cut

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
blade they'll give you a much finer cut

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.549 
blade they'll give you a much finer cut
and<00:00:59.329> last<00:01:00.329> one<00:01:00.539> name<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.780> least<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.230> wider

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
and last one name is least the wider

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.399 
and last one name is least the wider
version<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.489> long<00:01:02.640> life<00:01:02.850> blade<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.409> these

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
version of the long life blade of these

version of the long life blade of these
three<00:01:04.830> blades<00:01:05.900> personally<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:07.110> prefer<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
three blades personally I prefer the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.219 
three blades personally I prefer the
narrow<00:01:09.240> long<00:01:09.960> life<00:01:10.170> blade<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:11.990> just<00:01:12.990> show<00:01:13.200> you

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
narrow long life blade I just show you

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.420 
narrow long life blade I just show you
as<00:01:13.920> quickly<00:01:14.340> if<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.460> popped<00:01:14.670> onto<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.030> machine

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.060 

it<00:01:20.430> will<00:01:20.549> give<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.119> finest<00:01:21.840> cut<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
it will give you the finest cut of the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.510 
it will give you the finest cut of the
two<00:01:23.580> different<00:01:24.180> blades<00:01:24.470> and<00:01:25.470> because<00:01:26.130> it's

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
two different blades and because it's

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.969 
two different blades and because it's
not<00:01:26.820> as<00:01:26.939> wide<00:01:27.270> as<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:28.020> wide<00:01:28.290> long<00:01:28.500> life<00:01:28.680> blade

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
not as wide as a wide long life blade

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.030 
not as wide as a wide long life blade
you<00:01:29.640> don't<00:01:29.880> run<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> risk<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.780> going<00:01:31.320> too<00:01:31.680> far

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
you don't run the risk of going too far

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.120 
you don't run the risk of going too far
through<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:32.970> skirting<00:01:33.810> board<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.470> ended<00:01:35.040> up

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
through the skirting board and ended up

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.090 
through the skirting board and ended up
contacting<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.150> wall<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.590> just<00:01:37.590> tend<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.860> find

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
contacting the wall I just tend to find

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.420 
contacting the wall I just tend to find
that<00:01:38.250> with<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.549> wider<00:01:38.759> ones<00:01:39.090> as<00:01:39.890> you<00:01:40.890> come<00:01:41.189> in

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
that with the wider ones as you come in

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.090 
that with the wider ones as you come in
there's<00:01:41.970> obviously<00:01:42.750> more<00:01:43.110> blade<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.829> there's

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
there's obviously more blade so there's

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.530 
there's obviously more blade so there's
more<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.460> tendency<00:01:44.880> for

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
more of a tendency for

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.780 
more of a tendency for
the<00:01:45.960> cut<00:01:46.590> or<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.040> side<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.490> blade<00:01:47.610> that's

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
the cut or the side of the blade that's

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.539 
the cut or the side of the blade that's
cut<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.810> disappear<00:01:49.320> off<00:01:49.500> into<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.189> plastic

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
cut in to disappear off into the plastic

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.370 
cut in to disappear off into the plastic
work<00:01:50.729> into<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.329> brickwork<00:01:51.659> etc<00:01:52.200> and

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
work into the brickwork etc and

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.929 
work into the brickwork etc and
obviously<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.710> just<00:01:52.890> shortened<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
obviously you just shortened the the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.660 
obviously you just shortened the the
life<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.240> your<00:01:54.329> blade<00:01:54.619> new<00:01:55.619> long<00:01:56.130> life<00:01:56.310> blades

life of your blade new long life blades

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.090 
life of your blade new long life blades

got<00:02:13.710> seven<00:02:13.950> people<00:02:14.220> tend<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.460> use<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.730> as<00:02:14.850> a

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
got seven people tend to use it as a

got seven people tend to use it as a
plunge<00:02:15.510> cutter<00:02:16.310> you'll<00:02:17.310> be<00:02:17.490> there<00:02:17.700> for<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.880> very

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
plunge cutter you'll be there for a very

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.630 
plunge cutter you'll be there for a very
long<00:02:18.180> time<00:02:18.360> if<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.200> continually<00:02:19.980> come<00:02:20.280> in<00:02:20.460> a

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
long time if you continually come in a

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.150 
long time if you continually come in a
straight<00:02:21.300> angle<00:02:21.660> trying<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.470> cut<00:02:22.650> into<00:02:22.980> the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
straight angle trying to cut into the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.490 
straight angle trying to cut into the
into<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.820> wood<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.150> tend<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.870> find<00:02:25.140> works

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
into the wood I tend to find works

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.260 
into the wood I tend to find works
better<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:26.190> if<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.300> come<00:02:27.930> in<00:02:28.020> at<00:02:28.140> an<00:02:28.200> angle<00:02:29.270> get

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
better is if you come in at an angle get

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.140 
better is if you come in at an angle get
the<00:02:30.360> blade<00:02:30.600> in<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.650> then<00:02:32.640> just<00:02:32.970> continue

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
the blade in and then just continue

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.270 
the blade in and then just continue
along<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.230> length<00:02:34.350> of<00:02:34.590> your<00:02:34.680> cut<00:02:34.950> with<00:02:35.160> the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
along the length of your cut with the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.700 
along the length of your cut with the
machine<00:02:35.580> at<00:02:35.700> an<00:02:35.790> angle<00:02:36.180> what<00:02:36.990> this<00:02:37.110> also<00:02:37.470> tends

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
machine at an angle what this also tends

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.170 
machine at an angle what this also tends
to<00:02:37.800> do<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.100> clears<00:02:38.400> any<00:02:38.580> debris<00:02:38.790> that's<00:02:39.030> in

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
to do is it clears any debris that's in

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.430 
to do is it clears any debris that's in
front<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.510> blade<00:02:39.720> out<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.230> way<00:02:40.260> and

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
front of the blade out of the way and

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.690 
front of the blade out of the way and
obviously<00:02:40.710> reduces<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.190> amount<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.520> heat

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
obviously reduces the amount of heat

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.130 
obviously reduces the amount of heat
that<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.120> created<00:02:42.420> on<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.720> front<00:02:42.900> edge<00:02:43.050> of

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
that you created on the front edge of

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.060 
that you created on the front edge of
the<00:02:43.200> blade<00:02:43.440> another<00:02:44.400> good<00:02:44.970> tip<00:02:45.180> for<00:02:46.070> extending

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
the blade another good tip for extending

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.710 
the blade another good tip for extending
the<00:02:47.130> life<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.400> your<00:02:47.550> blades<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:48.150> as<00:02:48.390> you're

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
the life of your blades is as you're

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.830 
the life of your blades is as you're
cutting<00:02:49.370> just<00:02:50.370> try<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:50.790> keep<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.420> slight

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
cutting just try and keep a slight

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.199 
cutting just try and keep a slight
rocking<00:02:52.320> movement<00:02:52.709> on<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.040> machine<00:02:53.340> again<00:02:54.090> it

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
rocking movement on the machine again it

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.250 
rocking movement on the machine again it
just<00:02:54.240> helps<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.600> clear<00:02:54.840> out<00:02:54.930> any<00:02:55.020> debris

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
just helps to clear out any debris

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.110 
just helps to clear out any debris
that's<00:02:55.590> out<00:02:55.770> in<00:02:55.890> front<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.340> blade<00:02:56.910> will

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
that's out in front of the blade will

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.430 
that's out in front of the blade will
reduce<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.510> heat<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.840> extend<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.200> life<00:02:58.290> of

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
reduce it heat and extend the life of

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.740 
reduce it heat and extend the life of
your<00:02:58.560> blade
