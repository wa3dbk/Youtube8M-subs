higher if you already know how to play

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.020 
higher if you already know how to play

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
you plug it with your thumb see that you

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.820 
you plug it with your thumb see that you
catch<00:01:48.660> it<00:01:49.190> okay<00:01:50.190> so<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.400> got<00:01:50.520> like<00:01:51.510> so<00:01:51.750> then<00:01:52.740> you

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
catch it okay so I got like so then you

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.480 
catch it okay so I got like so then you
move<00:01:52.980> to<00:01:53.160> the<00:01:53.250> next<00:01:53.280> string<00:01:53.760> there<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.900> go<00:01:55.490> in

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
move to the next string there you go in

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.340 
move to the next string there you go in
the<00:01:56.640> third<00:01:56.850> string<00:01:57.120> and<00:01:57.570> then<00:01:57.660> take<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.170> fifth

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
the third string and then take the fifth

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.890 
the third string and then take the fifth
string<00:01:58.530> harmonic<00:01:59.450> second<00:02:00.450> string<00:02:00.630> fourth

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
string harmonic second string fourth

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.320 
string harmonic second string fourth
string<00:02:01.080> first<00:02:01.560> string<00:02:01.830> third<00:02:02.160> string<00:02:02.330> okay

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
string first string third string okay

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.400 
string first string third string okay
now<00:02:03.450> when<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.660> get<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.870> the<00:02:03.960> third<00:02:04.140> string<00:02:04.320> you

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
now when you get to the third string you

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.020 
now when you get to the third string you
have<00:02:04.470> to<00:02:04.620> move<00:02:04.740> your<00:02:04.800> finger<00:02:05.190> over<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.520> friend<00:02:05.820> I

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
have to move your finger over a friend I

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.050 
have to move your finger over a friend I
forgot<00:02:06.780> here<00:02:07.230> we<00:02:07.350> go

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.140 

Oh<00:02:10.200> doesn't<00:02:11.200> that<00:02:11.380> sound<00:02:11.890> just<00:02:12.459> Purdy<00:02:12.910> and

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
Oh doesn't that sound just Purdy and

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.620 
Oh doesn't that sound just Purdy and
fine<00:02:13.360> okay<00:02:13.840> so

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.790 

you<00:02:17.170> can<00:02:17.290> do<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:17.410> both<00:02:17.560> ways

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.250 

and<00:02:19.980> Tommy<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.060> annually<00:02:21.360> uses<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.750> thumb<00:02:22.050> pick

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
and Tommy and annually uses a thumb pick

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.110 
and Tommy and annually uses a thumb pick
you<00:02:22.770> know<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:22.980> can<00:02:23.100> get<00:02:23.250> really<00:02:23.520> much

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
you know you can get really much

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.890 
you know you can get really much
stronger<00:02:25.820> pull<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:26.970> thumb<00:02:27.390> no<00:02:27.540> but<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:27.750> got

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
stronger pull of that thumb no but I got

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.150 
stronger pull of that thumb no but I got
a<00:02:27.930> nail<00:02:28.170> there<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.440> I've<00:02:28.500> got<00:02:28.530> twist<00:02:29.010> my

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
a nail there and I've got twist my

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.970 
a nail there and I've got twist my
thumbnail<00:02:29.580> in<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.790> little<00:02:30.060> bit<00:02:30.180> so

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.800 

anyway<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.190> neat<00:02:35.850> little<00:02:35.970> trick<00:02:36.240> that<00:02:36.450> he<00:02:36.600> does

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
anyway a neat little trick that he does

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.350 
anyway a neat little trick that he does
is<00:02:37.350> he<00:02:37.530> uses<00:02:37.710> not<00:02:38.310> only<00:02:38.340> these<00:02:38.730> combinations

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
is he uses not only these combinations

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.440 
is he uses not only these combinations
but<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.630> pull<00:02:40.170> off<00:02:40.380> pull<00:02:41.220> offs<00:02:41.460> can<00:02:41.670> be<00:02:41.760> fun<00:02:42.030> and

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
but a pull off pull offs can be fun and

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.740 
but a pull off pull offs can be fun and
it'll<00:02:43.050> add<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.430> color<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.240> swivel

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
it'll add to the color of the swivel

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.920 
it'll add to the color of the swivel
idea<00:02:46.050> let's<00:02:46.740> just<00:02:46.950> say<00:02:47.040> we<00:02:47.160> start<00:02:47.430> up<00:02:47.550> here

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
idea let's just say we start up here

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.500 
idea let's just say we start up here
I'll<00:02:48.930> hit<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:49.380> harmonic<00:02:49.950> first<00:02:50.220> when<00:02:51.210> I<00:02:51.300> pull

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
I'll hit this harmonic first when I pull

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.120 
I'll hit this harmonic first when I pull
off<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.780> note<00:02:51.930> with<00:02:52.170> my<00:02:52.290> finger<00:02:52.590> well<00:02:52.830> now<00:02:53.070> I'm

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
off the note with my finger well now I'm

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.530 
off the note with my finger well now I'm
not<00:02:53.160> pulling<00:02:53.520> off<00:02:53.640> I'm<00:02:53.790> plucking<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.330> first

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
not pulling off I'm plucking the first

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.000 
not pulling off I'm plucking the first
string<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:55.230> I'm<00:02:55.290> hit<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.530> third<00:02:55.740> string

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
string so I'm hit the third string

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.460 
string so I'm hit the third string
harmonic<00:02:56.460> there<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:57.930> hear<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.170> triplet

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
harmonic there and you hear that triplet

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.160 
harmonic there and you hear that triplet
sound<00:02:59.030> triple<00:03:00.030> at<00:03:00.210> triple-a<00:03:00.780> okay<00:03:01.080> so

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.990 

then<00:03:03.770> I<00:03:03.830> do<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.099> same<00:03:04.340> thing<00:03:04.400> here<00:03:04.819> on<00:03:04.910> the

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
then I do the same thing here on the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.559 
then I do the same thing here on the
fourth<00:03:05.209> string<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:05.660> second<00:03:06.170> Street

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
fourth string and second Street

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.510 
fourth string and second Street
see<00:03:08.170> it<00:03:08.319> triple<00:03:08.950> a<00:03:09.219> triple

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.550 

you<00:03:14.300> could<00:03:14.420> really<00:03:14.540> get<00:03:14.690> blazing-fast<00:03:15.170> to

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
you could really get blazing-fast to

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:25.630 
you could really get blazing-fast to
that<00:03:15.680> in<00:03:15.770> this<00:03:15.860> town<00:03:16.040> school

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.790 

now<00:03:26.180> it's<00:03:26.390> important<00:03:26.870> if<00:03:27.410> you're<00:03:27.620> playing

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
now it's important if you're playing

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.130 
now it's important if you're playing
harmonics<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:29.060> have<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.240> play<00:03:29.420> 12<00:03:29.900> frets

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
harmonics you have to play 12 frets

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.480 
harmonics you have to play 12 frets
higher<00:03:30.380> than<00:03:30.830> whatever<00:03:31.010> chord<00:03:31.340> you're

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
higher than whatever chord you're

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.570 
higher than whatever chord you're
playing<00:03:31.520> just<00:03:32.420> like<00:03:32.600> the<00:03:33.500> open<00:03:33.860> notes

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.880 

that's<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.210> great<00:03:37.390> way<00:03:37.540> to<00:03:37.570> practice<00:03:37.810> that<00:03:38.140> it's

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
that's a great way to practice that it's

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.230 
that's a great way to practice that it's
doing<00:03:39.160> it<00:03:39.250> with<00:03:39.370> open<00:03:39.640> notes<00:03:39.790> without<00:03:39.970> being

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
doing it with open notes without being

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.280 
doing it with open notes without being
in<00:03:40.300> a<00:03:40.360> court<00:03:40.540> because<00:03:40.750> you<00:03:40.840> can<00:03:40.960> get<00:03:41.110> really

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
in a court because you can get really

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.440 
in a court because you can get really
stressed<00:03:41.680> out<00:03:41.890> holding<00:03:42.640> a<00:03:42.730> bar<00:03:42.910> court<00:03:43.210> for<00:03:43.420> a

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
stressed out holding a bar court for a

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.190 
stressed out holding a bar court for a
long<00:03:43.630> time
