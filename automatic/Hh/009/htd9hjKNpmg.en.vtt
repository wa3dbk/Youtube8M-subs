00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
 hi to all guys and welcome back 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:08.550
 right away and on Serbian because you're sad 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.160
 I don't even know these games give you 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.530
 sadness because there is no mention of death and 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.210
 destruction I am I can shoot at 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.880
 no one there is no blood there are not 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.949
 guts also lacks the exact duodenum 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.050
 however it is a type of game that does not 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.910
 we have never dealt with above then 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.710
 so it's a good and right thing 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.779
 yes because when we treat Thursday 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.539
 Usually we treat not require a game 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.850
 a football sports game then usually 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.880
 why a shit we have to talk about that 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.320
 rightly it makes me play throat or 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.520
 comes out so much from the schemes that 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:46.260
 we start to like it right and this mtb 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.539
 freeride 2 with the binding freerice 2 o 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.340
 mountain bike from now on 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.739
 we will call mtb to prevent the 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.000
 tongue becomes a round bike braid 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.520
 it is a bicycle bicycles game 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.530
 sap guys how many bicycle games 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.149
 well done there are few I tell you 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.000
 I tried some on consoles too 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.040
 shit is really ugly 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.170
 however this mtb has one 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.299
 particularity we could say that has 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.680
 created a new way to see the game 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.020
 of racing because it is a fps first person 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.869
 laughs 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.270
 exact and is one of those titles that it is 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.670
 been designed and structured e 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.460
 probably from the maximum indeed 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.680
 definitely gives the best with a 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.329
 adequate optical support so let's talk 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.610
 of opus rit 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.729
 in this case yes and this leads us to 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.409
 two conclusions 1 we must say goodbye to 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.930
 a certain amount of money because I want to 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.750
 play it pollock mills this game and 2 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.820
 it is a particularly immersive game 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.700
 also played on the normal PC screen 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.110
 will make you feel like you are really into 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.570
 riding a bike 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.670
 and it will almost make you feel the pain is 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.620
 stabbing of the stunts you will make 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.780
 surely but not only is it also 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.250
 fun because it will make you review the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.080
 stuntman you did 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.500
 and since we are still in the phase 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.560
 let's say beta of this game the bugs don't 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.990
 will miss and the bugs of this one of this 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.570
 type of games especially when 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.360
 you go to penetrate the trees the sounds 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.850
 and to make indecent flights because you have 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.790
 slammed against peter and these reasons 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.730
 between cosenza is really fun to da 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.030
 viewing the game graphically is not one 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.010
 shit is not a light shit 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.730
 we are talking about a game that runs on 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.380
 unity motor StrÃ  abused but motor 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.340
 which has also given many beautiful 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.920
 satisfactions 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.630
 on games of different nature is the first 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.640
 time we see unity used in a 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.680
 game of this type but we have to say 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.020
 that the lighting even if poor even 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.270
 sparta makes her pig work the herbs 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.190
 the models are made quite well 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.590
 made all the textures fine 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.570
 added together they work apart from those of the 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.810
 your feet that bench races you have the 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.760
 8-bit shoes but for the rest, guys 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.250
 graphically a great overall impact 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.730
 it is above all the structure of the bike 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.190
 we must say that it is really phenomenal 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.380
 they put everything in the models 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.250
 of the bicycles but also for 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.390
 make you have fun walking the slopes 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.090
 impossible in the sense that they are during 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.730
 impossible I don't think there are people like that 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.260
 sick to do it in reality pareo gioco 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.840
 obviously in a game you can do 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.640
 hallucinating things even though I think that with 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.209
 Seismic loculi that ray under even alone 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.209
 to play 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.380
 yes because there are descents 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.209
 impossible, that is, what you face 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.830
 so and you say no I go back and col 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.549
 fuck that I do it rather change 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.110
 track 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.570
 and about tracks there are 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.730
 several and all have names of women or 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.680
 names in general is ok anyway 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.420
 every track is very very fun yes 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.340
 starts from almost standard tracks 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.040
 that we could do even in real life 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.930
 he has seen so absurd that maybe 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.150
 would be illegal in some countries or 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.940
 perhaps in all countries a very thing 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.860
 interesting of this game is the fact 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.220
 that despite being like that 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.650
 immersive want to enter the world of 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.989
 stunt bike 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.810
 in short, these things would make you think 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.030
 to a very simulative approach instead 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.970
 no it is a monstrous game 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.010
 arcade with very few commands where a 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.930
 it is your spirit to lord it 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.570
 of initiative to your ability to 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.910
 face the situation with the right 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.229
 cold blood and with reflexes always at 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.889
 maximum and above all with stunts 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:35.100
 that you can do without losing sight 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.729
 the horizon because why in my opinion 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.970
 almost vomits with luz but own logo 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.240
 secured 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:47.130
 think you make a nice backflip in in 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:50.430
 bike with the non-profit organization of committees and Easter 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.229
 of 91 boys because it is so there 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.630
 even on the life pc screen 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.570
 this impression of really of 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.750
 be there imagine with the onlus that 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.669
 fuck is the sounds of the game that one thinks 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.860
 are a marginal part instead 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.110
 beautiful beautiful wheel sounds 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.990
 that the noise of the beautiful depart 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.419
 ground below under the rubber of the wheels 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.280
 beautiful crashes in short 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:17.160
 technically speaking this after that 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.080
 offers little but what little it offers 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.830
 top levels and we believe that 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.320
 played with gamepad is even better than 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.240
 on the keyboard always that there are not 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.740
 problems with gamepad like those 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.960
 we had of course we are 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.450
 talking about a demo the free demo 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.450
 you can download all of you is 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:39.570
 that gave us problems with the 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.669
 joypad hoping that you don't 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.340
 same thing, however, we refer you to 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:46.500
 link there is one important thing in 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.660
 this game is already on the grid and 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.990
 so soon we will also see it on steam 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.570
 and we will see it with some additions 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:56.390
 no small talk about coop we talk about 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:59.330
 multiplayer yes multiplayer 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:02.000
 this is very very positive now i 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.650
 green light is the access on steam more than 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.300
 once he gave us titles that 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.750
 they promised well but then they are 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:11.390
 resting on your laurels on tons of 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:14.060
 laurels that on sheaves of laurels 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:17.060
 we hope this mtb does not 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.920
 this bad marketing talk but 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.930
 stay true to yourself continue a 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.640
 improve yourself continue to offer the 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.960
 same beautiful experience that has us 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:28.330
 already given in its version 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.330
 primitive and indeed works
