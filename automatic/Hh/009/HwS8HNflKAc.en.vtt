00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:30.569 
tire with some acceleration runs to

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:32.029 
tire with some acceleration runs to

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
we'll get into blocks and do a few runs

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.480 
we'll get into blocks and do a few runs
out<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.259> blocks<00:01:34.499> so<00:01:34.829> it's<00:01:34.979> quite<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.189> long<00:01:35.340> day

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
out of blocks so it's quite a long day
