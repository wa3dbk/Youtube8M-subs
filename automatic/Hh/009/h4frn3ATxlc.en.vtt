farming it with 25 men normal is still

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.889 
farming it with 25 men normal is still
not<00:00:43.350> too<00:00:44.070> shabby<00:00:44.370> for<00:00:44.550> farming<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.629> had<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
not too shabby for farming and I had to

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.569 
not too shabby for farming and I had to
do<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.110> first<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.680> haven't<00:00:47.010> done<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.250> on<00:00:47.370> this

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.240 
do it first as I haven't done it on this
character<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.300> if<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.539> can't<00:00:48.780> do<00:00:49.079> heroic<00:00:49.649> just

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
character so if you can't do heroic just

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.010 
character so if you can't do heroic just
do<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.579> normal<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.090> then<00:00:51.329> next<00:00:51.570> week<00:00:51.840> when

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
do it on normal and then next week when

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.400 
do it on normal and then next week when
it<00:00:52.050> resets<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:53.039> do<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.309> on<00:00:53.550> heroic<00:00:54.410> now

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
it resets you can do it on heroic now

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.600 
it resets you can do it on heroic now
you<00:00:55.469> may<00:00:55.649> be<00:00:55.680> wondering<00:00:55.829> about<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
you may be wondering about the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.670 
you may be wondering about the
difficulty<00:00:57.090> setting<00:00:57.539> yes<00:00:57.899> everything<00:00:58.469> has

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
difficulty setting yes everything has

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.310 
difficulty setting yes everything has
more<00:00:58.920> health<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.370> 25<00:00:59.940> man<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.449> especially<00:01:00.870> so

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
more health on 25 man and especially so

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.560 
more health on 25 man and especially so
on<00:01:01.559> heroic<00:01:02.129> but<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.850> reason<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:03.239> do<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.449> on

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
on heroic but the reason we do it on

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.570 
on heroic but the reason we do it on
heroic<00:01:03.930> difficulty<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:04.830> 25<00:01:05.339> men

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
heroic difficulty and on 25 men

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.980 
heroic difficulty and on 25 men
difficulty<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.270> because<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> gold

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
difficulty is because the gold

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.649 
difficulty is because the gold
difference<00:01:07.470> more<00:01:08.010> than<00:01:08.220> makes<00:01:08.430> up<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.970> you

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
difference more than makes up for it you

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.080 
difference more than makes up for it you
get<00:01:09.810> 25<00:01:10.350> gold<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.070> ton<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.340> items<00:01:11.850> when<00:01:12.030> you

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
get 25 gold and a ton of items when you

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.020 
get 25 gold and a ton of items when you
kill<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> boss<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.780> 25<00:01:13.320> men<00:01:13.619> normal<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.250> if<00:01:14.939> you

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
kill a boss on 25 men normal and if you

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.160 
kill a boss on 25 men normal and if you
do<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.420> heroic<00:01:16.110> 25<00:01:16.409> men<00:01:17.100> then<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.430> get<00:01:18.170> 125

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
do it on heroic 25 men then you get 125

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.100 
do it on heroic 25 men then you get 125
gold<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.920> heroic<00:01:20.520> items<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.330> quite<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> big

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
gold and heroic items so quite a big

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.990 
gold and heroic items so quite a big
difference<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.979> basically<00:01:23.340> wants<00:01:23.700> do<00:01:23.820> all<00:01:23.970> of

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
difference so basically wants do all of

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.780 
difference so basically wants do all of
the<00:01:24.180> bosses<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.659> 25<00:01:25.380> man<00:01:25.799> heroic<00:01:26.070> although<00:01:26.670> if

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the bosses on 25 man heroic although if

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.999 
the bosses on 25 man heroic although if
your<00:01:26.939> gear<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.299> really<00:01:28.080> bad<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.619> may<00:01:28.740> want<00:01:28.950> to

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
your gear is really bad you may want to

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.240 
your gear is really bad you may want to
do<00:01:29.130> chimera<00:01:29.610> non<00:01:29.939> 25-man<00:01:30.900> normal<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.979> can

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
do chimera non 25-man normal you can

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.340 
do chimera non 25-man normal you can
change<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.820> difficulty<00:01:33.150> while<00:01:33.689> inside<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
change the difficulty while inside the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.870 
change the difficulty while inside the
instance<00:01:34.740> though<00:01:34.950> there<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> time<00:01:35.579> delay<00:01:35.729> to

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
instance though there is a time delay to

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.340 
instance though there is a time delay to
change<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.390> back<00:01:36.509> again<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.200> wait

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
change it back again so just wait

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.590 
change it back again so just wait
through<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.000> make<00:01:39.000> sure<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.509> it

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
through it and make sure that it

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.179 
through it and make sure that it
actually<00:01:39.810> changes<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.470> difficulty<00:01:40.979> because
