game project to work on their projects
we<00:02:04.270> have<00:02:04.390> four<00:02:04.660> different<00:02:04.750> spaces<00:02:05.290> for

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
we have four different spaces for

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.590 
we have four different spaces for
students<00:02:05.710> to<00:02:05.800> work<00:02:05.830> the<00:02:06.370> tables<00:02:06.670> are<00:02:06.760> built<00:02:07.060> as

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
students to work the tables are built as

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.940 
students to work the tables are built as
like<00:02:07.960> round<00:02:08.170> tables<00:02:08.530> so<00:02:08.650> they<00:02:08.770> can

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
like round tables so they can

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.710 
like round tables so they can
collaborate<00:02:09.700> better<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.119> see<00:02:10.360> each<00:02:10.479> other
