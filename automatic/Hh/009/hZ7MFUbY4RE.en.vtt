alright<00:00:16.139> so<00:00:16.260> this<00:00:16.379> was<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.590> sub<00:00:16.830> request<00:00:17.190> I

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
alright so this was a sub request I

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.279 
alright so this was a sub request I
think<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.850> think<00:00:18.180> either<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:18.630> or<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.810> dreamt<00:00:19.109> it

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
think I think either that or I dreamt it

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.810 
think I think either that or I dreamt it
because<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:19.949> didn't<00:00:20.160> write<00:00:20.369> down<00:00:20.400> who

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
because I didn't write down who

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.279 
because I didn't write down who
requested<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.510> in<00:00:21.710> and<00:00:22.939> when<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.150> open<00:00:24.420> I

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
requested it in and when is that open I

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.290 
requested it in and when is that open I
don't<00:00:25.650> write<00:00:25.920> down<00:00:26.099> who<00:00:26.189> requested<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.029> and

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
don't write down who requested this and

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.689 
don't write down who requested this and
once<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.109> searched<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.590> can<00:00:28.769> find<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.189> so

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
once I searched it I can find it so

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.060 
once I searched it I can find it so
basically<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.330> premise<00:00:30.779> okay<00:00:31.199> he

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
basically this is a premise okay he

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.090 
basically this is a premise okay he
doesn't<00:00:32.369> want<00:00:32.640> one<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:33.000> flows<00:00:33.540> with<00:00:33.780> water

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
doesn't want one that flows with water

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.959 
doesn't want one that flows with water
because<00:00:35.100> then<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.280> have<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.489> wait<00:00:35.670> for<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:35.910> to

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
because then you have to wait for it to

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.389 
because then you have to wait for it to
get<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:37.110> yeah<00:00:37.739> yeah<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.280> basically

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.690 
know you have your room grant this could
be<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> whole<00:00:43.140> like<00:00:43.410> water<00:00:43.800> house<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.460> this

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
be a whole like water house of this this

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.150 
be a whole like water house of this this
is<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.149> small<00:00:45.510> little<00:00:45.690> example<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.500> so

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
is just a small little example of it so

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.060 
is just a small little example of it so
you<00:00:47.219> turn<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.969> light<00:00:48.120> off<00:00:48.530> pretty<00:00:49.530> much<00:00:49.620> these

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
you turn the light off pretty much these

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.410 
you turn the light off pretty much these
are<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.309> ones<00:00:50.489> here<00:00:50.700> are<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.000> kind<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.270> there

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
are the ones here are just kind of there

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.569 
are the ones here are just kind of there
for<00:00:51.629> effect<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.289> they<00:00:52.410> can<00:00:52.559> actually<00:00:52.710> see<00:00:53.129> and

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
for effect so they can actually see and

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.340 
for effect so they can actually see and
then<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.030> know<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.239> don't<00:00:54.660> turn<00:00:54.930> them<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.110> and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
then you know you don't turn them on and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.779 
then you know you don't turn them on and
then<00:00:55.500> they<00:00:55.620> snap<00:00:55.890> off<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.370> then<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.670> know

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
then they snap off and then you know

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.660 
then they snap off and then you know
you've<00:00:57.390> replanted<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.590> rate<00:00:58.800> replanted<00:00:59.579> but

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
you've replanted you rate replanted but

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
you've replanted you rate replanted but
at<00:00:59.730> least<00:00:59.879> you<00:00:59.940> didn't<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.300> punch<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
at least you didn't have to punch the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.020 
at least you didn't have to punch the
whole<00:01:00.840> thing<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.320> or<00:01:02.250> wait<00:01:02.460> for<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.820> flow

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
whole thing and or wait for it to flow

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.509 
whole thing and or wait for it to flow
to<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:04.350> basically<00:01:05.040> that's<00:01:05.220> what<00:01:05.369> we're

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
to you so basically that's what we're

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.250 
to you so basically that's what we're
building<00:01:05.640> now<00:01:06.330> it's<00:01:06.600> gonna<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.930> very<00:01:07.170> very

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
building now it's gonna be a very very

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.670 
building now it's gonna be a very very
quick<00:01:07.710> example<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.990> because<00:01:09.990> again<00:01:10.409> this

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
quick example of this because again this

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.859 
quick example of this because again this
this<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.220> completely<00:01:11.909> expandable<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
this is completely expandable so the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.230 
this is completely expandable so the
biggest<00:01:13.100> thing<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.369> gonna<00:01:14.580> be<00:01:14.760> here<00:01:15.150> is

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
biggest thing that is gonna be here is

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.870 
biggest thing that is gonna be here is
gonna<00:01:15.390> be<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.780> setting<00:01:16.080> up<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.880> basically

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
gonna be just setting up the basically

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
gonna be just setting up the basically
the<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.150> piston<00:01:18.689> doors<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:20.060> there<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.390> then

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
the the piston doors so there and then

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.170 
the the piston doors so there and then
that's<00:01:22.049> gonna<00:01:22.290> hold<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.680> block<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.580> and

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
that's gonna hold a block like so and

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.760 
that's gonna hold a block like so and
then<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.780> other<00:01:24.810> pistons<00:01:25.320> are<00:01:25.439> gonna<00:01:25.530> hold

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
then the other pistons are gonna hold

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.420 
then the other pistons are gonna hold
the<00:01:25.860> block<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.490> they'll<00:01:26.759> be<00:01:26.970> here<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:28.320> now<00:01:29.220> it

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
the block so they'll be here and now it

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.069 
the block so they'll be here and now it
doesn't<00:01:29.640> have<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.090> be<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.420> either<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.930> can<00:01:31.020> be

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
doesn't have to be this either it can be

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.140 
doesn't have to be this either it can be
just<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.500> one<00:01:31.710> wide<00:01:31.979> door<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.549> mean<00:01:32.939> I'm<00:01:33.090> just

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.370 
doing two wide door but yeah so there's
a<00:01:38.790> torch<00:01:39.060> powering<00:01:39.479> now<00:01:39.630> one<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.930> put<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> block

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
a torch powering now one you put a block

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.929 
a torch powering now one you put a block
and<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.650> conducts<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.070> power<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.490> those<00:01:41.640> ones

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
and it conducts a power to those ones

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.910 
and it conducts a power to those ones
and<00:01:42.180> that's<00:01:42.360> what<00:01:42.509> we're<00:01:42.600> doing<00:01:42.869> all<00:01:43.500> right<00:01:43.560> so

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
see let's till this ground alright like

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.410 
see let's till this ground alright like
so<00:01:55.470> let's<00:01:56.040> get<00:01:56.189> some<00:01:56.340> water<00:01:56.549> also<00:01:57.240> if<00:01:57.299> you're

so let's get some water also if you're

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.999 
so let's get some water also if you're
not<00:01:57.570> too<00:01:57.719> familiar<00:01:57.869> with<00:01:58.140> farmland<00:01:58.799> and

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
not too familiar with farmland and

whatnot basically your best bet is to
put<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.950> source<00:02:02.219> block<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:02.759> at<00:02:02.939> least<00:02:03.060> four

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
put a source block and in at least four

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.330 
put a source block and in at least four
around<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.869> will<00:02:03.990> be<00:02:04.110> hydrate<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.680> like<00:02:05.130> all

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
around it will be hydrate it like all

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
we'll need pressure plates here to get

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.610 
we'll need pressure plates here to get
out<00:02:13.700> why<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.730> can't<00:02:15.030> just<00:02:15.180> place<00:02:15.390> him<00:02:15.569> there

here right here and then going into that

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.660 
here right here and then going into that
block<00:02:46.200> pretty<00:02:46.620> much<00:02:46.800> pretty<00:02:47.340> much<00:02:47.400> that's

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
block pretty much pretty much that's

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.440 
block pretty much pretty much that's
what<00:02:47.730> we're<00:02:47.850> going<00:02:48.030> for

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
what we're going for

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.060 
what we're going for
it'll<00:02:48.840> reverse<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.290> flow<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.650> torch<00:02:49.890> and

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
it'll reverse the flow of the torch and

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.770 
it'll reverse the flow of the torch and
it'll<00:02:50.250> open<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.610> up<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:51.269> I'll<00:02:51.360> do<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.600> same

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
it'll open it up so I'll do the same

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.030 
it'll open it up so I'll do the same
thing<00:02:51.959> on<00:02:52.050> this<00:02:52.290> side<00:02:53.660> like<00:02:54.660> that<00:02:54.800> bring<00:02:55.800> the

thing on this side like that bring the

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.540 
thing on this side like that bring the
dust<00:02:56.250> around<00:02:56.720> like<00:02:57.720> that's<00:02:57.989> like<00:02:58.350> that<00:02:58.590> and

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
dust around like that's like that and

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.180 
dust around like that's like that and
that's<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.209> now<00:03:00.840> on<00:03:01.050> this<00:03:01.200> side<00:03:01.410> we<00:03:01.470> need<00:03:02.070> the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
that's it now on this side we need the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.620 
that's it now on this side we need the
same<00:03:02.340> thing<00:03:02.610> pretty<00:03:02.790> much<00:03:02.880> we<00:03:03.209> just<00:03:03.239> need<00:03:03.510> to

same thing pretty much we just need to
uh<00:03:04.280> get<00:03:05.280> this<00:03:05.640> redstone<00:03:06.150> dust<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:07.080> that<00:03:08.870> like

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
uh get this redstone dust to that like

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.890 
uh get this redstone dust to that like
that<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.290> now<00:03:10.590> both<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.190> them<00:03:11.459> or<00:03:12.239> activate<00:03:12.750> it

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.509 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna place
just<00:03:24.329> a<00:03:24.420> ceiling<00:03:24.870> I<00:03:25.049> don't<00:03:26.040> know<00:03:26.130> why<00:03:26.280> I<00:03:26.310> did

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
just a ceiling I don't know why I did

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:26.690 
just a ceiling I don't know why I did
that

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
that

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.759 
that
all<00:03:27.420> we<00:03:27.570> need<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:27.720> really<00:03:27.989> just<00:03:28.290> for<00:03:28.350> sealing

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
all we need is really just for sealing

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.030 
all we need is really just for sealing
the<00:03:28.860> inside<00:03:29.250> portion<00:03:29.579> with<00:03:30.000> glowstone<00:03:30.630> lamps

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
the inside portion with glowstone lamps

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.500 
the inside portion with glowstone lamps
like<00:03:32.040> that<00:03:32.310> like<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.200> and<00:03:34.610> that's<00:03:35.610> and<00:03:36.329> like

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
like that like that and that's and like

like that like that and that's and like
dance<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.130> we'll<00:03:38.130> tell<00:03:38.310> ourselves<00:03:38.430> that<00:03:38.670> our

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
dance and we'll tell ourselves that our

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.160 
dance and we'll tell ourselves that our
leverage<00:03:39.329> right<00:03:39.630> here

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
leverage right here

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.979 
leverage right here
we'll<00:03:41.130> have<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.459> remember<00:03:41.730> because<00:03:42.090> I<00:03:42.660> don't

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
we'll have to remember because I don't

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.050 
we'll have to remember because I don't
have<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:43.140> different<00:03:43.320> color<00:03:43.620> block<00:03:43.950> on<00:03:44.160> me<00:03:44.340> all

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
have a different color block on me all

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.910 
have a different color block on me all
right<00:03:45.209> so<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:45.930> biggest<00:03:46.110> thing<00:03:46.320> about<00:03:46.380> this<00:03:46.739> is

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
right so the biggest thing about this is

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.819 
right so the biggest thing about this is
light<00:03:47.430> passes<00:03:47.910> through<00:03:47.940> Pistons<00:03:48.600> so<00:03:49.530> check<00:03:49.709> it

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
light passes through Pistons so check it

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.410 
light passes through Pistons so check it
out<00:03:50.090> I'll<00:03:51.090> place<00:03:51.360> these<00:03:51.570> here<00:03:53.120> I'll<00:03:54.120> place

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
out I'll place these here I'll place

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.300 
out I'll place these here I'll place
these<00:03:54.630> here<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:55.890> as<00:03:56.130> you're<00:03:56.310> inside<00:03:57.620> see<00:03:58.620> well

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
these here and as you're inside see well

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.470 
these here and as you're inside see well
actually<00:03:59.430> that's<00:03:59.640> not<00:03:59.760> a<00:03:59.880> good<00:04:00.000> example<00:04:00.090> of

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
actually that's not a good example of

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.870 
actually that's not a good example of
that<00:04:00.540> let's<00:04:01.380> cover<00:04:01.620> this<00:04:01.829> up<00:04:02.010> so<00:04:02.400> then<00:04:02.549> this<00:04:02.700> is

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
that let's cover this up so then this is

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.220 
that let's cover this up so then this is
covered<00:04:03.299> and<00:04:03.420> then<00:04:03.570> you<00:04:03.660> can<00:04:03.780> see<00:04:03.930> that<00:04:04.079> light

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
covered and then you can see that light

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.250 
covered and then you can see that light
still<00:04:04.560> passes<00:04:04.920> through<00:04:05.130> Pistons<00:04:06.109> see<00:04:07.109> that

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
still passes through Pistons see that

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.259 
still passes through Pistons see that
it's<00:04:08.070> still<00:04:08.340> not<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.549> good<00:04:08.700> example<00:04:08.790> because

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
it's still not a good example because

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.230 
it's still not a good example because
there's<00:04:09.600> still<00:04:10.019> stuff<00:04:10.170> there

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
there's still stuff there

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.510 
there's still stuff there

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
okay you see that okay that's an example

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.979 
okay you see that okay that's an example
see<00:04:19.520> everything's<00:04:19.850> covered<00:04:20.060> but<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:20.810> light

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
see everything's covered but the light

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.660 
see everything's covered but the light
passes<00:04:21.380> through<00:04:21.410> the<00:04:21.739> pissants<00:04:22.100> so<00:04:22.310> cover<00:04:22.550> it

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
passes through the pissants so cover it

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.670 
passes through the pissants so cover it
from<00:04:22.880> this<00:04:23.120> side<00:04:23.330> and<00:04:23.960> from<00:04:24.020> this<00:04:24.290> side<00:04:24.500> and

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
from this side and from this side and

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.890 
from this side and from this side and
then<00:04:24.800> it's<00:04:24.950> completely<00:04:25.550> dark<00:04:25.820> all<00:04:26.630> right

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
then it's completely dark all right

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.500 
then it's completely dark all right
where's<00:04:27.050> our<00:04:27.170> lever<00:04:27.410> at<00:04:27.910> all<00:04:28.910> right<00:04:29.090> all<00:04:29.300> you

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
where's our lever at all right all you

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.940 
where's our lever at all right all you
have<00:04:29.630> to<00:04:29.720> do<00:04:29.840> pretty<00:04:30.140> much<00:04:30.320> is<00:04:30.500> just<00:04:30.680> get

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
have to do pretty much is just get

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.370 
have to do pretty much is just get
redstone<00:04:31.580> dust<00:04:31.760> all<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.150> way<00:04:32.270> up<00:04:32.420> here<00:04:32.450> again

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
redstone dust all the way up here again

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.570 
redstone dust all the way up here again
if<00:04:33.470> you're<00:04:33.620> gonna<00:04:33.710> expand<00:04:34.070> it's<00:04:34.250> gonna<00:04:34.400> be<00:04:34.520> a

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
if you're gonna expand it's gonna be a

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.600 
if you're gonna expand it's gonna be a
huge<00:04:34.760> wart<00:04:35.120> house<00:04:35.330> then<00:04:35.630> clearly<00:04:36.490> you<00:04:37.490> know

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
huge wart house then clearly you know

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.870 
huge wart house then clearly you know
you<00:04:37.670> for<00:04:38.030> Peters<00:04:38.300> and<00:04:38.540> whatnot<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:40.430> then<00:04:40.700> so

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
you for Peters and whatnot and then so

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.030 
you for Peters and whatnot and then so
our<00:04:41.000> lever<00:04:41.270> will<00:04:41.810> be<00:04:44.590> right<00:04:45.590> there<00:04:45.770> that's

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
our lever will be right there that's

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.540 
our lever will be right there that's
perfect

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
perfect

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.520 
perfect
so<00:04:47.090> again<00:04:47.270> this<00:04:47.330> is<00:04:47.480> just<00:04:47.630> a<00:04:47.690> tiny<00:04:47.900> tiny<00:04:48.170> room

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
so again this is just a tiny tiny room

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.330 
so again this is just a tiny tiny room
representing<00:04:49.460> what<00:04:49.610> could<00:04:49.760> be<00:04:49.910> a<00:04:49.940> massive

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
representing what could be a massive

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.940 
representing what could be a massive
massive<00:04:52.340> farm<00:04:53.230> so<00:04:54.230> we'll<00:04:54.320> plant<00:04:54.560> the<00:04:54.680> stuff

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
massive farm so we'll plant the stuff

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.310 
massive farm so we'll plant the stuff
down<00:04:55.250> I<00:04:55.610> think<00:04:56.000> I'm<00:04:56.120> flying<00:04:56.420> that<00:04:56.960> will<00:04:57.080> quit

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
down I think I'm flying that will quit

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:06.310 
down I think I'm flying that will quit
flying<00:04:57.910> and<00:04:58.930> I<00:04:59.930> will<00:05:00.110> bonemeal<00:05:00.560> it

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.560 

there<00:05:07.320> there<00:05:07.590> there<00:05:07.860> there<00:05:07.889> there<00:05:08.100> and

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
there there there there there and

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
there there there there there and
clearly<00:05:09.570> so<00:05:09.750> what<00:05:09.870> you<00:05:09.960> need<00:05:10.080> to<00:05:10.139> do<00:05:10.320> is<00:05:10.440> have

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
clearly so what you need to do is have

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.230 
clearly so what you need to do is have
the<00:05:10.680> light<00:05:10.889> on<00:05:10.919> right<00:05:11.280> so<00:05:11.610> when<00:05:11.729> you<00:05:11.790> come<00:05:12.060> in

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
the light on right so when you come in

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.060 
the light on right so when you come in
here

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:23.060 

crap<00:05:20.870> should've<00:05:21.870> used<00:05:22.050> glowstone<00:05:22.590> lamps<00:05:22.949> I'm

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
crap should've used glowstone lamps I'm

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.850 
crap should've used glowstone lamps I'm
sure<00:05:23.540> that<00:05:24.540> if<00:05:24.720> anything's<00:05:25.110> causing<00:05:25.530> this<00:05:25.650> to

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
sure that if anything's causing this to

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:32.270 
sure that if anything's causing this to
act<00:05:26.010> funny<00:05:26.370> is<00:05:26.639> the<00:05:26.850> clothes<00:05:27.120> to<00:05:27.330> lamps<00:05:31.280> all

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
act funny is the clothes to lamps all

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.719 
act funny is the clothes to lamps all
right<00:05:32.690> like<00:05:33.690> that<00:05:33.720> so<00:05:34.080> you<00:05:34.229> want<00:05:34.440> it<00:05:34.470> to<00:05:34.530> be<00:05:34.740> lit

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
right like that so you want it to be lit

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:40.580 
right like that so you want it to be lit
on<00:05:35.760> the<00:05:35.910> inside<00:05:36.360> okay<00:05:38.840> so<00:05:39.840> that<00:05:40.020> this<00:05:40.410> stuff

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
on the inside okay so that this stuff

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.110 
on the inside okay so that this stuff
grows<00:05:40.860> and<00:05:41.190> then<00:05:41.310> when<00:05:41.460> you<00:05:41.580> are<00:05:41.610> ready<00:05:41.970> to

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
grows and then when you are ready to

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.500 
grows and then when you are ready to
harvest<00:05:42.360> it<00:05:42.660> just<00:05:42.870> turn<00:05:43.080> off<00:05:43.199> light<00:05:43.590> and<00:05:44.510> then

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
harvest it just turn off light and then

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.879 
harvest it just turn off light and then
turn<00:05:45.720> them<00:05:45.810> back<00:05:45.960> on<00:05:46.229> and<00:05:46.440> then<00:05:46.530> you<00:05:46.620> get<00:05:46.770> your

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
turn them back on and then you get your

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:48.800 
turn them back on and then you get your
stuff<00:05:47.190> so<00:05:47.669> you<00:05:47.729> don't<00:05:48.210> have<00:05:48.360> to<00:05:48.449> wait<00:05:48.600> for<00:05:48.750> it

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
stuff so you don't have to wait for it

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.469 
stuff so you don't have to wait for it
to<00:05:48.870> flow<00:05:49.110> to<00:05:49.169> you<00:05:49.440> even<00:05:50.430> if<00:05:50.550> it<00:05:50.639> is<00:05:50.729> entire<00:05:51.120> you

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
to flow to you even if it is entire you

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.750 
to flow to you even if it is entire you
know<00:05:51.510> room<00:05:52.229> of<00:05:52.380> this<00:05:52.470> stuff<00:05:52.770> like<00:05:53.460> a<00:05:53.490> football

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
know room of this stuff like a football

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.450 
know room of this stuff like a football
field<00:05:53.940> it's<00:05:54.720> not<00:05:54.990> really<00:05:55.590> problematic<00:05:56.100> and

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
field it's not really problematic and

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.300 
field it's not really problematic and
you<00:05:57.330> really<00:05:57.810> have<00:05:57.960> to<00:05:58.080> replant<00:05:58.530> it<00:05:58.740> even<00:05:59.100> with

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
you really have to replant it even with

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.279 
you really have to replant it even with
a<00:05:59.340> watered<00:05:59.820> wheat<00:06:00.060> farm<00:06:00.360> so<00:06:00.960> that's<00:06:01.139> pretty
