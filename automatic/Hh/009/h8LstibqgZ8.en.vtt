still<00:02:06.770> how<00:02:06.950> can<00:02:07.010> a<00:02:07.190> prank<00:02:07.520> like<00:02:07.610> that<00:02:07.940> just

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
still how can a prank like that just

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.980 
still how can a prank like that just
float<00:02:09.070> that's<00:02:10.070> easy<00:02:10.430> to<00:02:10.670> explain<00:02:10.990> according

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
float that's easy to explain according

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.140 
float that's easy to explain according
to<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.200> cutter<00:02:12.440> jackowski<00:02:12.890> lift<00:02:13.400> theorem<00:02:13.820> the

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
to the cutter jackowski lift theorem the

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.120 
to the cutter jackowski lift theorem the
control<00:02:14.600> surface<00:02:15.110> flow<00:02:15.320> is<00:02:15.500> balanced<00:02:15.980> by<00:02:16.040> the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
control surface flow is balanced by the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.170 
control surface flow is balanced by the
inverse<00:02:16.640> kinetics<00:02:17.210> of<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.450> stop<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:19.030> get<00:02:20.030> it

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
inverse kinetics of the stop I get it

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.090 
inverse kinetics of the stop I get it
okay<00:02:20.510> it<00:02:20.780> just<00:02:21.080> floats<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:21.680> that's<00:02:21.800> good

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
okay it just floats and that's good

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.700 
okay it just floats and that's good
enough<00:02:22.310> for<00:02:22.370> me<00:02:22.580> ah<00:02:25.840> sorry<00:02:26.840> but<00:02:27.230> it's<00:02:27.350> just<00:02:27.620> too
