00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hi guys today start the new ai 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.080
 a column dedicated to photography mine 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.179
 particular passion is taken from 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.290
 when i became dad of 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.179
 nicolò 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.980
 today we see as the first episode of 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.500
 this section as taking pictures 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.480
 photographs to the children when they are at the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.789
 closed an extremely difficult thing 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.380
 for the basic reason why children do 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.390
 move so many to succeed 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.849
 take it at that right time without it 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.039
 blurs or special events such as 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.009
 simple second because inside 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.350
 light condition often falling in the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.370
 very poor environments included 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.129
 we think it's for the party of 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.290
 classic birthday for which it is difficult 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:43.980
 with even cameras of a 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.899
 certain level a medieval base reflex 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.660
 getting good sources 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.280
 instant agents advice to succeed 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.440
 to do it inside the tube are 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.899
 essentially two the first is that of 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.149
 take advantage of the light as much as possible 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.039
 natural and therefore exploit it 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.530
 simply the windows of the house 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.339
 creating, however, as far as possible one 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.750
 soft light being as usual for 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.460
 continue photography the solution 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.960
 best when we do portraits 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.450
 that for example of a cloudy sky 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.020
 however first diffused light that does not create 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.570
 with the classic mechanism of the sun dell 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.640
 1 very jagged very very well 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.619
 defined for which the ideal maybe a 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.110
 try to close in the tent because 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.720
 it was the soft light and if you want to do it 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.579
 August photos long while playing I tell you 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.040
 just move it to the area more 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.479
 bright of the house where you also have one 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.270
 easy to rebuild an environment 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.450
 bright enough soft in my case 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.990
 this is the softest light environment 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:46.009
 so according to the video in the below 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.140
 cot under nicolò's bed where it enters 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.640
 the light from the window and the walls of the 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.700
 under bed all white help me to 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.149
 make a decidedly light atmosphere 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.079
 widespread to record a video to make 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.240
 of the photographs 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.310
 this is the first most basic method 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.860
 second concerns a device 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.990
 in using the flash the flashback 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.299
 always a point and command the children and 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.849
 for me and above all this because 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.920
 on the one hand there are not too many 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.230
 natural second in fact with age that 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.060
 annoyance to children often going 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.980
 close to them because melange anyway 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.959
 usually more than a few meters is not 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.910
 able to succeed in giving one 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.220
 brightness for which it is useless to remind you 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.750
 always take brescia photos 5 10 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.030
 meters away because you can't 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.880
 just to illuminate the area e 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.860
 second we have to leave a little spart 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.530
 how we were men in black iii our 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.200
 children how to make a solution that I have 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.019
 found by buying this item is 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.760
 imported from the united states is the lac 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.920
 scoop this kind of objects but here 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.389
 this little glass made by 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.519
 professor cover and dear professor 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:52.850
 of the university of san francisco that has 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.769
 thought of a small slide from is in 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.389
 able to reflect light we admit 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.670
 that my hand is the flash of the 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:00.980
 our camera able to 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.920
 reflect light in this world e 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.780
 shoot it like that on the ceiling on the walls 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.200
 has been around us therefore perfect from 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.129
 be used in the field 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.290
 closed in this way we pray the light 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:15.450
 widespread for that instant sufficient 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.280
 to create a photo where not only 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.010
 our subject with flash classes 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.959
 it is enlightened but you too totally 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.310
 surrounding more light 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.110
 being diffused to every arrival 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.700
 directly in the eye looking at the 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.250
 camera flash 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.489
 this object is in its version 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.410
 original for reflexes in this case 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.739
 I 'm not always doing the video 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.599
 and a canon eos 600d is adaptable to 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.940
 you can find many models on the 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:45.420
 site this break list below in the 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.739
 description of the video and also find the 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.620
 junior version also designed for 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:53.099
 compact cameras in case you don't want to 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.650
 buy this mini device that 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.540
 still important if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.130
 we are on the price of about 30 euros 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.690
 available in the German store that 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.180
 find if also in the description here 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.940
 at the bottom of the ski very efficient arrived 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.940
 in just two days with a time of 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.110
 shipping was very active you can 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.940
 buy if you have a reflex with the 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.920
 flashes that already automatically are 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.889
 adjustable so able to fire the 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.889
 light towards the car as you would do this 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:22.169
 veneto then or you can apply a 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.610
 simple diffuser on the flash for example 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.180
 just cut a piece that paper from 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.830
 oven at home to pinch it like it 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.539
 last paper on the spot one flash 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.180
 compact machine or not this already there 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:35.550
 helps a little to spread the light and not 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.830
 achieve an extremely strong radius 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.720
 in the vote of your boh 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.820
 some examples for example I take from 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.410
 calendar of my still here 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.600
 I went out to take a picture of 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.710
 this type as you see a lot 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.300
 close 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.520
 and while we were bathing without 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.320
 to disturb him in this case a huge one 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.410
 brightness also given by the type 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.360
 of the parts and having in a surface 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.979
 also enamelled here instead we are from 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.729
 kitchen I had the chance to 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.800
 get so close 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.809
 but the same time to keep bright 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.759
 as you also see the person who was 

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:12.199
 novak held him in his arms and also held him 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:15.469
 background the lasso then works in 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:17.539
 both horizontal and vertical but 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:20.749
 however, attention must always be paid 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:23.120
 very old and I speak of about 23 meters 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:24.439
 from the walls it serves for the power from 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.490
 machine flash light 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:27.319
 photographic 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.240
 this as I said to you is the first 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:30.800
 tutorial for children's photography for 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.539
 any questions or information 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.610
 requests for future tutorials you can

 write it in under the incumbents and 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.599
