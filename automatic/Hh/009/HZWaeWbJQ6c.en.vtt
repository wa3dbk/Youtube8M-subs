00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
to go for it I I think you'll battle

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.530 
to go for it I I think you'll battle
you're<00:05:34.710> really<00:05:35.070> battle<00:05:35.610> to<00:05:35.760> find<00:05:36.030> a<00:05:36.240> better

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
you're really battle to find a better

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.050 
you're really battle to find a better
value<00:05:36.900> and<00:05:37.350> I<00:05:37.710> know<00:05:37.770> that<00:05:38.430> you<00:05:38.550> won't<00:05:38.730> find<00:05:38.910> a

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
value and I know that you won't find a

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.240 
value and I know that you won't find a
knife<00:05:39.300> that<00:05:39.780> can<00:05:39.930> do<00:05:40.169> more<00:05:40.440> work<00:05:40.770> and<00:05:41.010> take

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
knife that can do more work and take

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.090 
knife that can do more work and take
more<00:05:41.490> abuse<00:05:41.940> than<00:05:42.150> the<00:05:42.600> 6-inch<00:05:43.110> holdout<00:05:43.530> for

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
more abuse than the 6-inch holdout for

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.770 
more abuse than the 6-inch holdout for
the<00:05:44.250> weight<00:05:44.430> it's<00:05:44.729> just<00:05:44.970> a<00:05:45.120> tremendous

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
the weight it's just a tremendous

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.200 
the weight it's just a tremendous
bargain<00:05:46.110> and<00:05:46.590> a<00:05:47.010> big<00:05:47.190> advantage<00:05:47.550> in<00:05:47.820> fact<00:05:48.030> I

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
bargain and a big advantage in fact I

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.690 
bargain and a big advantage in fact I
think<00:05:48.419> so<00:05:48.810> much<00:05:49.020> of<00:05:49.080> it<00:05:49.410> that<00:05:49.590> this<00:05:50.370> is<00:05:50.550> the

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
think so much of it that this is the
