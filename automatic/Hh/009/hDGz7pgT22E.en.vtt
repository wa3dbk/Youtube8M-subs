00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
takes some practice but I always start

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.630 
takes some practice but I always start
by<00:00:21.210> sectioning<00:00:21.600> off<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.170> front<00:00:22.769> pieces<00:00:23.070> these

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
by sectioning off the front pieces these

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.519 
by sectioning off the front pieces these
are<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.910> pieces<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.300> I'll<00:00:24.570> leave<00:00:24.869> out<00:00:25.109> of

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
are the pieces that I'll leave out of

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.540 
are the pieces that I'll leave out of
the<00:00:26.010> braid

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
the braid

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.450 
the braid
I<00:00:26.580> like<00:00:27.240> these<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.810> be<00:00:28.019> framing<00:00:28.619> my<00:00:28.859> face<00:00:29.160> when

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
behind my ears to kind of keep it out of

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.240 
behind my ears to kind of keep it out of
the<00:00:35.640> way<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.170> then<00:00:37.170> on<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.410> right<00:00:37.620> side<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.100> my

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
the way and then on the right side of my

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.810 
the way and then on the right side of my
head<00:00:38.280> about<00:00:39.320> two<00:00:40.320> maybe<00:00:40.770> three<00:00:41.160> inches<00:00:41.550> above

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
head about two maybe three inches above

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.959 
head about two maybe three inches above
my<00:00:42.059> ear<00:00:42.090> I'm<00:00:42.930> just<00:00:43.410> making<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.829> part<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.460> kind

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
my ear I'm just making a part and kind

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.670 
my ear I'm just making a part and kind
of<00:00:45.059> pulling<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.450> rest<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.870> hair<00:00:46.050> over<00:00:46.230> and

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
of pulling the rest of the hair over and

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.709 
of pulling the rest of the hair over and
then<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.399> take<00:00:47.610> three<00:00:47.820> small<00:00:48.059> sections<00:00:48.539> and

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
then you take three small sections and

00:00:48.719 --> 00:01:17.410 
then you take three small sections and
you<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:48.989> start<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.410> do<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> Dutch<00:00:49.860> braid

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.880 

you'll<00:01:18.420> keep<00:01:18.630> doing<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:19.080> Dutch<00:01:19.290> braid<00:01:19.530> until

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
you'll keep doing a Dutch braid until

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.180 
you'll keep doing a Dutch braid until
you<00:01:20.670> get<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.300> point<00:01:21.510> where<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:22.620> awkward

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
you get to the point where it's awkward

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.940 
you get to the point where it's awkward
to<00:01:23.220> keep<00:01:23.700> going<00:01:24.000> back<00:01:24.840> any<00:01:25.110> further<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.770> then

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
to keep going back any further and then

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.300 
to keep going back any further and then
you'll<00:01:26.130> have<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.700> rearrange<00:01:27.030> your<00:01:27.330> hands<00:01:28.020> and

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
you'll have to rearrange your hands and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.920 
you'll have to rearrange your hands and
whatever<00:01:29.310> hand<00:01:29.880> was<00:01:30.060> holding<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.570> bottom

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
whatever hand was holding the bottom

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.900 
whatever hand was holding the bottom
section<00:01:31.320> will<00:01:31.500> now<00:01:31.650> hold<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.100> top<00:01:32.310> section

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
section will now hold the top section

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.109 
section will now hold the top section
and<00:01:33.180> vice-versa<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.800> you'll<00:01:35.160> kind<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.670> arrange

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
and vice-versa so you'll kind of arrange

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.690 
and vice-versa so you'll kind of arrange
your<00:01:36.390> hands<00:01:36.660> that<00:01:36.960> way<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:38.369> you'll<00:01:38.640> see

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
your hands that way and as you'll see

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.670 
your hands that way and as you'll see
here<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.180> second<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.660> like<00:01:39.810> always<00:01:40.229> takes<00:01:40.530> me

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
here in a second it like always takes me

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.139 
here in a second it like always takes me
a<00:01:40.770> second<00:01:41.160> to<00:01:41.250> do<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.550> I<00:01:41.759> don't<00:01:41.910> know<00:01:42.000> why

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
a second to do this I don't know why

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.230 
a second to do this I don't know why
it's<00:01:42.330> like<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.750> confusing<00:01:43.410> to<00:01:43.560> me<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.580> once<00:01:45.030> you

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
it's like so confusing to me so once you

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.240 
it's like so confusing to me so once you
have<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.660> then<00:01:46.050> you'll<00:01:46.229> just<00:01:46.500> keep<00:01:46.800> going

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
have that then you'll just keep going

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.980 
have that then you'll just keep going
and<00:01:47.399> you'll<00:01:47.520> kind<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.940> want<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.180> keep<00:01:48.360> track<00:01:48.720> of

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
and you'll kind of want to keep track of

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.160 
and you'll kind of want to keep track of
what<00:01:49.740> section<00:01:50.100> needs<00:01:50.580> to<00:01:50.729> go<00:01:50.940> underneath<00:01:51.170> next

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
what section needs to go underneath next

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.469 
what section needs to go underneath next
and<00:01:52.410> then<00:01:53.130> you'll<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.520> keep<00:01:53.759> doing<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.300> Dutch

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
and then you'll just keep doing a Dutch

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:10.800 
and then you'll just keep doing a Dutch
braid<00:01:54.780> through<00:01:55.410> the<00:01:55.590> back<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.770> your<00:01:55.950> head

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.060 

when<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:11.960> get<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:12.320> about<00:02:12.350> here<00:02:12.860> you'll<00:02:13.010> have

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
when you get to about here you'll have

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.990 
when you get to about here you'll have
to<00:02:13.400> rearrange<00:02:13.730> your<00:02:14.150> hands<00:02:14.420> again<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.260> then

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
to rearrange your hands again and then

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.340 
to rearrange your hands again and then
continue<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.150> Dutch<00:02:17.330> braid<00:02:17.600> but<00:02:17.930> this<00:02:18.140> time

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
continue the Dutch braid but this time

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.440 
continue the Dutch braid but this time
you'll<00:02:18.500> kind<00:02:18.740> of<00:02:18.860> angle<00:02:19.220> it<00:02:19.280> up<00:02:19.460> and<00:02:19.850> then

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
you'll kind of angle it up and then

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.050 
you'll kind of angle it up and then
around<00:02:20.870> your<00:02:21.230> head<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.800> just<00:02:22.520> be<00:02:22.670> sure<00:02:22.910> you

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
around your head and just be sure you

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.090 
around your head and just be sure you
don't<00:02:23.270> incorporate<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:24.410> pieces<00:02:24.830> that<00:02:24.950> you

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
don't incorporate the pieces that you

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.190 
don't incorporate the pieces that you
had<00:02:25.280> originally<00:02:25.520> left<00:02:26.120> out<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.960> pieces

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
had originally left out so the pieces

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.440 
had originally left out so the pieces
that<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.190> want<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.550> frame<00:02:28.760> your<00:02:28.940> face<00:02:29.120> just

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
that you want to frame your face just

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.300 
that you want to frame your face just

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
make sure you don't include those in the

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:58.520 
make sure you don't include those in the
braid<00:02:31.520> as<00:02:31.730> well

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.050 

once<00:02:59.530> you've<00:02:59.739> run<00:02:59.920> out<00:03:00.129> of<00:03:00.159> hair<00:03:00.549> and<00:03:00.879> you've

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
once you've run out of hair and you've

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.819 
once you've run out of hair and you've
kind<00:03:01.480> of<00:03:01.599> finished<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.049> braid<00:03:02.260> then<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:02.650> can

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
kind of finished the braid then you can

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.530 
kind of finished the braid then you can
go<00:03:02.950> through<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.340> pull<00:03:03.579> it<00:03:03.670> apart<00:03:03.760> as<00:03:04.150> much<00:03:04.360> as

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
go through and pull it apart as much as

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.690 
go through and pull it apart as much as
you<00:03:04.659> want<00:03:04.900> I<00:03:05.200> actually<00:03:05.739> think<00:03:06.159> that<00:03:06.310> this

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
you want I actually think that this

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.580 
you want I actually think that this
braid<00:03:07.060> looks<00:03:07.390> cute<00:03:07.810> when<00:03:07.959> it's<00:03:07.989> not<00:03:08.290> pulled

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
braid looks cute when it's not pulled

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.849 
braid looks cute when it's not pulled
apart<00:03:08.890> but<00:03:09.790> of<00:03:10.120> course<00:03:10.540> I<00:03:10.930> always<00:03:11.170> am<00:03:11.709> like

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
apart but of course I always am like

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.800 
apart but of course I always am like
addicted<00:03:12.250> to<00:03:12.609> pulling<00:03:12.879> my<00:03:12.970> fur<00:03:13.269> so<00:03:13.540> I<00:03:13.599> went

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
addicted to pulling my fur so I went

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.050 
addicted to pulling my fur so I went
through<00:03:14.109> and<00:03:14.500> made<00:03:14.980> mine<00:03:15.640> a<00:03:15.670> little<00:03:15.940> bit

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
through and made mine a little bit

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.960 
through and made mine a little bit
chunkier<00:03:16.810> but<00:03:17.560> I<00:03:17.859> think<00:03:18.310> it's<00:03:18.489> fine<00:03:18.730> without

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
chunkier but I think it's fine without

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.940 
chunkier but I think it's fine without
it<00:03:19.329> so<00:03:19.569> if<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:19.959> feel<00:03:20.230> like<00:03:20.379> you're<00:03:20.530> gonna<00:03:20.620> mess

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
it so if you feel like you're gonna mess

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.520 
it so if you feel like you're gonna mess
up<00:03:21.190> your<00:03:21.220> braid<00:03:21.640> I<00:03:21.940> would<00:03:22.329> say<00:03:22.540> just<00:03:22.900> leave<00:03:23.290> it

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
up your braid I would say just leave it

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.460 
up your braid I would say just leave it
how<00:03:23.680> it<00:03:23.709> is<00:03:23.890> and<00:03:24.430> then<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:25.359> can<00:03:25.720> use<00:03:26.290> an

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
how it is and then you can use an

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.890 
how it is and then you can use an
elastic<00:03:26.920> and<00:03:27.069> tie<00:03:27.310> it<00:03:27.370> off<00:03:27.609> and<00:03:27.940> then<00:03:28.659> you'll

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
elastic and tie it off and then you'll

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.170 
elastic and tie it off and then you'll
just<00:03:28.930> kind<00:03:29.739> of<00:03:29.859> hide<00:03:30.069> it<00:03:30.310> behind<00:03:30.549> your<00:03:30.940> braid

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
just kind of hide it behind your braid

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.240 
just kind of hide it behind your braid
