00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
hi i'm tom from digital foundry now it's

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.180 
hi i'm tom from digital foundry now it's
been<00:00:03.659> about<00:00:03.689> a<00:00:03.899> year<00:00:04.020> since<00:00:04.470> Bungie<00:00:04.920> first

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
been about a year since Bungie first

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.210 
been about a year since Bungie first
revealed<00:00:05.520> destiny<00:00:06.029> in<00:00:06.240> three<00:00:06.569> back<00:00:07.049> in<00:00:07.220> 2013

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
revealed destiny in three back in 2013

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.640 
revealed destiny in three back in 2013
the<00:00:09.030> live<00:00:09.240> demo<00:00:09.570> basically<00:00:10.139> showed<00:00:10.410> what

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
the live demo basically showed what

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.589 
the live demo basically showed what
would<00:00:10.889> later<00:00:11.099> become<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.790> opening<00:00:12.059> tutorial

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
would later become the opening tutorial

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.570 
would later become the opening tutorial
segment<00:00:13.019> in<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.259> finished<00:00:13.530> product<00:00:13.799> it

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
segment in the finished product it

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.070 
segment in the finished product it
played<00:00:14.880> out<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.089> little<00:00:15.389> differently<00:00:15.839> in<00:00:15.960> terms

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
played out a little differently in terms

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.349 
played out a little differently in terms
of<00:00:16.379> been<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.650> positions<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.520> on<00:00:17.670> but

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
of been in positions and so on but

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.970 
of been in positions and so on but
largely<00:00:18.750> use<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.109> same<00:00:19.350> key<00:00:19.560> areas<00:00:21.740> here<00:00:22.740> we

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
largely use the same key areas here we

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.800 
largely use the same key areas here we
have<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.369> final<00:00:23.760> retail<00:00:23.910> release<00:00:24.240> played<00:00:24.660> on

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
have the final retail release played on

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.529 
have the final retail release played on
a<00:00:24.840> ps4<00:00:25.230> being<00:00:26.070> compared<00:00:26.460> with<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.760> early<00:00:27.090> III

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
a ps4 being compared with that early III

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.200 
a ps4 being compared with that early III
demo<00:00:27.980> but<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.130> question<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.580> has<00:00:29.820> anything

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
demo but the question is has anything

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.490 
demo but the question is has anything
actually<00:00:30.449> been<00:00:30.900> changed

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
actually been changed

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.200 
actually been changed
perhaps<00:00:31.859> downgraded<00:00:32.550> on<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> technical<00:00:33.180> level

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
perhaps downgraded on a technical level

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.430 
perhaps downgraded on a technical level
or<00:00:33.719> even<00:00:33.780> improved<00:00:35.750> so<00:00:36.750> right<00:00:36.960> off<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.230> bat

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
or even improved so right off the bat

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.990 
or even improved so right off the bat
you<00:00:37.710> can<00:00:37.860> see<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> massive<00:00:38.340> difference<00:00:38.520> in

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
you can see a massive difference in

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.910 
you can see a massive difference in
geometry<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.570> lighting<00:00:39.690> we're<00:00:40.559> just<00:00:40.770> on<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
geometry and lighting we're just on the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.010 
geometry and lighting we're just on the
outskirts<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.700> old<00:00:41.850> Russia<00:00:42.149> area<00:00:42.780> here

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
outskirts of the old Russia area here

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.049 
outskirts of the old Russia area here
and<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.320> can<00:00:43.559> see<00:00:43.829> terrain<00:00:44.280> has<00:00:44.430> been<00:00:44.670> pretty

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
and you can see terrain has been pretty

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.750 
and you can see terrain has been pretty
significantly<00:00:45.870> remoulded

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.370 

now<00:00:52.329> this<00:00:52.540> short<00:00:52.780> is<00:00:52.870> perhaps<00:00:53.050> the<00:00:53.320> most

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
now this short is perhaps the most

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.020 
now this short is perhaps the most
revealing<00:00:54.100> in<00:00:54.220> pointing<00:00:54.610> out<00:00:54.700> the<00:00:54.850> big

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
revealing in pointing out the big

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.080 
revealing in pointing out the big
differences<00:00:55.770> rock<00:00:56.770> outcrops<00:00:57.280> are<00:00:57.489> bolder<00:00:57.880> and

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
differences rock outcrops are bolder and

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.819 
differences rock outcrops are bolder and
heightened<00:00:58.600> and<00:00:58.780> there's<00:00:59.260> a<00:00:59.320> bigger<00:00:59.530> variety

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
heightened and there's a bigger variety

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.700 
heightened and there's a bigger variety
of<00:01:00.100> foliage<00:01:00.370> across<00:01:00.940> the<00:01:01.090> ground<00:01:01.329> to<00:01:01.559> added<00:01:02.559> to

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
of foliage across the ground to added to

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.189 
of foliage across the ground to added to
that<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:03.430> final<00:01:03.790> bill<00:01:03.970> gets<00:01:04.479> atmospheric

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
that the final bill gets atmospheric

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.770 
that the final bill gets atmospheric
effects<00:01:05.650> like<00:01:05.890> dust<00:01:06.159> clouds<00:01:06.430> and<00:01:06.729> a<00:01:07.479> chromatic

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
effects like dust clouds and a chromatic

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.440 
effects like dust clouds and a chromatic
aberration<00:01:08.650> effect<00:01:08.950> essentially<00:01:09.550> that's

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
aberration effect essentially that's

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.910 
aberration effect essentially that's
color<00:01:10.780> distortion<00:01:11.350> at<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:11.500> edges<00:01:11.590> of<00:01:11.800> the

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
color distortion at the edges of the

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.859 
color distortion at the edges of the
screen<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:15.310> mostly<00:01:15.670> aesthetic<00:01:16.270> tweaks<00:01:16.570> then

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
screen it's mostly aesthetic tweaks then

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.749 
screen it's mostly aesthetic tweaks then
but<00:01:17.290> we<00:01:17.440> also<00:01:17.590> get<00:01:17.860> objects<00:01:18.310> added<00:01:18.400> to<00:01:18.670> the

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
but we also get objects added to the

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.280 
but we also get objects added to the
world<00:01:18.970> which<00:01:19.270> affects<00:01:19.660> the<00:01:19.810> way<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:20.110> game

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.859 
plays and as you can see here there's
pretty<00:01:24.340> much<00:01:24.490> no<00:01:24.850> difference<00:01:25.330> in<00:01:25.450> the<00:01:25.539> quality

pretty much no difference in the quality

pretty much no difference in the quality
or<00:01:25.990> reflections<00:01:26.560> but<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.670> big<00:01:27.850> change<00:01:28.090> comes

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420
