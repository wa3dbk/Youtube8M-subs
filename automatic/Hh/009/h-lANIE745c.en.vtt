00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.090
 rio de janeiro 2012 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.370
 on October 24 , there was a 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.559
 political manifestation against the increase 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.759
 bus tickets for 3 reais and 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.460
 five cents 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.810
 I went to register and now I'm going to tell 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.810
 my version of this story 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.220
 the mayor 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.440
 i is the local population 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.879
 It's going to be a struggle, Machico. I found the 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.610
 idea of ​​the transport situation of 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.790
 manifestation 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.199
 This fair manifestation is not only 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.630
 for support 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.939
 imagine that fighting for other things 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.950
 also wants health is forgotten and 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.770
 When you finish the world cup and 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.070
 Olympiad, that's it, you 'll keep looking. 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.110
 I was running well 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.110
 the people who passed were supporting 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.720
 the protest of that youth more than 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.299
 suddenly a guy started to lose the line 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.549
 in the middle of the gang and was a policeman who 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.729
 was shocking people 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.729
 the more offers that I got on youtube 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.590
 The people in the protest are to be congratulated. 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.319
 It's good that they managed to stay calm. 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.780
 tranquility and follow the manifestation of 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.250
 peaceful way and do not fall on the pile 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.679
 wrong that this guy has to implement 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.299
 of local violence 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.400
 he just stopped doing what he was doing 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:13.980
 doing when he realized that he was being 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.590
 filmed and felt intimidated 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.980
 the cameras have shown that they can be a 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.139
 great instrument of resistance 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.250
 peaceful self-defense in a demonstration 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.739
 politics 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.380
 however, the act was clear too 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:32.030
 that depending on the hand she has 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.030
 she is going to mtur 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.060
 daniel 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:02.840
 from there the galera left with the city ​​hall 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.840
 to talk about the passage increase 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.180
 the subject is transportation but the city hall 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.189
 instead of sending a secretary of 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.189
 transport sent the municipal guard 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:41.830
 the word of mouth and asked the military police 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.830
 reinforcement of the shock troops 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.099
 whoa to both the police 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.099
 subject is hand transport 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.769
 in the end everything went well 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.019
 The demonstration managed to close 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.299
 peaceful manner but since there was no 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.189
 the dialogue with the city hall on the value 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:14.310
 of the ticket price which was the motivation 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:16.859
 of protest all leads me to believe that 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.590
 new manifestations occurred then a 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.720
 story that is just beginning 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:26.539

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.539
