00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
know they could have either been specs

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.830 
know they could have either been specs
or<00:01:40.810> scarf<00:01:41.470> or<00:01:41.710> banded<00:01:42.070> you<00:01:42.250> know<00:01:42.430> all<00:01:42.940> them<00:01:43.300> but

or scarf or banded you know all them but

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.880 
or scarf or banded you know all them but
anyways<00:01:44.020> I'm<00:01:44.170> gonna<00:01:44.229> switch<00:01:44.440> out<00:01:44.619> because

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
anyways I'm gonna switch out because

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.530 
anyways I'm gonna switch out because
that<00:01:45.040> Meganium<00:01:45.430> is<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.729> best<00:01:46.000> thing<00:01:46.180> I<00:01:46.240> had<00:01:46.390> to

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
that Meganium is the best thing I had to

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.940 
that Meganium is the best thing I had to
take<00:01:46.660> that<00:01:46.869> so<00:01:47.080> I<00:01:47.110> really<00:01:47.470> have<00:01:47.560> to<00:01:47.650> watch<00:01:47.800> my

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
take that so I really have to watch my

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.190 
take that so I really have to watch my
game<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:48.400> obviously<00:01:49.150> the<00:01:49.570> switch<00:01:49.750> out<00:01:49.930> in

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
game and obviously the switch out in

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.920 
game and obviously the switch out in
shoe<00:01:50.560> his<00:01:51.000> breviary<00:01:52.000> is<00:01:52.270> pretty<00:01:52.540> obvious<00:01:52.690> but

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
shoe his breviary is pretty obvious but

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.380 
shoe his breviary is pretty obvious but
obviously<00:01:53.680> he's<00:01:54.009> gonna<00:01:54.160> keep<00:01:54.400> shuffling<00:01:55.060> me

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
obviously he's gonna keep shuffling me

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.730 
obviously he's gonna keep shuffling me
around<00:01:55.690> like<00:01:55.869> this<00:01:56.050> because<00:01:56.229> I<00:01:56.380> can't<00:01:56.619> do

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
around like this because I can't do

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.160 
around like this because I can't do
anything<00:01:56.830> to<00:01:57.130> him<00:01:57.300> but<00:01:58.300> right<00:01:58.810> here<00:01:58.930> i'm<00:01:59.050> gonna

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
anything to him but right here i'm gonna

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.990 
anything to him but right here i'm gonna
switch<00:01:59.320> out<00:01:59.560> in<00:01:59.800> Balham<00:02:00.280> along<00:02:00.580> because<00:02:00.850> I

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
switch out in Balham along because I

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.030 
switch out in Balham along because I
know<00:02:01.060> he's<00:02:01.330> would<00:02:01.479> eventually<00:02:01.810> start<00:02:02.050> doing

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
know he's would eventually start doing

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.440 
know he's would eventually start doing
something<00:02:03.250> else<00:02:03.520> i<00:02:03.670> guess<00:02:03.850> i<00:02:04.060> don't<00:02:04.119> know<00:02:04.270> i

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
something else i guess i don't know i

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.639 
something else i guess i don't know i
thought<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.930> brave<00:02:05.080> bird<00:02:05.320> was<00:02:05.440> pretty

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
thought the brave bird was pretty

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.560 
thought the brave bird was pretty
obvious<00:02:05.740> sister<00:02:06.250> and<00:02:06.550> I<00:02:06.910> thought<00:02:07.119> actually<00:02:07.360> go

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
obvious sister and I thought actually go

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.970 
regenerate her because you can see her
hairy<00:02:12.850> dog<00:02:13.000> for<00:02:13.269> generator<00:02:13.650> because<00:02:14.650> of

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
hairy dog for generator because of

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.560 
hairy dog for generator because of
Raiford<00:02:15.400> does<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:15.700> lot<00:02:15.850> of<00:02:15.910> damage<00:02:16.209> they're<00:02:16.450> not

Raiford does a lot of damage they're not
going<00:02:16.660> to<00:02:16.720> do<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:16.840> lot<00:02:17.019> to<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.650> point<00:02:17.890> where

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
going to do a lot to the point where

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.229

it's<00:02:18.070> gonna<00:02:18.130> take<00:02:18.340> me<00:02:18.459> out<00:02:18.550> so<00:02:18.790> obviously<00:02:19.090> i'm

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
it's gonna take me out so obviously i'm

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.220 
it's gonna take me out so obviously i'm
all<00:02:19.510> as<00:02:19.660> defensive<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:21.299> this<00:02:22.299> is<00:02:22.510> its<00:02:22.720> max<00:02:22.959> HP

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
all as defensive and this is its max HP

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.039 
all as defensive and this is its max HP
am<00:02:23.560> pretty<00:02:23.890> sure<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.130> is<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:25.090> obviously<00:02:25.570> yeah

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
am pretty sure it is and obviously yeah

am pretty sure it is and obviously yeah
i'm<00:02:26.200> gonna<00:02:26.290> switch<00:02:26.440> out<00:02:26.680> i'm<00:02:26.920> gonna<00:02:27.070> guess<00:02:27.519> i

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
i'm gonna switch out i'm gonna guess i

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.600 
i'm gonna switch out i'm gonna guess i
predicted<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.780> switch<00:02:29.530> or<00:02:29.769> something<00:02:29.920> into

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
predicted a switch or something into

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.420 
predicted a switch or something into
something<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:31.180> i<00:02:31.239> went<00:02:31.360> out<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.810> my<00:02:32.500> executor

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
but you know I can still speed next turn

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.700 
but you know I can still speed next turn
and<00:03:04.840> go<00:03:04.989> for<00:03:05.380> something<00:03:05.890> you

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
and if he now he has butterfree then is

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.650 
and if he now he has butterfree then is
probably<00:03:10.310> if<00:03:10.460> he<00:03:10.580> brings<00:03:10.760> in<00:03:10.820> if<00:03:11.150> it's<00:03:11.270> a<00:03:11.450> she's

another solar beam and I have to say
this<00:04:27.760> executor<00:04:28.760> just<00:04:29.240> because<00:04:29.810> you<00:04:29.930> didn't

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:32.809 
thunderbolt I shoulda kept this in mind
because<00:05:31.080> I<00:05:31.259> think<00:05:31.649> this<00:05:31.860> actually<00:05:32.159> specs

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:32.819 
because I think this actually specs

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:34.549 
because I think this actually specs
because<00:05:33.270> one<00:05:33.509> he's<00:05:33.809> gonna<00:05:33.959> get<00:05:34.139> a<00:05:34.169> crit<00:05:34.409> right

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:37.040 
because one he's gonna get a crit right
here<00:05:34.740> and<00:05:35.009> I<00:05:35.729> don't<00:05:36.300> know<00:05:36.419> if<00:05:36.509> that<00:05:36.659> frit

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
here and I don't know if that frit

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.619 
here and I don't know if that frit
because<00:05:37.889> I<00:05:37.979> know<00:05:38.039> that<00:05:38.520> Kurt<00:05:38.729> might<00:05:38.969> have<00:05:39.119> just

00:05:39.619 --> 00:05:39.629 
because I know that Kurt might have just

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:43.149 
because I know that Kurt might have just
mattered<00:05:40.259> barely<00:05:40.949> but<00:05:41.550> if<00:05:41.729> it<00:05:41.849> was<00:05:41.969> specs<00:05:42.389> um

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:43.159 
mattered barely but if it was specs um

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.889 
mattered barely but if it was specs um
then<00:05:44.159> it<00:05:44.339> would<00:05:44.490> probably<00:05:45.089> just<00:05:45.389> done<00:05:45.599> a<00:05:45.629> lot

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:45.899 
then it would probably just done a lot

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:47.329 
then it would probably just done a lot
of<00:05:45.929> damage<00:05:46.199> I<00:05:46.409> don't<00:05:46.559> know<00:05:46.619> if<00:05:46.709> I<00:05:46.800> take<00:05:47.009> me<00:05:47.189> out
