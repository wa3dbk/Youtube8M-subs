00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.830
 Hi guys, let's do the class here today. 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:22.119
 I needed the lightning in which it was a class 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.890
 very much requested by you is the 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.350
 very simple mala 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.810
 I'll show you an easy way to 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.750
 you use to do is up to 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.059
 repeated granddaughter remember then always 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.550
 bringing that proposal of making a 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:43.239
 simplified way for you to 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:47.140
 see time in the red this production're 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:54.120
 here's a 45-millimeter ball 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:57.780
 I will open so slightly chubby rolls 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.780
 rounded and it 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:06.400
 Then I'll calculate more or less here or 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.950
 in the very tips I will put my fingers and 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.490
 I'll squeeze and I'll spin but I will not 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.630
 I'll go and go back. 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.630
 and back 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.220
 from here and I'm going to start giving 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:32.170
 the format of the car here will be the 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:35.560
 Then I'll go down, I 'll go down and 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.899
 in the back where he has that 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.290
 I'm going to make a team and I'm going 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.290
 rise 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.360
 here in that part of the cart I'm going 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.399
 get some more up 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.170
 will make an affection here in mass're 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.710
 Seeing does not stay even finger markers 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:05.710
 nothing is done but light and goes 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:09.700
 disappearing right here in front of the mouse 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.700
 after we do the same thing 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.390
 there already gives stand aside 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.010
 so now we're just going to characterize 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.530
 I'll start by putting the little ones here. 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.170
 place where I fit the tire I go 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:59.660
 stick here with a scorer 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:59.660
 I'll squeeze the other side the same thing 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:02.530
 good people coming here this step is 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.439
 You see, I already put the headlight here. 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.650
 His smile back there too. 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:11.349
 I put it in the headlight here 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.840
 Glasses in the windows I open the 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:16.750
 mass so fine fininha you see it opens 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.090
 with roller always use that little house 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.479
 even the one you buy in 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.509
 any domestic utility store 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:28.509
 passes the furniture end opens very thin 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:31.360
 so with a roll and let dry here 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:33.639
 This rubber dva need not surround 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.820
 all not only let it dry a little 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:45.490
 firmer neighbor and we can cut 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:45.940
 is using a piece here and let it dry 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.520
 a little 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:53.830
 I think it gets easier, it gets more 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:57.660
 hard and then it gets easier and more 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:00.220
 or less in the tiny eye 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:04.840
 first on paper 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:06.940
 cut and then use this template as 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.970
 guide to cut dough does not have 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.729
 problem of the preference of each 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.830
 I'm a little bit of water with a cotton swab 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.430
 behind it I think it gets easier 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.430
 to paste 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.200
 to finish then now 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:17.080
 I'm going to paste a sticker using you 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.690
 report how much of this sticker already 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.220
 There are templates on the blog that day that 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.470
 you already know 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.840
 always reminding the person not to 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.840
 get and see the molds on the internet 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.930
 explorer tries to access by google 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.730
 chrome is the best browser to access 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:37.630
 the blog you can not see everything 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:42.750
 The same thing is also clipped using aa 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.750
 little treasure and I'll just paste
