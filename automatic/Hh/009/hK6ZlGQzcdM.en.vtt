becomes a full-fledged fruit each and
every<00:04:41.920> one<00:04:42.130> has<00:04:42.370> to<00:04:42.550> be<00:04:42.640> fertilized<00:04:43.150> yep<00:04:43.720> and

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
every one has to be fertilized yep and

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.600 
every one has to be fertilized yep and
that<00:04:43.960> fertilization<00:04:44.740> happens<00:04:44.920> when<00:04:45.280> pollen

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
that fertilization happens when pollen

anyhow<00:04:56.110> this<00:04:56.380> process<00:04:56.860> is<00:04:57.040> repeated<00:04:57.190> hundreds

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
anyhow this process is repeated hundreds

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.180 
anyhow this process is repeated hundreds
of<00:04:58.090> times<00:04:58.330> and<00:04:58.600> the<00:04:58.990> result<00:04:59.320> is<00:04:59.440> a<00:04:59.470> field<00:04:59.800> full

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
of times and the result is a field full

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.340 
of times and the result is a field full
of<00:05:00.340> blueberries<00:05:00.520> like<00:05:01.330> this<00:05:01.510> one<00:05:01.720> and<00:05:02.140> when

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
of blueberries like this one and when

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.690 
of blueberries like this one and when
you<00:05:02.470> plant<00:05:02.710> different<00:05:02.920> varieties<00:05:03.550> of

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
you plant different varieties of

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.580 
you plant different varieties of
blueberries<00:05:04.210> close<00:05:04.480> together<00:05:04.870> like<00:05:05.140> they<00:05:05.530> do

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
blueberries close together like they do

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.010 
blueberries close together like they do
here<00:05:06.040> this<00:05:06.400> reproductive<00:05:07.210> process<00:05:07.630> is<00:05:07.840> called

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
here this reproductive process is called

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.890 
here this reproductive process is called
cross<00:05:08.620> pollination<00:05:09.490> that<00:05:10.240> causes<00:05:10.750> more

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
cross pollination that causes more

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.990 
cross pollination that causes more
variation<00:05:11.560> in<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.770> berries<00:05:12.130> and<00:05:12.310> increases

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
variation in the berries and increases

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.820 
variation in the berries and increases
the<00:05:13.120> survival<00:05:13.330> rate<00:05:13.840> of<00:05:14.050> new<00:05:14.320> blueberry

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
the survival rate of new blueberry

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.130 
the survival rate of new blueberry
plants<00:05:15.250> and<00:05:15.610> that<00:05:15.880> means<00:05:16.090> better<00:05:16.510> blueberries

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
plants and that means better blueberries

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.380 
plants and that means better blueberries
for<00:05:17.320> you<00:05:17.670> we<00:05:18.670> now<00:05:18.820> return<00:05:19.000> you<00:05:19.150> to<00:05:19.300> your
