restaurant right so I what we have
perceptual<00:02:35.510> at<00:02:35.660> this<00:02:35.900> point<00:02:36.200> is<00:02:36.790> into<00:02:37.790> the

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
perceptual at this point is into the

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.880 
perceptual at this point is into the
back<00:02:38.060> this<00:02:38.600> you<00:02:38.750> can<00:02:38.930> see<00:02:39.080> how<00:02:39.200> narrow<00:02:39.470> this<00:02:39.680> is

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
back this you can see how narrow this is

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.710 
back this you can see how narrow this is
it<00:02:40.130> opens<00:02:40.550> right<00:02:40.610> up<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.120> ceilings<00:02:41.450> go<00:02:41.630> up

it opens right up and the ceilings go up

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.500 
it opens right up and the ceilings go up
to<00:02:41.870> almost<00:02:42.020> 23<00:02:42.560> so<00:02:43.190> they'll<00:02:43.970> be<00:02:44.090> banquette

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510
