00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
quickly is that what goes up must come

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.340 
quickly is that what goes up must come
down<00:00:56.270> so<00:00:57.270> if<00:00:57.390> I'm<00:00:57.539> going<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.870> bike<00:00:58.020> up<00:00:58.230> a

going<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.570> be<00:01:03.690> biking<00:01:03.930> over<00:01:04.589> lots<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.790> rocks

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
going to be biking over lots of rocks

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.500 
going to be biking over lots of rocks
and<00:01:06.840> roots<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:08.130> entire<00:01:08.520> state<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:08.939> covered<00:01:09.270> in
