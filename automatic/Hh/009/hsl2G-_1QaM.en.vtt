00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
solve it took a little while a few bits

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.160 
solve it took a little while a few bits
and<00:03:05.830> pieces<00:03:06.070> but<00:03:06.250> I<00:03:06.490> decided<00:03:07.000> I<00:03:07.450> devised<00:03:07.810> this

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
and pieces but I decided I devised this

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.900 
and pieces but I decided I devised this
thing<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:08.680> now<00:03:09.040> call<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.460> one-up<00:03:09.730> hair

time mm-hmm
and<00:03:12.210> basically<00:03:13.210> it's<00:03:13.600> an<00:03:13.690> example<00:03:13.990> I<00:03:14.590> can<00:03:15.340> do<00:03:15.520> a

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
and basically it's an example I can do a

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.280 
and basically it's an example I can do a
quick<00:03:16.030> demo<00:03:16.330> so<00:03:16.840> basically<00:03:18.000> make<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.030> loop<00:03:19.290> put

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
quick demo so basically make a loop put

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.350 
quick demo so basically make a loop put
it<00:03:20.380> over<00:03:20.500> your<00:03:20.680> head<00:03:20.860> your<00:03:21.730> hair<00:03:22.030> out<00:03:22.060> of<00:03:22.240> the
