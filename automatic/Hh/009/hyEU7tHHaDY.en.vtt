00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.000
 let's go back to the disaster of flight rio-paris a month ago 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.260
 investigators are still looking for the black boxes of the airbus he hopes 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.210
 that the signal continues after the normal 30 day delay but the depth in 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.250
 made very uncertain recovery the flight recorders could so do not 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.340
 never deliver their data determinant important to explain 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.100
 the accident which raises a debate in the era of satellite communications

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.140
 in the days following the accident of the flight of air france 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.780
 a comment it was while the right arm I can say that it's for 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.210
 the best since want to participate in the surveyed 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.789
 that the state does not think that technology has evolved

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.960

 when traces of a dvd cd land canada acec thérèse occur

 he leads a technical team 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.680
 who uses a flight data recorder 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.050
 to improve aircraft maintenance 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.050
 it goes fast and strong mcmurray better so I had a lot that bio 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.230
 starts to burn 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.040
 the dangerous dog stand for silent cinema to possible causes 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.850
 does this accident have to do with this accident occurred in November 1963 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.530
 remains one of the worst air tragedies in Canada but also the disaster that 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.430
 gave the idea donna registrar protect 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.660
 I too want my mom told me something that we do not buy anymore 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.660
 such documents in a crystal ball 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.840
 that could withstand fire a full shock of fallout from a 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.980
 apparatus 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.090
 and that would be recoverable and that we could say at the moment of mourning after 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.280
 the accident rest to have everything that had happened to the townspeople and 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.570
 the parameters today the regulation requires manufacturers there 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.010
 is a black box 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.899
 in all aircraft that carried more passengers and more 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:20.129
 that of things that happen I was terrified because 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.969
 the first is that its not less than 5 m 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:26.370
 and what become of those who still had cases like this maybe 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:28.179
 to find her not your planet 

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:30.579
 in the era of satellite communications 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.839
 devices allow today to transmit hand 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:38.969
 from 2000 tons aircraft to a base of interviews air france received 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:43.589
 twenty-four messages from his plane before the crash off the brazil 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.159
 I do not know anything less 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.429
 but the samu the palmashow area all this one can 

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:53.359
 some newsletters to see he had the palace was not far so we dream at 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:54.900
 system that would transmit 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.069
 all data 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.139
 he understood the GPS position 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.719
 as the l 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:02.719
 especially when the plane starts to fail 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.409
 two Canadian companies have been developing such systems 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:09.809
 but so great believe that this is the way of the future 

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:14.149
 he even chaired an advisory committee to avoid these systems 

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:15.469
 beyond dollars 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:17.529
 research of the causes of the accident 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:22.009
 of using this system to improve the man maintains a 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:24.039
 operation to no longer lend to vienna 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:27.759
 we can diagnose or more quickly the euro and relations on 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:30.759
 failures and those that allow precisely 

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:34.489
 to prepare the interview and when the device has had the power to closely 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:38.349
 the hour is the hour of play diagnose the problem we are talking about repair 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.389
 very low price this may be a way to justify an investment 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:44.829
 Éric fortin a difficult sector for air carriers 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:48.289
 around 50 thousand dollars per share 

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:51.379
 in addition to satellite transmission fees 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:54.599
 it's much more than a black box acquired but dallas 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.119
 we can see a higher at 5432 at 10 years old 

00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:01.400
 as we speak it is licensed air traffic controllers 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.290
 they put chains continue to follow what's going on in the seats 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.109
 it's a technology that goes their way in sleep and the old 

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:12.930
 for sandy and aircraft manufacturers by indulging in 

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:17.559
 we think of the police officers you want to install these systems on board 

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:18.350
 planes 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.780
 I think we're not a 2009 even present military 2005 and 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.090
 new planes 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.240
 should be equipped with these 3 me seemingly paris 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.249
 the subject was more suited to your project to the elected 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:32.490
 it still 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.460
 e3 his device will not cassandra alone that we can have the rating more 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.450
 do not take out your laundry it was he who was president of air canada in the 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:41.460
 90s 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.440
 he is director of the iata the international air transport association 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.090
 3 that strong governments will eventually be the carriers to 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.830
 move 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.880
 that happiness 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.650
 starting with the eu 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.850
 and give a certain amount of time to the industry to adapt and that's 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.410
 better than for the break think about the two days bringing the doctor photo mb the 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.610
 thomas text and would have weighed the month that just hit 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.259
 I think it's a good time 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.379
 better than the player does not get done a total beauty something 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:10.279
 we must do 

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:13.279
 to improve this situation 

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:21.809
 hanoï so wrote and a flight data transmission system is this 

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:24.839
 we will know more about the causes of the accident air france af 

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:29.029
 yes we talked to the representatives of the tests american canada cbc new 

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:31.680
 tracy system serata master of danys baez 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.580
 the factory in calgary and a thornton drive and the 204 astray that these 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.590
 the airbus had been plotted at 3 satellite data at this point in 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.120
 mars had a lot more about abbas failures but mostly selene 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.440
 from the beginning we managed with much more precision where the plane 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.599
 crashed 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.469
 so does that mean it's the end of the black boxes 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:55.469
 nf3 in the short to medium term because it remains a system that s 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:58.470
 worried could listen and it's mandatory 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.730
 and it is rare that we do not find flight recorders sometimes leaves 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:02.710
 bow down 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.310
 thanks to the satellite broadcast gaia kanata disaster 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.439
 Magny-cours 

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:11.199
 and he knew the system the limit also loaded but it's a safe bet 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:15.339
 that the carriers the manufacturers are going to want to have both the assessor 

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:18.339
 and the arms she commented 

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:21.259
 thank you for these precisions on the horizon a point
