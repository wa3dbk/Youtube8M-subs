are for so they're coming three drawers
each<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.320> i<00:01:04.409> think<00:01:04.439> they're<00:01:04.739> about<00:01:04.949> four

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309

envelope<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.520> like<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.790> said<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.119> got<00:01:57.240> all

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
envelope that like I said that got all

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.120 
envelope that like I said that got all
caught<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.079> they<00:01:58.140> were<00:01:58.200> not<00:01:58.439> sorted<00:01:59.009> out

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.090 
like you can see this punch here but
like<00:02:57.450> i<00:02:57.570> just<00:02:57.600> if<00:02:58.170> it's<00:02:58.350> a<00:02:58.440> waste<00:02:58.770> of<00:02:58.920> paper

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
like i just if it's a waste of paper

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.340 
like i just if it's a waste of paper
like<00:02:59.640> if<00:02:59.790> something<00:03:00.030> can't<00:03:00.510> be<00:03:00.570> used<00:03:00.810> in<00:03:01.020> area

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
like if something can't be used in area

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.690 
like if something can't be used in area
so<00:03:01.500> i'll<00:03:01.590> just<00:03:01.620> trim<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.100> off<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.400> keep<00:03:02.580> it

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
so i'll just trim that off to keep it

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.370 
so i'll just trim that off to keep it
neat<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:02.880> just<00:03:03.570> throw<00:03:03.750> them<00:03:03.930> in<00:03:04.080> there<00:03:04.200> but

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
neat and just throw them in there but

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.199 
neat and just throw them in there but
you<00:03:04.500> don't<00:03:04.650> even<00:03:04.739> have<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:04.980> do<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:06.000> that

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
you don't even have to do that and that

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.699 
you don't even have to do that and that
just<00:03:06.360> keeps<00:03:06.600> it<00:03:06.720> really<00:03:06.870> nice<00:03:07.140> for<00:03:07.410> a<00:03:07.440> mitt<00:03:07.680> and

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
just keeps it really nice for a mitt and

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.460 
just keeps it really nice for a mitt and
