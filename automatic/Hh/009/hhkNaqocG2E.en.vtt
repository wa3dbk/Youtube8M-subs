00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 the semu of May 13 the college of 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.000
 medicine has created a discipline 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.349
 of common hiatus for the students of the 2nd year 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.299
 the university challenges in 50 hours 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:18.090
 curriculum students is to integrate in 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:23.519
 institutions and take on the role of 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.740
 of volunteers could well be 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.529
 employees of the port but are 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.330
 students of 2nd year medical spent 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.790
 volunteering with the title in 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.790
 optional the chair of social formation 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.280
 that took future doctors from the 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.280
 university and we take others to 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.719
 scenarios closer to reality 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.969
 was in the second year when the pib 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.879
 that this camera will have a 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.969
 optional I chose this galley soon 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.190
 because it 's a career out of context 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.579
 of the others gave us much more freedom 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.980
 and was a break and it's something I 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.430
 I can make a triangle and association with 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.750
 paste and help even the average was great 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.909
 it was very important for us to have this 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.439
 chair is a mere contact 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.720
 different way with people 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.610
 interact much more and therefore each 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.799
 side a list with names and it is also 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.960
 very important is the discipline of 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.700
 social training and human challenge to 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.009
 young people to integrate in a curricular plan 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.470
 50 hours of volunteering during a 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.060
 half of the list of institutions that 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.670
 part of the volunteer fellowship of 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.189
 medical school are part of several 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.140
 organizations such as the world's 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.900
 food bank against hunger support 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.020
 to the elderly and others 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.119
 the strategy was to make another type of 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.840
 an extracurricular activity as well as 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:46.320
 volunteering only this Wednesday 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.570
 won the right impulse that I was without 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.390
 priest ari and soon it ended up 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.799
 help in this city a way of 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.380
 transport medicine students 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.689

 discipline is only available for the 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.909
 second year of the course but the goal is
