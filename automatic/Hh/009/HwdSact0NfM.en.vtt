 meeting only groups in the program 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.220

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.810
 5 unfortunately for lack of starters we 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.949

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.340
 underneath but with a batch of 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.859
 quality 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.180
 yes it's true there are four groups 1 this 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.469
 Sunday in vincennes is the most beautiful

 meeting of the year simply 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.710

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.809
 rené ballière unfortunately they do not 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.920
 are that round good there in any case that 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.079
 remains a very beautiful test is 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.180
 logically dhr not too much out of 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.280
 nails we'll try we'll already see that 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.070

 perrine this royal valve the cese 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.489
 scarlett sorghum on the 8th tina johnny on the 11th 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.600
 hat the 5th is fine and finally the 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.730
 number 10 burgos 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.250
 we are going to start with a logical fight with 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.020
 your favorite number 4 perkins claw that 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.280
 has just reconnected with success on this 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.260
 course it was in the price of because if 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.790
 we're going to watch a reference race for 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.720
 it was the prize of combrée May 2 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.040
 latest 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.360
 we will see a star perrine who will 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.189
 to prevail we will talk about it a little bit 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.320
 later perkins that will break 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.869
 second is a little further we will see 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.000
 v to duvivier who will rank fifth 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.439
 quite not that day the ser perry 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.340
 had not made a big impression of one and 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.310
 km 11 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.049
 now my horse perkins he was doing 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.329
 also something because he was born 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.920
 to the wind in the climb and despite everything 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.659
 went to the pole he regained 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.979
 field on leicester perrine i find 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.350
 that he realizes is really a big 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.479
 perf that day plus one for nothing 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.649
 hide you I hesitated between two three 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.329
 choice for pole position 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.130
 franck nivard had been also 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.140
 called for driver leicester perrine he 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.540
 found in the perkins sulky claw 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.340
 the horse is full and more 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.020
 a horse that starts slowly enough and 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.640
 I really think that franck nivard can 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.930
 to be an asset franck nivard for 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.890
 start the choices in vincennes ya not 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.259
 better I think today 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.939
 so no I still see him continue his 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.500
 good series wanted to oppose 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.420
 we will just talk about this issue 3 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.649
 us at perrine who just tweaked her 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.940
 form it was in the province with a 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.310
 sixth place it was his coach 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.050
 peet 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.940
 hull who was waiting for jean michel bazire 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.880
 jean michel bazire will surely be the 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.010
 royal so we called on another 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.349
 driver does not prevent you from having 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.640
 trust yeah of course so that's for sure 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.959
 if it had been jean michel bazire I 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.790
 think I would not have hesitated I would have 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.920
 put up now this list rpr 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.900
 it remains a bit complicated so it's 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.099
 for that that françois lagadeuc will have more 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.840
 beware that jean michel bazire he 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.970
 know by heart now the need 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.190
 really full pot right now and 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.330
 trots like the last codou 7.1 on 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.950
 the 2007 of the big track 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.090
 we'll see some choices that will try 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.799
 to make the distance is not going to be 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.569
 easy if he manages to repeat a chrono 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.190
 ok bah like what we will see what 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.780
 think precisely this jean michel benoit 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.670
 since baudoin pardon daddy doc 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.690
 beaudoin since someone in the tale has it 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.690
 attached to the phone we listen to them 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.560
 accomplices and trust that m 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.390
 yes it is the trust to after jean 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.400
 michel baudouin dixon summer goals 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.980
 it will be the price of london trot riding 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.849
 so this more than that I put it that 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.010
 second position 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.630
 agree between positions number 7 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.620
 valleys royal jean-michel bazire one in 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.510
 spoke just now who just 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.580
 reconnect with success in laval 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.739
 a small flat the big track is 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.000
 really his thing bah it's true that if 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.440
 we look a little at his stats on 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.480
 long runs of the big track there 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.069
 never won in time on the course 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.200
 President ran twice twice 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.220
 he took the accessits to laval was 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.660
 still pretty impressive 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.769
 from afar he resists 20.6 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.239
 vinci Abbey of the ball that 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.519
 will find Sunday in the price rené 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.230
 baller all the same now it's 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.310
 true that great track for me is a 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.410
 choice that there is a lot of pace that 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.610
 can toil a bit and more for 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.690
 nothing hide you I got a little 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.640
 looking at his program 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.080
 the 4th of july in enghien he could 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.580
 choir at the sleeve but for that 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.180
 they should not be better than 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.920
 third 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.840
 so I put it third I said 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.920
 than a 3rd beaten by my two favorite 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.810
 after he runs the price of the sleeve 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.280
 it's magic flat slopes enghien 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.290
 here we do some mathematics 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.169
 and makes his ads and fourth 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.180
 position the 16 turgot then 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.430
 I give it she is at the top el hadj 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.780
 won no less than five fifth + 5.5 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.789
 since the beginning of her career she has 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.990
 transforms into a scene 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.190
 I personally would have clearly 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.500
 that these blues have now their 25 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.150
 m I think to win in this 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.440
 test for scarlett turgot it takes 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.870
 trotting a price clock of america 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.520
 maybe a little 12 10 12 on the layout 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.900
 so I love working turgot scarlets 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.560
 she is a wonderful mare in vincennes 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.120
 to be together 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.700
 she just matched with custines 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.260
 of duvivier now in addition it is the 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.030
 only who for me can make the finish 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.039
 of May 25th so maybe while they 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.090
 make the effort alone a risk 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.380
 maybe to blow a little bit 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.360
 now I think for places 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.010
 it will take the web during this 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.600
 we think eric raffin since jean 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.190
 françois meyer met him 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.110
 he is talking to us about this issue 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:04.360
 this is only the turbo listening 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.190
 it is true that those Muslims who 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.920
 full possession of his means as soon as 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.450
 that she manages to advance to be together 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.100
 discover it once again a beautiful 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.680
 commitment 25 meters has never been 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.450
 more obvious it's but it's in its 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.800
 category at the first rung and a shock 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.870
 like valorial that in great shape 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.510
 so the task is not easy 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.770
 but the mare so she forms a 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.880
 moment that I think it's a very 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.170
 good base 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.370
 a very good game base eric raffin 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.870
 love it good it makes sense we go without 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.980
 distrust is the only one who like you 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.600
 said it to the 25 meters the German 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.180
 should be able to make the finish 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.380
 we will go to number 8 tina joly who 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.020
 just shaking up big progress at 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.640
 the occasion of the pythia price of 1500 m on 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.560
 her momentum she too she takes a 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.970
 little place ben quite I think 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.380
 that they simply run the 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.180
 best value of his career in 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.330
 Finally because she tickles and 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.160
 still to finish united bac who the 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.660
 varies 25 meters but if he was gone 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.400
 in the lead will be the favorite of the 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.630
 whole France because it's clear so at 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.630
 the rat 17 values ​​it's a whole 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.680
 first chance is a mare 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.320
 valiant who does all her shopping 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.700
 no I think it makes sense to 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.160
 expect a good result anyway 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.050
 for places ok alexandre thanks for 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.640
 all this information we will conclude with a 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.060
 little nugget during this magnificent 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.550
 meeting 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.230
 yeah it's true that I did not take any 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.580
 nuggets in a classic race I 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.290
 preferred to try a little bit in a price 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.060
 in series it will be in the first race 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.800
 baccarat last of the loans 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.000
 marches 14.2 on the 2007 of the great 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.590
 track there he was one of the first four 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.270
 times what makes me think he can 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.070
 to walk a little 14 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.090
 I think if he walks a little 14 to 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.420
 must be strong anyway for the 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.730
 forestall
