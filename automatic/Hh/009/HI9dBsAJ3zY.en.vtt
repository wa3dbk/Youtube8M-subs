00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210 

I'm<00:00:00.149> going<00:00:00.420> to<00:00:00.510> show<00:00:00.690> you<00:00:00.750> how<00:00:01.020> to<00:00:01.050> trace<00:00:01.890> this

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
I'm going to show you how to trace this

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.400 
I'm going to show you how to trace this
multiple<00:00:02.760> color<00:00:03.030> logo<00:00:03.300> so<00:00:03.629> that<00:00:03.659> you<00:00:03.899> have<00:00:04.140> all

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
multiple color logo so that you have all

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.800 
multiple color logo so that you have all
of<00:00:04.680> your<00:00:04.980> colors<00:00:05.460> traced<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.270> all<00:00:06.540> of<00:00:06.690> your

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
of your colors traced and all of your

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.930 
of your colors traced and all of your
vector<00:00:07.170> lines<00:00:07.500> so<00:00:08.220> I'm<00:00:08.309> using<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.670> free<00:00:08.910> program

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
vector lines so I'm using a free program

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.720 
vector lines so I'm using a free program
to<00:00:09.570> do<00:00:09.690> this<00:00:09.929> it's<00:00:10.200> called<00:00:10.440> Inkscape<00:00:11.219> I'll

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
to do this it's called Inkscape I'll

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.940 
to do this it's called Inkscape I'll
provide<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.300> download<00:00:12.750> link<00:00:13.290> so<00:00:13.380> that<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.769> can

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
provide a download link so that you can

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:14.480 
provide a download link so that you can
download

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
download

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.760 
download
Inkscape<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.269> use<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.599> just<00:00:16.289> download

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
Inkscape and use it just download

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.590 
Inkscape and use it just download
install<00:00:17.220> I've<00:00:17.580> already<00:00:17.850> done<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.510> I've

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
install I've already done that and I've

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.810 
install I've already done that and I've
opened<00:00:18.869> up<00:00:19.140> my<00:00:19.199> image<00:00:19.710> file<00:00:20.010> here<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.520> want

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
opened up my image file here that I want

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.670 
opened up my image file here that I want
to<00:00:20.880> trace<00:00:21.240> now<00:00:21.539> I'm<00:00:21.720> using<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.170> file<00:00:22.410> because

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
to trace now I'm using this file because

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.950 
to trace now I'm using this file because
it's<00:00:23.010> multiple<00:00:23.430> colors<00:00:23.760> it's<00:00:24.600> not<00:00:24.689> too

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
it's multiple colors it's not too

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.410 
it's multiple colors it's not too
complicated<00:00:25.350> but<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.859> does<00:00:26.039> have<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.150> part

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
complicated but it does have this part

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.410 
complicated but it does have this part
with<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.689> teeth<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.410> definitely<00:00:29.269> adds<00:00:30.269> a

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
with the teeth that definitely adds a

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.139 
with the teeth that definitely adds a
layer<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.779> complexity<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.460> here<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.640> my<00:00:32.820> image

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
layer of complexity so here is my image

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.389 
layer of complexity so here is my image
I've<00:00:33.300> opened<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:34.020> Inkscape<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:35.010> open<00:00:35.280> an

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
I've opened it in Inkscape to open an

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.160 
I've opened it in Inkscape to open an
image<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.760> would<00:00:35.850> go<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.030> file<00:00:36.329> open<00:00:36.600> select

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
image you would go to file open select

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.760 
image you would go to file open select
your<00:00:37.380> image<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.430> just<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.790> jpg<00:00:39.329> image<00:00:39.770> now

select it when it's not selected you
won't<00:00:46.410> see<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.800> box<00:00:47.550> around<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.149> I'll

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
won't see this box around it so I'll

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.150 
won't see this box around it so I'll
click<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.780> image<00:00:49.110> that'll<00:00:49.500> select<00:00:49.829> it

I'll<00:00:50.489> head<00:00:50.730> over<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.180> path<00:00:51.570> trace<00:00:52.440> bitmap

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
I'll head over to path trace bitmap

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.729 
I'll head over to path trace bitmap
that'll<00:00:53.399> bring<00:00:53.550> up<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:54.000> dialog<00:00:54.690> box<00:00:55.020> now<00:00:55.260> a

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
that'll bring up this dialog box now a

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.740 
that'll bring up this dialog box now a
lot<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.399> people<00:00:56.670> ask<00:00:56.850> me<00:00:57.059> questions<00:00:57.180> how<00:00:57.570> do<00:00:57.629> i

lot of people ask me questions how do i
trace<00:00:58.079> colors<00:00:58.469> because<00:00:58.920> if<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.370> were<00:00:59.579> just

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
trace colors because if you were just

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.029 
trace colors because if you were just
tracing<00:01:00.539> black<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.020> white<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.739> don't<00:01:01.920> need

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
tracing black and white you don't need

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.830 
tracing black and white you don't need
to<00:01:02.129> touch<00:01:02.340> any<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.699> these<00:01:02.820> settings<00:01:03.300> but

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
to touch any of these settings but

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.750 
to touch any of these settings but
because<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.290> have<00:01:04.379> colors<00:01:04.890> we're<00:01:05.460> going<00:01:05.670> to

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
because we have colors we're going to

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.820 
because we have colors we're going to
select<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.210> colors<00:01:06.750> radio<00:01:07.229> button<00:01:07.590> down<00:01:07.799> here

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
select the colors radio button down here

the scans
box<00:01:12.479> scans<00:01:13.140> basically<00:01:13.740> represents<00:01:14.400> the

box scans basically represents the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.450 
box scans basically represents the
number<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.240> colors<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:15.990> want<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.770> have

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
number of colors that we want so I have

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.289 
number of colors that we want so I have
if<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.119> count<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.659> colors<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:20.490> skulls<00:01:20.939> I

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
if you count the colors of the skulls I

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.600 
if you count the colors of the skulls I
have<00:01:21.450> five<00:01:21.720> colors<00:01:22.049> but<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.250> don't<00:01:23.430> want<00:01:23.580> to

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
have five colors but we don't want to

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.570 
have five colors but we don't want to
forget<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.030> black<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.110> would<00:01:25.229> be<00:01:25.380> six<00:01:25.710> so

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
forget the black so that would be six so

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.440 
forget the black so that would be six so
let's<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:27.180> enter<00:01:28.159> six<00:01:29.159> here<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.610> before<00:01:30.299> we

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
let's just enter six here and before we

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.719 
let's just enter six here and before we
do<00:01:30.570> anything<00:01:30.930> we'll<00:01:31.079> click<00:01:31.320> update<00:01:31.770> now<00:01:32.549> when

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
do anything we'll click update now when

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.149 
do anything we'll click update now when
we<00:01:32.850> click<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.210> update<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.900> will<00:01:34.439> generate<00:01:34.979> a

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
we click on update it will generate a

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.359 
we click on update it will generate a
preview<00:01:35.820> here<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:37.380> preview<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.100> not

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
preview here and that preview is not

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.530 
preview here and that preview is not
what<00:01:38.610> I'm<00:01:38.700> looking<00:01:38.850> for<00:01:39.270> what<00:01:39.390> I'm<00:01:39.450> looking

so to get closer to that right here to

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.499 
so to get closer to that right here to
get<00:01:46.229> closer<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.829> I'm<00:01:47.250> going<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:48.000> increase

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
get closer to this I'm going to increase

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.810 
get closer to this I'm going to increase
this<00:01:48.840> number<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.619> little<00:01:49.829> bit

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
this number just a little bit

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.150 
this number just a little bit
and<00:01:51.910> as<00:01:52.270> I<00:01:52.300> increase<00:01:52.690> it<00:01:53.170> you<00:01:53.380> can<00:01:53.560> see<00:01:53.800> that<00:01:54.040> it

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
and as I increase it you can see that it

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.900 
and as I increase it you can see that it
will<00:01:54.670> change<00:01:55.590> my<00:01:56.590> preview<00:01:56.980> so<00:01:57.370> my<00:01:57.550> preview

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
will change my preview so my preview

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.320 
will change my preview so my preview
still<00:01:58.300> isn't<00:01:59.340> exactly<00:02:00.340> how<00:02:00.460> I<00:02:00.490> want<00:02:00.820> it<00:02:00.910> to<00:02:01.000> be

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
still isn't exactly how I want it to be

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.060 
still isn't exactly how I want it to be
I'll<00:02:01.510> just<00:02:01.750> bump<00:02:02.110> this<00:02:02.290> up<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.590> little<00:02:02.650> bit<00:02:02.800> more

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
I'll just bump this up a little bit more

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.670

I want to simplify this trace to the

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.850 
I want to simplify this trace to the

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
Illustrator just to show you what it

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.650 
Illustrator just to show you what it
looks<00:05:49.800> like<00:05:50.630> now<00:05:51.630> I'm<00:05:51.810> just<00:05:52.050> left<00:05:52.289> with<00:05:53.660> the

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
looks like now I'm just left with the

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.110 
looks like now I'm just left with the
paths<00:05:54.900> for<00:05:55.530> the<00:05:55.860> graphic<00:05:56.280> I<00:05:56.490> don't<00:05:56.760> have<00:05:56.970> the

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
paths for the graphic I don't have the

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.520 
paths for the graphic I don't have the
background<00:05:57.360> I<00:05:57.750> don't<00:05:57.900> need<00:05:57.990> the<00:05:58.110> background

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
background I don't need the background

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.710 
background I don't need the background
this<00:05:58.710> is<00:05:58.770> really<00:05:59.130> all<00:05:59.310> I<00:05:59.340> need<00:05:59.520> you<00:06:00.389> can<00:06:00.510> see

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
this is really all I need you can see

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.279 
this is really all I need you can see
that<00:06:00.930> it

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.289 
that it

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:04.820 
that it
it<00:06:02.800> traced<00:06:03.159> it<00:06:03.369> really<00:06:03.610> well<00:06:03.789> if<00:06:04.059> you<00:06:04.360> ask<00:06:04.509> me

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
it traced it really well if you ask me

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.409 
it traced it really well if you ask me
and<00:06:05.830> that's<00:06:06.069> why<00:06:06.249> I<00:06:06.279> like<00:06:06.490> Inkscape<00:06:07.059> that's

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
and that's why I like Inkscape that's

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:09.619 
and that's why I like Inkscape that's
why<00:06:07.539> I<00:06:07.599> think<00:06:08.289> Inkscape<00:06:08.710> is<00:06:08.800> a<00:06:08.860> great<00:06:09.039> program

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:09.629 
why I think Inkscape is a great program

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:12.149 
why I think Inkscape is a great program
because<00:06:10.629> it's<00:06:10.779> free<00:06:10.990> and<00:06:11.199> it<00:06:11.499> traces<00:06:11.830> this

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:12.159 
because it's free and it traces this

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:14.189 
because it's free and it traces this
stuff<00:06:12.430> really<00:06:12.639> well<00:06:12.879> so<00:06:13.210> that's<00:06:13.960> how<00:06:14.139> you

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 
stuff really well so that's how you

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:16.529 
stuff really well so that's how you
would<00:06:14.379> trace<00:06:14.649> a<00:06:14.889> multiple<00:06:15.520> color<00:06:15.759> logo<00:06:16.210> that's

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:16.539 
would trace a multiple color logo that's

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:18.299 
would trace a multiple color logo that's
the<00:06:16.809> easiest<00:06:17.110> way<00:06:17.349> that<00:06:17.379> I<00:06:17.589> know<00:06:17.710> how<00:06:17.919> to<00:06:17.949> do<00:06:18.189> it

00:06:18.299 --> 00:06:18.309 
the easiest way that I know how to do it

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:20.579 
the easiest way that I know how to do it
and<00:06:18.460> I<00:06:19.270> think<00:06:19.449> the<00:06:19.689> results<00:06:20.080> are<00:06:20.139> acceptable

00:06:20.579 --> 00:06:20.589 
and I think the results are acceptable

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:23.249 
and I think the results are acceptable
so<00:06:21.279> if<00:06:21.639> you<00:06:21.789> liked<00:06:22.029> this<00:06:22.210> video<00:06:22.389> leave<00:06:23.020> me<00:06:23.050> a
