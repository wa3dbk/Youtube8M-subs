00:05:52.279 --> 00:06:00.249 
thinking I just just put them randomly
in<00:05:53.279> the<00:05:54.919> just<00:05:55.919> random<00:05:56.279> in<00:05:56.369> the<00:05:56.459> part<00:05:57.019> as<00:05:58.019> like<00:05:58.589> a

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:00.259 
in the just random in the part as like a

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:05.509 
in the just random in the part as like a
stone<00:06:01.259> walkway<00:06:01.559> or<00:06:03.229> something<00:06:04.229> I<00:06:04.469> also<00:06:05.189> have
