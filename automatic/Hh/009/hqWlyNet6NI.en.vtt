differently than you used to and you

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.540 
differently than you used to and you

didn't have children first thing you

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.220 
didn't have children first thing you
need<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.730> consider<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.960> need<00:00:22.109> to

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
need to consider is that you need to

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.920 
need to consider is that you need to
adjust<00:00:22.350> your<00:00:22.800> goals<00:00:23.220> because<00:00:23.820> obviously<00:00:24.180> if

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
adjust your goals because obviously if

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.900 
adjust your goals because obviously if
you<00:00:25.050> have<00:00:25.170> little<00:00:25.470> people<00:00:25.650> with<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.220> you're

you have little people with you you're

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.480 
you have little people with you you're
going<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.150> be<00:00:27.300> going<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.689> lot<00:00:27.720> slower<00:00:28.490> you're

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
going to be going a lot slower you're

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.519 
going to be going a lot slower you're
not<00:00:29.730> going<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.939> be<00:00:30.060> able<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.990> go<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.320> is

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
not going to be able to go on is

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.430 
not going to be able to go on is
intensive<00:00:32.189> terrain<00:00:33.079> and<00:00:34.079> you're<00:00:34.230> not<00:00:34.320> going

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
intensive terrain and you're not going

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.080 
intensive terrain and you're not going
to<00:00:34.500> be<00:00:34.590> able<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.860> give<00:00:35.040> far<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.790> need<00:00:35.969> to

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
to be able to give far so you need to

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.660 
to be able to give far so you need to
evaluate<00:00:36.559> where<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.710> want<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.010> go<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.460> set

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
evaluate where you want to go and set

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.970 
evaluate where you want to go and set
your<00:00:38.790> family<00:00:39.210> up<00:00:39.300> for<00:00:39.510> success<00:00:40.050> by<00:00:40.770> not

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
your family up for success by not

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.700 
your family up for success by not
planning<00:00:41.460> such<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> huge<00:00:42.239> trip<00:00:42.780> just<00:00:43.469> knowing

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
planning such a huge trip just knowing

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.610 
planning such a huge trip just knowing
that<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.070> might<00:00:44.100> hike<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.910> half<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.989> mile<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.500> an

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
that you might hike a half a mile in an

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.400 
that you might hike a half a mile in an
hour<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.610> might<00:00:47.789> take<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.329> long<00:00:48.410> to

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
hour so it might take you that long to

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.619 
hour so it might take you that long to
get<00:00:49.860> there<00:00:50.100> since<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.820> little<00:00:51.449> people

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
get there since you have little people

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.130 
get there since you have little people
that<00:00:51.960> are<00:00:52.110> either<00:00:52.440> being<00:00:52.980> carried<00:00:53.430> by<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.629> or

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
that are either being carried by you or

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.590 
that are either being carried by you or
they're<00:00:55.590> walking<00:00:55.980> very<00:00:56.160> slowly<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:57.329> amount

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
they're walking very slowly the amount

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.349 
they're walking very slowly the amount
of<00:00:57.780> gear<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.469> also<00:00:58.829> obviously<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.670> huge<00:00:59.969> factor

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
of gear is also obviously a huge factor

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.150 
of gear is also obviously a huge factor
when<00:01:00.899> children<00:01:01.289> come<00:01:01.500> into<00:01:01.680> your<00:01:01.800> life<00:01:01.949> you

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
when children come into your life you

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.479 
when children come into your life you
have<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.309> have<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> lot<00:01:02.969> more<00:01:03.000> stuff<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.530> you

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
have to have a lot more stuff and so you

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.190 
have to have a lot more stuff and so you
know<00:01:05.519> you're<00:01:05.909> going<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.119> either<00:01:06.299> be<00:01:06.450> carrying

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
know you're going to either be carrying

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.120 
know you're going to either be carrying
the<00:01:07.619> child's<00:01:08.130> gear<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.150> child<00:01:09.390> or<00:01:10.130> just

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the child's gear and the child or just

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.320 
the child's gear and the child or just
the<00:01:11.220> child's<00:01:11.640> gear<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.030> you're<00:01:12.210> probably

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
the child's gear so you're probably

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.929 
the child's gear so you're probably
enough<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.780> pull<00:01:12.990> out<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.500> big<00:01:14.040> ol<00:01:14.310> six

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
backpacking with their children is to

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.780 
backpacking with their children is to
remember<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.710> kids<00:01:37.979> are<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> lot<00:01:38.460> closer

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
remember that the kids are a lot closer

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.240 
remember that the kids are a lot closer
to<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.180> ground<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.869> challenge<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.799> parents<00:01:41.159> to
