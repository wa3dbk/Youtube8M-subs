what you're doing when you're when you
are<00:00:23.850> boat<00:00:24.090> hopping<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.779> are<00:00:24.930> negating<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
are boat hopping is you are negating the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.279 
are boat hopping is you are negating the
need<00:00:25.980> for<00:00:26.220> acceleration<00:00:26.970> on<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.300> boat<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.109> so

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
need for acceleration on a boat so so

long as your boat is over ninety five
movement<00:00:31.500> speed<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.579> fastest<00:00:33.510> way

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
movement speed it is the fastest way

is<00:00:41.489> my<00:00:41.640> fastest<00:00:42.239> boats<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.690> game<00:00:42.840> if<00:00:43.020> not

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
is my fastest boats in the game if not

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.610 
is my fastest boats in the game if not
the<00:00:43.500> fastest<00:00:44.100> right<00:00:44.820> beside<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:46.020> one<00:00:46.469> that

the fastest right beside the one that

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.110 
the fastest right beside the one that
you<00:00:46.739> get<00:00:46.860> from<00:00:47.039> mastery<00:00:47.520> now<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.760> way<00:00:47.940> that

you get from mastery now the way that
this<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.360> going<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.629> work<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.350> extremely

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
this is going to work is it is extremely

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.220 
this is going to work is it is extremely
simple<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> bit<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.360> gallop<00:00:51.780> all

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
simple it is a bit of a gallop all

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.630 
simple it is a bit of a gallop all
you're<00:00:52.440> going<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.710> want<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.949> do<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.280> hold

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
you're going to want to do is hold

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.299 
you're going to want to do is hold
forward<00:00:54.059> or<00:00:54.719> just<00:00:55.170> start<00:00:55.410> Auto<00:00:55.620> walking<00:00:56.160> and

forward or just start Auto walking and

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.130 
forward or just start Auto walking and
then<00:00:56.460> when<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.300> gallop<00:00:57.719> between

then when you do it's a gallop between

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.799 
then when you do it's a gallop between
pressing<00:00:58.620> space<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.520> jump<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.000> pressing<00:01:00.719> your

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
jump boat and as we're up here it might

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.060 
jump boat and as we're up here it might
not<00:01:06.090> look<00:01:06.299> like<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.689> be<00:01:06.810> or<00:01:06.960> what<00:01:07.320> but<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.920> are

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
not look like it be or what but we are

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.010 
not look like it be or what but we are
actually<00:01:08.280> moving<00:01:08.760> at<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> hundred<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.570> forty

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
actually moving at a hundred and forty

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.800 
actually moving at a hundred and forty
movement<00:01:10.439> speed<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.799> as<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.040> can<00:01:11.159> see<00:01:11.220> we<00:01:11.490> are

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
movement speed and as you can see we are

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.050 
movement speed and as you can see we are
vastly<00:01:12.810> outrunning<00:01:13.560> people<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.460> have<00:01:14.700> wings

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
vastly outrunning people that have wings

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.030 
vastly outrunning people that have wings
and<00:01:15.360> everything<00:01:15.420> like<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.830> be

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
and everything like that this can be

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.969 
and everything like that this can be
used<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.549> all<00:01:17.939> sorts<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.420> different<00:01:18.600> ways<00:01:18.979> you

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
used in all sorts of different ways you

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.499 
used in all sorts of different ways you
know<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.460> use<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.030> go<00:01:21.210> from

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
know you can use it just to go from

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.300 
know you can use it just to go from
dungeon<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.960> dungeon<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.650> can<00:01:22.799> use<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.100> even

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
dungeon to dungeon you can use it even

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.830 
dungeon to dungeon you can use it even
just<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.580> get<00:01:23.700> across<00:01:24.000> little<00:01:24.270> peaks<00:01:24.600> like

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
just to get across little peaks like

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.410 
just to get across little peaks like
this<00:01:25.110> where<00:01:25.380> let's<00:01:26.159> just<00:01:26.400> say<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:27.150> wouldn't

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
this where let's just say you wouldn't

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.060 
this where let's just say you wouldn't
have<00:01:27.570> enough<00:01:27.810> jump<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.290> actually<00:01:28.650> get<00:01:28.799> across

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
have enough jump to actually get across

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.950 
have enough jump to actually get across
this<00:01:29.340> because<00:01:29.880> boat<00:01:30.119> hopping<00:01:30.540> makes<00:01:30.750> you

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
this because boat hopping makes you

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.980 
this because boat hopping makes you
travel<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.979> lot<00:01:32.549> more<00:01:32.790> distance<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.600> lot<00:01:33.780> less

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
travel a lot more distance in a lot less

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.719 
travel a lot more distance in a lot less
time<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:34.979> get<00:01:35.100> away<00:01:35.220> with<00:01:35.549> having

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
time so you can get away with having

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.990 
time so you can get away with having
