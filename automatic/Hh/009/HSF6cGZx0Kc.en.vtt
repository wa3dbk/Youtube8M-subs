can do for you you may have noticed on
one<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.080> my<00:00:13.230> previous<00:00:13.440> videos<00:00:13.710> which<00:00:14.580> describe

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
one of my previous videos which describe

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.300 
one of my previous videos which describe
the<00:00:15.269> memory<00:00:15.450> locks<00:00:15.809> on<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.529> symbol<00:00:16.859> stand<00:00:17.100> is

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
the memory locks on a symbol stand is

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.910 
the memory locks on a symbol stand is
that<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.180> symbol<00:00:18.539> stands<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.320> marked<00:00:19.770> with

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
that this symbol stands is marked with

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.980 
that this symbol stands is marked with
the<00:00:20.100> color<00:00:20.250> blue<00:00:20.520> this<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.300> why<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.539> call<00:00:21.869> this

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
the color blue this is why I call this

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.009 
the color blue this is why I call this
time<00:00:22.199> my<00:00:22.410> blue<00:00:22.680> stand<00:00:23.060> obviously<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.359> this

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
time my blue stand obviously and this

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.339 
time my blue stand obviously and this
blue<00:00:25.199> marking<00:00:25.910> is<00:00:26.910> consistent<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.050> entire

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
blue marking is consistent in the entire

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.560 
blue marking is consistent in the entire
stamp<00:00:28.769> for<00:00:29.070> example<00:00:29.550> I'm<00:00:30.119> gonna<00:00:30.240> take<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
stamp for example I'm gonna take the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.840 
stamp for example I'm gonna take the
middle<00:00:30.720> section<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.260> also<00:00:31.289> see<00:00:31.800> if<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.669> has

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
middle section you also see if it has

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.260 
middle section you also see if it has
the<00:00:32.880> blue<00:00:33.239> sticker<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.500> it's<00:00:35.040> just<00:00:35.280> tape

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
the blue sticker on it it's just tape

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.819 
the blue sticker on it it's just tape
that<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> wound<00:00:37.110> won't<00:00:37.649> long<00:00:38.370> run<00:00:38.670> around<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.829> so

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
that a wound won't long run around it so

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.209 
that a wound won't long run around it so
this<00:00:41.399> helps<00:00:41.820> me<00:00:41.940> identify<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:43.680> points<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.070> my

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
this helps me identify the points of my

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.150 
this helps me identify the points of my
symbol<00:00:44.550> stand<00:00:44.850> which<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.780> take<00:00:46.440> apart<00:00:46.800> when<00:00:47.039> I'm

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
symbol stand which I take apart when I'm

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.190 
symbol stand which I take apart when I'm
traveling<00:00:47.640> which<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.420> no<00:00:48.539> problem<00:00:48.960> because<00:00:49.050> I

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
traveling which is no problem because I

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.750 
traveling which is no problem because I
have<00:00:49.350> Murray<00:00:49.620> box<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.370> check<00:00:50.579> out

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
have Murray box you can check out

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.150 
have Murray box you can check out
whatever<00:00:51.690> you'd<00:00:51.989> like<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.140> do<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.800> previous

I'll show you how it works on my snare
stand<00:01:44.630> which<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.659> as<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.470> can<00:01:46.770> see<00:01:47.540> the<00:01:48.540> orange
