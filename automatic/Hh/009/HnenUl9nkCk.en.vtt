00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.660 

after<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.420> rule<00:01:24.600> he<00:01:25.020> glides<00:01:25.320> up<00:01:25.500> he<00:01:26.340> might<00:01:26.490> do

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
after the rule he glides up he might do

after the rule he glides up he might do
20<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.060> these<00:01:27.270> dives<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.840> row<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.580> was

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
20 of these dives in a row I was

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.950 
20 of these dives in a row I was
fascinated<00:01:29.820> with<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.240> sound<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.660> he<00:01:30.750> makes

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
fascinated with the sound that he makes

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.480 
fascinated with the sound that he makes
during<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.500> dive<00:01:32.990> it<00:01:33.990> turns<00:01:34.320> out<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.590> sound

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
during the dive it turns out the sound

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.670 
during the dive it turns out the sound
is<00:01:35.730> made<00:01:35.910> by<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.120> tail<00:01:36.390> here's<00:01:37.320> what<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.530> male

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
is made by the tail here's what a male

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.260 
is made by the tail here's what a male
of<00:01:37.710> no<00:01:37.979> tail<00:01:38.220> sounds<00:01:38.520> like<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.920> sound<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.060> gone

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
of no tail sounds like the sound is gone

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.770 
of no tail sounds like the sound is gone
but<00:01:42.780> he<00:01:42.900> still<00:01:43.080> makes<00:01:43.260> the<00:01:43.700> hmm<00:01:44.700> sound<00:01:45.210> which<00:01:45.660> i

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
but he still makes the hmm sound which i

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.810 
but he still makes the hmm sound which i
think<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.050> a<00:01:46.080> vocalization<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:47.460> figure<00:01:47.729> out

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
think is a vocalization to figure out

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.910 
think is a vocalization to figure out
how<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.030> tail<00:01:48.300> makes<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.720> sound<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.200> tested

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
how the tail makes the sound I tested

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.109 
how the tail makes the sound I tested
the<00:01:50.010> feathers<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.580> wind<00:01:50.729> tunnel

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
the feathers in a wind tunnel

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.450 
the feathers in a wind tunnel
here<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.840> an<00:01:51.960> ultra-high<00:01:52.560> speed<00:01:52.860> video<00:01:53.010> of<00:01:53.310> one

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
here is an ultra-high speed video of one

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.880 
here is an ultra-high speed video of one
of<00:01:53.580> his<00:01:53.670> tail<00:01:53.850> feathers<00:01:54.150> metrics<00:01:54.750> one<00:01:54.930> vote<00:01:55.710> is

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
of his tail feathers metrics one vote is

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.770 
of his tail feathers metrics one vote is
fluttering<00:01:56.190> it<00:01:56.610> did<00:01:56.820> not<00:01:56.940> make<00:01:57.119> much<00:01:57.450> sound

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
fluttering it did not make much sound

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.900 
fluttering it did not make much sound
but<00:01:58.470> notice<00:01:58.770> how<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.950> feather<00:01:59.190> rotates<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.759> bit

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
but notice how the feather rotates a bit

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.030 
but notice how the feather rotates a bit
with<00:02:00.090> each<00:02:00.119> flutter<00:02:00.509> when<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.350> saw<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
with each flutter when I saw that in the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.160 
with each flutter when I saw that in the
video<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.790> gave<00:02:03.030> me<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.300> idea<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.780> test<00:02:03.960> what

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
video it gave me the idea to test what

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.570 
video it gave me the idea to test what
happens<00:02:04.200> when<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.740> feathers<00:02:05.070> hit<00:02:05.340> each<00:02:05.460> other

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
happens when the feathers hit each other

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.210 
happens when the feathers hit each other
it<00:02:06.330> took<00:02:06.600> me<00:02:06.720> a<00:02:06.750> long<00:02:06.990> time<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.649> figure<00:02:07.830> out<00:02:08.009> how

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
it took me a long time to figure out how

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.219 
it took me a long time to figure out how
to<00:02:08.280> get<00:02:08.550> them<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.790> hit<00:02:08.940> each<00:02:09.030> other<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.959> looks

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
to get them to hit each other it looks

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.979 
to get them to hit each other it looks
like<00:02:10.350> this<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.880> when<00:02:12.450> they<00:02:12.570> hit<00:02:12.690> each<00:02:12.750> other

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
like this and when they hit each other

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.590 
like this and when they hit each other
they<00:02:13.680> generate<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.250> sound<00:02:17.420> which<00:02:18.420> is

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
they generate this sound which is

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.640 
they generate this sound which is
similar<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.170> sound<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.500> birds

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
similar to the sound of the birds

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
similar to the sound of the birds
actually<00:02:20.220> make<00:02:21.680> so<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:22.920> think<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.580> the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
actually make so I think that the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.040 
actually make so I think that the
buzzing<00:02:24.000> sound<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.480> made<00:02:24.660> by<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.810> tail

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
buzzing sound is made by the tail

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.570 
buzzing sound is made by the tail
feathers<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.620> hummingbird<00:02:26.010> hitting<00:02:26.489> each

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
feathers of the hummingbird hitting each

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.820 
feathers of the hummingbird hitting each
other<00:02:26.760> when<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.420> mail<00:02:27.570> spreads<00:02:27.900> his<00:02:28.019> tail<00:02:28.290> at

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
other when the mail spreads his tail at

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.920 
other when the mail spreads his tail at
the<00:02:28.950> bottom<00:02:29.190> of<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.340> dive<00:02:29.549> he<00:02:30.360> dives<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.810> get

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
the bottom of the dive he dives to get

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.600 
the bottom of the dive he dives to get
enough<00:02:31.140> airspeed<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.920> make<00:02:32.070> his<00:02:32.310> feathers

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
enough airspeed to make his feathers

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.180 
enough airspeed to make his feathers
