00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.680
 Silvia Fernández 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.440
 silvia fernández is an urban artist 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.600
 who sings in groups and trains when 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.880
 one has blows in life that feeds 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.500
 to the artist and I think that Silvia has 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.300
 had his bumps in life is a 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.430
 difficult competitor for the rest of the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.610
 team the program gave him a well-deserved 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.009
 recognition however she continues 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.960
 with his guitar in tow earning his 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.720
 life in the same way as after the 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.540
 good day passenger took off the guitar and 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.270
 People tell me the friends to follow and 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.910
 they started to applaud you wait and 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.160
 applaud as like a theater report of 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.630
 sant to keep silver and never sing 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.960
 because I stop it, I have to 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.670
 go down and I did not know what to do they start me 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.890
 to drop the tears his father 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.540
 encouraged from very small so that 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.540
 never get away from music 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.379
 I sing in the chamamé and improving myself 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.070
 with the world font when the recorder 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.380
 cited square no better I do not recognize 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.870
 doing something else a few decades later 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:18.060
 she transmits the passion for singing 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.060
 to his little son Juanito 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.700
 and while I'm a happy artist first 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:30.450
 I am a mom and a person who is the voice 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.450
 Argentina that the best mom in the universe 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.790
 to sing a song by Maria Elena Walsh 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.120
 like the cicada here by or silvia 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.120
 fernandez 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.610
 and 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:54.310
 sometimes they killed me so many times I died 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.310
 however, I am here 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:04.870
 I am in misfortune of the hand 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:08.790
 they composed because I kill myself so badly 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.790
 and keep singing 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.030
 so 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:21.010
 like the cicada 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:24.690
 after a year under the earth equal 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.690
 what to survive 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.570
 coming back from the war 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.730
 and 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:42.050
 that killed so many resurrected 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.050
 the last nights 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.690
 and that of darkness 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.570
 for 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.570
 I love 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.569
 singing 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.569
 how 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:13.670
 I look for the earth 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.670
 what survivors 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.790
 follow 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.790
 after one year 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.280
 just like him 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.599
 coming back from the war 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.560
 how the cicadas would continue fernandez 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.829
 how we feel 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:02.090
 but the scenario is very different from the 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:05.450
 collective is not very excited 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.450
 the amount 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.830
 the event is very strong 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.830
 to the ground 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:20.560
 and there is already an excellent job 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:24.150
 really excellent on stage I know 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:28.090

 every story of you and what I 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.020
 like voices that channel all that and 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.200
 you take it as a positive tool for 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.180
 dump it on the very important stage 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.750
 the same as the cougar I respect you very much 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.289
 the fact of being a person who sings in 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.749
 the collectives 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:48.050
 and is delivered at the mercy of the will of 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:50.360
 the people of every day is very admirable and 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.270
