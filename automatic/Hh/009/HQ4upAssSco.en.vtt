00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.370
 ah 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.720
 i 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.870
 yes because previously I had not 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.570
 man at the beginning had a bit of 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:35.390
 doubt for a bit because of ignorance of 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.390
 system but the truth is that I noticed 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:40.789
 to 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.469
 m 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.469
 functions 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.380
 we have satisfied and it has also been 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:01.110
 quick and very weird 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:05.120
 because it has no leak 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.120
 Yes Yes 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.400
 more than a year of bus 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.610
 they found 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.610
 where he lost and why 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.890
 when they have appeared simple method 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:37.690
 but cash is with the leak right away 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.370
 and very professional why did you do it 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.490
 as a sonar itself as seen in 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.030
 internet that you came with the device if 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.030
 is that you spend and 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.700
 I find novel methods I would recommend 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.010
 that in a day 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.780
 in the time that you came they were where 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.820
 all day 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.840
 you found the solution on the network 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.840
 Gasteiz and super good 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.780
 because talking 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.950
 I would advise you at least 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.190
 test because it has been fast and effective 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.470
 and not very expensive 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.540
 is that they totally trust the occupation of 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.470
 the website because I really 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.180
 It surprised everything because the goals 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.430
 ah 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.900
 that's what I was going to say yes 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.120
 yes yes I recommend that if I 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.120
 they ask how we recommend 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.200
 Awesome
