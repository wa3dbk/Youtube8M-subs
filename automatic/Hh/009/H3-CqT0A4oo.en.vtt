00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello everyone my name is Olya and in 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.450
 today's video wanted to show you how 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.250
 at home you can do energy or 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.849
 energy drink as his yet 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.940
 called 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.650
 for this we need quite a bit 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.130
 ingredients it's just a little cup 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.049
 tea 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.789
 Now it's on a jar I opened 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.100
 everything is now critical and a little sugar 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.439
 unless of course love everything sweeter like me 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.420
 askorbinki and also slightly boiled 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.189
 hot water and a little cold well 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.349
 also to do all this work 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.599
 we will need another blender mixer or 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.669
 something to mix it all up 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.280
 beginnings we put all the excess in 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.879
 side take our cup and pour it here 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.680
 somewhere around 100 milliliters of hot water 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.270
 maybe I filled even a little more but I'm afraid 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.980
 it will not hurt us now take 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.960
 about that much sugar I don't know 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.920
 how much do I not know how to pour out here and 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.510
 stir sugar quickly dissolved 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.469
 now we need to add three here 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.300
 tea bag 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.370
 take three tea bags it 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.250
 the best option well, although you can and 2 and 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.320
 here we lay them down and wait for the full brew 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.160
 about two with foam three minutes can 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.160
 be even 5 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.610
 and our tea or chifir is shown 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.860
 you can even call we need to do 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.259
 some other actions themselves aside and 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.970
 proceed take another cup in it 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.770
 we pour about the same hundred 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.259
 fifty or one hundred milliliters but already 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.960
 cold ordinary water now take 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.520
 askorbinki and throw them water and interfere 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.039
 so that they dissolve on this 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.950
 a jar of 250 milliliters of cola 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:32.200
 need a little baby ck just 15 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.330
 even in principle I can be 10 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.220
 considered that a lot of ascorbic acid 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.720
 it is also harmful and not at all useful 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.700
 so threw here either ten or 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.380
 eleven stuff I did not count write 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.750
 in the comment how many pieces are here now 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:49.929
 this we need to stir up practically 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:51.789
 complete dissolution as I planned 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.920
 until the full distance came out nothing 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.350
 interfere but it does not hurt you can leave 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.390
 here are such small after all the garage 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.220
 so that they remain a hole of time in our 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.229
 now we can brew from it 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.240
 take out tea bags now this 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.490
 do somewhere and put them in 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.190
 the side and here's what happened, that's what 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.739
 we need so now proceed to 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.900
 next steps take a funnel and 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.700
 ruler i don't 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.069
 already how correctly for sure many of 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.019
 You remember the video how to make a sprite was 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.430
 on my channel is a video there I said 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.290
 what do we need to do a watering can 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.150
 and when it said just a bunch of people on 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.610
 dog in the comments what to check funnel 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.110
 Well, this one is a funnel or a watering can 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.030
 now we fill in what we have done 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.709
 first tea that is chifir and then it 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.019
 what did i do with ascorbic me 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.659
 this one with the baskets there and 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.939
 fill well we can understand our 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.870
 funnel and proceed with mixing 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.870
 just turn on the blender 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.900
 In general, the people I do not know why so 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.460
 the color has changed a lot 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.860
 the drink that we just got with you 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.200
 but I prepared this color somehow 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.600
 I like it because I think the drink 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.460
 will be really refreshing invigorating 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.840
 really giving energy I won't tell 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.180
 what's yummy let's it now 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.680
 I'll try in general, I poured everything in a jar 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.840
 from under the cola and left exactly as much 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.790
 how much and the beginning was necessary and 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.100
 you need to put it in the fridge now 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.230
 then I will try to call him now I'm lying 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.110
 like that same jar of cola so 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.180
 the most and the drugs that turned out on 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.800
 really quite good exactly how 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.990
 you will be if you do not cook well not 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.090
 only taste even like i approve of it 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.970
 since black tea with 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.010
 ascorbinka mida I sure as a taste 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.200
 cool and i like it i will 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.940
 do yourself so what about effects like 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.190
 energy so it really works 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.500
 works well like other drugs 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.450
 just a little late somewhere through 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.430

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.320
