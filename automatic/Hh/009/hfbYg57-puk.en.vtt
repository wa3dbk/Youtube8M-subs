looking<00:00:34.380> out<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.710> four<00:00:34.950> animatronics

looking out of the four animatronics

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.090 
looking out of the four animatronics
what<00:00:36.390> would<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.719> hook<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.410> Nashes<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.040> the

what would the hook the Nashes and the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.220 
what would the hook the Nashes and the
damage<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.399> his<00:00:38.610> body<00:00:38.730> Scott<00:00:39.600> had<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.960> come<00:00:40.110> up

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
damage to his body Scott had to come up

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.900 
damage to his body Scott had to come up
with<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.530> little<00:00:40.680> bit<00:00:40.950> extra<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.370> make<00:00:41.489> foxy

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
with that little bit extra to make foxy

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.400 
with that little bit extra to make foxy
stand<00:00:42.180> out<00:00:42.360> amongst<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.780> other<00:00:42.930> nightmares

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
stand out amongst the other nightmares

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.260 
stand out amongst the other nightmares
and<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.920> think<00:00:43.980> he<00:00:44.219> did<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> good<00:00:44.610> job<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:45.030> doing

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
and I think he did a good job in doing

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.940 
and I think he did a good job in doing
so<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.960> also<00:00:46.140> ties<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.620> well<00:00:46.739> with<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
so this also ties in well with the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.440 
so this also ties in well with the
nightmare<00:00:47.399> element<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.879> game<00:00:48.030> seems<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.360> be

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
nightmare element the game seems to be

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.840 
nightmare element the game seems to be
based<00:00:48.629> on<00:00:48.899> speaking<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.829> which<00:00:50.039> if<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:50.670> take

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
based on speaking of which if we take

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.029 
based on speaking of which if we take
proxies<00:00:51.329> image<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.840> brighten<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.260> up<00:00:52.410> do<00:00:52.949> we

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
proxies image and brighten it up do we

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.229 
proxies image and brighten it up do we
see<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.309> same<00:00:53.460> way<00:00:53.640> we<00:00:53.789> did<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.000> previous

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
see the same way we did in the previous

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.779 
see the same way we did in the previous
three<00:00:54.480> images<00:00:54.840> well<00:00:55.800> it's<00:00:56.070> difficult<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.610> say

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
three images well it's difficult to say

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.670 
three images well it's difficult to say
the<00:00:57.270> letters<00:00:57.510> here<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.020> faint<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.469> it's

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
the letters here is so faint that it's

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.990 
the letters here is so faint that it's
hard<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.980> make<00:00:59.100> out<00:00:59.250> what's<00:00:59.460> written<00:00:59.640> at<00:00:59.820> all

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
hard to make out what's written at all

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.389 
hard to make out what's written at all
now<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.690> assumed<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.440> would<00:01:01.620> say<00:01:01.829> nightmare

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
now I assumed this would say nightmare

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.310 
now I assumed this would say nightmare
as<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.850> did<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.059> previous<00:01:03.270> images<00:01:03.809> but<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
as it did in the previous images but the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.870 
as it did in the previous images but the
word<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.619> too<00:01:04.860> long<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.460> last<00:01:05.670> letter

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
word is too long and the last letter

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.789 
word is too long and the last letter
looks<00:01:06.090> more<00:01:06.390> like<00:01:06.570> an<00:01:06.720> hour<00:01:06.840> rather<00:01:07.290> than<00:01:07.470> an<00:01:07.619> e

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
looks more like an hour rather than an e

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.429 
looks more like an hour rather than an e
also<00:01:08.580> if<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:08.760> zoom<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.360> Foxy's<00:01:09.810> teeth<00:01:10.110> and

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
also if we zoom in on Foxy's teeth and

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.620 
also if we zoom in on Foxy's teeth and
darken<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.220> image<00:01:11.250> tad<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.030> word<00:01:12.210> nightmare

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
darken the image tad the word nightmare

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.020 
darken the image tad the word nightmare
can<00:01:12.750> be<00:01:12.810> found<00:01:12.960> here<00:01:13.320> instead<00:01:13.710> but<00:01:14.369> then<00:01:14.580> what

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
can be found here instead but then what

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.179 
can be found here instead but then what
does<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.240> longer<00:01:15.509> would<00:01:15.630> say<00:01:15.900> unless<00:01:16.860> I'm

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
does the longer would say unless I'm

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.429 
does the longer would say unless I'm
completely<00:01:17.759> off<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.509> last<00:01:18.689> few<00:01:18.930> letters<00:01:19.140> look

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
completely off the last few letters look

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.359 
completely off the last few letters look
like<00:01:19.500> our<00:01:19.950> d<00:01:20.700> e<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.659> another<00:01:21.990> are<00:01:22.229> at<00:01:23.070> first

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
like our d e and another are at first

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.859 
like our d e and another are at first
the<00:01:23.549> only<00:01:23.820> word<00:01:23.970> ending<00:01:24.390> like<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.689> could

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
the only word ending like that I could

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.780 
the only word ending like that I could
think<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.259> was<00:01:25.409> murder<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.490> doesn't

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
think of was murder but that doesn't

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.210 
think of was murder but that doesn't
account<00:01:27.000> for<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.299> rest<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> letters<00:01:28.220> then

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
account for the rest of the letters then

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.429 
account for the rest of the letters then
it<00:01:29.460> suddenly<00:01:29.670> hit<00:01:29.880> me<00:01:30.060> what<00:01:30.840> if<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.049> not<00:01:31.259> a

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
it suddenly hit me what if it's not a
