the whole ever every single thing we did
in<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.320> game<00:01:07.380> i<00:01:07.590> think<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:07.830> like<00:01:07.950> two<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.220> a

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
in that game i think it's like two and a

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.090 
in that game i think it's like two and a
half<00:01:08.369> hours<00:01:08.610> long<00:01:08.790> every<00:01:09.119> single<00:01:09.390> match<00:01:09.540> and

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
half hours long every single match and

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.440 
half hours long every single match and
that<00:01:11.100> that's<00:01:11.250> going<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.700> be<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> video<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.150> I

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
that that's going to be a video that I

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.330 
that that's going to be a video that I
think<00:01:12.510> stars<00:01:13.170> uploading<00:01:13.740> right<00:01:13.920> now<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.130> his

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
think stars uploading right now to his

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.830 
think stars uploading right now to his
channel<00:01:14.549> its<00:01:14.880> processing<00:01:15.479> or<00:01:15.570> something

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
channel its processing or something

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.820 
channel its processing or something
hopefully<00:01:16.110> it's<00:01:16.229> not<00:01:16.320> by<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.500> time<00:01:16.680> this

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
hopefully it's not by the time this

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.920 
hopefully it's not by the time this
video<00:01:16.979> goes<00:01:17.130> up<00:01:17.280> it's<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:18.420> two<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.840> half

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
video goes up it's like two and a half

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.109 
video goes up it's like two and a half
three<00:01:19.080> hours<00:01:19.200> long<00:01:19.530> but<00:01:19.799> it's<00:01:20.369> pretty<00:01:20.549> sick<00:01:20.880> it

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
three hours long but it's pretty sick it

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
not starcraft at all not there's not a

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.460 
not starcraft at all not there's not a
