00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.099
 Hello to you Alexey Nazarov and the 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.240
 Pavel Timchenko spent a good day with us 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.089
 press there pavel participated in the trigger from 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.090
 These on advertising and I decided on 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.390
 questions ask him about how it was and 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.990
 about what happened when 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.150
 I participated and what project did I do 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.250
 studied with about a year ago 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.579
 entire oval project which was called 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.430
 disk obs book that is it 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.829
 brochure which is used in 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.690
 distance books thoughts nearest 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.440
 consultation 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:47.010
 that is, there is material it is useful than 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.280
 that the card is issued anyway 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.440
 female consultation and it is used 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.680
 women for records after taking 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.109
 doctors and picture consultation is slave 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.980
 there is an advertising company which somehow 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.860
 bound either 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.460
 baby clothes do not fit baby 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.130
 nutrition 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:12.650
 everything related to the garden and the translation and here 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.850
 such a project I realized spent on 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.280
 it will probably take three months and 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:23.630
 turned out to work with about 150,000 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.360
 rubles the rank of 150 is good masha but the word 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.610
 say but a lot of people face 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.060
 so that it seems to remember the scheme working 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.020
 and well here's how already decided on 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.200
 preteen training 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.050
 which made me wonder why when wearing 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.180
 participate and discuss do it from 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.210
 sony irresistible first acquaintance with 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.810
 you did not happen 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.210
 at the master class who gave out and 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.310
 in detail about your told and save 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.350
 were already this guys for free 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.460
 a rally that talked about what 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:00.330
 they also implemented this project 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:05.229
 that is, originated in Aquarius 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:08.140
 your coach had examples of implemented 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:11.560
 projects and maybe I'm just for myself 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.780
 I felt that I was in Odessa enough 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.110
 I can probably do something because 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.900
 everyone understood their own resources 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.350
 I realized I tried several calls and 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.850
 I realized that less circuit on the worker 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.730
 therefore at the beginning therefore adopted 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.370
 some solution may be difficult 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.170
 before the process or what helped here 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.090
 realize your project because there is 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.880
 people who come they also have 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.890
 the scheme turned out the recording time to us 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:44.230
 for some reason they don't do it 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.720
 areas right but the biggest difficulty 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.210
 make yourself just bar 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.600
 phone call this is the biggest 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:56.380
 complicated because you need it regularly 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.020
 you need to call people just because 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.300
 there would be nothing here oksana big 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:05.140
 use it at work and force 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.840
 work yourself as always deliver 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.420
 break on the Sabbath thank you very much for 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.350
 your eyes are waiting for you money 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.350
 fast day in my car
