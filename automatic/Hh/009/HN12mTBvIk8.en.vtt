00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.059 

the<00:01:36.450> transmitter<00:01:39.229> has<00:01:40.229> some<00:01:40.529> really<00:01:40.740> neat

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:41.069 
the transmitter has some really neat

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.239 
the transmitter has some really neat
features<00:01:41.990> it's<00:01:42.990> got<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.259> switch<00:01:43.529> to<00:01:43.889> limit

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:44.249 
features it's got to switch to limit

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:46.760 
features it's got to switch to limit
maximum<00:01:44.759> motor<00:01:45.149> power<00:01:45.569> with<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.319> switch<00:01:46.560> away

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
maximum motor power with the switch away

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.879 
maximum motor power with the switch away
from<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:48.060> get<00:01:48.329> maximum<00:01:48.749> power<00:01:49.349> sitting

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:49.889 
from you you get maximum power sitting

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:52.459 
from you you get maximum power sitting
with<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.490> switch<00:01:50.729> towards<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.599> maximum

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
with the switch towards you maximum

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:55.969 
with the switch towards you maximum
power<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:53.130> criminal<00:01:53.849> using<00:01:54.569> the<00:01:54.719> snob<00:01:55.109> this

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
power is criminal using the snob this

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.830 
power is criminal using the snob this
means<00:01:56.249> the<00:01:56.399> beginner<00:01:56.759> can<00:01:57.119> limit<00:01:57.419> the<00:01:57.450> power

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
means the beginner can limit the power

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.679 
means the beginner can limit the power
from<00:01:58.169> the<00:01:58.289> helicopter<00:01:59.069> and<00:01:59.419> hopefully<00:02:00.419> stop

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
from the helicopter and hopefully stop

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.359 
from the helicopter and hopefully stop
them<00:02:00.929> getting<00:02:01.049> into<00:02:01.349> so<00:02:01.529> much<00:02:01.739> trouble<00:02:01.799> when

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
them getting into so much trouble when

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.800 
them getting into so much trouble when
the<00:02:02.549> learning<00:02:03.709> there's<00:02:04.709> a<00:02:04.799> dual<00:02:05.009> rates<00:02:05.279> which

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
the learning there's a dual rates which

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.749 
the learning there's a dual rates which
this<00:02:06.810> allows<00:02:07.139> fast<00:02:07.529> control<00:02:08.039> response<00:02:08.459> with

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
this allows fast control response with

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.850 
this allows fast control response with
the<00:02:08.849> switch<00:02:09.090> away<00:02:09.270> from<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.899> for<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.560> switch

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
the switch away from you for the switch

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.400 
the switch away from you for the switch
towards<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.000> helicopters<00:02:12.630> got<00:02:12.810> softer

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410

brushless motor drives the main gear

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.750 
brushless motor drives the main gear
which<00:03:14.850> then<00:03:15.090> drives<00:03:15.240> the<00:03:15.630> main<00:03:15.870> rotor<00:03:16.260> and

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
which then drives the main rotor and

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.480
