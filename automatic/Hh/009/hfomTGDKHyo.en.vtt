00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:17.369
 Hello , I finally have a small 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.199
 I got a review yesterday I got the third 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.980
 parcel 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:25.550
 These two essentially I received already week 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.160
 back more so they are all hidden 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.669
 I looked that there that is a little bit to 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.420
 know yes let 's start this one changes 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.960
 a little disappointed of course yes package 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:44.420
 everything is all so much so complicated 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:48.629
 turns out to be a pen with a video camera 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:52.140
 I do not understand how to use in 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.789
 as covert video surveillance yes then 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.559
 there is it will be very difficult as I do not 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.360
 I know how you can with her just 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.430
 indulge in lessons somewhere there might 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.530
 to someone preschoolers students there if 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.329
 something sound write a little something 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.790
 record some footage yes if 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.920
 for example there are lectures or what is well in 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.960
 quality from hidden tools and and 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.970
 very difficult to use why now 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.909
 I will explain, and firstly here are two two 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.280
 holes one hole the indicator 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.900
 indicator exactly 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.270
 work the device does not work yes there 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.960
 shared light bulb and the bottom button 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.439
 reset 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.909
 and what is it for when turned on 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:36.299
 cameras set harry hour that is 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.040
 need before you click yes that is you 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.860
 clicked yes and we need to look 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.479
 whether it is burning or not, that is, again when 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.840
 covert video surveillance but how are you 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.290
 you will immediately see yourself 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.890
 cable giblets create yes again 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.729
 press it starts blinking all not 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.590
 blink here that is blinked at that is 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.520
 you need to click it turned on then again 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.229
 push she blink 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.229
 and it turned on again, that is, the recording went 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.750
 that is, 2 actions need to be done hidden 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.270
 it does not work and there is such a moment that 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.770
 she hangs 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.600
 that's it 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.580
 that's this bottom not me holes 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.010
 button times for this and need but it 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.690
 general paradoxical situation 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.700
 will be if you get this pen 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.630
 with hidden video surveillance and be 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.120
 poke there with a needle funny but oh 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.470
 quality of course you can 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.050
 pen pen writes 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.480
 pen writes us well pasta of course there 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.840
 little i will show you now with us 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.360
 worth this pen I immediately flash drive literally 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.330
 here for 2 gigabytes 2 gigabytes quietly 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.730
 pulls but i give students this comfortable 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.890
 who is there for example to write a lecture I do not 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.850
 I know how much it is enough and even 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.360
 did not check there yes that is 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.570
 record all this quality photos 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.510
 bad 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.100
 video I'm talking here for lectures 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.670
 some with good lighting 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.200
 she is normally hard in principle 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.580
 four for student this 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.500
 and pen and at the same time immediately camera 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.500
 although now everyone has mobile phones 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.820
 then I don’t know what's the point 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:20.270
 such a pen it is cheap somewhere 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:23.640
 dollar 65 so on, too, got 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:26.700
 the backpack ordered daughters she will go with me 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:32.340
 this year to school such a backpack halloween 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:34.140
 kiti too, it cost 14 dollars like you 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.700
 understand now and almost all of the page 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:43.740
 children are crazy for such 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:49.760
 emblems we throw sizes 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:57.290
 he has 10 centimeters height he has 34 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:04:01.110
 and width 27 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.990
 well enough I think for textbooks for 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.880
 notebooks 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:13.490
 holes that is as it should be yes that's 2 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:16.019
 here here, too, for example for pencil case yes 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.209
 here the individual goes yes here you can 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.090
 again the pencil case was live here something in 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.950
 Pocket there is yes that is where I really do not 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.710
 I know a lot of this, too 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:30.950
 put something 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:33.630
 they yes they come up with a cloth 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.450
 oilcloth to oilcloth fabric this 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.960
 mothers and bots but not material this is 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.730
 In principle, on the contrary, we would rather not 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.150
 cracked where straps 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.280
 that's it straps made a little bit I will 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.580
 there is something like foam 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.250
 apparently did not press on the shoulders are like 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.110
 this is good not just straps normal 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.480
 gave the type of such here anyway they 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:01.020
 the child needs an hour 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.730
 a suitcase and all sorts of books notebooks but 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.240
 nothing is written here I can not you 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:10.170
 say have something done in china and 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.060
 it is really from there well what in 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.940
 principle 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:18.030
 then I’ll see how it will be 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:22.080
 I'll even take a small child on video 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:25.500
 I will demonstrate it okay 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:30.950
 now this part is she here i know that 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:33.870
 I have ordered this watch from me 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:41.720
 Now let's see together I do not know such 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:45.540
 Well, by order of the phone and black black 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.870
 silver, whether yes or black strap 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:53.699
 deeds 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:06:01.139
 These are the watches but they don't mean 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:06:01.919
 something is not visible of course so now until 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:04.410
 start up 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:06.270
 this is not a quartz mechanical watch well yes 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.850
 you can see the pendulum as you see, yes 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.310
 opaque in this is the essence and 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:16.199
 skeleton that they are completely transparent 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:18.410
 the mechanism is visible here they are well 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:22.260
 somewhere 400 rubles 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:25.620
 450 500 so let's push 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.930
 From this sum, yes, I don’t know the person 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.000
 liked the man ordered if only 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.669
 at one time of the order he is with me they too 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.800
 how like a skeleton he's transparent too but 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:40.169
 they are a little bit different on their dial 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:42.810
 the other there is black well the idea was alive 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:44.789
 Mary give and show you 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.910
 compare and here is my watch 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:50.610
 Here these customized watches see the difference 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.470
 I have some of them too but I still have 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:56.160
 they are with a pendulum here that is when walking 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:07:00.450
 they are the very best thing they have here 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:04.020
 slightly dial another black black 

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:06.320
 with silver inside he is not white well 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.940
 I do not know, in principle, can be seen here 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.479
 Now understand that this is where the arrow keys 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:14.789
 so it doesn’t merge with the dial 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:17.099
 second hand black and big 

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:20.669
 the little one is not much different from 

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:23.729
 very all the blat inside the strap normal 

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:26.310
 a strap is a type of oilcloth on a knife like pvc 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:28.710
 Is it okay ? 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:32.430
 Yes, look here for this watch 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:35.190
 more than a year i got them that year 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:38.460
 in January that is, they have been here for them a year and 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:40.139
 there are two or three months so strap i 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.150
 wore winter and summer 

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:43.710
 so as you can see it became soft gave 

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:46.410
 he is tough now here he is 

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.840
 developed himself became soft and very even 

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:51.000
 good and nothing rubs not skin 

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.090
 therefore, therefore, I recommend to someone 

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.580
 exactly like such that's it 

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:58.540
 skeletons watches which can which 

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:02.170
 you can see what is there 

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:06.760
 hand okay that is to buy that's all in
