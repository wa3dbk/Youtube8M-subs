00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.460 

during<00:01:30.549> that<00:01:30.760> time<00:01:31.090> I<00:01:31.479> was<00:01:32.080> just<00:01:32.229> like<00:01:32.350> oh<00:01:32.440> my

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
god this is amazing I thought I want

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.980 
god this is amazing I thought I want
where<00:01:35.020> I<00:01:35.049> want<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:35.619> I<00:01:35.740> still<00:01:36.190> like<00:01:36.990> maintain

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
where I want and I still like maintain

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.570 
where I want and I still like maintain
it<00:01:38.200> but<00:01:38.590> then<00:01:38.740> what<00:01:38.890> I<00:01:38.920> realized<00:01:39.400> is<00:01:39.549> that

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
it but then what I realized is that

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.190 
it but then what I realized is that
after<00:01:40.030> I<00:01:40.090> stretch<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:40.510> learn<00:01:40.630> how<00:01:40.750> to<00:01:40.780> really

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
after I stretch and learn how to really

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.020 
after I stretch and learn how to really
cook<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.500> food<00:01:41.799> and<00:01:41.830> realize<00:01:42.700> how<00:01:42.909> much

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
cook the food and realize how much

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.200 
cook the food and realize how much
variety<00:01:43.270> it<00:01:43.750> was<00:01:43.900> I<00:01:44.290> think<00:01:44.890> gained<00:01:45.100> weight

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
variety it was I think gained weight

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.690 
variety it was I think gained weight
and<00:01:46.600> right<00:01:46.900> now<00:01:47.140> I'm<00:01:47.500> not<00:01:47.710> like<00:01:47.920> huge<00:01:48.400> or

that I you know the way I used to be
back<00:01:54.010> when<00:01:54.040> I<00:01:54.970> first<00:01:55.630> started<00:01:56.049> my<00:01:56.170> channel<00:01:56.549> so

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
back when I first started my channel so

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.510 
back when I first started my channel so
it<00:01:58.659> brings<00:01:58.990> me<00:01:59.170> to<00:01:59.320> this<00:01:59.439> point<00:01:59.680> if<00:02:00.220> you<00:02:00.369> want

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
it brings me to this point if you want

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.039 
it brings me to this point if you want
to<00:02:00.580> be<00:02:00.670> a<00:02:00.700> vegan<00:02:00.939> and<00:02:01.210> lose<00:02:01.390> weight<00:02:01.750> I<00:02:02.020> think

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
to be a vegan and lose weight I think

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.760 
to be a vegan and lose weight I think
that's<00:02:02.470> amazing<00:02:02.890> but<00:02:03.729> I<00:02:03.790> really<00:02:04.210> think<00:02:04.509> that

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
that's amazing but I really think that

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.629 
that's amazing but I really think that
you<00:02:05.770> should<00:02:05.799> embrace<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.850> lifestyle<00:02:07.330> for

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:10.689 
causes that are bigger than you

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:13.379 
causes that are bigger than you

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
but if you want to do it I think you

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.529 
but if you want to do it I think you
should<00:04:48.919> do<00:04:49.039> it<00:04:49.069> for<00:04:49.520> reasons<00:04:50.030> that<00:04:50.300> are

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
should do it for reasons that are

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.659 
should do it for reasons that are
sometimes<00:04:50.870> I<00:04:51.289> think<00:04:51.889> you<00:04:52.130> should<00:04:52.310> do<00:04:52.400> it<00:04:52.520> for

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
sometimes I think you should do it for

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.100 
sometimes I think you should do it for
reasons<00:04:53.030> that<00:04:53.060> are<00:04:53.210> bigger<00:04:53.419> than<00:04:53.509> you<00:04:53.810> you

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
reasons that are bigger than you you

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.710 
reasons that are bigger than you you
know<00:04:54.430> do<00:04:55.430> it<00:04:55.460> for<00:04:55.759> the<00:04:55.849> planet<00:04:56.419> do<00:04:56.630> it<00:04:56.780> for<00:04:57.050> the

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
know do it for the planet do it for the

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.749 
know do it for the planet do it for the
animals<00:04:59.860> and<00:05:00.860> of<00:05:00.979> course<00:05:01.190> do<00:05:01.370> it<00:05:01.490> for<00:05:01.639> your

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.600 
animals and of course do it for your
health<00:05:01.970> but<00:05:02.180> I<00:05:02.690> don't<00:05:03.590> really<00:05:03.710> think<00:05:03.949> that<00:05:04.070> the

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
health but I don't really think that the

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.400 
health but I don't really think that the
health<00:05:04.880> is<00:05:05.150> what<00:05:05.360> keeps<00:05:05.630> people<00:05:05.780> vegan<00:05:06.320> I

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
health is what keeps people vegan I

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.200 
health is what keeps people vegan I
think<00:05:06.650> it's<00:05:06.770> something<00:05:07.190> bigger<00:05:07.820> than<00:05:08.060> you

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
think it's something bigger than you

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.330 
think it's something bigger than you
because<00:05:08.539> in<00:05:08.900> my<00:05:09.110> experience<00:05:09.259> is<00:05:09.740> a<00:05:09.770> big<00:05:10.009> is<00:05:10.310> a

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
because in my experience is a big is a

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.040 
because in my experience is a big is a
big<00:05:10.550> difference<00:05:10.880> between<00:05:10.940> a<00:05:11.180> plant-based<00:05:11.750> and

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
big difference between a plant-based and

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.200 
big difference between a plant-based and
vegan<00:05:12.560> plant-based<00:05:13.220> people<00:05:13.789> just<00:05:13.970> do<00:05:14.060> it

vegan plant-based people just do it

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.820 
vegan plant-based people just do it
usually<00:05:14.479> for<00:05:14.660> diet<00:05:14.870> reasons<00:05:15.440> trying<00:05:15.620> to<00:05:15.710> lose

much<00:06:23.270> bigger<00:06:23.509> than<00:06:23.599> that<00:06:23.780> and<00:06:24.139> there's<00:06:24.259> so

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:24.409 
much bigger than that and there's so

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:26.020 
much bigger than that and there's so
much<00:06:24.530> that<00:06:24.830> I<00:06:24.860> learned<00:06:25.130> and<00:06:25.490> so<00:06:25.580> much<00:06:25.729> that<00:06:25.940> I'm

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030
