00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.680
 2 tar 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.490
 me 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.490
 me 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.130
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.460
 Hmm 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:50.500
 I can say to any god this shooting 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:56.410
 Nde would Saleh to the rear stairs with the camera from the beginning that I would be to check with your own eyes 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:01:00.010
 At first it has been overlooking his or here's for example doing this to check in the eye all the time 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:03.420
 I'll tell you to put the train with that back 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:07.380
 It is best to check with your own eyes first 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:12.409
 Since First of all does not go so much good at me thud hit that go 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.630
 So how do you choose the lens while grabbing points properly 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:20.060
 We say that shutter speed is fast or slow 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:23.350
 Is beautiful What should I put in my head horse like a shutter in advance to say 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.880
 So is another most important breakthrough 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.010
 Another one 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.470
 that 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.770
 Come to associate 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:36.469
 For example 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:41.509
 Because there is a lot of schools and universities on this day 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:48.350
 Something is a bit different today and feels like today's wind collagen, it 's white and thin in the blue sky 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:50.790
 I put an image in the park and train here while being in the tennis court Grand Marquee behind 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:56.100
 After all come this is a region 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.970
 Getting out the check that kind but it is I think it's absolutely take no scene things in the other eye 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.320
 I will make an image in myself 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.320
 I think that's the way it works best 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.320
 Hmm 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.100
 Even if you take the same snow road, it is very important to say that the image 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:17.410
 Instead of taking up only the snowy road 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:23.320
 What whether running any place where snow-covered road it is also I who live in that there 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:26.750
 If you put the place where you have a connection in the screen, it will be with the previous railway photo 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:33.690
 I think Na Krka 0.00 or different feel is 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:39.390
 I in the inner city to such Fu in I hope also to Tteyuu local railway of local 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.380
 When I look for a spot, I feel that a landscape that I have never seen has appeared 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.140
 I will 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:52.500
 Select the flag another time Toka wonder if is better to say you were the individual location 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:55.520
 Pretty good and then come again to take while the 8 of Tteyuu Na or-General's good also to imagine 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.820
 I think that things are made 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.820
 2 minutes 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:11.180
 Now if from now 9 c Man Is not that there is quite a distance to the US's line 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:17.659
 It I'll also become the cause and was really softening hand depriving Follow 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:19.909
 If I just do this do I come blurred put the branch Toka's green leaves in front perspective is 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:24.130
 It's all about child compression 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:28.800
 It's a distant Titi but it's a big eye 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:32.390
 Well if you look like this from the same place, but from where 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:36.200
 This is also what confirmed in the eyes after all I wonder if good to 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.910
 Baptist is the first to think that all the cars get hot water 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:43.410
 Choose what you see and what 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:47.190
 If not, it is better to shoot with front blur 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:50.069
 The perspective is to raising atmosphere Toka and out 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.310
 It is necessary to watch such things as well 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.310
 2 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:00.660
 Don't worry too much about where you can see Sudo Sky, but that moment you get out of the tunnel 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:06.840
 It was come 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:09.720
 It would be nice if you listen to the sound of the train and listen to where it comes from the rear etc. 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.010
 That's right, she is pretty good at grabbing her 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:16.630
 Because it is already late after seeing 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.600
 If you feel like you are about to release the shutter to some extent while listening to the sound, the timing is 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.959
 I think it's easy to grasp 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.959
 Yup 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:30.640
 In the case of shooting moving objects, but in the case of shooting moving objects 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:36.550
 Or I've got quite say I Toka time lag 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:38.000
 Since the image is recorded person Mr. Press some time lag shutter the case of a digital camera 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:43.010
 I have time 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.380
 In the case of Nikon, there is almost no time lag and the moment the shutter is pressed 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:49.249
 Images are recorded 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:53.370
 That kind of strength of moving body photography is good after all 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:57.120
 To hand for what comes running after 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:01.529
 For the movement that goes straight ahead instead of the movement just beside 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:05.909
 There is the Tteyuu Ponty nuance auto focus 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:12.310
 The autofocus follows the direction you are heading 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:15.210
 Well to take this even come moving wind say this wonder if that very easy-to-use camera 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.210
 me 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.240
 Ah ah ah ah
