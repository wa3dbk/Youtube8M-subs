00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
kids ask me was it really that cold I

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.870 
kids ask me was it really that cold I
tell<00:02:50.760> them<00:02:50.970> yeah

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
tell them yeah

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.770 
tell them yeah
it<00:02:52.000> was<00:02:52.300> really<00:02:52.720> that<00:02:52.930> cold<00:02:53.260> but<00:02:54.100> now<00:02:54.780> the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
it was really that cold but now the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.230 
it was really that cold but now the
winter<00:02:56.380> is<00:02:56.650> not<00:02:56.860> my<00:02:57.070> main<00:02:57.280> problem<00:02:57.610> my<00:02:58.000> main

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
winter is not my main problem my main

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.300 
winter is not my main problem my main
problem<00:02:58.570> is<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:58.960> mutated<00:02:59.650> version<00:03:00.130> of<00:03:00.220> the

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
problem is a mutated version of the

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.300 
problem is a mutated version of the
micro<00:03:00.640> skeleton<00:03:01.150> that<00:03:01.720> I<00:03:01.840> still<00:03:02.410> need<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:03.040> kill

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
micro skeleton that I still need to kill

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.790 
micro skeleton that I still need to kill
because<00:03:03.880> of<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.210> high<00:03:04.420> source<00:03:05.080> of<00:03:05.290> protein

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
because of the high source of protein

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.210 
because of the high source of protein
and<00:03:07.200> killing<00:03:08.200> one<00:03:08.320> of<00:03:08.350> those<00:03:08.560> beasts<00:03:08.860> is

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
and killing one of those beasts is

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.760 
and killing one of those beasts is
really<00:03:09.670> crucial<00:03:10.000> for<00:03:10.210> a<00:03:10.420> survival<00:03:10.870> but<00:03:11.740> I

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
really crucial for a survival but I

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.970 
really crucial for a survival but I
should<00:03:12.190> not<00:03:12.340> be<00:03:12.370> sprinting<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.090> jumping

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
should not be sprinting and jumping

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.830 
should not be sprinting and jumping
hence<00:03:14.980> it'll<00:03:15.370> take<00:03:15.550> my<00:03:15.730> hunger<00:03:15.910> away<00:03:16.210> quite

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
hence it'll take my hunger away quite

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.320 
hence it'll take my hunger away quite

really<00:03:33.130> a<00:03:33.310> very<00:03:33.820> crucial<00:03:34.150> part<00:03:34.450> for<00:03:34.720> survival

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
really a very crucial part for survival

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.880 
really a very crucial part for survival
ha<00:03:35.830> cow<00:03:36.280> meat<00:03:36.540> very<00:03:37.540> famous<00:03:38.080> for<00:03:38.230> its<00:03:38.380> protein

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
ha cow meat very famous for its protein

carbohydrates which is really not that

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.500 
carbohydrates which is really not that
great<00:03:44.800> but<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:45.970> will<00:03:46.150> need<00:03:46.300> those

I<00:03:50.350> mean<00:03:50.950> regenerates<00:03:51.490> itself<00:03:51.580> so<00:03:53.130> yeah<00:03:54.130> I

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
I mean regenerates itself so yeah I

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.400 
I mean regenerates itself so yeah I
don't<00:03:54.580> I<00:03:55.120> do<00:03:55.180> not<00:03:55.510> know<00:03:55.720> what<00:03:55.900> I'm<00:03:56.020> talking

button and I get regeneration and I can

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.440 
button and I get regeneration and I can
either<00:04:07.360> barely<00:04:07.780> seeds<00:04:08.050> and<00:04:08.440> I<00:04:08.650> won't<00:04:09.130> get

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
either barely seeds and I won't get

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.590 
either barely seeds and I won't get
anything

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
anything

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.180 
anything
that's<00:04:11.520> what<00:04:12.520> survival<00:04:13.030> is<00:04:13.150> all<00:04:13.300> about<00:04:13.330> now

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
that's what survival is all about now

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.770 
that's what survival is all about now
after<00:04:15.190> making<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.640> shelter<00:04:16.060> points<00:04:16.450> so<00:04:16.600> we

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
after making the shelter points so we

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.110

to now the goal is not to waste any

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.740 
to now the goal is not to waste any
energy<00:05:46.070> by<00:05:46.580> running<00:05:46.820> which<00:05:47.330> I'm<00:05:47.540> already

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
energy by running which I'm already

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.140 
energy by running which I'm already
doing<00:05:48.260> but<00:05:48.860> I<00:05:49.160> have<00:05:49.400> to<00:05:49.520> do<00:05:49.610> with<00:05:49.730> that<00:05:49.850> because

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
doing but I have to do with that because

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.240 
doing but I have to do with that because
I<00:05:50.180> see<00:05:50.450> some<00:05:50.630> creepers<00:05:50.990> ahead<00:05:51.290> and<00:05:51.500> creepers

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
I see some creepers ahead and creepers

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.990 
I see some creepers ahead and creepers
can<00:05:53.210> be<00:05:53.510> really<00:05:53.990> crucial<00:05:54.560> for<00:05:54.590> survival<00:05:54.980> so<00:05:55.850> we

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
can be really crucial for survival so we

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.210 
can be really crucial for survival so we
need<00:05:56.180> to<00:05:56.300> do<00:05:56.510> this<00:05:56.720> we<00:05:57.380> need<00:05:57.410> to<00:05:57.590> watch<00:05:57.950> out

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
need to do this we need to watch out

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.520 
need to do this we need to watch out
because<00:05:58.700> their<00:05:59.210> explosion<00:05:59.810> rate<00:06:00.020> has<00:06:00.500> been

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
because their explosion rate has been

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.580 
because their explosion rate has been
really<00:06:00.920> high<00:06:01.100> this<00:06:01.160> year<00:06:01.400> and<00:06:01.850> this<00:06:02.530> this<00:06:03.530> is
