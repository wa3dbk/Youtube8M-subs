cooling<00:00:18.540> system<00:00:18.720> say<00:00:19.050> for<00:00:19.230> an<00:00:19.290> aircraft<00:00:19.439> after

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
cooling system say for an aircraft after

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.790 
cooling system say for an aircraft after
it's<00:00:20.279> all<00:00:20.460> figured<00:00:20.849> out<00:00:21.200> size<00:00:22.200> shape

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
it's all figured out size shape

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.250 
it's all figured out size shape
locations<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.939> stuff<00:00:24.090> like<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.539> what<00:00:25.140> they

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
locations and stuff like that what they

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.929 
locations and stuff like that what they
will<00:00:25.410> do<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.740> they<00:00:25.890> will<00:00:25.920> send<00:00:26.220> me<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.460> mock-up

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
will do is they will send me in mock-up

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.849 
will do is they will send me in mock-up
and<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.630> mock-up<00:00:27.840> would<00:00:28.170> look<00:00:28.320> like<00:00:28.470> something

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
and a mock-up would look like something

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.880 
and a mock-up would look like something
like<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.369> it's<00:00:29.939> not<00:00:30.150> very<00:00:30.359> pretty<00:00:30.630> but<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.470> gets

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
like so it's not very pretty but it gets

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.650 
like so it's not very pretty but it gets
the<00:00:32.040> message<00:00:32.189> across

what happens is these are the way I get

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.190 
what happens is these are the way I get
two<00:01:27.179> cores<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.869> will<00:01:28.619> get<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> cores<00:01:30.020> being<00:01:31.020> on

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
two cores I will get the cores being on

building two radiators of the same size
this<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.749> what<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.960> coral<00:01:34.200> header<00:01:34.409> two<00:01:34.619> header

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
this is what the coral header two header

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
cut it down this way this is a locked

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.629

because<00:01:51.149> what<00:01:51.299> they<00:01:51.389> do<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.600> they<00:01:51.810> will<00:01:52.049> say

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
because what they do is they will say

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.050 
because what they do is they will say
well<00:01:52.619> these<00:01:52.979> tanks<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.819> they<00:01:53.880> got<00:01:54.030> a

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
well these tanks on and they got a

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.690 
well these tanks on and they got a
special<00:01:54.240> process<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:55.139> way<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.340> which<00:01:56.520> they

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
special process that way in which they

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.359 
special process that way in which they
weld<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.259> but<00:01:58.259> what<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.649> say<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.159> when<00:01:59.340> a

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
weld it on but what I say is when a

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.249 
weld it on but what I say is when a
customer<00:01:59.579> gives<00:01:59.939> me<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.179> specifications<00:02:01.020> as

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
customer gives me the specifications as

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.649 
customer gives me the specifications as
far<00:02:01.499> as<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.710> width<00:02:01.859> is<00:02:02.039> concerned<00:02:02.429> I<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:03.479> cut

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
far as the width is concerned I can cut

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.870 
far as the width is concerned I can cut
it<00:02:03.749> down<00:02:03.899> cut<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.649> down<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.159> then<00:02:05.670> we<00:02:05.759> want

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
it down cut that down and then we want

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.240 
it down cut that down and then we want
to<00:02:05.909> do<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.209> I<00:02:06.329> bend<00:02:06.869> my<00:02:06.929> tanks<00:02:07.409> as<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.920> see<00:02:08.100> the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
to do is I bend my tanks as you see the

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.340 
to do is I bend my tanks as you see the
sample<00:02:08.610> here<00:02:08.850> this<00:02:09.630> is<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:09.899> all<00:02:10.110> gets

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
sample here this is this all gets

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.170 
sample here this is this all gets
cleaned<00:02:10.649> down<00:02:10.860> gotta<00:02:11.340> clean<00:02:11.550> all<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.880> welding

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
cleaned down gotta clean all the welding

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.130 
cleaned down gotta clean all the welding
flux<00:02:12.480> out<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.720> here<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:14.730> gets<00:02:14.970> put<00:02:15.240> on<00:02:15.420> like

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
flux out of here this gets put on like

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.640 
flux out of here this gets put on like
so<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:18.000> will<00:02:18.150> get<00:02:18.360> welded<00:02:18.750> TIG<00:02:19.290> weld<00:02:19.500> it

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
so and it will get welded TIG weld it

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
so and it will get welded TIG weld it
here

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
here

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.930 
here
and<00:02:20.730> there's<00:02:21.030> end<00:02:21.330> caps<00:02:21.599> that<00:02:22.520> end<00:02:23.520> caps<00:02:23.819> that

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
and there's end caps that end caps that

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.380 
and there's end caps that end caps that
get<00:02:24.180> put<00:02:24.390> on<00:02:24.420> like<00:02:25.410> say<00:02:25.650> like<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.280> this<00:02:27.150> gets

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
get put on like say like so this gets

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.720 
get put on like say like so this gets
all<00:02:27.569> welded<00:02:27.900> around<00:02:28.319> here<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.250> gets<00:02:29.520> welded

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
all welded around here and gets welded

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.690 
all welded around here and gets welded
down<00:02:30.000> here<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.510> then<00:02:31.110> I<00:02:31.230> put<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.430> this

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
down here and then I put the and this

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.479 
down here and then I put the and this
one<00:02:32.880> here<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.510> gonna<00:02:33.780> be<00:02:33.900> for<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.230> drain<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:35.459> that

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
one here is gonna be for a drain so that

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.520 
one here is gonna be for a drain so that
will<00:02:35.790> be<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.450> would<00:02:36.599> be<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.750> drain<00:02:37.170> put<00:02:37.440> in

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
will be that would be a drain put in

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.070 
will be that would be a drain put in
there<00:02:37.770> like<00:02:38.160> so

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
there like so

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.100 
there like so
and<00:02:40.080> then<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.350> have<00:02:40.530> your<00:02:41.510> your<00:02:42.510> other<00:02:42.750> tank

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
and then you have your your other tank

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.229 
and then you have your your other tank
which<00:02:43.739> will<00:02:44.010> as<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.580> can<00:02:44.730> see<00:02:44.880> on<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.120> other

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
which will as you can see on the other

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.320 
which will as you can see on the other
sample<00:02:45.720> it's<00:02:45.840> stepped<00:02:46.200> out<00:02:46.760> that<00:02:47.760> will<00:02:47.970> be<00:02:48.090> put

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
sample it's stepped out that will be put

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.180 
sample it's stepped out that will be put
on<00:02:48.590> like<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:51.019> then<00:02:52.019> okay<00:02:52.739> these<00:02:52.920> are<00:02:53.160> a

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
on like that and then okay these are a

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.640 
on like that and then okay these are a
little<00:02:53.340> longer<00:02:53.790> than<00:02:54.330> those<00:02:54.959> ones<00:02:55.290> over<00:02:55.410> there

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
little longer than those ones over there

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.590 
little longer than those ones over there
but<00:02:55.890> that'll<00:02:56.160> get<00:02:56.310> issued<00:02:56.670> out<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.120> welded<00:02:57.510> in

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
but that'll get issued out and welded in

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.289 
but that'll get issued out and welded in
there<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.980> will<00:02:59.130> be<00:02:59.190> cut<00:02:59.970> out<00:03:00.000> and

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
there and that will be cut out and

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.800 
there and that will be cut out and
welded<00:03:00.810> in<00:03:00.930> there<00:03:01.110> like<00:03:01.530> so<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:02.610> then<00:03:03.510> on<00:03:03.690> the

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
welded in there like so and then on the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.539 
welded in there like so and then on the
side<00:03:04.110> we<00:03:04.470> have<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:06.209> mounts<00:03:07.190> there<00:03:08.190> will<00:03:08.310> be<00:03:08.340> at

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
side we have the mounts there will be at

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.670 
side we have the mounts there will be at
another<00:03:09.150> plate<00:03:09.660> of<00:03:09.870> aluminum<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.319> it<00:03:10.590> would

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
another plate of aluminum that it would

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.380 
another plate of aluminum that it would
be<00:03:10.769> a<00:03:11.010> finish<00:03:11.489> off<00:03:11.670> plate<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.120> we're<00:03:12.269> going

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
be a finish off plate that we're going

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.750 
be a finish off plate that we're going
aside<00:03:12.810> here<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.350> on<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:13.890> side<00:03:14.160> here<00:03:14.580> just

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
aside here and on the side here just

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.900 
aside here and on the side here just
like<00:03:15.630> we<00:03:16.200> have<00:03:16.410> over<00:03:16.709> here<00:03:16.950> that<00:03:17.130> you'll<00:03:17.670> see

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
like we have over here that you'll see

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.340 
like we have over here that you'll see
this<00:03:18.500> this<00:03:19.500> piece<00:03:19.769> right<00:03:20.040> here<00:03:20.100> and<00:03:20.720> it<00:03:21.720> serves

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
this this piece right here and it serves

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.229 
this this piece right here and it serves
two<00:03:22.590> purposes<00:03:22.620> first<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.580> all<00:03:23.700> it<00:03:23.850> finishes

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
two purposes first of all it finishes

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.160 
two purposes first of all it finishes
off<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.420> side<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.900> red<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.500> also<00:03:26.070> it's<00:03:26.880> a

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
off the side the red and also it's a

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.530 
off the side the red and also it's a
it's<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.290> mount<00:03:28.560> flange<00:03:28.920> for<00:03:29.549> your<00:03:29.880> ducting<00:03:30.359> and

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
it's a mount flange for your ducting and

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.120 
it's a mount flange for your ducting and
then<00:03:31.079> off<00:03:31.410> that<00:03:31.709> will<00:03:32.640> will<00:03:33.120> be<00:03:33.269> welded<00:03:33.720> your

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
then off that will will be welded your

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.319 
then off that will will be welded your
your<00:03:35.130> mounts<00:03:35.579> like<00:03:36.650> approximately<00:03:37.650> there

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
your mounts like approximately there

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.789 
your mounts like approximately there
that's<00:03:39.329> where<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.630> mock-up<00:03:40.079> comes<00:03:40.320> into<00:03:40.590> play

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
that's where the mock-up comes into play

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.530 
that's where the mock-up comes into play
it<00:03:41.549> gives<00:03:41.760> me<00:03:41.880> all<00:03:41.910> my<00:03:42.180> specifications<00:03:44.540> then

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
it gives me all my specifications then

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.630 
it gives me all my specifications then
what<00:03:45.690> will<00:03:45.780> happen<00:03:45.810> is<00:03:46.260> before<00:03:46.680> I<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:47.100> cut<00:03:47.489> my

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
what will happen is before I I cut my

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.150 
what will happen is before I I cut my
inlets<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.299> outlet<00:03:48.630> tubes<00:03:48.930> in<00:03:49.200> I<00:03:49.410> will<00:03:49.920> drill

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
inlets and outlet tubes in I will drill

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.610 
inlets and outlet tubes in I will drill
this<00:03:50.280> hole<00:03:50.340> out<00:03:50.730> I<00:03:50.880> will<00:03:51.090> put<00:03:51.299> my<00:03:51.620> temperature

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
this hole out I will put my temperature

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.099 
this hole out I will put my temperature
probe<00:03:52.950> in<00:03:53.070> here<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.489> what<00:03:54.239> I<00:03:54.269> do<00:03:54.390> is<00:03:54.720> before<00:03:55.079> I

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
probe in here and what I do is before I

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.910 
probe in here and what I do is before I
proceed<00:03:55.739> any<00:03:56.190> further<00:03:56.359> on<00:03:57.359> it<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:58.049> pressurize

it I have a test tank a water test tank
and<00:04:01.680> I<00:04:01.739> pressurize<00:04:02.100> it<00:04:02.250> pressurize<00:04:03.030> it<00:04:03.060> with

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
and I pressurize it pressurize it with

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.590 
and I pressurize it pressurize it with
double<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:04.319> pressure<00:04:04.799> of<00:04:05.100> a<00:04:05.310> of<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.239> normal

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
double the pressure of a of the normal

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.410 
double the pressure of a of the normal
operations<00:04:07.350> it<00:04:07.590> could<00:04:07.980> operate<00:04:08.519> say<00:04:08.790> at<00:04:08.910> 16

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
operations it could operate say at 16

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.740 
operations it could operate say at 16
I'll<00:04:09.859> pressure<00:04:10.859> check<00:04:11.160> it<00:04:11.310> to<00:04:11.430> 30<00:04:11.670> 35<00:04:12.090> pounds

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
I'll pressure check it to 30 35 pounds

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.319 
I'll pressure check it to 30 35 pounds
this<00:04:13.350> way<00:04:13.530> gives<00:04:13.799> me<00:04:13.920> a<00:04:13.950> lot<00:04:14.220> of<00:04:14.250> leeway<00:04:14.489> as<00:04:15.090> far

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
this way gives me a lot of leeway as far

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.779 
this way gives me a lot of leeway as far
as<00:04:15.510> strength<00:04:16.320> is<00:04:16.440> concerned<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:17.070> what<00:04:17.669> I'm

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
as strength is concerned and what I'm

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.300 
as strength is concerned and what I'm
looking<00:04:17.970> at<00:04:18.359> is<00:04:18.690> this<00:04:19.560> is<00:04:19.739> a<00:04:19.769> very<00:04:20.010> critical

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
looking at is this is a very critical

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.870 
looking at is this is a very critical
weld<00:04:20.729> here<00:04:21.030> because<00:04:21.269> it's<00:04:21.450> very<00:04:21.510> very<00:04:22.260> thin

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
weld here because it's very very thin

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.250 
weld here because it's very very thin
and<00:04:24.020> this<00:04:25.020> well<00:04:25.289> here<00:04:25.740> has<00:04:26.550> to<00:04:26.729> be<00:04:26.760> welded

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
and this well here has to be welded

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.350

I<00:04:33.779> have<00:04:34.169> to<00:04:34.289> take<00:04:34.469> corrective<00:04:34.769> measures<00:04:35.309> to

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
I have to take corrective measures to

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.089 
I have to take corrective measures to
make<00:04:35.759> sure<00:04:35.909> it<00:04:36.029> doesn't<00:04:36.499> it<00:04:37.499> does<00:04:37.679> not<00:04:37.709> leak

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099 
make sure it doesn't it does not leak

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.759 
make sure it doesn't it does not leak
and<00:04:38.369> then<00:04:38.969> once<00:04:39.209> I<00:04:39.360> prove<00:04:40.019> in<00:04:40.169> and<00:04:40.319> out<00:04:40.439> that<00:04:40.679> it

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:40.769 
and then once I prove in and out that it

00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:42.979 
and then once I prove in and out that it
does<00:04:40.889> not<00:04:41.069> leak<00:04:41.369> then<00:04:41.939> I<00:04:42.089> can<00:04:42.269> proceed<00:04:42.719> with

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:42.989 
does not leak then I can proceed with

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:45.109 
does not leak then I can proceed with
putting<00:04:43.259> on<00:04:43.379> my<00:04:43.529> side<00:04:43.799> caps<00:04:44.129> my<00:04:44.489> mounts<00:04:44.939> and

putting on my side caps my mounts and
going<00:04:46.110> on<00:04:46.259> and<00:04:46.529> put<00:04:46.649> any<00:04:46.799> of<00:04:46.949> my<00:04:47.039> my<00:04:47.549> Inlet<00:04:47.939> and
