that they'd come back and share the

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.879 
that they'd come back and share the
benefit<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.910> hope<00:02:48.720> is<00:02:48.930> not<00:02:49.049> a<00:02:49.109> strategy<00:02:49.200> that

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
benefit and hope is not a strategy that

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:50.659 
benefit and hope is not a strategy that
we<00:02:50.010> want<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.190> rely<00:02:50.430> on

I<00:02:50.880> think<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.540> OAC<00:02:51.840> has<00:02:52.230> provided<00:02:52.560> that

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
I think the OAC has provided that

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.770 
I think the OAC has provided that
district<00:02:53.250> vision<00:02:53.639> and<00:02:53.790> implementation<00:02:54.510> our
