00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.480
 today we want to show how to tie here 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.340
 a pattern called astrakhan fur 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.990
 the report consists of 4 loops plus 2 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:20.420
 Edging and repeat repeated from 1 to 4 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:25.710
 a number so I already gained 18 loops and 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:31.650
 knitted 1 row purse further knit 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.079
 so edge we remove from the next loop 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.880
 knit 3 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.880
 facial back 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:46.950
 knit any facial purl 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:52.320
 for you the method further 3 loops together 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:01:01.260
 we knit the wrong side and again from 1 3 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:06.570
 face wrong face again 3 loops together 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.360
 knit seam loop and for 1 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.159
 knit 3 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:16.159
 face wrong side 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.159
 face 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:38.320
 3 loops together purl again from one 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:41.820
 we knit 3 face wrong side 3 loop 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.820
 together purl 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.979
 edge we had a second row 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.189
 the first row we knit inside out 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.649
 after a set of loops and then knit 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:09.700
 drawing and now the third row 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:12.860
 again purl loops as i said 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.890
 knot a seam loop as you 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.890
 conveniently 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.740
 and the last fourth row is knitting so 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:21.110
 we remove the edge and here we can 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:29.930
 see these three loops these three 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:32.840
 loops we knit together purl a of 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:38.510
 Now the next visible one loop's three 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.410
 loops here it is you from one knotted 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:49.270
 3 loops 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:49.270
 face wrong face 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.320
 3 loops together purl 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:13.870
 from one we impose 3 face wrong side 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:18.269
 face 3 loops together purl and for 1 3 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:25.080
 face and lock 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:25.080
 face 3 loops together purl 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.610
 due to be added on the emitter front 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:43.599
 back and front and edge 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:57.780
 knit 4 row and now we can already see 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:04.050
 as the box appears it will 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:09.690
 staggered it 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:12.080
 call now and this sample was connected 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.080
 earlier 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.980
 good luck to you
