today<00:00:13.940> we're<00:00:14.210> doing<00:00:14.389> the<00:00:14.570> maiden<00:00:15.019> flight<00:00:15.200> for

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:15.769 
today we're doing the maiden flight for

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.260 
today we're doing the maiden flight for
the<00:00:15.920> my<00:00:16.160> twin<00:00:16.520> dream<00:00:17.830> plane

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
the my twin dream plane

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.450 
the my twin dream plane
I'm<00:00:20.270> flying<00:00:20.750> this<00:00:20.960> plane<00:00:21.020> with<00:00:21.619> a<00:00:21.650> 10,000

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
I'm flying this plane with a 10,000

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.850 
I'm flying this plane with a 10,000
milliamp<00:00:22.730> battery<00:00:23.180> and<00:00:25.240> the<00:00:26.240> motors<00:00:26.960> the<00:00:27.470> all

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 
milliamp battery and the motors the all

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.920 
milliamp battery and the motors the all
of<00:00:28.040> the<00:00:28.189> electronics<00:00:28.820> are<00:00:29.029> coming<00:00:29.390> from<00:00:29.630> the

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
of the electronics are coming from the

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.840 
of the electronics are coming from the
same<00:00:30.140> manufacturer<00:00:30.910> my<00:00:31.910> fly<00:00:32.270> dream

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
same manufacturer my fly dream

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.709 
same manufacturer my fly dream
conditions<00:00:34.850> are<00:00:35.000> not<00:00:35.180> ideal<00:00:35.350> we<00:00:36.350> have<00:00:36.559> between

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
conditions are not ideal we have between

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.799 
conditions are not ideal we have between
six<00:00:38.719> and<00:00:38.899> ten<00:00:39.170> knots<00:00:39.440> of<00:00:39.649> wind<00:00:40.600> we're<00:00:41.600> using

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
six and ten knots of wind we're using

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.240 
six and ten knots of wind we're using
the<00:00:42.110> vector<00:00:42.350> for<00:00:42.800> flight<00:00:43.040> controller<00:00:43.540> and<00:00:45.250> we

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
the vector for flight controller and we

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.450 
the vector for flight controller and we
have<00:00:46.520> two<00:00:46.880> mobius<00:00:47.300> cameras<00:00:48.010> and<00:00:49.010> that<00:00:49.190> one

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
have two mobius cameras and that one

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.569 
have two mobius cameras and that one
didn't<00:00:49.760> work<00:00:49.940> and<00:00:50.890> here<00:00:51.890> one<00:00:52.160> did<00:00:52.340> work

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
didn't work and here one did work

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.080 
didn't work and here one did work
anyways<00:00:53.329> the<00:00:53.690> propellers<00:00:54.230> are<00:00:54.910> going<00:00:55.910> the

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
anyways the propellers are going the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.569 
anyways the propellers are going the
same<00:00:56.120> way

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
same way

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.979 
same way
counter<00:00:59.050> counter<00:01:00.050> propeller<00:01:00.470> and<00:01:01.840> you<00:01:02.840> wanna

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
counter counter propeller and you wanna

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.749 
counter counter propeller and you wanna
see<00:01:03.260> in<00:01:03.380> a<00:01:03.470> bit<00:01:03.680> that<00:01:03.950> the<00:01:04.100> take-off<00:01:04.519> is<00:01:04.579> a

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
see in a bit that the take-off is a

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.200 
see in a bit that the take-off is a
little<00:01:05.149> sketchy<00:01:05.770> because<00:01:06.770> we<00:01:07.220> didn't<00:01:07.549> get<00:01:07.970> the

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
little sketchy because we didn't get the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.020 
little sketchy because we didn't get the
right<00:01:09.140> CG<00:01:11.649> 3<00:01:12.649> inches<00:01:13.009> didn't<00:01:13.340> cut<00:01:13.520> it<00:01:13.549> I<00:01:13.820> think

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
right CG 3 inches didn't cut it I think

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.359 
right CG 3 inches didn't cut it I think
it<00:01:14.149> has<00:01:14.329> to<00:01:14.360> be<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:14.659> little<00:01:14.960> bit<00:01:16.270> just<00:01:18.159> to<00:01:19.159> take

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
it has to be a little bit just to take

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:42.639 
it has to be a little bit just to take
off<00:01:19.549> smooth<00:01:21.100> enjoy<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.249> play

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:54.050 

maybe<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> road<00:01:46.130> straight<00:01:47.130> into<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.520> road

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:12.160 

movie<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:58.180> on<00:01:58.360> 2d<00:01:59.039> 2d<00:02:00.039> no<00:02:00.430> home<00:02:00.670> 2d<00:02:01.570> hole

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.460 

once<00:02:12.740> filled<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.340> plane<00:02:13.610> flies<00:02:14.000> super<00:02:14.750> super

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
once filled the plane flies super super

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.850 
once filled the plane flies super super
slim<00:02:15.710> really<00:02:16.670> nice
