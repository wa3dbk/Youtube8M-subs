00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.800
 most of the technical team was the 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:57.800
 projection in the fortnight 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.620
 and until now the selection more 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.610
 exciting that I've had in my life 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.590
 first is a projection in cannes no 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.119

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.010
 first time I showed this movie to 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.960
 my mom already admitted 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.960
 also in that very particular context 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.590
 Well the Fortnight 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.080
 filmmakers is a parallel section of the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.800
 festival of cannes and is a section that 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.960
 It has a very particular history 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.820
 [Music] 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.979
 is one is a section that was created 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.420
 after May 68 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.119
 know a little what happens in france 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.650
 which was thought to happen 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.990
 a revolution a movement of 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.940
 students very loud the protests that 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.670
 have started on March 22 in under 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.740
 reach in the Latin Quarter of Paris the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.979
 magnitude of the manifestations increases 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.110
 and good in 68 it was canceled to infection of 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.290
 the facial of reeds some directors 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.550
 creating yourself to hit etc. etcetera 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.080
 all this strip of French cinema the 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.030
 institutes and universities are 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.640
 paralyzed by a strike that 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.100
 it extends to them day by day 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.380
 that it was not opportune to do with a 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.080
 film festival with champagne and you that 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.019
 while a revolution is happening 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.500
 in france not ignacio of this east 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.630
 movement of the director is the fortnight 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.870
 the fortnight of the filmmakers that 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:32.470
 He wanted to show another type of cinema 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:34.840
 [Music] 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.260
 the other projection that had a little bit that 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.820
 feeling of finding the public for 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.930
 the one that had been made a movie for 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.930
 prediction the festival of Cartagena 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.959
 in which 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.849
 in which the public really reacted 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.959
 in a very different way than as 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.959
 I had made a clove in meat 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.860
 [Music] 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.530
 I am very grateful to fix canal and 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.880
 opportunity that gives us power 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.630
 publicize 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.630
 short film rodrich 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:16.430
 I was very interested 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.760
 see the different action that was left 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.989
 The short film festival in Cartagena 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.989
 where it was presented 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.860
 [Music] 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:40.420
 the Cartagena the short 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:42.010
 it caused laughter hilarity while in cannes 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.530
 I think they looked at the story of a 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:51.510
 man of 48 years somehow 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.510
 failed in his life 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:02.680
 and a disease 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:11.120
 working with a very natural director 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.880
 I saw it as another job in my life 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.330
 to undertake I did not get older 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.330
 questions 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.550
 I was being divided by franc 

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:23.600
 [Music] 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:26.110
 no no 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.639
 the current 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.000
 and I wanted to be an actress 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.840
 in my times 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.660
 a childhood and youth 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.819
 and the family 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.819
 [Music] 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:50.660
 and the experience that I feel that 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.660
 [Music] 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.099
 the difficulty came 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:00.180
 by the situation of the road was the 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:02.130
 director is not easy to change 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.349
 completely the roles of authority 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.910
 even if it's the son who is 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:10.220
 directing one 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.480
 and that was the degree of difficulty 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.090
 two 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:17.030
 [Music] 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.980
 the actors in Rodriguez most had the 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.310
 script in the hands I never gave them 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.770
 a dash 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.110
 I never write the dialogues and what 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.120
 we had were situations from 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.620
 which they improviser you think 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.150
 that everyone who works feels 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.699
 divinely in works of the one one 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.350
 starts shows that it can and go for 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:34.669
 go ahead and the idea goes up 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.580
 it was that he stayed with a very 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:40.280
 natural that comes from improvisation 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.680
 but that the scenes were very clear 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.439
 since the fortnight is that really 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.330
 franco loggia is a great director has 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:51.530
 one has a unique voice has a style 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:54.289
 that is only yours and no one else's and I think 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.330
 which is also one is a fact of 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:58.159
 demonstrate shorts in the fortnight is a 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.250
 bet for the future I think they try 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:03.500
 from seeing news to the director to 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.150
 writing will become important in 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.880
 the future and I think that is the case of this 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.300
 is the case of franco 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.930
 [Music] 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:16.020
 and well I think is like turning the 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.560
 stop of a movement 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.750
 a little more wider and deeper than 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.610
 they are doing good the originals of 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.159
 the organizers of burgos shots from 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.930
 many years ago and that and that will continue 

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:28.990
 I think it's something that has a lot of future 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:34.829
 in this country 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:34.829
 [Music] 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.780
 but I think the short is the beginning of 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.610
 everything is really taking out the monotony of 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.889
 the exceptional oriental organized 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.650
 listen now what an artist is looking for 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:49.389
 show his work the short is important 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.750
 depending on who the person is 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:55.450
 he does it I think the young directors 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.680
 we have an obligation to make short 

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.510
 so do not say it seems very important to me 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.340
 especially here in Colombia as these 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:04.419
 spaces did not exist the first time 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:07.000
 I come to the place and I received sorrows at the 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:08.500
 input and I think it's part of all this 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.020
 atmosphere that looks like the very 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.720
 innovators 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:16.300
 and where are young people and all the 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:19.090
 ages to make use of the internet 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.490
 of spaces like all 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:24.449
 movement characteristics more than 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.449
 simply a sample
