00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.260
  Axel Månsson A/S situated in Brande, Western Jutland is one of Denmark's largest manufacturers of iceberg lettuce.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.740
 In the course of a season there is produced over 20 million conventional - 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.900
- and 3,5 million organic iceberg lettuce supplied to the Danish retail, food industry and for export.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.760
There are also onions and other types of salads at a total of 650 acres belonging to the company.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.680
In the next few minutes, we follow how organic iceberg lettuce is produced by Axel Månsson A/S.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.280
Before production can begin , there must be a comprehensive plan -

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.420
- such as taking into account how many lettuce sprouts customers will buy and when.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.800
Then a field plan is established for each field, so they have control over how many and which - 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.580
- species and varieties of lettuce to be grown and when it should be ready for delivery to customers.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.180
And then the farming work can begin.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:05.780
Before planting fields are being plowed and harrowed. Immediately after the soil is fertilized with manure.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.960
Finally the ground is readied and shaped into beds, so  it is  ready for planting.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.320
All tractors used on the fields run by GPS so they always run in the same rutes on the field.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.780
In this way, the soil in which the plants grow is not pressed hard by the tractor's heavy wheels -

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.580
- but retains a loose and good structure, so plant roots can better grab a foothold and grow.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.140
Shortly after the seeding begins. 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.560
The plants come from seedling growers from the Netherlands and Germany, which have propagated plants from seed to small plants.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.020
The planting is done by machine, but some work is still necessary to perform manually.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.180
After planting, plants that are planted a little crooked or not tightly enough, will be pushed a little into the ground -

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.780
- so plants can get the best possible hold on the soil with their roots before they really need to start to grow

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.680
It is important not to plant the same crop in the same field year after year, in order to prevent diseases and pests on the plants. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Therefore planting different crops in the same field is done - also called crop rotation.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.640
Now, the lettuce is left to grow for about 40 days before it can be harvested. 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.460
During this period it is watered, fertilized and kept free of weeds.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.620
In organic iceberg lettuce is weeded with a hatch robot which is also controlled by GPS.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.140
The robot hatches gently around each lettuce plant. 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.300
It is weeded at least twice with weeding robot through the growing season and weeded once by hand.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.020
It takes continuous soil samples to find out if there is a lack of nitrogen in the soil.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.960
 Missing nitrogen must be added to ensure that the lettuce grows satisfactorily.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.760
The lettuce is typically fertilized a few times during the growing season.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.320
The fertilizer is based on potato juices and manure from Axel Månsson A / S own organic chickens.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.900
In periods without rain the lettuce is watered 3 times a week.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.840
After approx. 30 days the lettuce close ranks -

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.580
-- which means, the lettuce is large enough to fill the entire field and it is almost impossible to see the soil between the rows.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.320
Now it is ready to be harvested.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.760
Before harvesting lettuce the quality is assessed. The size and structure of the lettuce is checked together with taste testing. 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.920
The harvest is done by hand, as it is most gentle on the fresh and perfectly crisp lettuce.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.300
Each head of lettuce is cut and packed in the bag and in boxes on site.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.380
That way unnecessary handling of the salad is avoided and it retains its freshness and crispness during transport -

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.560
- back to the store and all the way out to consumers. 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.740
After harvesting the lettuce is taken to distributors or stores. 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.740
Before shipment lettuce is weighed and quality checked yet again.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:02.400
Axel Månsson A / S have made a virtue out of cooling the lettuce as quick as possible, in order to maintain the good quality.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.740
In less than 20 minutes the lettuce is cooled from 25 to 2 degrees -

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.460
- then the lettuce is placed in the warehouse, so that it is ready for collection and further transportation.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:23.100
In high season there are daily more than 10 trucks from Axel Månsson A / S to customers with freshly harvested lettuce.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.760
Axel Månsson A / S specialize in growing fresh organic quality iceberg lettuce. 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.760
An art that requires careful planning, nurturing care, grooming and Good Agricultural Practice to succeed.
