00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
actually paid pretty good attention to

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.250 
actually paid pretty good attention to
it<00:00:17.400> but<00:00:17.609> on<00:00:17.760> on<00:00:18.060> all<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.720> pretty<00:00:18.869> good<00:00:19.080> fight

it but on on all is a pretty good fight

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.890 
it but on on all is a pretty good fight
in<00:00:19.529> code<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.490> mean<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.300> fight<00:00:21.510> pretty<00:00:21.720> much

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
in code I mean I the fight pretty much

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.019 
in code I mean I the fight pretty much
went<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.410> way<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.279> thought<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.699> was<00:00:23.789> going

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
went the way that I thought it was going

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.599 
went the way that I thought it was going
but<00:00:24.380> it<00:00:25.380> was<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.560> couple<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.949> like<00:00:26.070> little<00:00:26.250> snags

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
but it was a couple of like little snags

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.910 
but it was a couple of like little snags
in<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.849> road<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.420> figured<00:00:27.779> like<00:00:27.869> um<00:00:28.140> he'd

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
in the road like I figured like um he'd

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.710 
in the road like I figured like um he'd
be<00:00:29.070> like<00:00:29.340> Cotto<00:00:29.699> would<00:00:29.910> be<00:00:30.000> really<00:00:30.210> active<00:00:30.480> and

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
be like Cotto would be really active and

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.179 
be like Cotto would be really active and
aggressive<00:00:30.779> in<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.289> opening<00:00:31.619> round<00:00:31.679> which<00:00:32.040> it

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
gonna walk Cotto down and pepper him

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.080

with<00:00:45.960> jabs<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.100> hooks<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.489> uppercuts<00:00:47.879> inner

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
with jabs and hooks and uppercuts inner

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.410 
with jabs and hooks and uppercuts inner
and<00:00:48.360> like<00:00:48.600> everything<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.140> between<00:00:50.270> it<00:00:51.270> was<00:00:51.390> a

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
and like everything in between it was a

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.930 
and like everything in between it was a
nasty<00:00:51.750> cut<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.410> opened<00:00:52.710> up<00:00:52.770> over<00:00:53.010> kodos

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
nasty cut that opened up over kodos

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.270 
nasty cut that opened up over kodos
right<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.449> think<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.899> was<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.289> um<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:56.100> was

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
right I think it was that um that was

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.700 
right I think it was that um that was
really<00:00:56.520> bothered<00:00:56.789> him<00:00:56.820> during<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.120> fight<00:00:57.329> and

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
really bothered him during a fight and

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.200 
really bothered him during a fight and
Joshua<00:00:58.710> Clottey<00:00:58.829> he<00:00:59.190> exploited<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.030> i

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
Joshua Clottey he exploited it but i

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.610 
Joshua Clottey he exploited it but i
would<00:01:00.359> have<00:01:00.449> exploited<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.140> lot<00:01:01.440> better

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
would have exploited it a lot better

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.170 
would have exploited it a lot better
than<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:01.980> because<00:01:02.129> during<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.699> fight<00:01:02.940> i<00:01:02.969> was

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
than that because during the fight i was

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.609 
than that because during the fight i was
like<00:01:03.300> oh<00:01:03.480> come<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.290> he's<00:01:04.439> leaving
