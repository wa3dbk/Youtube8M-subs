00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
had a problem in just being aware that

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.340 
had a problem in just being aware that
it's<00:02:26.550> there<00:02:26.640> helps<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.300> lot<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:27.750> you're<00:02:28.260> a

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
it's there helps a lot so you're a

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.630 
it's there helps a lot so you're a
little<00:02:28.410> bit<00:02:28.560> more<00:02:28.740> careful<00:02:29.160> with<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.400> but<00:02:29.520> then

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
little bit more careful with it but then

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.580 
little bit more careful with it but then
is<00:02:29.790> something<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.180> consider<00:02:30.960> about<00:02:31.140> this<00:02:31.380> back

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
is something to consider about this back

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.710 
is something to consider about this back
because<00:02:31.800> this<00:02:32.160> latch<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.640> metal<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.210> it<00:02:33.540> can

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
because this latch is metal and it can

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.150 
because this latch is metal and it can
do<00:02:33.900> some<00:02:34.110> damage<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.500> your<00:02:34.560> equipment<00:02:34.650> if

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
you know to protect it works fairly well

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.300 
you know to protect it works fairly well
again<00:03:10.440> it's<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.650> little<00:03:10.860> bit<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.100> tight<00:03:11.280> fit

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
prime as an extra this works perfectly

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.280

well<00:03:32.190> for<00:03:32.430> that<00:03:32.520> and<00:03:32.910> then<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:33.780> has<00:03:33.900> two<00:03:34.080> velcro

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
well for that and then it has two velcro

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.200 
well for that and then it has two velcro
pockets<00:03:34.770> right<00:03:34.890> here<00:03:34.950> in<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.220> front<00:03:35.490> which

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
pockets right here in the front which

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.150 
pockets right here in the front which
kind<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.540> expand<00:03:36.960> federal<00:03:37.470> bunch<00:03:37.770> of<00:03:37.860> stuff<00:03:38.040> in

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
kind of expand federal bunch of stuff in

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.540 
kind of expand federal bunch of stuff in
there<00:03:38.250> CF<00:03:38.520> cards<00:03:39.140> you<00:03:40.140> know<00:03:40.230> your<00:03:40.470> iPhone<00:03:41.250> and

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
there CF cards you know your iPhone and

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.480 
there CF cards you know your iPhone and
things<00:03:41.760> like<00:03:41.880> that<00:03:41.940> so<00:03:42.450> in<00:03:43.350> general<00:03:43.650> it's<00:03:44.250> a

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
things like that so in general it's a

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.950 
things like that so in general it's a
really<00:03:44.820> good<00:03:44.940> bag<00:03:45.090> that<00:03:45.240> I<00:03:45.300> recommend<00:03:45.720> for<00:03:45.780> the

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
really good bag that I recommend for the

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.100 
really good bag that I recommend for the
price<00:03:46.200> it's<00:03:46.650> not<00:03:46.800> real<00:03:47.040> expensive<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:48.300> I

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
price it's not real expensive and I

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.660 
price it's not real expensive and I
think<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.470> lot<00:03:49.620> of<00:03:49.680> people<00:03:49.860> swear<00:03:50.100> by<00:03:50.280> this<00:03:50.340> just

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
think a lot of people swear by this just

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.210 
think a lot of people swear by this just
because<00:03:50.970> it's<00:03:51.410> sort<00:03:52.410> of<00:03:52.440> a<00:03:52.560> workhorse<00:03:52.920> type

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
because it's sort of a workhorse type

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.530 
because it's sort of a workhorse type
bag<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.640> it<00:03:53.700> doesn't<00:03:53.970> really<00:03:54.150> look<00:03:54.300> like

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
bag and it doesn't really look like

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.970 
bag and it doesn't really look like
anything<00:03:54.720> special<00:03:55.080> like<00:03:55.530> some<00:03:55.710> of<00:03:55.800> the<00:03:55.860> other

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
anything special like some of the other

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.860 
anything special like some of the other
bags<00:03:56.520> out<00:03:56.820> there<00:03:57.030> like<00:03:57.210> for<00:03:57.750> instance

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
bags out there like for instance

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.200 
bags out there like for instance
billingham<00:03:58.560> bags<00:03:58.860> which<00:03:59.430> incidentally<00:03:59.910> are

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
billingham bags which incidentally are

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.360 
billingham bags which incidentally are
like<00:04:00.360> double<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.810> cost<00:04:00.960> of<00:04:01.200> these<00:04:01.370> billingham

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
like double the cost of these billingham

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.580 
like double the cost of these billingham
bags<00:04:03.270> are<00:04:03.570> very<00:04:03.780> nice<00:04:03.990> they're<00:04:04.290> made<00:04:04.410> in
