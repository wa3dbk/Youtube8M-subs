00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hi this is a new practical lesson on 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.060
 site frame com in this park now 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.350
 I will photograph spectacular stunts on 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.210
 skate and bmx 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.429
 and my friend will be seriously lich 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.059
 for today's shooting i took sony alpha 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.099
 72 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.109
 This mirrorless camera with full frame 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.390
 a matrix and also 5 axial system 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.130
 image stabilization is also in her 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.109
 good hybrid autofocus with great 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.289
 the number of autofocus points 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.849
 plus I have a 2470 lens with aperture 4 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.529
 the trick will be that all I will 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.060
 illuminate a pair of external flashes and 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.740
 combine it all with light 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.790
 environment in order to 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.320
 use flashes of any 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.070
 I will not use the manufacturer 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.780
 gum tm 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.780
 and I will adjust their power of rotations 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.280
 before filming you need to look 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.410
 location and identify places for future 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.480
 flash tricks will make 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.220
 our photos are more juicy and expensive 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.630
 and of course it will allow to shoot in the dark 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.580
 the rooms are very good 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.290
 fix the movement of our model 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.119
 initial value is easy to pick up 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.160
 setting the exposure in the background 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.930
 because during flash shooting not 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.640
 will affect it and will illuminate 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.100
 only the model is determined by the place 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.410
 shooting we can already arrange flash 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.930
 included and tune power somewhere 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.030
 at level 1 32 or one sixteenth 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.070
 from full power to finally 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.320
 make sure our settings are correct 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.670
 need to do a couple of test photos and 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.920
 Now we are ready for double for double 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.660
 taking pictures when shooting extreme 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.520
 sports are very common 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.420
 is the bottom angle when you sit 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.340
 either lie 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.080
 and the trick happens a little bit above you 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.700
 drawings from this angle we will 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.649
 use the swivel screen he 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.300
 greatly facilitate our task also 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.310
 tracking autofocus allows us without 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.110
 blunders shoot then when the object 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.240
 moves on us and also catch a target in 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.770
 the most peak place naturally important 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.750
 use wide-angle lenses 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.800
 so that everything could fit in the frame 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.720
 because we can't always 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.910
 predict the movement of our model for 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.950
 getting a good shot I recommend 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.690
 change angles more often and not forget 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.640
 change the position of the flashes because even 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.930
 several centimeters can substantially 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.700
 affect the light pattern 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.130
 I use one of my flashes as 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.260
 drawing light and the second is how Backlight 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.120
 allows me to separate an athlete from 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.200
 background and make sure that he doesn't 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.200
 disappeared into the dark 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.380
 it was a practical lesson on the site to 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.880
 fights in which we studied 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.680
 take pictures of dynamic scenes with 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.400
 by external light subscribe rates 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.400
