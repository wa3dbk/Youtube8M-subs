well<00:00:02.879> today<00:00:03.179> I<00:00:03.210> decided<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.810> do<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:03.959> little

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
well today I decided to do a little

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.150 
well today I decided to do a little
tune-up<00:00:04.650> on<00:00:04.890> my<00:00:05.810> club<00:00:06.810> car<00:00:07.109> electric<00:00:08.010> golf

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
tune-up on my club car electric golf

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.180 
tune-up on my club car electric golf
cart<00:00:08.690> this<00:00:09.690> is<00:00:09.809> my<00:00:10.010> 1981<00:00:11.030> club<00:00:12.030> car<00:00:12.330> electric

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
cart this is my 1981 club car electric

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.010 
cart this is my 1981 club car electric
golf<00:00:14.190> cart<00:00:14.580> 36<00:00:15.210> volt<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:16.369> I<00:00:17.369> just<00:00:18.000> pulled<00:00:18.869> it

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
golf cart 36 volt and I just pulled it

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.410 
golf cart 36 volt and I just pulled it
in<00:00:19.109> here<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.619> thought<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:19.830> would<00:00:20.300> fill<00:00:21.300> up

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
in here and I thought I would fill up

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.820 
in here and I thought I would fill up
the<00:00:21.539> batteries<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.199> make<00:00:22.289> sure<00:00:22.410> they're<00:00:22.619> full

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
the batteries and make sure they're full

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.939 
the batteries and make sure they're full
give<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.279> good<00:00:23.490> charge<00:00:23.789> clean<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.949> excess

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
give it a good charge clean of excess

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.099 
give it a good charge clean of excess
battery<00:00:26.400> acid<00:00:26.580> off<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.119> doesn't<00:00:27.300> corrode<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
battery acid off so doesn't corrode the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.450 
battery acid off so doesn't corrode the
frame<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:29.720> so<00:00:30.720> on<00:00:30.960> but<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.529> thought<00:00:32.099> I'd<00:00:32.250> show

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
frame and so on but I thought I'd show

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.700 
frame and so on but I thought I'd show
you<00:00:32.489> something<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:32.969> did<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:34.230> might<00:00:34.410> help<00:00:34.590> some

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
you something I did it might help some

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.389 
you something I did it might help some
of<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> future

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
of you in the future

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.810 
of you in the future
this<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.520> your<00:00:38.640> basic<00:00:38.850> electric<00:00:39.840> golf<00:00:40.020> cart

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
this is your basic electric golf cart

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.470 
this is your basic electric golf cart
it's<00:00:41.820> got<00:00:42.260> six<00:00:43.260> six<00:00:44.010> volt<00:00:44.309> batteries<00:00:45.149> and

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
it's got six six volt batteries and

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.110 
it's got six six volt batteries and
series<00:00:46.050> for<00:00:46.379> 36<00:00:46.890> volts<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:49.219> on<00:00:50.219> these<00:00:50.820> older

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
series for 36 volts and on these older

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.630 
series for 36 volts and on these older
ones<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:52.140> speed<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.680> controlled<00:00:53.129> by<00:00:53.600> relays

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
ones the speed is controlled by relays

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.580 
ones the speed is controlled by relays
try<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.699> get<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> shot<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.300> that<00:01:00.079> and<00:01:01.079> you'll<00:01:01.350> see

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
try to get a shot of that and you'll see

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.870 
try to get a shot of that and you'll see
that<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:01.949> have<00:01:01.980> five<00:01:02.640> relays<00:01:03.180> wired<00:01:03.660> there<00:01:04.880> and

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
that I have five relays wired there and

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.679 
that I have five relays wired there and
then<00:01:06.270> above<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.140> relays<00:01:07.530> are<00:01:08.479> these<00:01:09.479> big

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
then above the relays are these big

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.149 
then above the relays are these big
resistor<00:01:10.200> coils<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:12.799> basically<00:01:13.799> how<00:01:14.010> it

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
resistor coils and basically how it

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.990 
resistor coils and basically how it
works<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.990> those<00:01:15.990> relay<00:01:16.790> relays<00:01:17.790> are

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
works is those relay relays are

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.859 
works is those relay relays are
energized<00:01:18.479> by<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> micro<00:01:19.799> switch<00:01:20.070> that's<00:01:20.869> under

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
energized by a micro switch that's under

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.359 
energized by a micro switch that's under
the<00:01:22.340> floor<00:01:23.340> pan<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.229> as<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.500> press<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.100> pedal

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the floor pan and as you press the pedal

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.399 
the floor pan and as you press the pedal
down<00:01:27.110> micro<00:01:28.110> switches<00:01:28.380> engage<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.850> different

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
down micro switches engage the different

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.940 
down micro switches engage the different
coils<00:01:31.409> on<00:01:31.770> these<00:01:31.979> relays<00:01:32.909> here<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.960> bridge<00:01:34.680> out

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
coils on these relays here to bridge out

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.980 
coils on these relays here to bridge out
those<00:01:35.220> resistors<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:37.850> if<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.030> have<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.390> where

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
those resistors so if you have it where

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.170 
those resistors so if you have it where
you're<00:01:40.110> running<00:01:40.229> low<00:01:40.530> speed<00:01:40.920> all<00:01:41.610> those

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
you're running low speed all those

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.940 
you're running low speed all those
resistors<00:01:42.810> will<00:01:42.990> be<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.259> series<00:01:43.649> with<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
resistors will be in series with the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.940 
resistors will be in series with the
motor<00:01:44.570> which<00:01:45.570> will<00:01:45.780> cause<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.020> golfcart<00:01:46.680> to

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
motor which will cause the golfcart to

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.090 
motor which will cause the golfcart to
run<00:01:47.549> slow<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.299> then<00:01:49.020> as<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.470> push<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.829> pedal

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
run slow and then as you push the pedal

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.330 
run slow and then as you push the pedal
down<00:01:50.630> more<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.840> more<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.140> those<00:01:52.350> relays<00:01:52.890> will

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
down more and more of those relays will

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.020 
down more and more of those relays will
and<00:01:53.689> energize<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.079> bridge<00:01:55.829> out<00:01:56.100> those

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
and energize and bridge out those

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.560 
and energize and bridge out those
resistors<00:01:57.689> until<00:01:58.729> you<00:01:59.729> have<00:01:59.880> nothing<00:02:00.240> but<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
resistors until you have nothing but the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.490 
resistors until you have nothing but the
motor<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.369> batteries<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.990> series<00:02:03.990> with

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
motor and the batteries in series with

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.109 
motor and the batteries in series with
no<00:02:04.680> resistance<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.610> gives<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.000> the

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
no resistance and that gives you the

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.390 
no resistance and that gives you the
highest<00:02:06.149> speed

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
highest speed

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.310 
highest speed
and<00:02:07.850> assistant<00:02:08.360> works<00:02:08.540> pretty<00:02:08.720> good<00:02:08.840> I<00:02:09.020> mean

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
and assistant works pretty good I mean

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.930 
and assistant works pretty good I mean
I've<00:02:09.440> had<00:02:09.619> this<00:02:09.800> thing<00:02:10.010> for<00:02:10.340> many<00:02:10.640> many<00:02:10.850> years

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
I've had this thing for many many years

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.290 
I've had this thing for many many years
and<00:02:12.160> there<00:02:13.160> is<00:02:13.280> one<00:02:13.580> problem<00:02:13.880> with<00:02:14.270> it

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
and there is one problem with it

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.300 
and there is one problem with it
especially<00:02:15.140> if<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.290> use<00:02:15.350> these<00:02:15.650> golf<00:02:15.920> carts

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
especially if you use these golf carts

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.930 
especially if you use these golf carts
for<00:02:16.550> long<00:02:16.820> long-term<00:02:18.010> usage<00:02:19.010> like<00:02:19.460> riding

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
for long long-term usage like riding

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.000 
for long long-term usage like riding
around<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.180> neighborhood<00:02:20.240> and<00:02:20.870> you<00:02:21.050> ride<00:02:21.830> it

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
around the neighborhood and you ride it

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.150 
around the neighborhood and you ride it
several<00:02:22.400> miles<00:02:22.610> or<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.260> those<00:02:24.260> relay<00:02:24.680> coils

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
several miles or so those relay coils

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.940 
several miles or so those relay coils
can<00:02:25.490> get<00:02:25.640> very<00:02:25.910> hot<00:02:26.210> even<00:02:27.050> though<00:02:27.170> they're

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
can get very hot even though they're

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.910 
can get very hot even though they're
probably<00:02:28.220> designed<00:02:28.820> for<00:02:29.060> continuous<00:02:29.270> duty<00:02:29.920> I

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
probably designed for continuous duty I

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.120 
probably designed for continuous duty I
found<00:02:31.700> that<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.360> relays<00:02:32.930> will<00:02:33.260> go<00:02:33.470> bad<00:02:33.680> after

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
found that the relays will go bad after

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.960 
found that the relays will go bad after
a<00:02:34.160> period<00:02:34.550> of<00:02:34.580> time<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:36.280> actually<00:02:37.280> open<00:02:37.790> one

a period of time and actually open one
up<00:02:38.120> to<00:02:38.240> see<00:02:38.420> if<00:02:38.480> I<00:02:38.540> could<00:02:38.720> tell<00:02:38.900> what<00:02:39.080> was<00:02:39.110> going

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
up to see if I could tell what was going

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.520 
up to see if I could tell what was going
on<00:02:39.590> I<00:02:39.860> think<00:02:39.920> I<00:02:40.160> discovered<00:02:40.310> what<00:02:40.820> it<00:02:40.910> was

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
on I think I discovered what it was

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.350 
on I think I discovered what it was
anyway<00:02:42.530> I'm<00:02:43.520> going<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.820> show<00:02:43.970> you<00:02:44.030> the

here<00:03:03.050> and<00:03:03.910> when<00:03:04.910> it's<00:03:05.060> energized<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:06.620> relay

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
here and when it's energized you relay

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.270 
here and when it's energized you relay
coil<00:03:07.510> you<00:03:08.510> supply<00:03:08.840> 36<00:03:09.380> volts<00:03:09.710> across<00:03:09.800> these

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
coil you supply 36 volts across these

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.590 
coil you supply 36 volts across these
two<00:03:10.959> studs<00:03:11.959> here<00:03:12.350> and<00:03:12.580> causes<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.790> coil<00:03:14.450> to

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
two studs here and causes the coil to

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.360 
two studs here and causes the coil to
magnetically<00:03:15.440> pull<00:03:15.709> in<00:03:15.920> a<00:03:16.160> plunger<00:03:17.150> that

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
magnetically pull in a plunger that

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.340 
magnetically pull in a plunger that
makes<00:03:19.370> contact<00:03:19.880> with<00:03:20.060> these<00:03:20.330> two<00:03:20.570> studs<00:03:20.959> here

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
makes contact with these two studs here

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.100 
makes contact with these two studs here
and<00:03:21.880> then<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:22.970> current<00:03:23.300> flows<00:03:23.510> through<00:03:23.540> the

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
and then the current flows through the

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.490 
and then the current flows through the
two<00:03:24.770> large<00:03:25.010> studs<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.930> like<00:03:27.110> I<00:03:27.200> said<00:03:27.410> the

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
two large studs and like I said the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.710 
two large studs and like I said the
problem<00:03:27.890> I<00:03:28.040> found<00:03:28.280> that<00:03:28.640> after<00:03:28.970> writing<00:03:29.600> these

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
problem I found that after writing these

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.520 
problem I found that after writing these
golf<00:03:30.050> carts<00:03:30.440> for<00:03:30.650> several<00:03:31.160> miles<00:03:31.370> or<00:03:31.700> so<00:03:32.530> these

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
golf carts for several miles or so these

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.190 
golf carts for several miles or so these
relays<00:03:34.010> are<00:03:34.310> on<00:03:34.520> continuously<00:03:35.300> which<00:03:35.750> causes

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
relays are on continuously which causes

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.740 
relays are on continuously which causes
them<00:03:36.320> to<00:03:36.350> get<00:03:36.590> kind<00:03:36.830> of<00:03:36.890> hot<00:03:37.070> and<00:03:37.750> I've

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
them to get kind of hot and I've

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.900 
them to get kind of hot and I've
actually<00:03:38.959> taken<00:03:39.290> one<00:03:39.590> apart<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:40.190> found<00:03:40.580> that

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
actually taken one apart and found that

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.740 
actually taken one apart and found that
what<00:03:41.120> happens<00:03:41.540> is<00:03:41.780> that<00:03:42.500> this<00:03:42.950> plunger<00:03:43.750> gets

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
what happens is that this plunger gets

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.550 
what happens is that this plunger gets
tight<00:03:45.080> inside<00:03:45.980> here<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:46.750> it<00:03:47.750> doesn't<00:03:48.320> burn

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
tight inside here and it doesn't burn

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.320 
tight inside here and it doesn't burn
the<00:03:48.709> coil<00:03:48.980> out<00:03:49.190> but<00:03:49.580> the<00:03:49.700> coil<00:03:50.000> actually

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
the coil out but the coil actually

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.840 
the coil out but the coil actually
swells<00:03:51.050> a<00:03:51.380> little<00:03:51.590> bit<00:03:51.769> inside<00:03:52.280> there<00:03:52.580> and

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
swells a little bit inside there and

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.560 
swells a little bit inside there and
locks<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.330> plunger<00:03:53.750> down<00:03:54.489> inside<00:03:55.570> the

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
locks the plunger down inside the

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.620 
locks the plunger down inside the
assembly<00:03:57.530> and<00:03:58.070> it<00:03:58.850> prevents<00:03:59.239> it<00:03:59.300> from<00:03:59.420> making

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
assembly and it prevents it from making

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.250 
assembly and it prevents it from making
contact<00:04:00.519> with<00:04:01.519> the<00:04:01.850> two<00:04:02.090> studs<00:04:02.450> up<00:04:02.660> here<00:04:02.959> and

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
contact with the two studs up here and

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.600 
contact with the two studs up here and
when<00:04:03.769> it<00:04:03.890> does<00:04:04.040> that<00:04:04.360> it<00:04:05.360> causes<00:04:05.570> the<00:04:06.610> golf

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
when it does that it causes the golf

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.520 
when it does that it causes the golf
cart<00:04:07.910> to<00:04:08.090> stop<00:04:08.330> working<00:04:08.780> in<00:04:09.110> some<00:04:09.320> of<00:04:09.440> the

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
cart to stop working in some of the

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.729 
cart to stop working in some of the
speeds<00:04:09.860> or<00:04:10.160> if<00:04:10.910> it's<00:04:11.660> there's<00:04:12.320> one<00:04:12.530> of<00:04:12.650> them

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
speeds or if it's there's one of them

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.130 
speeds or if it's there's one of them
here<00:04:12.980> that<00:04:13.010> actually<00:04:13.519> turns<00:04:13.910> on<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.959> whole

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
here that actually turns on the whole

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.900 
here that actually turns on the whole
string<00:04:15.470> of<00:04:15.620> the<00:04:15.709> relays<00:04:16.040> the<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:16.640> very<00:04:16.850> first

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
string of the relays the the very first

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.750 
string of the relays the the very first
one<00:04:17.390> you<00:04:17.540> see<00:04:17.750> there<00:04:18.040> closest

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
one you see there closest

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.390 
one you see there closest
to<00:04:20.510> the<00:04:20.600> right<00:04:20.750> hand<00:04:21.020> side<00:04:21.260> there<00:04:21.560> that<00:04:22.100> that

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
to the right hand side there that that

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.490 
to the right hand side there that that
really<00:04:22.640> there<00:04:23.030> energizes<00:04:23.810> first<00:04:24.140> to

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
really there energizes first to

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.860 
really there energizes first to
basically<00:04:25.130> enable<00:04:25.730> all<00:04:26.000> of<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.300> other<00:04:26.450> relays

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
basically enable all of the other relays

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.340 
basically enable all of the other relays
and<00:04:27.350> if<00:04:28.040> that<00:04:28.220> one<00:04:28.430> burns<00:04:28.670> out<00:04:29.050> you're<00:04:30.050> dead<00:04:30.260> in

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
and if that one burns out you're dead in

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.980 
and if that one burns out you're dead in
the<00:04:30.410> water<00:04:30.470> and<00:04:30.970> ask<00:04:31.970> me<00:04:32.240> how<00:04:32.420> I<00:04:32.450> know<00:04:32.570> it's

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
the water and ask me how I know it's

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.840 
the water and ask me how I know it's
happened<00:04:33.380> a<00:04:33.470> couple<00:04:33.500> times<00:04:33.830> and<00:04:34.280> fortunately

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
happened a couple times and fortunately

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.640 
happened a couple times and fortunately
I<00:04:34.880> wasn't<00:04:35.180> too<00:04:35.450> far<00:04:35.690> away<00:04:35.780> from<00:04:35.930> home<00:04:36.320> when<00:04:36.560> it

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
I wasn't too far away from home when it

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.010 
I wasn't too far away from home when it
happened<00:04:37.040> I<00:04:37.220> was<00:04:37.970> able<00:04:38.120> to<00:04:38.330> push<00:04:38.480> it<00:04:38.510> back<00:04:38.780> home

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
happened I was able to push it back home

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.830 
happened I was able to push it back home
and<00:04:39.050> then<00:04:39.650> figure<00:04:40.160> out<00:04:40.250> what<00:04:40.400> was<00:04:40.550> wrong<00:04:40.730> and

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
and then figure out what was wrong and

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.860 
and then figure out what was wrong and
so<00:04:42.040> over<00:04:43.040> the<00:04:43.130> years<00:04:43.160> of<00:04:43.550> buying<00:04:44.420> and<00:04:44.720> buying

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
so over the years of buying and buying

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.870 
so over the years of buying and buying
and<00:04:45.170> buying<00:04:45.290> those<00:04:45.560> relays<00:04:46.040> at<00:04:46.340> about<00:04:46.580> fifty

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
and buying those relays at about fifty

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.200 
and buying those relays at about fifty
dollars<00:04:47.210> a<00:04:47.240> piece<00:04:47.620> I<00:04:48.620> found<00:04:49.370> another<00:04:49.730> relay

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
dollars a piece I found another relay

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.510 
dollars a piece I found another relay
that<00:04:50.720> is<00:04:50.990> a<00:04:51.020> little<00:04:51.290> pricey<00:04:51.440> to<00:04:51.800> purchase<00:04:52.280> but

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
that is a little pricey to purchase but

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.940 
that is a little pricey to purchase but
it<00:04:53.120> fixes<00:04:53.570> the<00:04:53.690> problem<00:04:54.170> I've<00:04:54.410> had<00:04:54.590> these<00:04:54.740> on

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
it fixes the problem I've had these on

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.640 
it fixes the problem I've had these on
for<00:04:55.190> years<00:04:55.460> and<00:04:55.730> about<00:04:56.270> to<00:04:56.390> show<00:04:56.570> you<00:04:56.630> what<00:04:57.530> I'm

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
for years and about to show you what I'm

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.570 
for years and about to show you what I'm
using<00:04:57.890> now<00:04:58.040> and<00:04:58.600> you'll<00:04:59.600> see<00:05:00.160> it's<00:05:01.160> this<00:05:01.370> guy

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
using now and you'll see it's this guy

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.130 
using now and you'll see it's this guy
right<00:05:01.610> here<00:05:01.880> and<00:05:02.830> it's<00:05:03.830> made<00:05:04.040> by<00:05:04.070> Eaton<00:05:05.140> and

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
right here and it's made by Eaton and

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.780 
right here and it's made by Eaton and
see<00:05:06.380> if<00:05:06.440> I<00:05:06.500> can<00:05:06.650> zoom<00:05:06.860> in<00:05:07.100> you<00:05:07.250> get<00:05:07.430> the<00:05:07.550> part

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
see if I can zoom in you get the part

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.180 
see if I can zoom in you get the part
number<00:05:08.060> I<00:05:08.210> have<00:05:08.420> to<00:05:08.540> turn<00:05:08.690> it<00:05:08.840> over

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
number I have to turn it over

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.760 
number I have to turn it over
it's<00:05:10.190> a<00:05:10.340> normally<00:05:11.150> open<00:05:11.180> relay<00:05:11.960> it<00:05:12.470> has<00:05:12.620> the

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
it's a normally open relay it has the

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.640 
it's a normally open relay it has the
two<00:05:12.920> big<00:05:13.300> wings<00:05:14.300> on<00:05:14.570> it<00:05:14.690> here<00:05:14.870> where<00:05:15.140> you<00:05:15.500> could

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
two big wings on it here where you could

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.720 
two big wings on it here where you could
actually<00:05:15.800> attach<00:05:16.400> your<00:05:16.790> wiring<00:05:17.240> to<00:05:17.450> and<00:05:18.730> the

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
actually attach your wiring to and the

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.450 
actually attach your wiring to and the
relay<00:05:20.510> coil<00:05:21.320> is<00:05:21.590> actually<00:05:21.770> on<00:05:22.070> these<00:05:22.220> two

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
relay coil is actually on these two

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.420 
relay coil is actually on these two
studs<00:05:22.760> here<00:05:23.320> there's<00:05:24.320> a<00:05:24.410> diode<00:05:24.740> suppressor

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
studs here there's a diode suppressor

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.580 
studs here there's a diode suppressor
here<00:05:25.640> that<00:05:25.910> I'm<00:05:26.120> not<00:05:26.150> using<00:05:26.480> online<00:05:26.750> but<00:05:27.200> it

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
here that I'm not using online but it

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:35.560 
here that I'm not using online but it
came<00:05:28.070> with<00:05:28.130> it<00:05:29.860> but<00:05:31.330> it's<00:05:32.330> a<00:05:32.420> 200<00:05:32.900> amp<00:05:34.300> 28<00:05:35.300> vote

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
came with it but it's a 200 amp 28 vote

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.320 
came with it but it's a 200 amp 28 vote
volt<00:05:36.050> coil<00:05:36.410> which<00:05:37.340> seems<00:05:37.580> to<00:05:37.670> be<00:05:37.790> working<00:05:38.120> fine

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
volt coil which seems to be working fine

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.370 
volt coil which seems to be working fine
with<00:05:38.390> 36<00:05:39.260> volts<00:05:39.680> and<00:05:40.930> might<00:05:41.930> be<00:05:41.960> able<00:05:42.110> to<00:05:42.200> pick

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
with 36 volts and might be able to pick

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.420 
with 36 volts and might be able to pick
up<00:05:42.500> the<00:05:42.770> part<00:05:43.550> number<00:05:43.820> there<00:05:44.060> I<00:05:45.250> think<00:05:46.250> I've

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
up the part number there I think I've

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.970 
up the part number there I think I've
seen<00:05:46.700> these<00:05:46.910> at<00:05:47.210> Newark<00:05:47.510> electronics<00:05:48.230> and

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980 
seen these at Newark electronics and

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.920 
seen these at Newark electronics and
maybe<00:05:49.820> some<00:05:50.030> of<00:05:50.090> the<00:05:50.180> other<00:05:50.330> electronic

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
maybe some of the other electronic

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.160 
maybe some of the other electronic
places<00:05:51.920> online<00:05:52.120> and<00:05:53.120> they<00:05:53.780> are<00:05:53.900> kind<00:05:54.140> of

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.170 
places online and they are kind of

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.500 
places online and they are kind of
pricey<00:05:54.350> they're<00:05:54.710> about<00:05:54.920> 125<00:05:55.910> dollars<00:05:56.240> a<00:05:56.270> piece

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510 
pricey they're about 125 dollars a piece

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.740 
pricey they're about 125 dollars a piece
but<00:05:56.930> once<00:05:57.350> you<00:05:57.500> go<00:05:57.710> through<00:05:57.950> and<00:05:58.160> you<00:05:58.190> buy<00:05:58.430> them

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
but once you go through and you buy them

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.000 
but once you go through and you buy them
you're<00:05:59.750> done<00:05:59.930> because<00:06:00.290> I<00:06:00.440> haven't<00:06:00.740> had<00:06:00.830> any

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010 
you're done because I haven't had any

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.930 
you're done because I haven't had any
more<00:06:01.190> problem<00:06:02.380> with<00:06:03.380> my<00:06:03.560> speed<00:06:03.860> control<00:06:04.220> since

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
more problem with my speed control since

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.750 
more problem with my speed control since
I've<00:06:05.090> done<00:06:05.240> this<00:06:05.950> so<00:06:06.950> I<00:06:07.280> just<00:06:07.460> thought<00:06:07.610> I'd

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:07.760 
I've done this so I just thought I'd

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.180 
I've done this so I just thought I'd
share<00:06:08.000> that<00:06:08.030> with<00:06:08.390> you<00:06:08.600> and<00:06:09.020> it<00:06:09.830> seems<00:06:09.980> to<00:06:10.040> be

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
share that with you and it seems to be

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.700 
share that with you and it seems to be
working<00:06:10.520> fine<00:06:10.700> I<00:06:11.060> think<00:06:11.420> I'll<00:06:11.690> give<00:06:11.870> you<00:06:12.020> a<00:06:12.050> tip

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
working fine I think I'll give you a tip

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.560 
working fine I think I'll give you a tip
I'll<00:06:12.830> give<00:06:12.860> you<00:06:13.100> another<00:06:13.310> closer<00:06:13.730> shot<00:06:14.150> at<00:06:14.390> how

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
I'll give you another closer shot at how

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.360 
I'll give you another closer shot at how
I've<00:06:14.690> got<00:06:14.870> them<00:06:14.960> wired<00:06:15.200> in<00:06:15.440> there<00:06:15.650> and<00:06:16.250> then

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
I've got them wired in there and then

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.910 
I've got them wired in there and then
actually<00:06:16.730> even<00:06:17.320> without<00:06:18.320> even<00:06:18.530> drilling<00:06:18.830> any

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:18.920 
actually even without even drilling any

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.380 
actually even without even drilling any
holes<00:06:19.010> or<00:06:19.400> anything<00:06:19.550> they've<00:06:19.820> actually<00:06:20.060> got

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
holes or anything they've actually got

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.930 
holes or anything they've actually got
the<00:06:20.510> same<00:06:20.690> footprint<00:06:21.290> so<00:06:21.530> they'll<00:06:21.680> bolt<00:06:21.950> right

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
the same footprint so they'll bolt right

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.590 
the same footprint so they'll bolt right
in<00:06:23.180> there<00:06:23.420> where<00:06:24.230> the<00:06:24.350> other<00:06:24.500> ones<00:06:24.740> were<00:06:25.600> so

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:26.600 
in there where the other ones were so

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.210 
in there where the other ones were so
it's<00:06:26.870> pretty<00:06:27.020> cool<00:06:27.230> how<00:06:27.530> it<00:06:27.560> how<00:06:27.920> it<00:06:28.040> worked

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220 
it's pretty cool how it how it worked

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.520 
it's pretty cool how it how it worked
out<00:06:28.430> and<00:06:28.760> all<00:06:29.090> I<00:06:29.150> did<00:06:29.240> was<00:06:29.630> uh<00:06:29.660> you<00:06:30.140> know<00:06:30.170> attach

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
out and all I did was uh you know attach

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:31.350 
out and all I did was uh you know attach
the<00:06:30.710> resistors

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
the resistors

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.290 
the resistors
and<00:06:31.780> all<00:06:31.870> the<00:06:31.990> wires<00:06:32.199> and<00:06:32.849> man<00:06:33.849> this<00:06:34.090> thing

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
and all the wires and man this thing

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.659 
and all the wires and man this thing
really<00:06:34.449> works<00:06:34.810> great<00:06:35.139> I've<00:06:35.500> had<00:06:35.770> no<00:06:36.490> more

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:36.669 
really works great I've had no more

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:40.649 
really works great I've had no more
problems<00:06:36.849> at<00:06:37.330> all<00:06:38.129> so<00:06:39.150> it's<00:06:40.150> not<00:06:40.270> I'd<00:06:40.419> share

00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:40.659 
problems at all so it's not I'd share

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:41.309 
problems at all so it's not I'd share
that<00:06:40.689> with<00:06:41.020> you

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:41.319 
that with you

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:43.170 
that with you
and<00:06:41.409> if<00:06:42.009> you'd<00:06:42.370> like<00:06:42.520> to<00:06:42.639> know<00:06:42.759> the<00:06:42.939> part

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
and if you'd like to know the part

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.490 
and if you'd like to know the part
number<00:06:43.479> if<00:06:43.689> you<00:06:43.810> couldn't<00:06:44.050> get<00:06:44.199> it<00:06:44.289> on<00:06:44.379> the

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.500 
number if you couldn't get it on the

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.619 
number if you couldn't get it on the
video<00:06:44.770> I'll<00:06:45.699> give<00:06:45.879> you<00:06:45.969> the<00:06:46.060> part<00:06:46.270> number<00:06:46.509> two

00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:46.629 
video I'll give you the part number two

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:51.809 
video I'll give you the part number two
the<00:06:46.719> relay<00:06:47.050> and<00:06:49.259> you<00:06:50.259> could<00:06:50.439> get<00:06:51.250> fixtures<00:06:51.639> up

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:51.819
