00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
can see we do have an on and off button

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.549 
can see we do have an on and off button
when<00:00:51.850> you<00:00:51.910> have<00:00:51.940> an<00:00:52.120> icons<00:00:52.660> list<00:00:52.989> then<00:00:53.350> we<00:00:53.379> have

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
when you have an icons list then we have

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.819 
when you have an icons list then we have
icon<00:00:54.070> then<00:00:54.309> we<00:00:54.399> have<00:00:54.519> dark<00:00:54.879> dots<00:00:55.829> wallpapers

icon then we have dark dots wallpapers

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:58.319 
icon then we have dark dots wallpapers
and<00:00:57.160> then<00:00:57.280> you<00:00:57.399> have<00:00:57.519> other<00:00:57.789> where<00:00:58.089> you<00:00:58.210> can

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
and then you have other where you can

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.020 
and then you have other where you can
even<00:00:58.480> hide<00:00:58.899> the<00:00:58.929> icon<00:00:59.589> to<00:01:00.219> make<00:01:00.370> it<00:01:00.489> a<00:01:00.550> shortcut

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
even hide the icon to make it a shortcut

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.450 
even hide the icon to make it a shortcut
to<00:01:01.539> the<00:01:01.660> settings<00:01:02.079> application<00:01:02.260> so<00:01:03.190> if<00:01:03.280> we<00:01:03.370> go

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
to the settings application so if we go

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.340 
to the settings application so if we go
into<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.850> icon<00:01:04.180> list<00:01:04.390> and<00:01:04.750> then<00:01:04.900> here<00:01:05.140> we<00:01:05.230> have

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
into the icon list and then here we have

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.050 
into the icon list and then here we have
the<00:01:05.470> actual<00:01:05.890> effects<00:01:06.280> -<00:01:06.370> you<00:01:06.490> see<00:01:06.700> we<00:01:06.820> have<00:01:06.940> our

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
the actual effects - you see we have our

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.080 
the actual effects - you see we have our
set<00:01:07.390> to<00:01:07.510> 360<00:01:08.170> rotation<00:01:08.920> right<00:01:09.430> now<00:01:09.640> so<00:01:09.909> these

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
set to 360 rotation right now so these

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.670 
set to 360 rotation right now so these
we<00:01:10.480> can<00:01:10.630> have<00:01:10.750> this<00:01:10.870> -<00:01:11.080> like<00:01:11.230> a<00:01:11.260> different

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
we can have this - like a different

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.220 
we can have this - like a different
rotation<00:01:12.220> so<00:01:12.430> let's<00:01:12.580> do<00:01:12.760> page<00:01:13.090> curl<00:01:15.660> and<00:01:16.660> you

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
rotation so let's do page curl and you

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.840 
rotation so let's do page curl and you
guys<00:01:17.350> can<00:01:17.560> see<00:01:17.710> it<00:01:17.800> kind<00:01:17.980> of<00:01:18.010> gives<00:01:18.160> it<00:01:18.310> a<00:01:18.400> page

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
guys can see it kind of gives it a page

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.760 
guys can see it kind of gives it a page
curl<00:01:19.240> but<00:01:19.870> it<00:01:19.990> gets<00:01:20.140> kind<00:01:20.230> of<00:01:20.410> messed<00:01:20.620> up

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
curl but it gets kind of messed up

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.230 
curl but it gets kind of messed up
sometimes<00:01:21.220> so<00:01:21.400> do<00:01:21.520> keep<00:01:21.700> that<00:01:21.910> in<00:01:22.030> mind

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
sometimes so do keep that in mind

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.300 
sometimes so do keep that in mind
something<00:01:23.020> that<00:01:23.200> we<00:01:23.290> have<00:01:23.470> Ripple<00:01:26.160> so<00:01:27.160> those

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
something that we have Ripple so those

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.280 
something that we have Ripple so those
ripple<00:01:27.820> go<00:01:28.510> back<00:01:28.690> into<00:01:28.900> the<00:01:29.080> settings

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
ripple go back into the settings

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.560 
ripple go back into the settings
application<00:01:29.590> and<00:01:30.310> let's<00:01:30.490> try<00:01:30.730> the<00:01:30.790> actual

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
application and let's try the actual

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.230 
application and let's try the actual
icons<00:01:32.110> so<00:01:33.100> let's<00:01:33.310> go<00:01:33.460> to<00:01:33.700> flip<00:01:34.150> from<00:01:34.360> left<00:01:36.240> you

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
icons so let's go to flip from left you

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.660 
icons so let's go to flip from left you
guys<00:01:37.360> can<00:01:37.600> see<00:01:37.750> that

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
guys can see that

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.430 
guys can see that
and<00:01:39.670> let's<00:01:39.940> try<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.240> dock<00:01:40.690> effect<00:01:41.110> so<00:01:41.260> let's

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
and let's try the dock effect so let's

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.350 
and let's try the dock effect so let's
change<00:01:41.620> up<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:41.980> dock<00:01:42.160> so<00:01:42.970> let's<00:01:43.150> have<00:01:43.330> the<00:01:43.390> see

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
change up the dock so let's have the see
