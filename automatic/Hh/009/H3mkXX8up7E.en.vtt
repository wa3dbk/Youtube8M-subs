00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.750 

so<00:02:46.860> explain<00:02:47.069> a<00:02:47.129> little<00:02:47.280> bit<00:02:47.430> about<00:02:47.489> the

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
so explain a little bit about the

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.940 
so explain a little bit about the
aerodynamic<00:02:48.299> on<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.569> car<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:49.260> car<00:02:49.500> is<00:02:49.530> made

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
aerodynamic on the car the car is made

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.229 
aerodynamic on the car the car is made
for<00:02:51.290> high-speed<00:02:52.290> circuits<00:02:52.980> in<00:02:53.189> Europe<00:02:53.489> that's

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
for high-speed circuits in Europe that's

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.789 
for high-speed circuits in Europe that's
why<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:54.450> will<00:02:54.689> see<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:55.019> we<00:02:55.260> don't<00:02:55.409> have<00:02:55.650> any

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
why you will see that we don't have any

s2000 cards it's one profile which don't
give<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.349> a<00:03:13.379> lot<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.769> opportunity<00:03:14.400> for<00:03:14.640> using

give you a lot of opportunity for using
it<00:03:15.510> for<00:03:15.689> downforce<00:03:16.459> that's<00:03:17.459> why<00:03:17.609> it's<00:03:18.209> not

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
it for downforce that's why it's not

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:27.830 
it for downforce that's why it's not
very<00:03:19.379> efficient<00:03:19.920> but<00:03:20.489> good-looking
