watt<00:01:34.079> which<00:01:34.560> was<00:01:34.850> 756<00:01:35.850> watts<00:01:36.090> per<00:01:36.329> liter<00:01:36.509> I

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
watt which was 756 watts per liter I

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.810 
watt which was 756 watts per liter I
know<00:01:36.930> it's<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.140> little<00:01:37.409> bit<00:01:37.530> weird<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.610> way<00:01:38.759> to

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
know it's a little bit weird of a way to

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.730 
know it's a little bit weird of a way to
define<00:01:39.270> things<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:39.930> think<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.259> shows<00:01:40.470> on

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
define things but I think it shows on

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.920 
define things but I think it shows on
just<00:01:41.250> how<00:01:41.520> much<00:01:41.820> power<00:01:42.119> they<00:01:42.390> fit<00:01:42.600> inside<00:01:42.869> a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
just how much power they fit inside a

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.600 
just how much power they fit inside a
tiny<00:01:43.290> box<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.860> don't<00:01:44.040> actually<00:01:44.159> mind<00:01:44.460> that

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
tiny box so I don't actually mind that

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.800 
tiny box so I don't actually mind that

so<00:03:00.810> if<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:01.049> do<00:03:01.230> buy<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.530> radiator<00:03:02.099> that<00:03:02.220> comes

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
so if you do buy a radiator that comes

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.830 
so if you do buy a radiator that comes
with<00:03:02.579> two<00:03:02.700> fans<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.120> can<00:03:03.239> install<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:03.569> in

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
with two fans you can install that in
