00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.550

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:17.240
 How about friends and are welcome to this 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.880
 gameplay of fight night and game 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.580
 freddie 2 so well let me tell you 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.630
 about this game we are going to give it in new 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.570
 play then let's play here well in 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.870
 this time we're going to play night 1 if 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.579
 they are interested in this game 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.440
 I remember that there is a free version in 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.710
 the place thor and a paid version 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.820
 also that you can find the link 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.720
 towards the place tora here in the 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.270
 description but as I say only links of 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.850
 the play is 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.760
 so let's put mute and then they 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.830
 I tell a bit the news that brings 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.930
 this fan night and freddie 2 with 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:00.020
 compared to 1 since as you see today 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.910
 we have the possibility of the lamp and 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.760
 also to turn it on what are the 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.250
 different cameras as you see here I am 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.660
 reading a little here we have freddy 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:14.310
 that we have savon and that this one 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.579
 girl who is paw 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.670
 this exact leg and another novelty that 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:23.159
 brings us this little box of music that 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.500
 Well, I'm going to have to be playing 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.320
 to be and to wind up 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.549
 because if it reaches zero what is this 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.960
 music box comes out a rabbit guy what 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.190
 which then we do not want 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.800
 as you see here today we have what they are 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.810
 the ventilation ducts on the side 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.380
 left and we also have what it is 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.229
 is 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.930
 this mask to simulate that we are 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:54.070
 freddy because apart from these three that 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.930
 they are from the past game yes you can 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.390
 say there are also some new ones 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.700
 animatronics which do have 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.200
 facial recognition so when 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.600
 we put on this mask when we 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.030
 we leave here close when we see it here 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.660
 or when we see it here we have to 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.880
 put this mask so that he thinks 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.720
 in which we are fereres and they do not kill us 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.630
 so come the night 1 in the truth 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.400
 that tonight one if it's quiet 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:26.150
 because it can be night 1 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.640
 from night 2 onwards it gets this 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.030
 more interesting if they want me to continue 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.430
 going up on what is night 2 3 4 and 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.379
 if we can get to 5 because they 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.560
 I invite you to leave a like to this video 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:41.420
 or a comment if I see the answers 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.030

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.530
 reproductions because I will be uploading the 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.629
 second night and if not then we 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.629
 we'll stay here with this one 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.500
 with this series of videos that can be 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.860
 turn into a series as I tell them a 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.300
 like if you want it to continue 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.550
 or with some comment 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.310
 2 in the morning and everything is very quiet 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:10.010
 freddy bonino girl 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.410
 they are not they have not wanted to move as they 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.500
 I say that is quiet the first night 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.330
 he has already played uy uy as a young man here 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.100
 I have to be winding him so that 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.490
 do not reach zero so that it does not come out 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:27.520
 a rabbit type because I was 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:31.290
 also watching and reading a bit that 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.290
 this music box is like 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.069
 as I tell them 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.250
 of those types of box that one gives you 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:42.459
 it has to go winding and in the end 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.430
 a rabbit comes out I do not know if they gave me 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.790
 understand mean understand so we have 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.700
 that keep it grape and as you can see it 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.819

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.120
 move now 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.860

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.600
 side to play there with his guitar 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.500
