00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.280
 Based on the following video we want to show you 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.350
 how easy to use the software Photo WK 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.330
 Create so-called LÃ¼tzow club 

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:13.699
 these are translucent pictures 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.640
 the whole beauty of which only comes to light when she is in front of you 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.640
 Be held light source 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:23.499
 I invite you here 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.499
 my data 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.720
 in the example as the Tower Bridge here this can be a 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.820
 black and white or color photo act 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.110
 subsequently 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.470
 I go to the point of Sept with co2ol's 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.470
 to set the size of the image 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.710
 Here I could the starting point or the mixed-title and 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.910
 Change zero point 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.910
 usually this chestnut is left 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.899
 the material thickness is given here 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.519
 where the zero point of the field is usually above the workpiece 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.090
 take over 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.190
 then we go to that caught the parameters 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.190
 Hereby I fix the tool data 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.820
 in the weather station row 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.040
 they secure 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.040
 metric tools predefined 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.430
 for Fraser 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.160
 Analyst Fraser 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.010
 or because we have stitches 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.200
 this part can of course 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.180
 to be extended by several tools 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.040
 by just clicking on a tool 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.870
 and go to Copy 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.870
 Of course, this tool can also be easily deleted again 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.200
 the term is Reisers or tool topics in 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.650
 this field 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.340
 We have three types of tools to choose from 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.180
 Analyst Fraser 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.100
 role model 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.260
 for TV for Megan Fraser and in Greding for 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.930
 created serious 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.310
 here the maximum depth is specified 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:13.099
 in this field 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.099
 the speed of the spindle 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:20.119
 the maximum suggested x and y 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:24.679
 in millimeters per second 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:27.679
 as well as the feed speed MZ 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.959
 The tools can also be edited individually afterwards 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:39.479
 Here we give the maximum depth of cut Andor 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:42.359
 under the point Leins Basin is defined 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.229
 the many lines 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:47.229
 be milled later in this picture 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.849
 I go up with the percentage 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.849
 the number of lines decreases 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:59.089
 however, we need a lot of lines for high-resolution images 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:00.599
 side by side 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.599
 a default setting would be 20 percent 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.299
 45 degrees 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.569
 that would be the attitude under which angle the picture risks now 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:16.809
 It is very important for the milling of the Tuk 1 the light and dark 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:19.809
 Investing areas of the picture 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:24.819
 the WPT player honors us only the setting how high the press shop 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.239
 At the end of an APA Red train, you'll be back again and again 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.239
 Edible to perform 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:34.729
 by going on 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.729
 on calculate 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.959
 and the scavengers are calculated 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:53.089
 he must be milled natural course the longer it takes 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:55.029
 process 

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:58.029
 this would be the milled end result 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:01.079
 which I now 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.239
 in the three-dimensional view 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.429
 subsequently 

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:14.429
 if the data is simply saved 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:17.039
 as a boost processor 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.139
 a-tec seats and sets as NC file 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.170
 for example, for working with the PC NC 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.360
 and finished is the raw files 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.360
 very interesting to mention in addition would be the fact that 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.469
 Photo we can 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:46.469
 has several post processions 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:05.789
 and at the same time indicating how long the pressing process of the entire picture 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:08.020
 lasts 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.499
 Finally, we would like to show you some examples 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:15.079
 which were realized with her son Heidfeld Fritz Maschinen 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:28.279
 Thank you for your attention
