00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
I was just really pretty dry now because

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.990 
I was just really pretty dry now because
I<00:01:54.500> saw<00:01:54.680> a<00:01:54.710> couple<00:01:55.070> of<00:01:55.130> chunks<00:01:55.490> in<00:01:55.580> that<00:01:55.730> first

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000

I saw a couple of chunks in that first
batch<00:01:56.210> I<00:01:56.390> just<00:01:56.660> decided<00:01:57.260> to<00:01:57.290> do<00:01:57.500> something

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
batch I just decided to do something

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.890 
batch I just decided to do something
different<00:01:58.610> when<00:01:58.940> I<00:01:58.970> loaded<00:01:59.240> it<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.540> second

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
different when I loaded it the second

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.540 
different when I loaded it the second
time<00:02:00.050> and<00:02:00.230> that<00:02:00.410> was<00:02:00.830> that<00:02:01.040> I<00:02:01.070> was<00:02:01.280> going<00:02:01.460> to

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
time and that was that I was going to

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.060 
time and that was that I was going to
pulse<00:02:01.820> it<00:02:02.060> because<00:02:02.780> whenever<00:02:02.990> I<00:02:03.200> stopped<00:02:03.710> I

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
pulse it because whenever I stopped I

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.380 
pulse it because whenever I stopped I
could<00:02:04.850> hear<00:02:05.980> larger<00:02:06.980> pieces<00:02:07.280> kind<00:02:07.850> of<00:02:08.060> getting

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
could hear larger pieces kind of getting

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.230 
could hear larger pieces kind of getting
caught<00:02:08.570> up<00:02:08.780> on<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.020> blade<00:02:09.460> as<00:02:10.460> the<00:02:10.820> blade<00:02:11.030> was

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
caught up on the blade as the blade was

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.850 
caught up on the blade as the blade was
coming<00:02:11.570> to<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:11.810> standstill<00:02:12.290> so<00:02:12.620> I'm<00:02:12.680> going<00:02:12.830> to

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
coming to a standstill so I'm going to

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.950 
coming to a standstill so I'm going to
pick<00:02:13.010> like<00:02:13.280> three<00:02:14.090> or<00:02:14.210> four<00:02:14.480> of<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:14.690> little

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
pick like three or four of the little

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.890 
pick like three or four of the little
bigger<00:02:15.290> chunks<00:02:15.830> out<00:02:15.980> of<00:02:16.330> out<00:02:17.330> of<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.630> first

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
bigger chunks out of out of the first

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.060 
bigger chunks out of out of the first
batch<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.290> really<00:02:18.560> there's<00:02:18.770> really<00:02:18.830> only

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
batch and really there's really only

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.690 
batch and really there's really only
about<00:02:19.430> four<00:02:19.790> or<00:02:19.880> five<00:02:20.090> of<00:02:20.360> them<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:22.550> I'm<00:02:22.670> a

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.670 
get ground up very well back in I'm just
gonna<00:02:31.730> pulse<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.210> a<00:02:32.270> couple<00:02:32.480> of<00:02:32.630> times<00:02:32.840> you

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
gonna pulse it a couple of times you

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.380 
gonna pulse it a couple of times you
have<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:33.980> get<00:02:34.130> that<00:02:34.250> lid<00:02:34.490> on<00:02:34.610> exactly<00:02:35.180> right
