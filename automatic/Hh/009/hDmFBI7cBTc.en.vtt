and forth as you drive the truck down
the<00:00:49.110> road<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.670> on<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.730> back<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.270> these

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
the road and on the back of these

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.700 
the road and on the back of these
hangers<00:00:51.660> then<00:00:52.430> are<00:00:53.430> all<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.789> mounts<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.210> need

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
hangers then are all the mounts you need

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.049 
hangers then are all the mounts you need
to<00:00:55.710> mount<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.039> coil<00:00:56.280> overs<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.640> come<00:00:56.940> as

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
to mount the coil overs that come as

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.849 
to mount the coil overs that come as
part<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> kit<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.320> coil<00:00:58.530> over<00:00:58.710> is

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
part of the kit so the coil over is

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.920 
part of the kit so the coil over is
mount<00:00:59.070> here<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.489> again<00:00:59.670> these<00:01:00.600> let<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
mount here and again these let the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.560 
mount here and again these let the
suspension<00:01:01.440> travel<00:01:01.620> up<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:01.920> down<00:01:02.329> so<00:01:03.329> what

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
suspension travel up and down so what

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.920 
suspension travel up and down so what
we've<00:01:03.719> done<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.320> get<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.799> point<00:01:05.100> is

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
we've done to get to this point is

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.660 
we've done to get to this point is
measured<00:01:06.930> measured<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.950> measured<00:01:08.369> we<00:01:08.490> had<00:01:08.610> to

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
measured measured and measured we had to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.640 
measured measured and measured we had to
make<00:01:08.820> sure<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.780> got<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.290> spacing

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
make sure that we got this spacing

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.130 
make sure that we got this spacing
correct<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.270> drive<00:01:12.540> fit<00:01:12.780> everything<00:01:12.960> in

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
correct and we drive fit everything in

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.570 
correct and we drive fit everything in
the<00:01:13.200> chassis<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.650> get<00:01:13.890> all<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.130> spacing

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
the chassis to get all the spacing

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.429 
the chassis to get all the spacing
correct<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:15.540> also<00:01:15.720> had<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.900> make<00:01:15.960> sure<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.320> we

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
correct we also had to make sure that we

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.190 
correct we also had to make sure that we
have<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.799> axle<00:01:17.310> properly<00:01:17.850> centered<00:01:18.200> between

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
have the axle properly centered between

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.100 
have the axle properly centered between
the<00:01:19.290> two<00:01:19.439> hangers<00:01:19.770> here<00:01:20.509> once<00:01:21.509> we<00:01:21.659> got<00:01:21.810> that

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
the two hangers here once we got that

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.620 
the two hangers here once we got that
part<00:01:22.409> done<00:01:22.740> with<00:01:23.549> everything<00:01:23.880> dry<00:01:24.090> fit<00:01:24.420> and

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
part done with everything dry fit and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.820 
part done with everything dry fit and
kind<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.869> where<00:01:25.020> we<00:01:25.110> thought<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.439> ride<00:01:25.619> height

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
kind of where we thought the ride height

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.070 
kind of where we thought the ride height
was<00:01:25.979> going<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.189> be<00:01:26.460> we<00:01:27.060> roughly<00:01:27.630> set<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
was going to be we roughly set the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.710 
was going to be we roughly set the
pinion<00:01:28.350> angle<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.369> rear<00:01:29.549> end<00:01:29.729> here<00:01:29.939> now

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
pinion angle of the rear end here now

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.300 
pinion angle of the rear end here now
we've<00:01:30.840> got<00:01:31.020> about<00:01:31.200> an<00:01:31.350> inch<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.710> adjustability

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
we've got about an inch of adjustability

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.450 
we've got about an inch of adjustability
in<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:32.939> each<00:01:33.270> side<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.650> both<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
in on each side in the in both of the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.850 
in on each side in the in both of the
links<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.880> top<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.210> bottom<00:01:36.420> links<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.530> by

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
links the top of the bottom links so by

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.069 
links the top of the bottom links so by
adjusting<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.030> link<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.570> we<00:01:39.630> can<00:01:39.780> actually

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
adjusting the link so we can actually

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.319 
adjusting the link so we can actually
tune<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.530> pinion<00:01:41.040> angle<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.790> get<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.030> right<00:01:42.210> we

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
tune the pinion angle to get it right we

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.170 
tune the pinion angle to get it right we
want<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:42.829> so<00:01:43.829> we<00:01:43.950> got<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.280> distance<00:01:44.700> set<00:01:44.970> we

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
want to be so we got the distance set we

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.730 
want to be so we got the distance set we
got<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.479> angle<00:01:45.869> roughed<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.530> we<00:01:46.590> know

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
got the angle roughed in and we know

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.429 
got the angle roughed in and we know
that<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.040> excellent<00:01:47.610> centered<00:01:48.259> between<00:01:49.259> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
that the excellent centered between the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.969 
that the excellent centered between the
two<00:01:49.590> hangers<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.820> we<00:01:51.240> tacked<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:51.979> check

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979
