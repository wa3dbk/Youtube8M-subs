here<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.859> found<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.429> very<00:00:29.910> dry<00:00:30.300> spruce<00:00:30.810> tree<00:00:31.769> and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
here I found a very dry spruce tree and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:44.080 
here I found a very dry spruce tree and
I<00:00:33.030> kind<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.300> cut<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.600> off<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.079> take<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.500> with<00:00:34.620> me

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.729 

okay<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.270> spruce<00:00:45.600> tree<00:00:45.899> here<00:00:46.140> will<00:00:46.379> not<00:00:46.469> only

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
okay the spruce tree here will not only

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.459 
okay the spruce tree here will not only
give<00:00:47.070> me<00:00:47.280> kindling<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.300> fuel<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.960> will<00:00:49.230> also

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
give me kindling and fuel it will also

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.319 
give me kindling and fuel it will also
give<00:00:49.950> me<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.190> tinder

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.479 

okay<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.539> very<00:00:54.780> fine<00:00:55.110> twigs<00:00:55.469> would<00:00:56.250> make<00:00:56.460> a

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
okay this very fine twigs would make a

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.360 
okay this very fine twigs would make a
great<00:00:56.789> accelerant<00:00:57.600> for<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.899> fire<00:00:58.160> but<00:00:59.160> I

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
great accelerant for the fire but I

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.310 
great accelerant for the fire but I
don't<00:00:59.550> want<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.820> use<00:00:59.969> them<00:01:00.210> today<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.660> would<00:01:01.140> be

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
don't want to use them today it would be

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.750 
don't want to use them today it would be
too<00:01:01.620> easy

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.130 

this<00:01:08.760> little<00:01:09.000> branches<00:01:09.510> here<00:01:09.750> they<00:01:09.990> would

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
this little branches here they would

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.350 
this little branches here they would
make<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.350> great<00:01:10.590> kindling<00:01:11.189> but<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.729> don't<00:01:12.180> want

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
this tree here and from this I gotta

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:31.600 
this tree here and from this I gotta
make<00:01:18.420> my<00:01:18.600> few<00:01:18.840> my<00:01:19.170> kindling<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.770> my<00:01:20.040> tinder

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
the key to fire making is preparation it

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.580 
the key to fire making is preparation it
took<00:04:16.880> me<00:04:17.030> about<00:04:17.269> 1<00:04:17.329> hour<00:04:17.750> to<00:04:18.170> get<00:04:18.530> everything

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
took me about 1 hour to get everything

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.849 
took me about 1 hour to get everything
done<00:04:19.130> from<00:04:19.760> letting<00:04:20.600> that<00:04:20.959> free<00:04:21.230> to<00:04:21.530> making

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
done from letting that free to making

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.570 
done from letting that free to making
the<00:04:21.950> fuel<00:04:22.720> making<00:04:23.720> the<00:04:23.930> fat<00:04:24.170> sticks<00:04:24.560> if<00:04:25.460> you

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
the fuel making the fat sticks if you

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.850 
the fuel making the fat sticks if you
don't<00:04:25.790> spend<00:04:26.120> so<00:04:26.480> much<00:04:27.080> time<00:04:27.140> on<00:04:27.620> the

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
don't spend so much time on the

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.280 
don't spend so much time on the
preparation<00:04:28.490> you'll<00:04:29.240> probably<00:04:29.510> won't<00:04:30.110> be

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
preparation you'll probably won't be

00:04:30.290 --> 00:05:06.940 
preparation you'll probably won't be
successful

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950
