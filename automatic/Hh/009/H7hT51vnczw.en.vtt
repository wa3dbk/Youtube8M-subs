00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
and I think that's what people need to

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:48.650 
and I think that's what people need to
realize<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.340> celebrate

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.530 

maybe<00:01:49.660> we<00:01:50.050> could<00:01:50.290> say<00:01:51.070> it<00:01:51.190> was<00:01:51.280> because

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
maybe we could say it was because

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.840 
maybe we could say it was because
because<00:01:52.540> of<00:01:52.570> the<00:01:52.780> war<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:54.280> we<00:01:54.430> had<00:01:54.520> to<00:01:54.640> break

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
because of the war and we had to break

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.080 
because of the war and we had to break
we<00:01:55.750> had<00:01:55.840> two<00:01:55.960> very<00:01:56.080> high<00:01:56.260> tides<00:01:56.560> of<00:01:56.770> Japan<00:01:57.130> and

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
we had two very high tides of Japan and

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.420 
we had two very high tides of Japan and
so<00:01:58.390> we<00:01:58.600> we<00:01:59.140> really<00:01:59.440> went<00:01:59.590> overboard<00:01:59.710> doing<00:02:00.310> it

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
so we we really went overboard doing it

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.420 
so we we really went overboard doing it
we're<00:02:01.180> totally<00:02:01.750> different<00:02:02.200> really<00:02:02.710> because

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
we're totally different really because

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.910 
we're totally different really because
you're<00:02:03.670> different<00:02:03.850> as<00:02:04.600> much<00:02:04.840> to<00:02:05.320> me<00:02:05.350> as<00:02:05.530> I<00:02:05.890> am

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
you're different as much to me as I am

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.620 
you're different as much to me as I am
different<00:02:06.370> to<00:02:06.580> you<00:02:06.730> and<00:02:07.030> that's<00:02:07.330> something

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
different to you and that's something

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.130 
different to you and that's something
that<00:02:07.810> I<00:02:08.500> felt<00:02:09.160> from<00:02:09.430> many<00:02:10.270> years<00:02:10.360> ago<00:02:10.690> that

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
that I felt from many years ago that

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.750 
that I felt from many years ago that
this<00:02:11.530> is<00:02:11.710> a<00:02:11.740> way<00:02:11.920> like<00:02:12.160> we<00:02:12.370> were<00:02:12.490> going<00:02:12.700> to

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
this is a way like we were going to

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.990 
this is a way like we were going to
marry<00:02:12.910> a<00:02:13.270> Caucasian<00:02:14.080> they<00:02:14.290> call<00:02:14.500> me<00:02:14.530> sushi

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
marry a Caucasian they call me sushi

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.780 
marry a Caucasian they call me sushi
once<00:02:16.000> they<00:02:16.240> clog<00:02:16.510> nice<00:02:16.780> you<00:02:16.990> shoot<00:02:17.790> there

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
once they clog nice you shoot there

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.860 
once they clog nice you shoot there
might<00:02:18.910> be<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:19.060> day<00:02:19.240> that<00:02:19.270> comes<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.810> when

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
might be a day that comes and when

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.710 
might be a day that comes and when

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
community is getting smaller is dying

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.040 
community is getting smaller is dying
and<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:05.310> problem<00:03:05.760> is<00:03:05.850> intermarriage<00:03:06.330> we're

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050

just disappearing and I turn around and
say<00:03:09.630> no<00:03:09.870> because<00:03:11.330> intermarriage<00:03:12.330> actually

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
say no because intermarriage actually

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.330 
say no because intermarriage actually
makes<00:03:13.380> us<00:03:13.530> one<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:13.890> fastest<00:03:14.310> growing

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
makes us one of the fastest growing

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.460 
makes us one of the fastest growing
communities<00:03:14.730> in<00:03:15.330> this<00:03:15.450> country<00:03:15.510> because

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
communities in this country because

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.930 
communities in this country because
we're<00:03:16.620> doubling<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.160> number<00:03:17.190> of<00:03:17.520> people<00:03:17.700> who

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
we're doubling the number of people who

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.430 
we're doubling the number of people who
can<00:03:18.090> potentially<00:03:18.540> add<00:03:18.810> children<00:03:19.110> to<00:03:19.260> our

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
can potentially add children to our

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.460 
can potentially add children to our
community

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:33.720 

I<00:03:29.100> started<00:03:30.100> making<00:03:30.370> animation<00:03:31.170> basically<00:03:32.730> we

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
I started making animation basically we

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.250 
I started making animation basically we
took<00:03:33.880> some<00:03:34.000> high<00:03:34.120> school<00:03:34.360> classes<00:03:34.570> in<00:03:35.020> high

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
took some high school classes in high

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.020 
took some high school classes in high
school<00:03:35.650> they<00:03:35.800> had<00:03:35.950> an<00:03:36.010> animation<00:03:36.280> program<00:03:36.820> so

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
school they had an animation program so

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.340 
school they had an animation program so
I<00:03:37.090> kind<00:03:37.330> of<00:03:37.360> played<00:03:37.540> around<00:03:37.660> with<00:03:37.900> with

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
I kind of played around with with

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.320 
I kind of played around with with
animation<00:03:38.860> then<00:03:39.070> I<00:03:39.340> kind<00:03:39.910> of<00:03:39.940> always<00:03:40.090> knew<00:03:40.270> I

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
animation then I kind of always knew I

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.610 
animation then I kind of always knew I
was<00:03:40.420> going<00:03:40.510> to<00:03:40.600> be<00:03:40.660> an<00:03:40.750> artist<00:03:40.930> or<00:03:41.230> an<00:03:41.290> animator

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
was going to be an artist or an animator

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.920 
was going to be an artist or an animator
and<00:03:41.860> I<00:03:42.730> didn't<00:03:43.060> know<00:03:43.180> about<00:03:43.300> animation

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
and I didn't know about animation

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.090 
and I didn't know about animation
because<00:03:44.020> there<00:03:44.290> weren't<00:03:44.380> a<00:03:44.530> lot<00:03:44.560> of<00:03:44.710> avenues

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
because there weren't a lot of avenues

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.180 
because there weren't a lot of avenues
when<00:03:45.640> I<00:03:45.730> graduated<00:03:46.270> from<00:03:46.330> high<00:03:46.570> school<00:03:47.190> like

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
when I graduated from high school like

schools and stuff we're just sort of
popping<00:03:50.020> up<00:03:50.170> so<00:03:50.860> I<00:03:50.890> kind<00:03:51.280> of<00:03:51.370> thought<00:03:51.790> okay

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
popping up so I kind of thought okay

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.310 
popping up so I kind of thought okay
well<00:03:52.150> maybe<00:03:52.210> i'll<00:03:52.390> go<00:03:52.630> into<00:03:52.780> being<00:03:53.050> an<00:03:53.140> artist
