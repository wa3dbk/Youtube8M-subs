videos<00:00:41.969> generally<00:00:42.899> give<00:00:43.020> me<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.230> best

because most of the things I record our
larger<00:00:48.180> than<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.780> what<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> do<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.170> I

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
larger than that and what I do is I

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.630 
larger than that and what I do is I
record<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.879> 1024<00:00:50.879> x<00:00:51.110> 768<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.649> then<00:00:53.280> import

record it 1024 x 768 and then import

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.700 
record it 1024 x 768 and then import
those<00:00:53.730> into<00:00:53.789> Camtasia<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.750> let<00:00:54.870> Camtasia<00:00:55.350> do

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.160 
those into Camtasia and let Camtasia do
a<00:00:55.739> shrink<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.520> fit<00:00:56.600> then<00:00:57.600> once<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.870> have<00:00:58.050> the
