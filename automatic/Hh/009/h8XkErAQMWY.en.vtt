arthritis and it's a reasonably common

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.700 
arthritis and it's a reasonably common

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
effects that are what we call

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.900

antirheumatic drugs or the D Mads and
then<00:01:54.509> there's<00:01:54.810> another<00:01:55.140> group<00:01:55.619> called<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
then there's another group called the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.350 
then there's another group called the
biological<00:01:56.759> demon

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
biological demon

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.750 
biological demon
which<00:01:57.540> are<00:01:57.780> quite<00:01:58.080> fancy<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.860> quite

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
which are quite fancy and quite

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.200 
which are quite fancy and quite
expensive<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.450> most<00:02:00.480> cases<00:02:01.400> the<00:02:02.400> two<00:02:02.970> last

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
expensive in most cases the two last

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.530 
expensive in most cases the two last
groups<00:02:03.480> I<00:02:03.630> mentioned<00:02:03.660> the<00:02:04.350> D<00:02:04.530> Mads<00:02:04.800> are<00:02:05.540> really

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
groups I mentioned the D Mads are really

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.169 
groups I mentioned the D Mads are really
not<00:02:06.690> a<00:02:06.720> good<00:02:06.960> choice<00:02:07.230> for<00:02:08.009> dogs<00:02:08.220> they<00:02:08.850> are

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
not a good choice for dogs they are

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.070 
not a good choice for dogs they are
mainly<00:02:09.539> used<00:02:10.100> for<00:02:11.120> rheumatoid<00:02:12.120> arthritis<00:02:12.360> and

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
mainly used for rheumatoid arthritis and

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.790 
mainly used for rheumatoid arthritis and
similar<00:02:13.740> conditions<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.430> people<00:02:14.580> and

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
similar conditions and people and

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.500 
similar conditions and people and
although<00:02:16.800> we<00:02:17.100> do<00:02:17.280> see<00:02:17.330> rheumatoid<00:02:18.330> arthritis

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
although we do see rheumatoid arthritis

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.800 
although we do see rheumatoid arthritis
in<00:02:19.110> dogs<00:02:19.140> it's<00:02:19.590> actually<00:02:19.920> pretty<00:02:20.160> rare<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:21.480> we

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
in dogs it's actually pretty rare so we

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.270 
in dogs it's actually pretty rare so we
don't<00:02:21.990> really<00:02:22.170> use<00:02:22.320> these<00:02:22.770> drugs<00:02:23.070> very

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
don't really use these drugs very

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.270 
don't really use these drugs very
commonly<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:24.660> today<00:02:25.080> I'm<00:02:25.380> going<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.680> focus<00:02:25.740> on

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
commonly so today I'm going to focus on
