and<00:00:18.690> for<00:00:19.500> about<00:00:19.740> 30<00:00:20.130> years<00:00:20.279> I've<00:00:20.789> been<00:00:20.970> trying

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
and for about 30 years I've been trying

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.660 
and for about 30 years I've been trying
to<00:00:21.240> learn<00:00:21.390> how<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.600> do<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.859> did<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.609> a

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
to learn how to do that and I did it a

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.279 
to learn how to do that and I did it a
variety<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.210> ways<00:00:24.390> when<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.689> first<00:00:25.019> started

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
variety of ways when I first started

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.839 
variety of ways when I first started
trying<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.619> place<00:00:25.800> crunch<00:00:26.130> dollars<00:00:26.609> through

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
trying to place crunch dollars through

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.740 
trying to place crunch dollars through
the<00:00:26.880> slide<00:00:27.269> thing<00:00:31.250> and<00:00:32.250> but<00:00:32.730> that's<00:00:32.940> it's<00:00:33.660> hard

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
the slide thing and but that's it's hard

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.350 
the slide thing and but that's it's hard
to<00:00:34.079> get<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.559> be<00:00:34.590> really<00:00:34.890> fast<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:36.239> was

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
to get that to be really fast and I was

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.700 
to get that to be really fast and I was
working<00:00:36.600> with<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.140> morning<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.590> was

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
working with it this morning I was

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:51.490 
working with it this morning I was
thinking<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:38.160> something<00:00:38.399> like

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.900 

something<00:00:52.500> like<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.800> too

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:05.800 

I<00:01:02.620> was<00:01:03.620> also<00:01:03.829> thinking<00:01:03.860> about<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:05.300> B<00:01:05.479> part

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
I was also thinking about the the B part

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:16.319 
I was also thinking about the the B part
which<00:01:06.020> it<00:01:06.200> was<00:01:06.440> just<00:01:06.680> kind<00:01:07.160> of<00:01:07.190> like

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.850 

the<00:01:17.329> problem<00:01:17.750> of<00:01:17.810> that<00:01:17.930> is<00:01:18.079> hard<00:01:18.380> to<00:01:18.560> get<00:01:18.710> that

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
the problem of that is hard to get that

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.529 
the problem of that is hard to get that
up<00:01:18.979> to<00:01:19.009> speed<00:01:19.340> because<00:01:19.520> this<00:01:19.880> little<00:01:20.090> hand<00:01:20.360> is

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
up to speed because this little hand is

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:23.050 
up to speed because this little hand is
going<00:01:20.750> like<00:01:20.899> muckman<00:01:21.610> and<00:01:22.610> if<00:01:22.729> you<00:01:22.820> really

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
going like muckman and if you really

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.450 
going like muckman and if you really
want<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:23.270> go<00:01:23.390> fast<00:01:23.780> you<00:01:24.679> have<00:01:24.829> to<00:01:24.890> sort<00:01:25.340> a

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
want to go fast you have to sort a

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.789 
want to go fast you have to sort a
streamline<00:01:26.149> and<00:01:26.479> turbocharged<00:01:27.229> that<00:01:27.530> thing

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
streamline and turbocharged that thing

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.289 
streamline and turbocharged that thing
to<00:01:27.950> make<00:01:28.100> it<00:01:28.250> work<00:01:28.429> now<00:01:28.700> come<00:01:28.970> up<00:01:29.090> with

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
to make it work now come up with

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.749 
to make it work now come up with
something<00:01:29.899> here<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:30.319> keep<00:01:31.100> in<00:01:31.220> mind<00:01:31.460> I<00:01:31.549> play

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:53.539 
idea to kind of figure out how to make a

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:55.869 
idea to kind of figure out how to make a
progression<00:05:54.050> into<00:05:54.620> getting<00:05:54.830> a<00:05:54.949> song<00:05:55.219> up<00:05:55.580> to

00:05:57.429 --> 00:05:57.439 
kind of a high speed song because it's

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:59.140 
kind of a high speed song because it's
fun<00:05:57.590> to<00:05:57.710> play<00:05:57.860> that<00:05:58.069> way<00:05:58.250> and<00:05:58.460> it's<00:05:58.610> somewhat

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
fun to play that way and it's somewhat

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.119 
fun to play that way and it's somewhat
impressive<00:05:59.689> when<00:05:59.810> you<00:05:59.900> can<00:06:00.110> whip<00:06:00.710> out<00:06:00.889> our
