00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.600
 hello everyone today I 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:08.680
 find you to make a little goat 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.540
 Summer with the products or the gp2 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.340
 cosmetics I'm going to kill you the 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.140
 previous video 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.460
 so I start with the foundation 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:20.140
 fluid hd I put it directly with the 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.830
 hands which I take a first pump 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.400
 I put it mostly my face and I'm going 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.580
 take a second pump to finish 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.810
 at the front and finish a small 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.920
 little at the level of the coverage too 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.179
 because there is enough confidence 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.300
 light 

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:41.010
 9th well being a second layer and 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.010
 to audois it's better 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.629
 then I use the eyebrow gel on 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:48.850
 top 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.670
 so I put it on my hand and I'm going 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.989
 come with a bottle cleaner so I tap 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.670
 a little bit of products on the spot 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.489
 pimont and I'll just come 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.289
 bush and my eyelashes with you it's going 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:04.600
 drop a few products on the 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.620
 on the eyebrows it's just going to color them 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.260
 a little bit actually 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.030
 and I like this technique 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.160
 since I can not do it 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.040
 brush so here I find that it 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.710
 color a little eyebrows and that 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.520
 does it make it less weird then we 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.230
 go to the eyes I start with the liner 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.810
 so I'm just going to make a 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.430
 little line of liner so what I like 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.980
 to do well is to go small to 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.260
 little we do little things 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.910
 until inside to bind and then 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.490
 here I am trying to remake correctly 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.740
 the line by thickening a little bit 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.510
 more outward 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.960
 then I return the brush and I 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.510
 come and do the little thing and I 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:51.310
 connect and that's it you do everything from 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.040
 Following an eye liner quite well done in 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.750
 desire I am not a pro of the year 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.240
 hours especially when this one is good 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.390
 colorful like that but now there are 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.700
 little by little it's really better 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.650
 you had a lot easier 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.090
 much quieter than wanting 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.259
 try to do it all at once 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.520
 it's already almost impossible and 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.090
 I find it much simpler 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.200
 to go little by little and then you 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.560
 have something that is still 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.960
 much more so much more fun so 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.510
 and the color is super pretty for the summer 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.650
 frankly that's good so I dream 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.980
 what is a little taste the lashes 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.680
 and I go to the color so the little 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.600
 straw color so you are like me 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.720
 had put on the video in fact it's not 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.310
 the world color I was actually expecting 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.260
 there is a small mistake there it is 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.660
 really glittery gleams begs 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.140
 so what is it? 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.300
 flakes 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.970
 so I'm going to put it mainly at 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.600
 middle level of the eyelid and towards 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.350
 interior 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.330
 you must so here I go to 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.390
 masquerades the mascara necessarily 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.630
 waterproof and I will try to good 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.790
 so what is it like I have to root 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.760
 eyelashes and I turn the brush at the same 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.739
 time that I brush the six actually 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.970
 I know if you really see am 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.500
 I mean I hope it shows 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.500
 enough in video 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.080
 so that's what it gives us for 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.630
 eyes we will then continue for the 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.220
 dyed so I'm going to use the blush to 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:33.200
 liquid cheeks that I come to put on 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.150
 duo film brush I find it's 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.090
 much simpler to become 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.260
 apply the product like this 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.850
 apply it not immediately on the 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.320
 days you're going to be too 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.560
 first we apply a little bit on 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.820
 your hand and come tapping with the 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.860
 brush because now you go 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.930
 to have me too much and there anyway 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.200
 I rectify a little audois goes into 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.720
 do too much pink I'm finishing 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.990
 now by the lip gloss that 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.430
 is not brilliant but matt and I'm going 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.840
 put in small touches so there 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.490
 I put directly in brush and 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.530
 frankly what it is much more 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.390
 simple to put directly on 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.040
 your finger 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.720
 I did not want to put the thing 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.940
 directly because it's pretty flashy 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.410
 I put a little bit and I find 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.480
 than the prettier bouquet when it's a 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.130
 little bit like that 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.380
 so here are the girls I hope that 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.410
 you will have enjoyed a little summer goat 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.510
 waterproof all the links are in the 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.710
 info bar and I make you 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.760
 very big mizuho and I tell you to 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.760
 soon to lease
