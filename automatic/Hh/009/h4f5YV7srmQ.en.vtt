00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.219
 he 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:22.210
 day d hour x well and what's there next 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.260
 In general, this whole thing I have gathered 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.890
 the box was such a fool 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.529
 I honestly did not count the volume 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.320
 there is no line here on the port 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.140
 it turned out somewhere 500 70 squares in 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.079
 Basically it turns out to be a graph area 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.340
 on ten or preloaded on dvenashku 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:47.649
 because we on dvenashku did 660 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.670
 here 570 is basically something average 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:53.379
 such around ten it turns out 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.500
 The speakers are the same yesterday in the cold 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.090
 they are waited for by a suspension absolutely don't care 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.829
 how were hard then become hard 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.800
 because I really something dynamics and 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:06.010
 kneaded can be said now somehow 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.970
 in a sly way all this we connect the coil 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.280
 2 + 2 everything will be switched in 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.210
 parallel ie 11 and in series 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:20.830
 there will be two wires going to play from 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:24.310
 how much from mac audio think parade become 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:28.150
 at the time here was laying as usual 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.860
 Carpet all the pieces I put they are whole 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.000
 ring with solid ring as it happens 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.200
 hemorrhoids at nozzle 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.580
 here is another awkward moment 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.680
 installation she roughly speaking grandfather here 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.050
 so for the wires here it remains very 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.260
 little space therefore put one side 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.590
 i would also like to plant 2 but choo 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.140
 It would not work at all, of course it would be a topic 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.160
 if here as at the ends from here still 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.060
 the wires went out 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.070
 additionally there was a mole canes perry though 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.130
 would the terminals on the holes be bigger 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.690
 because basically two such 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.090
 ok but two and a half square 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.340
 There push and in four, even already 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:12.390
 problematic features twist two 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:15.700
 wires so on the box what else 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.560
 Usually, like you do others 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.219
 I recommend to grind a little this one 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:25.780
 edge just take a bigger file 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:26.319
 somewhere like this love 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.750
 teeth 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.250
 I do not know what that number and pass on 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.939
 all corners i 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.760
 there were right angles to this thing 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:39.250
 then nowhere we do not kotsal car 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.189
 did not interfere as if it did not sound funny 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:47.139
 but I often cut about the edge of the board yes 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:48.700
 I was so so what else in 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:51.579
 principle there is even a cut special 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.239
 which, when passing, cuts like this 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:57.219
 little corner and it turns out exactly 45 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:01.209
 the bend is not here doing the same thing 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:02.859
 a file but it hurt a little free to 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.459
 sintering 7 crumble from on plywood 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:09.219
 It turns out clearly so now we are all this 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.930
 little by little for the collective farm we will try 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:16.449
 connect the general were driven it did 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:22.079
 the trunk here is all this here 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:22.079
 there is little space left 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.579
 Usinsk rev 2 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:40.190
 here the whole thing looks like this 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.910
 there is a little place on the side there a little bit 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:47.420
 places on top of the speakers you can see the place 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:52.270
 here here is a piece of iron which interferes in 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:56.420
 principle like so on cold horns street 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:58.370
 hell would understand the weather the day before yesterday was 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.520
 -15 yesterday was 0 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:06.400
 this morning it was about 0 minus 1 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:09.200
 now in the region of -10 so between 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.780
 now would not run at all without 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:18.549
 concepts like this plays hope everything is cool 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.549
 unprincipled route handed them 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:40.569
 that 's something like blowing 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:29.650
 oak speakers in principle comes out here 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:31.450
 on such a move already knocks I do not know what 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.180
 joke on this one speaker a little bit 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.680
 walks more than this one or all the same 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.120
 played the fact that he was near the port 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.420
 is either this one 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.990
 kneaded at home because I took one 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:45.190
 garage to cut the rings a 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.310
 the second kneaded a little more at home 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:51.430
 just maybe, he was caught and knew him 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.170
 the principle is most likely the law 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:57.190
 meanness turned out that they still 

00:06:53.170 --> 00:07:01.900
 changed okay to hell with him so bottom 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:06.930
 until 29 plays very reluctantly date 33 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:10.100
 34 spur he waves a window 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:12.539
 entirely and go trim a little bit 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.810
 I am glad that the food does not squander 

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:18.930
 because monique d-class is kind of like though 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.910
 and piled on until a little connected all in 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.560
 2 ohm 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:25.440
 I will knead forex shoot I think 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.470
 now it is meaningless that the speaker is not 

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:31.259
 mashed up 

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:33.509
 yet you really don't want to throw 

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:38.630
 that's what is in principle somewhere through 

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:38.630
 a week and a half wait for the video with Lex 

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.949
 what am i the topic 

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:42.949
 seemingly
