00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.629

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.530
 agrigento a new way of understanding the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.269
 I trade the work that will surely be 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.950
 among the most important in the province 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.780
 Agrigento in recent years 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.029
 represents the will to respond 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.520
 to the crisis with important investments 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.769
 the shopping center built between 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.930
 fractions of monserrato and villaseta is of 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.029
 property of the villa 7 srl company 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.369
 wholly owned by fininvest pia 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.590
 of Milan directed by doctor Carlo 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.390
 vals and after having invested so much 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.820
 from eastern Sicily he wanted 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.399
 bet on doctor 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.690
 vallars in today's conference 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.340
 presenting the project he told the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.570
 difficulties that an onerous work like 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.100
 this met by his 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.930
 realization 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.420
 the budget allocated initially was 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.520
 of 45 million euros but delays the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.890
 unforeseen circumstances such as finding of 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.960
 war device and the uncertain extension for 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.670
 business risked to do 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.500
 skip the construction of the center 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.730
 as well as having increased the price 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.530
 of the realization 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.080
 doctor Carlo vallardo to ours 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.820
 microphones what does the birth of 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.439
 shopping center city ​​of the times for 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.570
 agrigento 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.450
 I don't think it's a point of arrival 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.909
 but a starting point for agrigento 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.860
 needs me to 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.110
 infrastructures that can 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.310
 to make more and more a place of 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.050
 calamity for both tourists and tourists 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.050
 also for the inhabitants of the province 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.140
 of agrigento itself and be for the 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.450
 Agrigento themselves 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.450
 I think that 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.340
 in this very difficult moment of the 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.369
 history of the economic history of 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.960
 our country is an answer in 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:50.539
 counter-trend that certainly helps 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.500
 local population especially for 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:56.509
 regarding the employment sector 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.520
 and above all as regards also 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.140
 the activities that were done for the 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.789
 realization of the same because we 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:10.069
 we have used many companies 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:12.230
 Agrigento Agrigento Labor Company e 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.730
 so we gave work for the 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.760
 construction of the shopping center a 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.840
 so many Sicilian companies here 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:25.819
 so let's say the city gets richer 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:29.599
 of a very important new factor 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.700
 but in my opinion he still needs b 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:35.269
 grow because agrigento lives on 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.310
 tourism on services and on the part 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.530
 agriculture predominantly not a 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.109
 industries 1 inaugur industries 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.510
 particularly significant for the 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:47.630
 moment and therefore must always more 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.400
 increase this this one 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.730
 I look for the tourist aspect above all 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:57.109
 because he saw the beauty he has 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:01.030
 temples to try to ensure that too 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:04.430
 agrigento is no longer a place of 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.560
 touched and escape so to speak but if a 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.180
 beautiful place to stay 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:14.930
 and being able to enjoy life with everyone 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.120
 essential services because people 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.840
 can stay and live on this 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.910
 territory 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.940
 speaking of numbers precisely how many seats 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:28.310
 work will be created will come 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:31.400
 created of the 350 plus out of the 400 seats 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.310
 work here and I have to tell you that in these 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.200
 days I saw the mall e 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.419
 inside the center inside the 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.239
 stores I saw so many young neo 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:43.730
 hired who are working with great 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.579
 enthusiasm and this is a small one 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.530
 contribution we have is that the center 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.920
 commercial from the plague especially 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.120
 of youth unemployment for the 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.090
 construction of the shopping center 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.489
 320 cubic meters of were dug 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.110
 land and is structured on three levels 2 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.459
 commercial is a level used as a 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.129
 parking area 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.650
 the entire complex and measuring 70 4,600 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:08.719
 square meters of which 22 thousand used 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.430
 commercial activity attention 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:11.959
 architectural in the construction of the 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.750
 complex make up the mall 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.640
 city ​​of temples a modern structure e 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.109
 destined to withstand over time like the 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.539
 famous columns that inspired the 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.219
 name of this shopping city 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:23.870
 a work that bodes well for the economy 

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:26.030
 hopefully the city of Agrigento 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.650
 may find the flywheel in this work 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.390
 that can revive the work and to 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.479
 consequently the economy of the city of gods 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.479
 temples
