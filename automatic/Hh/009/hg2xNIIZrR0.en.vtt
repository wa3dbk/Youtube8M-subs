and but enemies are still red which is
still<00:00:36.660> normal<00:00:36.840> witches<00:00:37.340> so<00:00:38.340> basically<00:00:38.700> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
still normal witches so basically the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.389 
still normal witches so basically the
radar<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.149> still<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> same<00:00:40.100> but<00:00:41.100> now<00:00:41.250> if<00:00:41.340> you

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
radar is still the same but now if you

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.770 
radar is still the same but now if you
look<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.670> right<00:00:41.940> hand<00:00:42.210> corner<00:00:42.450> the

look in the right hand corner the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.770 
look in the right hand corner the
scoring<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.739> much<00:00:43.950> different<00:00:44.750> instead<00:00:45.750> of

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
scoring is so much different instead of

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.779 
scoring is so much different instead of
being<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.260> know<00:00:46.410> like<00:00:46.590> one<00:00:46.860> two<00:00:47.219> three<00:00:47.489> four

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
being you know like one two three four

went didn't have the BR but the
crosshairs<00:01:18.330> are<00:01:18.450> different<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.380> having

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
crosshairs are different so if having

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.859 
emblem for a picture which and it says
the<00:01:46.860> number<00:01:46.890> 5<00:01:47.399> next<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.119> each<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.509> metals

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
the number 5 next to each the metals

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.870 
the number 5 next to each the metals
which<00:01:49.710> I'm<00:01:49.860> guessing<00:01:50.009> it's<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.369> fifth<00:01:50.759> time

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
which I'm guessing it's the fifth time

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.030 
which I'm guessing it's the fifth time
you've<00:01:51.270> acquired<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.409> metal<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.860> same

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
you've acquired that metal in the same

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.630 
you've acquired that metal in the same
game<00:01:53.630> that's<00:01:54.630> just<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.869> guess<00:01:55.079> but<00:01:55.380> also<00:01:56.369> if<00:01:56.579> you

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
game that's just a guess but also if you

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.670 
game that's just a guess but also if you
look<00:01:56.790> at<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.909> scoring<00:01:57.360> again<00:01:57.659> has<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.409> picture

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
look at the scoring again has a picture

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.359 
look at the scoring again has a picture
of<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.890> unicorn<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.579> wolf<00:01:59.880> for<00:02:00.210> emblems<00:02:00.869> I

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
of a unicorn in the wolf for emblems I

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.709 
of a unicorn in the wolf for emblems I
don't<00:02:02.369> know<00:02:02.490> if<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.759> like<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.450> choose<00:02:03.689> a

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
don't know if this like you choose a

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.560 
don't know if this like you choose a
team<00:02:04.079> now<00:02:04.350> or<00:02:04.530> something<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:05.159> can<00:02:06.119> call<00:02:06.329> duty

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
team now or something I can call duty

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.290 
team now or something I can call duty
but<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.459> guess<00:02:08.459> something<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:08.849> up<00:02:09.000> with<00:02:09.030> those

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
but I guess something is up with those

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.660 
but I guess something is up with those
also<00:02:09.649> we'll<00:02:10.649> find<00:02:10.920> out<00:02:11.039> more<00:02:11.220> later

take off his helmet in this game we'll
we'll<00:04:11.920> find<00:04:12.130> out<00:04:12.310> that's<00:04:13.090> going<00:04:13.450> to<00:04:13.569> be<00:04:13.799> quite

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
we'll find out that's going to be quite

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.039 
we'll find out that's going to be quite
awesome<00:04:15.010> if<00:04:15.519> we<00:04:15.549> does<00:04:16.060> and<00:04:17.100> here's<00:04:18.100> basically

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
awesome if we does and here's basically

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.480 
awesome if we does and here's basically
343<00:04:20.669> updating<00:04:21.669> the<00:04:21.880> bodies<00:04:22.300> of<00:04:22.330> all<00:04:22.780> Spartans

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
343 updating the bodies of all Spartans

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.050 
343 updating the bodies of all Spartans
it

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
it

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.490 
it
guess<00:04:26.270> that<00:04:26.510> that's<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:26.900> skeleton<00:04:27.350> inside

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
guess that that's the skeleton inside

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.950 
guess that that's the skeleton inside
the<00:04:27.950> Spartan<00:04:28.400> I<00:04:28.669> guess<00:04:29.389> what<00:04:29.540> they're<00:04:29.660> doing

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
the Spartan I guess what they're doing

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.290 
the Spartan I guess what they're doing
is<00:04:30.139> like<00:04:30.440> so<00:04:31.190> when<00:04:31.280> they<00:04:31.430> when<00:04:31.730> someone<00:04:32.150> dies

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
is like so when they when someone dies

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.379 
is like so when they when someone dies
by<00:04:32.600> explosion<00:04:33.290> or<00:04:33.440> something<00:04:33.850> their<00:04:34.850> act<00:04:35.180> like

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
by explosion or something their act like

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.770 
by explosion or something their act like
a<00:04:35.419> rag<00:04:35.780> doll<00:04:36.169> or<00:04:36.410> something<00:04:36.590> in<00:04:36.919> there<00:04:37.070> like

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
a rag doll or something in there like

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.210 
a rag doll or something in there like
hands<00:04:38.780> and<00:04:38.900> legs<00:04:39.050> be<00:04:39.290> flying<00:04:39.650> around<00:04:39.950> when

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
hands and legs be flying around when

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.629 
hands and legs be flying around when
they<00:04:40.340> die<00:04:40.760> and<00:04:41.060> all<00:04:41.120> that<00:04:41.389> they<00:04:42.200> get<00:04:42.350> blown<00:04:42.560> up

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
they die and all that they get blown up

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.190 
they die and all that they get blown up
so<00:04:43.639> be<00:04:43.790> more<00:04:44.000> like<00:04:44.150> a<00:04:44.180> realistic<00:04:44.780> death<00:04:44.990> or

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
so be more like a realistic death or

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.750 
so be more like a realistic death or
something<00:04:45.320> like<00:04:45.500> that<00:04:45.590> I<00:04:45.919> don't<00:04:46.250> know<00:04:46.340> I'm<00:04:46.580> not

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
something like that I don't know I'm not

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.750 
something like that I don't know I'm not
I<00:04:47.030> don't<00:04:47.900> know<00:04:47.960> a<00:04:48.139> lot<00:04:48.320> about<00:04:48.380> it<00:04:48.800> but<00:04:49.100> also<00:04:49.310> not

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760
