 What was the amount of generation of today disconnect or Kanèª­Well Well people at the base that is Well 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.780
 The members are different, so the state is different too 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.220
 Well I think this year is Manson I just did well 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.970

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:31.040
