what<00:02:03.299> I'll<00:02:03.479> try<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.810> do<00:02:03.930> something<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.380> that

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
what I'll try and do something in that

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.800 
what I'll try and do something in that
size<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.189> I

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
size and I

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.160 
size and I
challenged<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:08.550> try<00:02:09.550> to<00:02:09.610> squeeze<00:02:10.360> a<00:02:10.509> motive

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
challenged to try to squeeze a motive

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.040 
challenged to try to squeeze a motive
into<00:02:11.590> this<00:02:11.739> tall<00:02:12.430> narrow<00:02:13.030> format<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:15.900> in<00:02:16.900> the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
into this tall narrow format and in the

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.040 
into this tall narrow format and in the
end<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.349> really<00:02:17.680> liked<00:02:18.000> using<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:19.300> format<00:02:19.750> and

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.949 

so<00:02:23.050> it's<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.760> mainly<00:02:24.760> practical<00:02:25.330> reasons<00:02:25.750> but

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
so it's a mainly practical reasons but

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.890 
so it's a mainly practical reasons but
almost<00:02:26.769> later<00:02:27.220> I<00:02:28.150> hope

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
almost later I hope

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.440 
almost later I hope
aesthetic<00:02:29.560> reason<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:30.099> the<00:02:30.250> shape<00:02:30.760> of<00:02:31.060> the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
aesthetic reason that the shape of the

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.050 
aesthetic reason that the shape of the
paintings<00:02:31.840> are<00:02:32.050> oh<00:02:32.650> definitely<00:02:33.310> because<00:02:33.849> I

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
paintings are oh definitely because I

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.630 
paintings are oh definitely because I
feel<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.569> you<00:02:34.750> know<00:02:34.870> there<00:02:35.230> was<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:35.860> tall
