00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
honest 1089 aggression which is really

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.130 
honest 1089 aggression which is really
good<00:00:39.059> it's<00:00:39.210> going<00:00:39.329> for<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> ball<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.930> time

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140
