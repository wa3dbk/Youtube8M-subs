00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
nass box and if you and that's what

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.330 
nass box and if you and that's what
means<00:01:41.630> it's<00:01:41.869> just<00:01:42.110> for<00:01:42.259> one<00:01:42.290> year<00:01:42.740> in<00:01:42.920> terms<00:01:43.130> of

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
means it's just for one year in terms of

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.380 
means it's just for one year in terms of
shelf<00:01:43.640> storage<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:45.520> if<00:01:46.520> you<00:01:46.759> fill<00:01:47.119> this<00:01:47.240> up

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
shelf storage and if you fill this up

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.880 
shelf storage and if you fill this up
with<00:01:47.450> six<00:01:47.810> TB<00:01:48.079> drives<00:01:48.350> that<00:01:48.530> means<00:01:48.740> you're

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
with six TB drives that means you're

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.499 
with six TB drives that means you're
gonna<00:01:49.009> be<00:01:49.100> getting<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.399> potential<00:01:49.909> 24

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
gonna be getting a potential 24

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.719 
gonna be getting a potential 24

terabytes of storage pre-ride

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.730 
terabytes of storage pre-ride
so<00:01:53.390> there's<00:01:53.600> still<00:01:53.810> quite<00:01:53.899> a<00:01:53.960> large<00:01:54.200> number<00:01:54.350> so

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
so there's still quite a large number so

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.649 
so there's still quite a large number so
yes<00:01:55.310> there's<00:01:55.610> only<00:01:55.670> four<00:01:55.969> bags<00:01:56.149> but<00:01:56.360> of<00:01:56.450> course

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
yes there's only four bags but of course

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.149 
yes there's only four bags but of course
with<00:01:56.840> those<00:01:56.990> larger<00:01:57.380> drive<00:01:57.619> types<00:01:57.890> available

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
with those larger drive types available

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.910 
with those larger drive types available
in<00:01:58.549> there's<00:01:59.079> definitely<00:02:00.079> not<00:02:00.229> exactly<00:02:00.680> the

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
in there's definitely not exactly the

right so lots of speed there and you

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.230 
right so lots of speed there and you
spread<00:02:27.470> that<00:02:27.620> on<00:02:27.740> those<00:02:27.890> six<00:02:28.100> TB<00:02:28.430> drives<00:02:28.730> at

purchase of an extra 4 GB after 6
gigabytes<00:02:45.590> of<00:02:45.890> RAM<00:02:46.130> so<00:02:47.000> again<00:02:47.270> you<00:02:47.750> don't<00:02:47.930> need

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
gigabytes of RAM so again you don't need

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.650 
gigabytes of RAM so again you don't need
much<00:02:48.530> more<00:02:48.830> than<00:02:49.100> those<00:02:49.400> 2<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.850> 6<00:02:50.090> in<00:02:50.240> a<00:02:50.330> box<00:02:50.480> of

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
much more than those 2 to 6 in a box of

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.720 
much more than those 2 to 6 in a box of
this<00:02:50.780> size<00:02:51.080> and<00:02:51.410> even<00:02:51.890> if<00:02:52.100> you<00:02:52.220> were<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.580> add

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
this size and even if you were to add

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.910 
this size and even if you were to add
lots<00:02:53.030> more<00:02:53.240> volumes<00:02:53.840> into<00:02:54.050> this<00:02:54.290> mix<00:02:54.560> it<00:02:54.740> still

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
lots more volumes into this mix it still

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.960 
lots more volumes into this mix it still
doesn't<00:02:55.220> mean<00:02:55.280> you're<00:02:55.430> gonna<00:02:55.520> need<00:02:55.700> more<00:02:55.910> than

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
doesn't mean you're gonna need more than

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.500 
doesn't mean you're gonna need more than
2<00:02:56.360> but<00:02:57.320> is<00:02:57.470> I<00:02:57.920> think<00:02:58.580> about<00:02:58.760> an<00:02:58.850> average<00:02:59.209> size

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
2 but is I think about an average size

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.630

about<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.350> back<00:03:33.500> of<00:03:33.650> this<00:03:33.739> box<00:03:33.920> is<00:03:34.220> there<00:03:34.430> just

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
about the back of this box is there just

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.400 
about the back of this box is there just
seems<00:03:34.880> to<00:03:35.030> be<00:03:35.060> quite<00:03:35.390> a<00:03:35.420> lot<00:03:35.690> of<00:03:35.810> fans<00:03:36.080> and

to four hundred to four hundred what am
I<00:05:02.840> saying<00:05:03.050> there<00:05:03.290> forty<00:05:03.680> eight<00:05:03.890> terabytes<00:05:04.670> of

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
I saying there forty eight terabytes of

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.200 
I saying there forty eight terabytes of
storage<00:05:05.800> so<00:05:06.800> that's<00:05:06.950> massive<00:05:07.430> and<00:05:07.550> that's<00:05:07.700> the

storage so that's massive and that's the

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.750

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.090 
60 B WD reading as drives are available
now<00:05:11.240> obviously<00:05:12.200> as<00:05:12.260> time<00:05:12.290> wears<00:05:12.680> on<00:05:12.890> those

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
now obviously as time wears on those

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.130 
now obviously as time wears on those
capacities<00:05:13.610> will<00:05:13.850> get<00:05:14.060> bigger<00:05:14.300> so<00:05:14.870> it<00:05:14.960> feels

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
capacities will get bigger so it feels

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.170
