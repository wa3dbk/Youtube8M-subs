00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
car started ideally the alternator

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.320 
car started ideally the alternator
should<00:01:09.920> pick<00:01:10.160> up<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.400> load<00:01:10.550> for<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.030> whole

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
should pick up the load for the whole

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.960 
should pick up the load for the whole
system<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:12.020> power<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.830> whole<00:01:12.950> system

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
system and power the whole system

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.670 
system and power the whole system
if<00:01:15.330> your<00:01:15.540> alternator<00:01:15.810> doesn't<00:01:16.350> have<00:01:16.500> to

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
if your alternator doesn't have to

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.170 
if your alternator doesn't have to
choose<00:01:17.010> the<00:01:17.190> power<00:01:17.400> system<00:01:17.700> let's<00:01:18.000> say<00:01:18.090> you

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
choose the power system let's say you

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.930 
choose the power system let's say you
put<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.480> a<00:01:18.570> multi<00:01:19.050> fast<00:01:19.320> one<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.620> fire<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
put in a multi fast one and fire and the

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.300 
put in a multi fast one and fire and the
alternator<00:01:21.360> can't<00:01:21.600> keep<00:01:21.810> up<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.650> will<00:01:22.800> drop<00:01:23.070> in

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
alternator can't keep up it will drop in

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.890 
alternator can't keep up it will drop in
its<00:01:23.400> voltage<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:24.030> battery<00:01:24.360> will<00:01:24.540> help<00:01:24.780> you

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
its voltage the battery will help you

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.450 
its voltage the battery will help you
implode<00:01:25.260> but<00:01:25.470> ideally<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.070> alternator

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
implode but ideally the alternator

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.790 
implode but ideally the alternator
should<00:01:26.670> power<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.060> whole<00:01:27.120> system<00:01:27.620> lots<00:01:28.620> of

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
should power the whole system lots of

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.410 
should power the whole system lots of
