00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.589
 template lovers welcome to skiing 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.600
 brazil number 4 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.300
 I'm luiz felipe and today I'm going to speak 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.400
 for you what is a scotch whiskey blend 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.650
 I have here to show a great 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.309
 layman 1 burnley bull both by johnnie 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.029
 walker 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.510
 so come on 1 blended scotch whiskey is 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.510
 90% of the skiing consumed in the world 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.769
 make a good whiskey scotch blues 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:32.070
 we need at least 40% of the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.980
 silicon you 40% malted barley o 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.930
 which will be 40% of several symbols mount 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.809
 it will not be just a symbol mount a cei 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.940
 several single mount we do not have here 40% 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:48.870
 of malted barley and the other 60% are 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.250
 miserable products produced from 1,101 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.850
 and wheat 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.430
 the strongest feature of these 60% is 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.680
 a corn since corn used is corn 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.329
 can you tell me that America is 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.820
 and genetically 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:09.060
 modified and it is extremely sweet 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.250
 it is so sweet that the ethanol produced 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.430
 here in the United States is done from 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.740
 corn which for many people are in 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.990
 Brazil as corn something salty since 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.880
 Butter and salt kitchen 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.810
 here you can cross with salt that still 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.890
 will leave if she is very sweet what is 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.600
 best setting is extremely sweet 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.380
 let's not go here let's use this example 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:38.780
 here is a johnnie walker dilemma 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.049
 diageo tac the name of goodwill is the owner of 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.210
 walker 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.500
 she also owns several refineries 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.930
 in scotland 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.329
 so for John Walker's production she 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.490
 has ensured that the others that 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.189
 several employees will send with 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.549
 skis so that they can produce a 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.170
 globe radio in the case here in this case 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.610
 good harley they do not care much 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.560
 with quality 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.299
 so that what is produced will be 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.939
 aged in low quality barrels 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.149
 are fucking getting older in 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.370
 high quality neighborhoods so much 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.459
 people think that a blend does not have a good 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.459
 quality 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.750
 but we have an example here of the 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.890
 volleyball the burnley button excellent 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.340
 quality 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.600
 they simply made a good whiskey 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.830
 have aged a case do a good job 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.230
 spirit 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.690
 aging in high quality barrels 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.690
 are barrels that were used one or two 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.060
 or three times a case this has already been 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.520
 used ten times neighborhood already broke already 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.130
 placed a piece of oak from a 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.830
 another barrel made retread increase 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.330
 of the barrel because I'm not 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.030
 worried about making a good gesture 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.640
 quality in this case here 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.260
 then put a dye there is nothing 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.270
 You've been wrong for a month now. 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.730
 inexpensive since the person will consume 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.610
 consume it with another drink but 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.080
 advice drinks a lot like tea in staff 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.680
 I like to drink with water 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.480
 fault 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.310
 So whoever missed any is a mixed 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.360
 cheap that it will be consumed with a 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.580
 another drink but also can do 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.620
 a good quality blend that the 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.750
 people are likely to take this 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.180
 large with only one or two pieces of ice 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.270
 to take better advantage of the 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.240
 blandy and also follows the same logic 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.070
 at least 40% of me 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.620
 the single malt here in the case of barley 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.500
 malted case number 5 lot that 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.660
 would make a big pile and here in 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.480
 whiskey came from other great ones as well 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.770
 There's corn here like the one here. 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.290
 a month coming from me this here too 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.470
 has 12 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.150
 What has changed here is that the whiskey here 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.340
 inside was aged in barrels of 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.040
 better qualities and these neighborhoods 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.000
 produce so it is better one 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.320
 detail problem it does not mark age 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.160
 as well as good harley not 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.660
 mark age 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.090
 so if you think that if the 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.670
 Brazilian eight years you're mistaken. 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.470
 he is not 18 years old 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.440
 and who thinks the blue label 20 years 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.510
 he is also mistaken he is not 20 years old and 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.960
 that if anyone has heard that someone 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.120
 said because in that mix he places the country 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.690
 aged 20 and were aged for 20 years. 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.270
 years 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.109
 Let's always put 10 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.410
 barrels 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:25.460
 they do by lot is to put ten barrels 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.110
 who were aged for 20 years in 30 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.689
 barrels that were known a little bit 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.689
 - that's why it does not age 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.819
 here I already have a royal salute xix 21 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:40.009
 years 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:43.039
 What do you want me to say? 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:47.620
 here all that has here in the 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:50.330
 minimum age of this mixture is 21 years 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.259
 he 's already here he is not hiding 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.449
 age 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:56.479
 it means you have a mix here more 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:59.240
 and also does not speak the proportion alone 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:01.210
 to point out that there are people who watch 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.939
 this thinks of something else 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:07.819
 china produces 21-year-old whiskey here 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:10.009
 with quality for royalty he calls 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:15.289
 that we had here in our 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:18.139
 elite loews kitchen royal salute of 21 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:21.409
 which is something common in the navy and 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.610
 army then greeting 21 shots at 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:24.469
 a real greeting 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.360
 they made a 21 year skipper here 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:27.949
 forbidden health requiring a ski with 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.339
 quality for you to offer to the 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:32.440
 queen of england 

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:35.960
 basically this 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.120
 so here it is a blend then too 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.779
 Let's read this is it has at least 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.000
 40% coming from barley mounted on this 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:46.639
 they came from what they did 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.979
 in the case of this assembled band producing 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:52.580
 several single hills were aged 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:58.819
 in excellent barrels and thus produced a 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:06:00.740
 excellent scott was all produced in 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:03.830
 scotland wales and bottled scotland 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.439
 in Scotland has to be bottled 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.360
 schools and now we are here too 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:10.699
 We have people that many people think 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.620
 a big one does not have quality what he thinks 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:13.969
 being a blend has no quality and only has 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.759
 quality and bother 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:17.629
 it's not true you find it's good 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:19.370
 blanes 

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:22.159
 the big difference is that the blend 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:27.500
 usually at 40% alcoholic strength 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:31.310
 which would be 80% to 1 40% to 30% and 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:34.400
 40% forty percent a minimum for 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:38.060
 make a spot already on the single malts you 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.600
 is a 46 per hundred and fifty 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:45.380
 and sixty percent 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:47.540
 and that's good, the next video I 'm going to 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.520
 I'll talk about the types of gifts 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.400
 we practically have four types of blogs 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.000
 and if anyone has any questions comment 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.530
 on here 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.210
 down here that we will gladly 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.210
 answer until the next
