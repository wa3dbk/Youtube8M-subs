Hello to everyone!

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.140
Hope this video will be useful for you!

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.140
it's about How to clean an oven.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.740
I faced with this problem 4-5 months ago when I was pregnant

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:27.240
After we had cooked for the first time we discovered it was very dirty

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.500
And it was impossible to clean it by cleanser

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.980
I've tries to find any cleanser in markets

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.980
I've read instruction for my oven

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.300
and it's forbidden to use very stron cleanser

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.300
but i didn't have any choice:(

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.680
I'd watched many videos in Youtube and had read information in forums but didn't have sucess

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:06.620
Even I  tried one thing: soda + ammonia + soap and something else but... :(

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.840
didn't have any result...

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.440
But I could clean microwaveoven))) but it was too simple

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.100
Once... when I gave up ... I'd found super thing and I'd like to share it with you!

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:37.880
You need 5 bottles of ammonia (each bottle 40 ml). So totally - 200 ml.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.300
Put all ammonia to the plate

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.020
Then you put water in another plate

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:07.200
You can use even cold water

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.440
Turn on your oven up to 180C

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.740
Turn it off after 15 minutes

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.740
put the plates with water andinside your oven
