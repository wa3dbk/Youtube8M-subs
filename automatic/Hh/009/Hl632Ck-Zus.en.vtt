00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
kind of strange

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.380 
kind of strange
I'm<00:02:13.480> not<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:14.560> don't<00:02:15.010> have<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:15.550> much<00:02:15.730> information

about the Spanish chocolate industry and

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.080 
about the Spanish chocolate industry and

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
I think with Oreos this was sort of a

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:38.250 
I think with Oreos this was sort of a
genuine<00:02:25.600> idea<00:02:27.750> it's<00:02:28.750> awesome<00:02:36.600> yeah<00:02:37.600> it's

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
genuine idea it's awesome yeah it's

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:50.030 
genuine idea it's awesome yeah it's
super<00:02:38.530> speed<00:02:41.160> usually<00:02:42.160> brandy<00:02:44.400> super<00:02:45.400> premium

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.260 

yeah<00:02:51.040> it's<00:02:51.160> different<00:02:51.400> things<00:02:51.910> at<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.150> same

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
yeah it's different things at the same

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.810 
yeah it's different things at the same
time<00:02:52.780> so<00:02:54.750> dusty<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:55.780> creamy<00:02:56.520> yeah<00:02:57.520> it's
