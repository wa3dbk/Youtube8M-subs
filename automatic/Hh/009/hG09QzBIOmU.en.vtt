00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
already depreciated creek by we don't

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.940 
already depreciated creek by we don't
need<00:02:53.910> extra<00:02:54.060> pace<00:02:54.510> on<00:02:54.720> them<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.440> passing

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950

and their offending I find what works
really<00:02:58.320> well<00:02:58.410> so<00:02:58.710> it<00:02:59.640> is<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.940> proof<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.390> lemma

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870
