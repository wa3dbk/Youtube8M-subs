then moving on to the blue I probably

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.190 
then moving on to the blue I probably
could<00:01:18.000> have<00:01:18.030> left<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> purple<00:01:18.840> out<00:01:18.990> but<00:01:19.170> I

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
could have left the purple out but I

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.140 
could have left the purple out but I
really<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.920> color<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.460> decided<00:01:20.880> to

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
really like the color so I decided to

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.200
