00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello everyone , I can assure you not 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.509
 I'm crazy there's a reason if I have 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.059
 fingers with chat and so if you notice they are 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.040
 all glazes with glitter or otherwise 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.040
 with michele all it or with microspheres 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.900
 this is because today's video will focus 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.789
 on these types of glazes as well 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.980
 you will know these enamels are very much 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.320
 therefore difficult to remove sometimes me 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.939
 I even give up putting them because then 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.609
 I don't feel like stalls with the chainsaw 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.130
 to remove it from the nail this video is 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.960
 made to offer you a solution 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.630
 there would simply be glue 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.969
 vinyl and a clean brush 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.469
 the enamels I will use in this video is it 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:43.710
 space dust by rimmel and number 007 on 163 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:48.510
 and the essence new ones that effect 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.579
 sand g 11 4 of the slots and 578 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.770
 marble effect always of ies love 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.140
 then we take our little brush from 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.809
 Battle we dye it in the glue 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.250
 vinyl and spread it on the nail as 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.250
 if it were normal enamel 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.050
 we now wait for it to dry completely 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.360
 we will notice it because it will become 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.950
 completely transparent of course i 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.170
 drying times are a little more 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.240
 long compared to a normal enamel there 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.040
 it takes about ten minutes though 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.350
 I assure you that it's worth it 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.440
 and here we are, everything is dried for 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.910
 well as you see it remains completely 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.960
 transparent advice if you do not have 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.910
 want to wait 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.740
 you can obviously use the hair dryer for 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.750
 dry it all up faster now 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.750
 proceed by applying over the various glazes 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.340
 not that the enamels are completely there 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.590
 dried now we can proceed with 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.570
 removal with the help of a fullback 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.430
 or of our own nail we go to 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.820
 remove everything as if it were one 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.820
 film 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.950
 et voila in short, apart from a few stickers 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.230
 which I am now going to remove with a little more 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.370
 of calm to say that the result is a lot 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.650
 satisfactory 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.840
 with this technique the removal times 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.090
 enamels with it become shorter 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.129
 it is actually very much indeed 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.170
 I am really fast 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.330
 satisfied and in my case no nails 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.190
 we know where nano for anything at most yes 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.769
 they dry a little but it is the same 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.200
 result that I have with acetone rather not 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.360
 I have to stay 20 wants with acetone for 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.010
 being able to remove all the enamel 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.410
 having said that I hope this tutorial 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.910
 there were useful faith jury themes 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.470

 tried this technique and what it was 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.360
