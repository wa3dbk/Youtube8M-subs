00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
have the ability to look 360 degrees all

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.389 
have the ability to look 360 degrees all
the<00:01:20.369> way<00:01:20.429> around<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.819> see<00:01:21.630> ya<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:23.250> biggest

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
the way around to see ya the biggest

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.669 
the way around to see ya the biggest
challenge<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.360> camera<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:25.229> currently

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
challenge with the camera is currently

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:29.240 
challenge with the camera is currently
the<00:01:25.770> lensing<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.520> much<00:01:26.700> wider<00:01:27.830> film<00:01:28.830> camp<00:01:29.069> and

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
the lensing is much wider film camp and

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.290 
the lensing is much wider film camp and
we're<00:01:29.700> at<00:01:29.759> least<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:29.940> don't<00:01:30.030> have<00:01:30.149> a<00:01:30.240> choice

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
we're at least you don't have a choice

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.149 
we're at least you don't have a choice
really<00:01:30.780> with<00:01:30.929> your<00:01:31.080> lenses<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.649> most

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
really with your lenses and most

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.160 
really with your lenses and most
importantly<00:01:32.640> because<00:01:32.819> you<00:01:33.060> see<00:01:33.240> 360<00:01:33.990> degrees

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
importantly because you see 360 degrees

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.100 
importantly because you see 360 degrees
in<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.159> round<00:01:35.399> your<00:01:36.060> your<00:01:36.390> typical<00:01:36.630> coverage

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
in the round your your typical coverage

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.749 
in the round your your typical coverage
and<00:01:37.259> photography<00:01:37.799> as<00:01:37.979> well<00:01:38.159> as<00:01:38.369> just<00:01:38.610> where

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
and photography as well as just where

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
top to bottom 360 degrees there has to

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.020 
top to bottom 360 degrees there has to
be<00:01:46.619> action<00:01:47.039> something<00:01:47.490> going<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:47.820> at<00:01:47.939> all

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
be action something going on at all

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.200 
be action something going on at all
times<00:01:48.799> otherwise<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.640> viewer<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:51.030> turn

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
times otherwise the viewer can turn

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.459 
times otherwise the viewer can turn
around<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.539> see<00:01:51.659> there's<00:01:51.990> people<00:01:52.259> saying

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
around and see there's people saying

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.319 
around and see there's people saying
they're<00:01:52.590> waiting<00:01:52.890> for<00:01:53.039> the<00:01:53.100> tank<00:01:53.310> or<00:01:53.789> turn

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
they're waiting for the tank or turn

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.599 
they're waiting for the tank or turn
around<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.810> see<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.280> basically<00:01:56.280> nothing's

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:56.609 
around and see that basically nothing's

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:57.770 
around and see that basically nothing's
happened<00:01:56.969> what<00:01:57.210> I'm<00:01:57.299> trying<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.479> do<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.600> I'm

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
happened what I'm trying to do is I'm

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.959 
happened what I'm trying to do is I'm
bending<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.590> boundaries<00:01:59.460> what<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.789> knew<00:01:59.939> the

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
bending the boundaries what you knew the

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.999 
bending the boundaries what you knew the
camp<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.899> I'm<00:02:01.020> trying<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.350> treat<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.649> camera

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
camp so I'm trying to treat the camera

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.060 
camp so I'm trying to treat the camera
it's<00:02:02.189> just<00:02:02.340> another<00:02:02.549> way<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.119> tell<00:02:03.390> an<00:02:03.509> error

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
it's just another way to tell an error

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.469 
it's just another way to tell an error
so<00:02:05.070> i<00:02:05.100> think<00:02:05.490> i<00:02:05.700> think<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.969> audience<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.329> like

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
so i think i think the audience to like

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.140 
so i think i think the audience to like
fun
