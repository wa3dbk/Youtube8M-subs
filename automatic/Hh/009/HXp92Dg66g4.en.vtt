00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.970 
and relaxing sand
and<00:02:22.140> then<00:02:22.910> just<00:02:23.910> whisk<00:02:24.300> it<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.590> oils

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
and then just whisk it so that the oils

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
and then just whisk it so that the oils
are<00:02:26.130> evenly<00:02:26.580> spread<00:02:27.060> throughout<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.630> salts

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
are evenly spread throughout the salts

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.990 
are evenly spread throughout the salts
the<00:02:30.000> salt<00:02:30.570> will<00:02:30.980> seem<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.010> little<00:02:32.310> bit<00:02:32.430> moister

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
the salt will seem a little bit moister

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.350 
the salt will seem a little bit moister
not<00:02:33.450> not<00:02:33.870> dramatic<00:02:34.470> wanna<00:02:35.430> whisk<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.090> really

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
not not dramatic wanna whisk it really

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.500 
not not dramatic wanna whisk it really
well<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:37.550> that's<00:02:38.550> worth<00:02:38.820> some<00:02:39.210> of<00:02:39.360> the

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
well so that that's worth some of the

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.950 
well so that that's worth some of the
blend<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.930> oils<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:41.100> then<00:02:41.280> after<00:02:41.940> every<00:02:42.840> if

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
blend of oils and then after every if

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.770 
blend of oils and then after every if
you<00:02:43.110> like<00:02:43.320> it's<00:02:43.530> well<00:02:43.890> blended<00:02:44.240> then<00:02:45.240> I<00:02:45.480> just

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
you like it's well blended then I just

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.690 
you like it's well blended then I just
let<00:02:45.990> it<00:02:46.020> sit<00:02:46.440> for<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.740> little<00:02:46.920> while<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.550> do

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
let it sit for a little while and do

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.810
