started on the conversion and talk about
a<00:00:41.220> few<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.519> things<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.030> we're<00:00:42.120> gonna<00:00:42.239> have<00:00:42.330> to

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
a few of things that we're gonna have to

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.500 
a few of things that we're gonna have to
do<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.470> get<00:00:44.280> into<00:00:44.519> wine<00:00:44.699> and<00:00:44.879> some<00:00:45.059> oils

do to it and get into wine and some oils

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.270 
do to it and get into wine and some oils
but<00:00:45.690> before<00:00:45.989> we<00:00:46.110> do<00:00:46.290> that<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.070> make<00:00:47.250> a

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
but before we do that you have to make a

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.160 
but before we do that you have to make a
jig<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.970> can't<00:00:48.330> really<00:00:48.449> help<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.809> with<00:00:48.900> that

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
jig I can't really help you with that

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.900 
jig I can't really help you with that
but<00:00:49.410> I'll<00:00:49.500> show<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.769> the<00:00:49.890> jig<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.220> I<00:00:50.460> come<00:00:50.730> up

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
but I'll show you the jig that I come up

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.090 
but I'll show you the jig that I come up
with<00:00:51.089> to<00:00:51.269> line<00:00:51.420> my<00:00:51.659> coils<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.290> we'll<00:00:52.350> go<00:00:52.979> over

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
with to line my coils and we'll go over

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.979 
with to line my coils and we'll go over
the<00:00:53.370> whole<00:00:53.549> steps<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.059> how<00:00:54.210> I'm<00:00:54.390> winding<00:00:54.809> my

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
the whole steps on how I'm winding my

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.829 
the whole steps on how I'm winding my
coils<00:00:55.470> so<00:00:56.190> let's<00:00:56.489> take<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> look<00:00:56.940> at<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.239> this

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
coils so let's take a look at that this

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:59.509 
coils so let's take a look at that this
is<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.110> wire<00:00:58.290> that<00:00:58.440> we<00:00:58.620> use<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.400> a

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
is the wire that we use and it's a

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.560 
is the wire that we use and it's a
coated<00:01:00.059> copper<00:01:00.330> and<00:01:01.280> as<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.549> comes<00:01:02.760> along<00:01:03.150> here

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
coated copper and as it comes along here

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.719 
coated copper and as it comes along here
it<00:01:03.989> comes<00:01:04.229> into<00:01:04.440> our<00:01:04.530> jig<00:01:04.949> which<00:01:05.190> is<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.610> a

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
it comes into our jig which is just a

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.760 
it comes into our jig which is just a
few<00:01:06.000> two-by-four<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.840> staffed<00:01:07.260> with<00:01:08.360> a<00:01:09.770> piece

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
few two-by-four is staffed with a piece

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.810 
few two-by-four is staffed with a piece
from<00:01:11.010> my<00:01:11.250> drum<00:01:12.619> so<00:01:13.619> actually<00:01:14.310> greater<00:01:14.580> than

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
from my drum so actually greater than

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.740 
from my drum so actually greater than
not<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.030> we<00:01:15.540> use<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.140> mind<00:01:16.979> our<00:01:17.130> coils<00:01:17.670> but<00:01:18.600> it

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
not that we use to mind our coils but it

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.510 
not that we use to mind our coils but it
works<00:01:18.930> out<00:01:19.080> where<00:01:19.320> they<00:01:19.470> get<00:01:19.740> we'll<00:01:20.280> show<00:01:20.490> you

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
works out where they get we'll show you

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.020 
works out where they get we'll show you
how<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.880> would<00:01:21.000> do<00:01:21.150> it

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
how it would do it

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.510 
how it would do it
so<00:01:24.030> what<00:01:24.150> we're<00:01:24.300> starting<00:01:24.420> with<00:01:24.870> our

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
so what we're starting with our

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.550 
so what we're starting with our
composite<00:01:26.520> washers<00:01:27.230> they're<00:01:28.230> about<00:01:28.410> an

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
composite washers they're about an

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.770 
composite washers they're about an
eighth<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.740> an<00:01:29.100> inch<00:01:29.220> thick<00:01:29.640> we<00:01:30.030> have<00:01:30.150> three<00:01:30.630> of

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
eighth of an inch thick we have three of

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.020 
eighth of an inch thick we have three of
them<00:01:30.960> what<00:01:31.650> we're<00:01:31.770> gonna<00:01:31.890> do<00:01:32.160> is<00:01:32.310> drill<00:01:32.730> agree

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
them what we're gonna do is drill agree

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.920 
them what we're gonna do is drill agree
those<00:01:33.240> together<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:34.710> order<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.040> achieve

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.360 

and<00:01:38.930> what<00:01:39.080> we're<00:01:39.200> using<00:01:39.350> for<00:01:39.500> these<00:01:39.740> guys<00:01:40.010> it's

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
and what we're using for these guys it's

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.540 
and what we're using for these guys it's
just<00:01:40.430> kind<00:01:40.790> of<00:01:40.910> a<00:01:41.090> a<00:01:41.560> spacer<00:01:42.560> or<00:01:42.770> starter<00:01:43.400> if

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
just kind of a a spacer or starter if

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.490 
just kind of a a spacer or starter if
you<00:01:43.730> will<00:01:43.970> to<00:01:44.300> start<00:01:44.630> our<00:01:44.930> coils<00:01:45.880> so<00:01:47.500> this

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
you will to start our coils so this

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.590 
you will to start our coils so this
piece<00:01:48.860> right<00:01:49.130> here<00:01:49.190> comes<00:01:49.820> off<00:01:50.000> of<00:01:50.180> my<00:01:50.300> drum

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
piece right here comes off of my drum

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.960 
piece right here comes off of my drum
kit<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:51.110> what<00:01:51.890> I've<00:01:52.010> done<00:01:52.160> is<00:01:52.220> I've<00:01:52.520> drilled<00:01:52.880> a

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
kit and what I've done is I've drilled a

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.840 
kit and what I've done is I've drilled a
little<00:01:53.090> hole<00:01:53.240> in<00:01:53.960> there<00:01:54.560> to<00:01:54.710> receive<00:01:55.130> the

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
little hole in there to receive the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.870 
little hole in there to receive the
copper<00:01:56.330> wire<00:01:56.590> so<00:01:57.590> as<00:01:57.890> we<00:01:58.130> stick<00:01:58.400> that<00:01:58.580> through

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
copper wire so as we stick that through

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.100 
copper wire so as we stick that through
though<00:01:59.060> we'll<00:01:59.300> just<00:01:59.450> stick<00:01:59.660> that<00:01:59.690> through

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
though we'll just stick that through

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.080 
though we'll just stick that through
there

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
there

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.770 
there
pull<00:02:02.090> it<00:02:02.240> a<00:02:02.330> little<00:02:02.360> bit<00:02:02.810> taut<00:02:04.420> and<00:02:05.420> then<00:02:05.600> give

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
pull it a little bit taut and then give

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.690 
pull it a little bit taut and then give
it<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:05.900> little<00:02:06.050> rap<00:02:07.690> just<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.810> hold<00:02:09.020> it<00:02:09.170> in<00:02:09.289> place

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
it a little rap just to hold it in place

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.390 
it a little rap just to hold it in place
now<00:02:10.700> we're<00:02:10.820> going<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:10.970> slide<00:02:11.300> this<00:02:12.230> piece<00:02:12.620> onto

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
now we're going to slide this piece onto

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.550 
now we're going to slide this piece onto
this<00:02:13.760> bolt<00:02:14.180> that<00:02:14.420> we<00:02:14.510> have<00:02:14.660> set<00:02:14.959> up<00:02:15.110> on<00:02:15.320> this

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
this bolt that we have set up on this

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.140 
this bolt that we have set up on this
hinge<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:17.540> then<00:02:17.660> we're<00:02:17.810> gonna<00:02:17.930> take<00:02:18.200> our

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
hinge and then we're gonna take our

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.640 
hinge and then we're gonna take our
composite<00:02:20.150> three-piece<00:02:20.989> washer<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.590> we

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
composite three-piece washer that we

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.580 
composite three-piece washer that we
glued<00:02:21.950> together<00:02:22.130> to<00:02:22.670> stick<00:02:22.940> that<00:02:23.120> on<00:02:23.180> there

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
glued together to stick that on there

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.110 
glued together to stick that on there
now<00:02:24.590> we've<00:02:24.770> got<00:02:24.980> together<00:02:25.220> in<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.670> bud<00:02:25.850> drum

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
now we've got together in the bud drum

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.760 
now we've got together in the bud drum
kit<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:27.170> slide<00:02:27.470> that<00:02:27.709> on<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:29.620> now<00:02:30.620> we've

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
kit and you slide that on that now we've

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.010 
kit and you slide that on that now we've
got<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:30.950> net<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:32.090> we're<00:02:32.239> simply<00:02:32.600> just<00:02:32.630> gonna

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
got a net and we're simply just gonna

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.640 
got a net and we're simply just gonna
tighten<00:02:33.560> these<00:02:33.650> two<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.250> hold<00:02:34.459> them<00:02:34.610> together

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
tighten these two to hold them together

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.120 
tighten these two to hold them together
this<00:02:36.650> is

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
this is

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.910 
this is
I'm<00:02:38.220> going<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.490> create

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
I'm going to create

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.920 
I'm going to create
a<00:02:39.950> thin<00:02:40.819> coil<00:02:42.310> with<00:02:43.310> over<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:43.700> hundred<00:02:44.000> turns

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
a thin coil with over a hundred turns

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.860 
a thin coil with over a hundred turns
the<00:02:45.920> only<00:02:46.130> thing<00:02:46.370> is<00:02:46.640> I'm<00:02:46.819> not<00:02:47.060> counting<00:02:47.720> my

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
the only thing is I'm not counting my

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.600 
the only thing is I'm not counting my
turns<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.590> reason<00:02:48.890> I'm<00:02:49.010> not<00:02:49.040> counting<00:02:49.580> my

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
turns the reason I'm not counting my

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.030 
turns the reason I'm not counting my
turns<00:02:50.000> is<00:02:50.180> because<00:02:50.480> I'm<00:02:50.630> wage<00:02:50.900> coil<00:02:51.680> as<00:02:51.860> I'm

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
turns is because I'm wage coil as I'm

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.490 
turns is because I'm wage coil as I'm
against<00:02:52.660> so<00:02:53.860> this<00:02:54.860> might<00:02:55.100> take<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.400> minute<00:02:55.700> so

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
against so this might take a minute so

00:02:56.500 --> 00:04:09.100 
against so this might take a minute so
cute

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.840 

you<00:04:09.680> know<00:04:09.740> all<00:04:09.830> you're<00:04:09.980> gonna<00:04:10.070> do<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:10.370> get<00:04:10.730> the

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
you know all you're gonna do is get the

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.470 
you know all you're gonna do is get the
coil<00:04:11.150> right<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:12.110> the<00:04:12.230> top<00:04:12.670> until<00:04:13.670> it<00:04:14.030> starts<00:04:14.390> to

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
coil right to the top until it starts to

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.500 
coil right to the top until it starts to
unwind<00:04:14.750> off<00:04:15.560> of<00:04:15.830> there<00:04:16.010> which<00:04:16.820> is<00:04:17.000> right<00:04:17.269> about

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
unwind off of there which is right about

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.770 
unwind off of there which is right about
now<00:04:21.550> then<00:04:22.550> that's<00:04:22.730> the<00:04:23.000> end<00:04:23.030> of<00:04:23.240> our<00:04:23.390> coil

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
now then that's the end of our coil

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.750 
now then that's the end of our coil
since<00:04:24.590> I<00:04:24.680> have<00:04:24.890> it<00:04:25.070> coming<00:04:25.280> all<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:25.640> way<00:04:25.670> to

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
since I have it coming all the way to

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.760 
since I have it coming all the way to
the<00:04:25.940> top<00:04:26.150> of<00:04:26.360> this<00:04:26.480> each<00:04:26.810> coil<00:04:27.170> I<00:04:27.440> bring<00:04:27.650> all

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
the top of this each coil I bring all

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.170 
the top of this each coil I bring all
the<00:04:27.920> way<00:04:27.980> to<00:04:28.040> the<00:04:28.160> top<00:04:28.400> of<00:04:28.430> this<00:04:28.700> until<00:04:29.030> it

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
the way to the top of this until it

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.080 
the way to the top of this until it
starts<00:04:29.480> to<00:04:29.510> wind<00:04:30.320> off<00:04:30.560> either<00:04:30.770> way<00:04:31.130> the<00:04:31.730> next

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
starts to wind off either way the next

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.230 
starts to wind off either way the next
step<00:04:32.300> is<00:04:32.540> we<00:04:32.930> just<00:04:33.080> weigh<00:04:33.410> each<00:04:33.800> one<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:34.430> at

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
step is we just weigh each one and at

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.390 
step is we just weigh each one and at
the<00:04:35.360> end<00:04:35.540> we<00:04:35.870> end<00:04:36.020> up<00:04:36.200> with<00:04:36.410> all<00:04:36.620> of<00:04:36.680> our<00:04:36.890> coils

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
the end we end up with all of our coils

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.790 
the end we end up with all of our coils
the<00:04:37.580> exact<00:04:37.970> same<00:04:38.240> weight<00:04:38.810> which<00:04:39.260> should<00:04:39.590> mean

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
the exact same weight which should mean

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.159 
the exact same weight which should mean
the<00:04:40.220> exact<00:04:40.580> same<00:04:40.820> length<00:04:41.180> so<00:04:41.780> now<00:04:41.960> we're<00:04:42.080> gonna

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
the exact same length so now we're gonna

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.170 
the exact same length so now we're gonna
take<00:04:42.350> some<00:04:42.410> trusty<00:04:43.010> gorilla<00:04:43.370> clips<00:04:43.880> so

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
take some trusty gorilla clips so

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.690 
take some trusty gorilla clips so
strongest<00:04:44.720> glue<00:04:44.810> that<00:04:45.080> I<00:04:45.230> know<00:04:45.430> I'm<00:04:46.430> just

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
strongest glue that I know I'm just

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.409 
strongest glue that I know I'm just
gonna<00:04:46.850> hold<00:04:47.180> that<00:04:47.419> taut<00:04:48.580> and<00:04:49.580> just<00:04:49.910> put<00:04:50.120> a<00:04:50.150> drop

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
gonna hold that taut and just put a drop

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.800 
gonna hold that taut and just put a drop
or<00:04:50.840> two<00:04:51.140> right<00:04:52.010> on<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:52.400> end<00:04:52.669> of<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:53.510> coil

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
or two right on the end of the coil

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.950 
or two right on the end of the coil
where<00:04:54.680> we<00:04:54.830> stopped<00:04:55.720> so<00:04:56.720> when<00:04:56.870> you're

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
where we stopped so when you're

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.530 
where we stopped so when you're
satisfied<00:04:57.169> that<00:04:57.740> your<00:04:57.980> coil<00:04:58.310> is<00:04:58.610> dried<00:04:59.300> from

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
satisfied that your coil is dried from

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.690 
around a screw keep it in place and then
lift<00:05:09.890> this<00:05:10.100> up

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.210 

unbolt<00:05:13.330> it<00:05:13.630> as<00:05:13.870> you<00:05:14.020> can<00:05:14.200> see<00:05:14.500> doesn't

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
unbolt it as you can see doesn't

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.510 
unbolt it as you can see doesn't
completely<00:05:15.610> dry<00:05:16.030> yet<00:05:16.330> that's<00:05:16.690> okay

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
completely dry yet that's okay

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.720 
completely dry yet that's okay
they<00:05:18.520> make<00:05:18.730> these<00:05:18.910> just<00:05:19.180> a<00:05:19.300> little<00:05:19.330> bit<00:05:19.900> long

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
they make these just a little bit long

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.410 
they make these just a little bit long
because<00:05:21.730> I'm<00:05:22.150> gonna<00:05:22.680> kill<00:05:23.680> some<00:05:24.010> of<00:05:24.130> it<00:05:24.250> off

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
because I'm gonna kill some of it off

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.230 
because I'm gonna kill some of it off
how<00:05:26.110> I<00:05:26.140> get<00:05:26.440> in<00:05:26.590> exactly<00:05:27.010> the<00:05:27.220> same<00:05:27.250> way<00:05:27.730> so<00:05:28.090> we

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
how I get in exactly the same way so we

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.260 
how I get in exactly the same way so we
take<00:05:28.480> this<00:05:29.130> piece<00:05:30.130> from<00:05:30.280> our<00:05:30.490> jobs<00:05:30.700> slide<00:05:31.120> it

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
take this piece from our jobs slide it

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.220 
take this piece from our jobs slide it
over<00:05:31.390> there

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
over there

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.860 
over there
we're<00:05:32.530> gonna<00:05:32.620> take<00:05:32.950> a<00:05:33.900> coil<00:05:34.900> slide

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
we're gonna take a coil slide

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.560 
we're gonna take a coil slide
said<00:05:37.870> it<00:05:38.050> right<00:05:38.260> here<00:05:39.210> so<00:05:40.210> now<00:05:40.360> we're<00:05:40.480> gonna

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
said it right here so now we're gonna

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.050 
said it right here so now we're gonna
take<00:05:40.780> our<00:05:40.960> gorilla<00:05:41.320> glue<00:05:41.620> and<00:05:42.310> do<00:05:42.610> what<00:05:42.760> I<00:05:42.850> call

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
take our gorilla glue and do what I call

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.850 
take our gorilla glue and do what I call
making<00:05:43.300> a<00:05:43.480> poker<00:05:43.840> chip<00:05:43.870> and<00:05:44.470> I'm<00:05:44.590> just<00:05:44.710> gonna

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
making a poker chip and I'm just gonna

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.120 
making a poker chip and I'm just gonna
come<00:05:45.160> across<00:05:45.310> it

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
come across it

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:57.790 
come across it
one<00:05:48.080> two<00:05:49.550> three<00:05:51.080> four

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.379 

seven<00:05:58.550> times

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
seven times

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.420 
seven times
and<00:06:00.750> I<00:06:00.870> call<00:06:01.169> poker<00:06:01.620> chip<00:06:01.860> because<00:06:02.129> it<00:06:02.250> looks

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
and I call poker chip because it looks

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.980 
and I call poker chip because it looks
like<00:06:02.550> a<00:06:02.580> poker<00:06:02.879> chip<00:06:03.000> that's<00:06:03.389> been<00:06:03.569> doing<00:06:03.719> it

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
like a poker chip that's been doing it

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:10.369 
like a poker chip that's been doing it
so<00:06:05.539> we<00:06:06.539> let<00:06:06.750> that<00:06:06.930> dry<00:06:07.289> and<00:06:07.710> then<00:06:09.169> so<00:06:10.169> now<00:06:10.319> we

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:10.379 
so we let that dry and then so now we

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:13.909 
so we let that dry and then so now we
have<00:06:10.560> a<00:06:10.590> few<00:06:10.830> coils<00:06:11.159> that<00:06:11.639> are<00:06:11.699> all<00:06:12.590> same<00:06:13.590> way

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 
have a few coils that are all same way

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.969 
have a few coils that are all same way
so<00:06:14.400> they<00:06:14.550> should<00:06:14.789> all<00:06:14.939> be<00:06:14.969> the<00:06:15.240> same<00:06:15.979> length

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
so they should all be the same length

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:20.480 
so they should all be the same length
and<00:06:17.520> we're<00:06:17.639> gonna<00:06:17.729> do<00:06:17.969> eight<00:06:18.240> coils<00:06:19.159> all<00:06:20.159> with

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
and we're gonna do eight coils all with

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.939 
and we're gonna do eight coils all with
12<00:06:20.849> magnets<00:06:21.569> and<00:06:24.080> twelve<00:06:25.080> magnets<00:06:25.530> on<00:06:25.710> each

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:25.949 
12 magnets and twelve magnets on each

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:28.969 
12 magnets and twelve magnets on each
side<00:06:26.310> of<00:06:26.340> the<00:06:26.610> stator<00:06:27.469> we're<00:06:28.469> going<00:06:28.590> to<00:06:28.680> double

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 
side of the stator we're going to double

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:31.580 
side of the stator we're going to double
up<00:06:29.099> our<00:06:29.250> magnets<00:06:29.819> so<00:06:30.419> that'll<00:06:30.689> be<00:06:30.810> 48<00:06:31.319> total

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
up our magnets so that'll be 48 total

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.580 
up our magnets so that'll be 48 total
madness<00:06:32.270> and<00:06:33.270> we'll<00:06:33.870> get<00:06:34.050> to<00:06:34.199> that<00:06:34.229> on<00:06:34.439> the

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
madness and we'll get to that on the

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.499 
madness and we'll get to that on the
next<00:06:34.710> episode<00:06:35.460> let<00:06:35.669> me<00:06:35.699> show<00:06:35.819> you<00:06:36.090> how<00:06:36.360> we're

00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:36.509 
next episode let me show you how we're

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:39.830 
next episode let me show you how we're
gonna<00:06:36.629> use<00:06:36.930> 10-inch<00:06:37.439> saw<00:06:37.740> blades<00:06:38.129> to<00:06:39.120> attach

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 
gonna use 10-inch saw blades to attach

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.499 
gonna use 10-inch saw blades to attach
our<00:06:40.080> magnets<00:06:40.560> so<00:06:41.460> until<00:06:41.759> next<00:06:41.969> time<00:06:42.180> this<00:06:42.270> is

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:42.509 
our magnets so until next time this is

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:44.749 
our magnets so until next time this is
what's<00:06:42.779> the<00:06:42.990> statics<00:06:43.379> and<00:06:43.560> later<00:06:44.490> from<00:06:44.699> the

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 
what's the statics and later from the

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:47.360 
what's the statics and later from the
west<00:06:45.060> coast
