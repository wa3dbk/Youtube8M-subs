bend<00:01:13.890> over<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.400> stick<00:01:14.670> down<00:01:14.910> because<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.570> I

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
bend over and stick down because I I

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.520 
bend over and stick down because I I
coated<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.430> with<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.970> polyurethane<00:01:18.300> so<00:01:19.290> would

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
coated it with a polyurethane so would

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.560 
coated it with a polyurethane so would
be<00:01:19.680> waterproof<00:01:20.160> right<00:01:20.610> did<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.120> before<00:01:21.240> or

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
be waterproof right did that before or

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.780 
be waterproof right did that before or
after<00:01:21.600> them<00:01:22.050> before<00:01:22.770> it's<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> problem

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
after them before it's the problem

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.200 
after them before it's the problem
should've<00:01:24.450> done<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.690> after<00:01:25.400> dad<00:01:26.400> yeah<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
should've done it after dad yeah so the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.390 
should've done it after dad yeah so the
glue<00:01:28.050> and<00:01:28.230> stuff<00:01:28.380> isn't<00:01:28.590> sticking<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.190> it<00:01:29.280> very

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
glue and stuff isn't sticking to it very

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.000 
glue and stuff isn't sticking to it very
well<00:01:29.640> but<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.300> fixable<00:01:30.690> nicely<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.860> it

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
well but that it's fixable nicely and it

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.380 
well but that it's fixable nicely and it
probably<00:01:32.310> needs<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.520> little<00:01:32.700> bit<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.910> I<00:01:33.210> think

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
probably needs a little bit of I think

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.300 
probably needs a little bit of I think
the<00:01:33.600> actual<00:01:33.900> model<00:01:34.290> has<00:01:34.440> some<00:01:34.680> black<00:01:34.860> paint<00:01:35.160> on

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.020 

I<00:03:24.200> could<00:03:25.200> use<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.410> little<00:03:25.590> less<00:03:26.430> rate<00:03:26.730> in<00:03:26.880> the

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
I could use a little less rate in the

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:34.280 
I could use a little less rate in the
elements<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:28.110> little<00:03:28.560> twitchy<00:03:28.770> issue<00:03:33.290> like

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
elements a little twitchy issue like

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:46.699 
elements a little twitchy issue like
that<00:03:34.590> yeah<00:03:35.160> doesn't<00:03:35.670> that<00:03:35.760> real<00:03:35.940> nice

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.020 

this<00:03:47.709> means<00:03:47.950> a<00:03:48.069> little<00:03:48.219> lower<00:03:48.549> rate<00:03:48.790> in<00:03:48.939> the

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
this means a little lower rate in the

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.790 
this means a little lower rate in the
other<00:03:49.150> husband

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.770 

you<00:03:54.340> can<00:03:54.460> set<00:03:54.640> up<00:03:54.670> like<00:03:54.880> a<00:03:54.910> 3d<00:03:55.240> ship<00:03:55.480> I<00:03:55.600> get<00:03:55.750> a

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
you can set up like a 3d ship I get a

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.220 
you can set up like a 3d ship I get a
low<00:03:56.050> and<00:03:56.230> high<00:03:56.320> rates<00:03:57.750> just<00:03:58.750> fly<00:03:58.990> it<00:03:59.050> all<00:03:59.200> the

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
low and high rates just fly it all the

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:06.140 
low and high rates just fly it all the
rates<00:03:59.530> mostly<00:03:59.950> on<00:04:00.040> nuts<00:04:01.030> entirety

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:17.640 

exponential

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:31.779 

as<00:04:18.650> it's<00:04:19.280> a<00:04:19.430> goofy<00:04:19.849> the<00:04:20.060> a<00:04:24.460> little<00:04:25.460> blade<00:04:30.789> so

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
as it's a goofy the a little blade so

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:32.950 
as it's a goofy the a little blade so
you<00:04:31.879> did<00:04:32.000> polyurethane<00:04:32.629> this<00:04:32.810> Li

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
you did polyurethane this Li

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.899 
you did polyurethane this Li
theoretically<00:04:33.620> flattened<00:04:34.069> and<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.490> rain<00:04:34.699> and

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:34.909 
theoretically flattened and the rain and

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:37.179 
theoretically flattened and the rain and
he's<00:04:35.900> a<00:04:35.930> little<00:04:36.289> as<00:04:36.349> more<00:04:36.590> the<00:04:36.740> bottom<00:04:37.069> of<00:04:37.129> the

00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:37.189 
he's a little as more the bottom of the

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:43.899 
he's a little as more the bottom of the
ailerons<00:04:38.289> I<00:04:39.289> didn't<00:04:40.159> get<00:04:40.990> you<00:04:41.990> didn't<00:04:42.909> the

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:43.909 
ailerons I didn't get you didn't the

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:45.790 
ailerons I didn't get you didn't the
idea<00:04:44.240> would<00:04:44.360> be<00:04:44.419> to<00:04:44.509> do<00:04:44.930> it<00:04:44.960> all<00:04:45.199> after<00:04:45.560> you<00:04:45.650> had

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
idea would be to do it all after you had

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.529 
idea would be to do it all after you had
it<00:04:45.889> built<00:04:46.069> I<00:04:46.430> think<00:04:46.819> that's<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.180> thing<00:04:47.270> to<00:04:47.419> do

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
it built I think that's the thing to do

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:49.510 
it built I think that's the thing to do
yeah<00:04:47.719> in<00:04:48.379> fact<00:04:48.620> some<00:04:48.979> place<00:04:49.159> in<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.400> video

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
yeah in fact some place in the video

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.689 
yeah in fact some place in the video
eventually<00:04:49.969> said<00:04:50.360> that<00:04:50.569> oops

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
eventually said that oops

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.920 
eventually said that oops
she<00:04:52.699> fainted<00:04:53.000> at<00:04:53.150> first<00:04:53.330> then<00:04:53.569> it<00:04:53.690> said<00:04:53.840> before

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
she fainted at first then it said before

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.469 
she fainted at first then it said before
I<00:04:54.229> I<00:04:54.560> think<00:04:55.069> I<00:04:55.129> saw<00:04:55.460> something<00:04:55.699> about<00:04:55.879> sort<00:04:56.449> of

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.119 
I I think I saw something about sort of
painting<00:04:56.750> of<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.050> floor<00:04:57.289> and<00:04:57.620> though<00:04:57.800> like
