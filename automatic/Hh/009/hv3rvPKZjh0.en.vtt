too<00:00:38.250> with<00:00:39.250> this<00:00:39.399> photo<00:00:39.699> we<00:00:39.879> spun<00:00:40.269> the<00:00:40.329> globe

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
and showed Cecilia a shutter speed check

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:44.880 
and showed Cecilia a shutter speed check
so<00:00:43.480> that<00:00:43.510> you<00:00:43.840> could<00:00:43.989> actually<00:00:44.140> capture<00:00:44.559> the

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
so that you could actually capture the

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.470 
so that you could actually capture the
motion<00:00:45.250> in<00:00:45.339> the<00:00:45.460> spinning<00:00:45.790> globe<00:00:45.909> while<00:00:46.300> the

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
motion in the spinning globe while the

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.200 
motion in the spinning globe while the

used a different angle in this one to

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.509
