00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
used to hold the juubi earlier on so

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.800 
used to hold the juubi earlier on so
like<00:01:02.480> killer<00:01:03.480> bees<00:01:03.949> atl<00:01:04.949> said<00:01:05.280> all<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.479> power

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
like killer bees atl said all the power

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.750 
like killer bees atl said all the power
of<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.170> doobies<00:01:07.560> being<00:01:07.770> concentrated<00:01:08.280> now

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
of the doobies being concentrated now

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.460 
of the doobies being concentrated now
which<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:08.970> why<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.750> powerful<00:01:10.049> now<00:01:10.439> than

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
which is why it's so powerful now than

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.890 
which is why it's so powerful now than
it<00:01:10.830> was<00:01:10.860> before<00:01:11.510> before<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.570> was<00:01:12.600> firing

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
it was before before it was firing

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.859 
it was before before it was firing
randomly<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.680> now<00:01:13.799> it's<00:01:14.040> even<00:01:14.220> more<00:01:14.460> powerful

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
randomly so now it's even more powerful

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.480 
randomly so now it's even more powerful
this<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> juubi<00:01:16.470> at<00:01:16.650> his<00:01:16.890> best<00:01:17.100> but

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
this is the juubi at his best but

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.280
