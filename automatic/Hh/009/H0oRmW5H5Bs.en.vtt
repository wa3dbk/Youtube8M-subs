fireball<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.230> use<00:00:19.380> freezing<00:00:19.770> pulse<00:00:19.949> and

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
fireball and a use freezing pulse and

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.800 
fireball and a use freezing pulse and
the<00:00:20.279> reason<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.609> use<00:00:20.760> these<00:00:20.970> two<00:00:21.180> abilities<00:00:21.390> is

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
the reason I use these two abilities is

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.080 
the reason I use these two abilities is
because<00:00:22.140> they're<00:00:22.410> both<00:00:22.560> very<00:00:22.830> very<00:00:23.220> good<00:00:23.550> you

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
because they're both very very good you

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.880 
because they're both very very good you
get<00:00:24.210> them<00:00:24.330> early<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.630> really<00:00:24.990> really<00:00:25.710> quickly

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
get them early on really really quickly

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.099 
get them early on really really quickly
fireball<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.820> first<00:00:27.060> skill<00:00:27.599> gem<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.930> get

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
fireball is the first skill gem you get

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.529 
fireball is the first skill gem you get
and<00:00:28.320> free<00:00:28.740> sync<00:00:28.920> pulse<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.789> hillock<00:00:30.179> reward

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
and free sync pulse is a hillock reward

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.260 
and free sync pulse is a hillock reward
so<00:00:31.320> they're<00:00:32.160> both<00:00:32.309> very<00:00:32.489> easy<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.940> get<00:00:33.030> and

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
so they're both very easy to get and

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.540 
so they're both very easy to get and
they're<00:00:33.360> both<00:00:33.540> very<00:00:33.780> very<00:00:34.110> reliable<00:00:34.680> freezing

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
they're both very very reliable freezing

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.900 
they're both very very reliable freezing
pulse<00:00:36.590> scales<00:00:37.590> very<00:00:37.680> well<00:00:37.980> at<00:00:38.070> level<00:00:38.370> as<00:00:38.520> those

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
pulse scales very well at level as those

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.209 
pulse scales very well at level as those
fireball<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.510> if<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.530> get<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.950> appropriate

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
fireball and if you get the appropriate

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.150 
fireball and if you get the appropriate
plus<00:00:42.180> increase<00:00:42.899> spell<00:00:43.110> damage<00:00:43.260> ones<00:00:43.620> which<00:00:44.010> I

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
plus increase spell damage ones which I

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.799 
plus increase spell damage ones which I
don't<00:00:44.399> have<00:00:44.610> because<00:00:45.120> they<00:00:45.239> didn't<00:00:45.450> get<00:00:45.539> lucky

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
don't have because they didn't get lucky

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.510 
don't have because they didn't get lucky
but<00:00:46.079> oh<00:00:46.230> well<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:47.039> get<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.280> appropriate

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
but oh well you get the appropriate

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.940 
but oh well you get the appropriate
increased<00:00:48.059> spell<00:00:48.239> damage<00:00:48.390> ones<00:00:48.719> they<00:00:49.620> can<00:00:49.829> be

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
increased spell damage ones they can be

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.400 
increased spell damage ones they can be
a<00:00:49.980> lot<00:00:50.190> better<00:00:50.700> than<00:00:51.300> they<00:00:51.809> are<00:00:51.840> right<00:00:51.930> now<00:00:52.079> and

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
a lot better than they are right now and

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.360 
a lot better than they are right now and
they're<00:00:53.250> pretty<00:00:53.699> okay<00:00:54.180> right<00:00:54.360> now<00:00:54.480> but<00:00:55.370> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
they're pretty okay right now but the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.119 
they're pretty okay right now but the
problem<00:00:56.699> with<00:00:56.789> freezing<00:00:57.420> pulse<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.320> it's

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
problem with freezing pulse is that it's

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.430 
problem with freezing pulse is that it's
very<00:00:59.430> very<00:00:59.760> melee<00:01:00.690> oriented<00:01:01.260> you're

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
very very melee oriented you're

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.260 
very very melee oriented you're
basically<00:01:01.890> playing<00:01:02.190> ass<00:01:02.399> brown<00:01:02.699> slammer<00:01:03.000> if

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
basically playing ass brown slammer if

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.030 
basically playing ass brown slammer if
you're<00:01:03.449> using<00:01:03.570> freezing<00:01:04.019> pulse<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.769> problem

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
you're using freezing pulse and problem

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.859 
you're using freezing pulse and problem
with<00:01:05.129> fireball<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.299> has<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> travel

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
with fireball is that it has a travel

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.710 
with fireball is that it has a travel
time<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.770> doesn't<00:01:08.070> hit<00:01:08.430> everything<00:01:08.909> it

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
time and it doesn't hit everything it

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.060 
time and it doesn't hit everything it
only<00:01:09.869> hit<00:01:10.049> some<00:01:10.260> things<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.710> its<00:01:10.860> very

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
only hit some things in its very

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.020 
only hit some things in its very
unreliable<00:01:11.810> so<00:01:12.810> your<00:01:13.799> skills<00:01:14.130> your<00:01:14.760> skill<00:01:15.000> set

is a medicine chest reward as well to
help<00:01:22.200> with<00:01:22.500> AOE<00:01:22.770> for<00:01:23.340> when<00:01:23.460> fireball<00:01:23.970> won't<00:01:24.540> do

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
help with AOE for when fireball won't do

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.990 
help with AOE for when fireball won't do
it<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.170> when<00:01:25.380> freezing<00:01:26.310> pulse<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.909> be

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
it and when freezing pulse is to be

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.090 
it and when freezing pulse is to be
dangerous<00:01:27.479> like<00:01:27.689> I'm<00:01:27.840> Brutus<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.409> think<00:01:29.009> on

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
dangerous like I'm Brutus I think on

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.380 
dangerous like I'm Brutus I think on
this<00:01:29.189> character<00:01:29.460> ended<00:01:29.820> up<00:01:29.909> just<00:01:30.119> face

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
this character ended up just face

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.240 
this character ended up just face
tanking<00:01:30.840> Brutus<00:01:31.170> because<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.710> didn't<00:01:32.009> have<00:01:32.130> it

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
tanking Brutus because I didn't have it

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.920 
tanking Brutus because I didn't have it
but<00:01:33.320> in<00:01:34.320> any<00:01:34.470> case<00:01:34.560> that's<00:01:34.920> how<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.130> handle<00:01:35.520> that

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
but in any case that's how I handle that

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.660 
but in any case that's how I handle that
now<00:01:36.930> if<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.770> look<00:01:37.890> at<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.070> witches<00:01:38.430> skill

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
now if you look at the witches skill

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.370 
now if you look at the witches skill
tree<00:01:38.939> you'll<00:01:39.720> notice<00:01:39.930> something<00:01:40.350> very

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
tree you'll notice something very

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.830 
tree you'll notice something very
interesting<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.490> she<00:01:42.329> doesn't<00:01:42.540> really

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
interesting it's that she doesn't really

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.200 
interesting it's that she doesn't really
have<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.140> whole<00:01:43.470> lot<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.680> damage<00:01:43.979> nodes<00:01:44.430> that

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
have a whole lot of damage nodes that

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
and I just book it to whatever health

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.370 
and I just book it to whatever health
nodes<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.459> would<00:02:11.610> normally

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
nodes I would normally

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.290

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
would ever build on planning so I flat

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.940

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
notes in that build grab those and then

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.590 
notes in that build grab those and then
I'm<00:02:19.430> ready<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.820> serve<00:02:20.000> with<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.270> rest<00:02:20.420> of<00:02:20.510> my

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
respect points and maybe some regrets

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.410 
respect points and maybe some regrets
but<00:02:30.710> at<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:30.950> same<00:02:31.130> time<00:02:31.400> it<00:02:31.670> makes<00:02:31.700> you<00:02:32.090> really

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
but at the same time it makes you really

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.230 
but at the same time it makes you really
really<00:02:32.510> weak<00:02:32.960> early<00:02:33.590> game<00:02:33.770> which<00:02:34.760> is<00:02:35.000> the

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
really weak early game which is the

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.120 
really weak early game which is the
major<00:02:35.420> failing<00:02:35.900> of<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.110> wick<00:02:36.290> shy<00:02:36.500> which<00:02:36.770> I

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
major failing of the wick shy which I

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.790 
major failing of the wick shy which I
wish<00:02:37.400> they<00:02:37.580> would<00:02:37.840> fix<00:02:38.840> that<00:02:39.170> because<00:02:39.560> I<00:02:39.740> think

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
wish they would fix that because I think

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.830 
wish they would fix that because I think
a<00:02:40.070> health<00:02:40.280> note<00:02:40.460> right<00:02:40.670> here<00:02:40.700> right<00:02:41.690> off

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
a health note right here right off

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.280 
a health note right here right off
something<00:02:42.320> like<00:02:42.470> this<00:02:42.620> intelligence<00:02:43.190> node<00:02:43.430> or

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
something like this intelligence node or

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.780 
something like this intelligence node or
replace<00:02:45.290> this<00:02:45.500> Lord<00:02:45.800> of<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:45.950> Dead<00:02:46.070> wheel<00:02:46.310> with

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
replace this Lord of the Dead wheel with

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.430 
replace this Lord of the Dead wheel with
health<00:02:47.270> and<00:02:47.570> then<00:02:47.720> put<00:02:47.900> this<00:02:48.020> load<00:02:48.230> of<00:02:48.350> the

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
health and then put this load of the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.140 
health and then put this load of the
dead<00:02:48.590> somewhere<00:02:48.920> else<00:02:49.100> I<00:02:49.340> think<00:02:49.910> that<00:02:50.030> would

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
dead somewhere else I think that would

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.820 
dead somewhere else I think that would
really<00:02:50.180> really<00:02:50.840> help<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.350> witch<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:51.650> make

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
really really help the witch and make

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.160 
really really help the witch and make
her<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:51.980> lot<00:02:52.250> more<00:02:52.400> viable<00:02:52.670> because<00:02:53.360> as<00:02:53.690> it<00:02:54.050> is

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
her a lot more viable because as it is

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.080 
her a lot more viable because as it is
now<00:02:54.380> she's<00:02:54.710> really<00:02:55.310> hard<00:02:55.490> to<00:02:55.610> play<00:02:55.790> hardcore

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
now she's really hard to play hardcore

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.780 
now she's really hard to play hardcore
unless<00:02:57.050> you<00:02:57.230> play<00:02:57.590> really<00:02:57.830> really<00:02:58.130> solidly<00:02:58.490> I

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
unless you play really really solidly I

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.400 
unless you play really really solidly I
don't<00:02:59.330> really<00:02:59.450> have<00:02:59.540> a<00:02:59.660> whole<00:02:59.870> lot<00:02:59.900> of<00:03:00.050> advice

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
don't really have a whole lot of advice

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.580 
don't really have a whole lot of advice
other<00:03:00.650> than<00:03:00.770> don't<00:03:01.220> die<00:03:02.110> you'll<00:03:03.110> have<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.320> play

other than don't die you'll have to play

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.780 
other than don't die you'll have to play

advice there's no stock build that you

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.949 
advice there's no stock build that you
can<00:03:46.430> run<00:03:46.640> that's<00:03:46.850> more<00:03:47.090> defensive<00:03:47.570> or<00:03:47.750> better

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959

at<00:03:48.140> clearing<00:03:48.440> things<00:03:48.640> than<00:03:49.640> not<00:03:49.880> the<00:03:50.240> which<00:03:50.390> is

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
at clearing things than not the which is

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.410 
at clearing things than not the which is
really<00:03:51.440> really<00:03:51.680> weak<00:03:51.950> so<00:03:52.910> that's<00:03:53.270> how<00:03:53.390> I

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
really really weak so that's how I

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.790 
really really weak so that's how I
handle<00:03:53.840> it<00:03:54.050> that's<00:03:54.230> how<00:03:54.380> I<00:03:54.410> try<00:03:54.740> and
