to be picked up right now as we see this

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.080 
to be picked up right now as we see this
the<00:00:42.320> low<00:00:42.680> speed<00:00:42.980> handpiece<00:00:43.310> is<00:00:43.460> being<00:00:43.850> picked

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
the low speed handpiece is being picked

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.540 
the low speed handpiece is being picked
up<00:00:44.180> right<00:00:44.420> now<00:00:44.600> it's<00:00:44.810> being<00:00:44.990> lubricated<00:00:45.680> runs

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
up right now it's being lubricated runs

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.550 
up right now it's being lubricated runs
15<00:00:47.000> seconds<00:00:47.450> of<00:00:47.540> the<00:00:47.660> lubrication<00:00:48.140> then<00:00:48.440> we

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.560 
15 seconds of the lubrication then we

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.140 
15 seconds of the lubrication then we
switch<00:00:48.800> over<00:00:49.070> to<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.250> high<00:00:49.400> speed<00:00:49.700> handpiece

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
switch over to the high speed handpiece

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.390 
switch over to the high speed handpiece
once<00:00:50.750> the<00:00:50.930> high<00:00:51.050> speed<00:00:51.320> kicks<00:00:51.590> on<00:00:51.770> you

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
once the high speed kicks on you

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.040 
once the high speed kicks on you
actually<00:00:52.550> be<00:00:52.940> able<00:00:53.030> to<00:00:53.210> hear<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:53.600> high<00:00:53.750> speed

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
actually be able to hear the high speed

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.870 
actually be able to hear the high speed
running<00:00:54.410> in<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:54.800> back<00:00:54.950> as<00:00:55.220> we<00:00:55.430> are<00:00:55.460> cleaning

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
running in the back as we are cleaning

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.510 
running in the back as we are cleaning
and<00:00:56.210> purging<00:00:56.629> it

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
and purging it

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.340 
and purging it
the<00:00:57.760> cleaning<00:00:58.390> solution<00:00:58.870> that<00:00:58.900> goes<00:00:59.110> through

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
the cleaning solution that goes through

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.920 
the cleaning solution that goes through
is<00:00:59.530> actually<00:00:59.920> like<00:01:00.100> an<00:01:00.220> expanding<00:01:00.970> foam<00:01:01.240> what

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
is actually like an expanding foam what

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.840 
is actually like an expanding foam what
happens<00:01:02.320> with<00:01:02.470> the<00:01:02.590> expanding<00:01:03.220> foam<00:01:03.460> is<00:01:03.670> that

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
happens with the expanding foam is that

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.750 
happens with the expanding foam is that
the<00:01:04.059> foam<00:01:04.839> expands<00:01:05.290> one<00:01:05.590> to<00:01:05.710> twenty<00:01:06.010> times<00:01:06.190> it

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
the foam expands one to twenty times it

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.490 
the foam expands one to twenty times it
actually<00:01:07.120> expands<00:01:07.480> on<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:07.720> inside<00:01:08.080> cleaning

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
actually expands on the inside cleaning

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.920 
actually expands on the inside cleaning
anything<00:01:08.740> of<00:01:09.010> the<00:01:09.130> debris<00:01:09.490> gives<00:01:10.300> us<00:01:10.450> a<00:01:10.600> double

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
anything of the debris gives us a double

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.600 
anything of the debris gives us a double
beep<00:01:11.080> when<00:01:11.380> we're<00:01:11.590> done<00:01:11.770> and<00:01:12.400> we<00:01:12.580> just

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
beep when we're done and we just

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.520 
beep when we're done and we just
disengage<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.510> hand<00:01:13.690> pieces<00:01:13.900> by<00:01:14.170> pulling

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
disengage the hand pieces by pulling

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.890 
disengage the hand pieces by pulling
straight<00:01:14.560> down<00:01:15.040> and<00:01:15.580> hitting<00:01:16.150> on<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:16.810> the

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
pad so we can change it out so it does

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.350 
pad so we can change it out so it does
not<00:01:29.530> ruin<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.369> bottom<00:01:30.670> of<00:01:30.790> the<00:01:30.850> machine<00:01:31.149> or

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.560 
disengage the cam it is engaged in the
collar<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.610> most<00:01:42.820> important<00:01:43.240> part<00:01:43.479> to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
collar the most important part to

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.270 
collar the most important part to
remember<00:01:43.810> on<00:01:44.080> this<00:01:44.229> is<00:01:44.410> that<00:01:44.560> when<00:01:44.770> we<00:01:44.800> engage

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
remember on this is that when we engage

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.490 
remember on this is that when we engage
the<00:01:45.550> can<00:01:45.759> up<00:01:46.060> and<00:01:46.390> slide<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.960> collar<00:01:47.200> down

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
the can up and slide the collar down

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.160 
the can up and slide the collar down
there<00:01:48.040> is<00:01:48.220> no<00:01:48.460> pressurization<00:01:49.300> in<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.720> system

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
there is no pressurization in the system

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.540 
there is no pressurization in the system
because<00:01:50.560> right<00:01:50.800> now<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.009> only<00:01:51.160> thing<00:01:51.310> that's

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
because right now the only thing that's

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.609 
because right now the only thing that's
under<00:01:51.759> pressure<00:01:52.000> is<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.360> cam<00:01:52.600> when<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.290> unit

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
under pressure is the cam when the unit

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.770 
under pressure is the cam when the unit
actually<00:01:53.770> engages<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.880> plunger<00:01:55.390> goes<00:01:55.420> down

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
actually engages a plunger goes down

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.960 
actually engages a plunger goes down
inside<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:56.440> then<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.710> entire<00:01:57.039> system<00:01:57.610> gets

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
inside and then the entire system gets

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.820 
inside and then the entire system gets
engaged<00:01:58.360> so<00:01:58.869> without<00:01:59.140> having<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.649> system

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
engaged so without having the system

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.710 
engaged so without having the system
engaged<00:02:00.310> all<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.610> time<00:02:00.729> we<00:02:01.300> don't<00:02:01.420> have<00:02:01.600> the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
engaged all the time we don't have the

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.790 
engaged all the time we don't have the
issues<00:02:02.049> with<00:02:02.229> leaks

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
issues with leaks

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.709 
issues with leaks
have<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.160> issues<00:02:03.520> with

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
have the issues with

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.889 
have the issues with
arbitrary<00:02:05.590> leaving<00:02:06.579> of<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:06.909> of<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.329> butane

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
arbitrary leaving of the of the butane

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.960 
arbitrary leaving of the of the butane
of<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.319> of<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.770> propellant<00:02:09.250> on<00:02:09.489> the<00:02:09.610> inside

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
of the of the propellant on the inside

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.030 
of the of the propellant on the inside
so<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.780> units<00:02:11.080> right<00:02:11.230> now<00:02:11.440> they<00:02:11.620> retail<00:02:12.010> for

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
so the units right now they retail for

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.430
