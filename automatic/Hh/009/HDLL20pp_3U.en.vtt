00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:08.700
 people i want you traffic today 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.139
 imagine traffic is an app with what 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.089
 to do tasks in a timely manner 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.309
 let time-controlled tasks 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:16.350
 For example, you could use your elan at any time 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.880
 and turn off display or lower 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.430
 for example , that is often just ask 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.720
 Start made sap traffic have one 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.250
 small survey up here we can 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.810
 For example, the app on and off 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.900
 we have the profiles and we have the 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.310
 Settings so we just go 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.840
 the profiles purely as you see we have 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.340
 even before defined profiles are 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.140
 already fixed you can of course 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.879
 also create your own profiles 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.350
 otherwise we still have the 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.309
 attitudes I have the attitude 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.989
 so far left 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.570
 this way I have only now of this 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.800
 skip introduction still clicked 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.480
 otherwise you will get such a small one 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.219
 infoscreen otherwise you can actually 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.069
 leave the setting as you like 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.480
 it has therefore profile you can to 

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:52.579
 each one has his own profile 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.600
 I have an example 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.589
 weekdays from 6:00 that the phone is 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.809
 to completely turn it on again 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.339
 Party time is Saturday and Sunday can 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.809
 for example, for the saturday and for 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.620
 sunday has a different profile than in 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.749
 awarded the week 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.570
 Otherwise bedtime is with me 

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:08.610
 usually from 0 o'clock that means I switch 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.740
 for example, then my device in the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.909
 flight mode that is a complete 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.640
 is shut down 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.570
 So as I said 00 clock 22 clock then wlan 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.969
 and mute 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.700
 otherwise you see traffic up here 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:24.730
 the last version 14 of the city 2013 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.020
 150 start the next 10 pm then 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.640
 As I said, this is at a glance 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.310
 the next time something 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.960
 otherwise we will hold the 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.030
 bar the profile we pressed the 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.880
 possibility to insert profile of an action 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.680
 add delete rename profile you can 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.720
 of course, is again put in profile 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.920
 otherwise have no problem as an action 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.110
 Here, for example, the overview above 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.940
 the time then the days from monday to 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.320
 sunday as well as us just the day off 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.730
 who wants to share with others otherwise 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.190
 Here you can, for example, in the mini 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.200
 adjust everything survey want it 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.060
 wlan on and off or flight mode 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.890
 be active whatever as I said 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.510
 it's visually she was first 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.190
 confusing but otherwise no 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.600
 problem otherwise we can 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.250
 for example, keep pressed 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.710
 we could delete it 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.380
 Change adjust depending on where 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.119
 the need is the same as the whole 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.310
 looks in practice, I show you 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.500
 now in a test we click on 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.240
 attitude to new profile if 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.130
 Just try the new profile like you 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.560
 See is a check mark on 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.420
 the profile immediately active, we can 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.770
 just turn it off for a moment 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.360
 click on it when you see the two 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.160
 We can hold an action 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.240
 insert what do i want that around 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.070
 1220, for example, on Tuesday or 21 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.410
 that for example the wifi turned on 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.970
 and that the flight mode 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.959
 clearly it certainly does that 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.580
 no sense because the flight mode 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.860
 Of course everything on but simply raises 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.110
 about showing what it looks like her 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.640
 look it is still out and now shuts 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.739
 yourself 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.180
 krupp it is active so as I said how 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.130
 You see, in practice, I work 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.200
 The app just highly recommended it 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.190
 really works once the free 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.230
 customize 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.660
 after we want that you should 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.250
 Questions about the app or suggestions 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.810
 just write in the comments 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.950
 I have contact by e-mail 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.370
 you like to continue I wish you one 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.630
 nice week 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.630
 that was it from me
