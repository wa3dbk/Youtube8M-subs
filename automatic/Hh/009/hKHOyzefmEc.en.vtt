 left behind tripple 7 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.229
 savage that the target then recognized 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:18.030

 we made half of agreement but we 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.250
 continue we will make a pastel price 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.890
 right before tripple seb radio in advance 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.350
 that before we do a level of 8 years 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.860
 in the right tripple this left 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.070
 in front of guts it's right foot in front and 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.259
 pivot turn to the left we redo his 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.680
 with the camps this price can certainly this 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:07.390
 half turn one starts right 16/08 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:10.209
 rivers is that tour and rieffel serve 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:16.370
 of eight rounds since the beginning life that 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:22.940
 expensive is it 1 and 2 3 4 5 s 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:27.049
 it's 8 1 and 2 3 and 4 5 and 6 7 and 8 1 and 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:30.590
 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:33.110
 then an ear 80 we will ask the 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.970
 right foot in front of the body to the right 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.530
 we make a live quarter turn to 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.620
 left will have good what is due to 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.989
 left at the place in race heel 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.750
 left we feel and we end up with a 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.280
 rocking chair defeated in front and rock 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.440
 perriÃ¨re

 left right foot in front live in the heart 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.870
 from all my left talent and going and 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.880
 believe that the wind and waves behind one 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:06.000
 give it back with the accounts at the stadium 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:11.010
 it's 8 1 2 3 and 4 and 5 6 for being 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.110

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:22.350
 start we go 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:23.459

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.090
 and 8 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:34.950
 and I believe 4 5 and 6 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:39.630
 7 8 1 2 3 and 4 and 5 6 7 8 second wall 7 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:47.070

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:53.640
 then 1 and 2 3 and 4 5 6 7 8 1 and 2 3 4 5 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:55.470
 6 7 8 1 2 3 and 4 and 5 6 7 8 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:01.380
 third measure with that she a 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:07.650
 little bit it's him 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:13.470

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:21.110
 and 6 and 8 1 2 3 and 4 and 5 6 7 8 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:21.110
 look at wall 7 8 1 and 2 points 4 5 and 6 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:32.180
 5 6 7 and 8 1 and 2 3 4 5 and 6 and 8 1 2 3 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:37.729
 4 5 6 7 8 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:39.229
 ok but there is Pathak Padre Sarthe 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.760
 so I'm precise for the 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:43.940
 music 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.350
 we hear an intro that slow enough and at 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.410
 when we are going to start moving forward 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.900
 it's rain that the intro for that you 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.270
 surprise a little but I would say 7 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.250
 yes it started fairly quickly but 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.320
