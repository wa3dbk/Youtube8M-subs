I guess you stick to the structure and

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.730 
I guess you stick to the structure and
that<00:01:38.060> cause<00:01:38.270> from<00:01:38.540> my<00:01:38.780> coaches<00:01:39.200> from<00:01:39.410> the<00:01:39.560> top

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
that cause from my coaches from the top

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.310 
that cause from my coaches from the top

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
few sometimes we don't we don't listen

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.510 
few sometimes we don't we don't listen
and<00:01:42.650> sometimes<00:01:43.190> us<00:01:43.460> like<00:01:43.850> take<00:01:44.720> Lionel<00:01:45.520> you
