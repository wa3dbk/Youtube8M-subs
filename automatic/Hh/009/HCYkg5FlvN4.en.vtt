00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
anyhow I'm not sure which way to turn

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.800 
anyhow I'm not sure which way to turn
this<00:00:24.269> nut<00:00:24.510> down<00:00:24.689> here<00:00:24.960> on<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.199> crank<00:00:25.939> so<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:26.970> I

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
this nut down here on the crank so I I

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.950 
this nut down here on the crank so I I
used<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.439> impact<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.130> wasn't<00:00:29.279> budging

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
used the impact and it wasn't budging

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.280 
used the impact and it wasn't budging
I<00:00:30.990> put<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.390> just<00:00:33.390> got<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.719> ratchet<00:00:33.899> down

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
I put the just got the ratchet down

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.190 
I put the just got the ratchet down
there<00:00:34.590> at<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.710> pry<00:00:34.950> bar<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.430> there<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.360> was

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
there at the pry bar on there and was

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.970 
there at the pry bar on there and was
giving<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.590> just<00:00:38.340> jerks<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.620> attempt<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.710> pop

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
giving it just jerks and attempt to pop

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.420 
giving it just jerks and attempt to pop
it<00:00:41.160> loose<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.640> doing<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:43.280> timing<00:00:44.280> belt

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
it loose and doing so the timing belt

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.060 
it loose and doing so the timing belt
turned<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.090> popped<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:46.379> pulley<00:00:46.739> off

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
turned and popped this pulley off

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.360 
turned and popped this pulley off
because<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.489> didn't<00:00:47.730> have<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.850> nut<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.329> there

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
because I didn't have that nut in there

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.970 
because I didn't have that nut in there
took<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.520> out<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.670> was<00:00:50.910> inside<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.449> pulley<00:00:51.660> off

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
took it out I was inside the pulley off

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.380 
took it out I was inside the pulley off
realized<00:00:52.980> about<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.579> tension<00:00:54.030> or<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.270> know

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
realized about the tension or you know

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.250 
realized about the tension or you know
tighten<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.050> up<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:56.539> never<00:00:57.539> put<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.840> back<00:00:57.870> and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
tighten it up so never put it back and

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.459 
tighten it up so never put it back and
that's<00:00:58.320> what<00:00:58.500> happens<00:00:58.920> so<00:01:00.079> make<00:01:01.079> sure<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.320> get

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
that's what happens so make sure you get

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.260 
that's what happens so make sure you get
your<00:01:01.620> nut<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:01.949> there<00:01:02.160> it's<00:01:02.309> gonna<00:01:02.399> pop<00:01:02.670> off<00:01:02.969> but

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
your nut on there it's gonna pop off but

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.299 
your nut on there it's gonna pop off but
it<00:01:03.780> don't<00:01:03.960> much<00:01:04.170> matter<00:01:04.439> because<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.010> have<00:01:05.189> to

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
it don't much matter because I have to

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.990 
it don't much matter because I have to
replace<00:01:05.640> all<00:01:05.909> these<00:01:06.030> new<00:01:06.240> parts<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:07.560> just

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
replace all these new parts I can just

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.120 
replace all these new parts I can just
hand<00:01:09.000> crank<00:01:09.360> my<00:01:09.570> marks<00:01:09.900> because<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.860> does

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
hand crank my marks because it it does

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.670 
hand crank my marks because it it does
have<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.640> key<00:01:12.450> way<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.869> here<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.500> pole

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
have this key way on here so the pole

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:22.130 
have this key way on here so the pole
you<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:13.979> only<00:01:14.130> go<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.369> one<00:01:14.820> way<00:01:19.759> and<00:01:21.140> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
you can only go on one way and the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.499 
you can only go on one way and the
pulleys<00:01:22.619> got<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> pin<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.909> your<00:01:24.030> marks<00:01:24.330> gonna

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
pulleys got the pin so your marks gonna

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.190 
pulleys got the pin so your marks gonna
line<00:01:24.810> up<00:01:25.610> you<00:01:26.610> can<00:01:26.790> see<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.420> made<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> mark

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
line up you can see it I made a mark

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.030 
line up you can see it I made a mark
right<00:01:28.530> here<00:01:29.060> match<00:01:30.060> up<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.710> when<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.740> dropped

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.090 
right here match up so when I dropped
the<00:01:32.159> cam<00:01:32.369> back<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.060> don't<00:01:33.270> turn<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.259> 180

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
the cam back in I don't turn it 180

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.230 
the cam back in I don't turn it 180
degrees<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.850> wrong<00:01:36.030> way<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.329> know<00:01:36.509> but<00:01:38.240> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
degrees the wrong way you know but the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.270 
degrees the wrong way you know but the
lobe<00:01:39.450> should<00:01:39.780> set<00:01:40.049> down<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.470> rockers

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
lobe should set down on the rockers

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.539 
lobe should set down on the rockers
tooling<00:01:41.670> stuff<00:01:41.939> like<00:01:42.950> like<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.100> took<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.430> out

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
here to a one on each side of the tubes

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:01.639 
here to a one on each side of the tubes
okay<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.850> then<00:01:57.649> now<00:01:59.090> my<00:02:00.090> issue<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:01.590> don't

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
okay and then now my issue is I don't

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.959 
okay and then now my issue is I don't
know<00:02:01.890> whether<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:03.380> cam<00:02:04.380> pulls<00:02:05.130> out<00:02:05.399> like<00:02:05.939> a

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
know whether this cam pulls out like a

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.350 
know whether this cam pulls out like a
traditional<00:02:07.399> engine<00:02:08.399> I've<00:02:08.700> never<00:02:09.090> really

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
traditional engine I've never really

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.930 
traditional engine I've never really
worked<00:02:09.539> much<00:02:09.780> on<00:02:09.959> these<00:02:10.140> overhead<00:02:10.590> cams<00:02:10.920> or<00:02:11.310> if

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
worked much on these overhead cams or if

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.360 
worked much on these overhead cams or if
there

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
there

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.520 
there
units<00:02:12.760> gonna<00:02:12.879> lift<00:02:13.180> off<00:02:13.450> but<00:02:13.870> I'll<00:02:14.170> figure<00:02:14.409> it

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
units gonna lift off but I'll figure it

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.149 
units gonna lift off but I'll figure it
out<00:02:14.680> here<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.099> let<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.340> know<00:02:15.489> and<00:02:16.620> it'd<00:02:17.620> be<00:02:17.799> a

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.159 
out here and let you know and it'd be a

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.850 
out here and let you know and it'd be a
heck<00:02:18.459> of<00:02:18.549> a<00:02:18.610> lot<00:02:18.700> more<00:02:18.879> helpful<00:02:19.150> if<00:02:20.140> I<00:02:20.409> had<00:02:20.590> the

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
heck of a lot more helpful if I had the
