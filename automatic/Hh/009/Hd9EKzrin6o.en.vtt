00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.080
 so map da child of the end of the 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:18.630
 videos ever 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:21.470
 what is there he is then protected then 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:27.599
 I'll take a look at the maps of Deichkind 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:35.180
 I 'll go carefully first carefully 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:39.050
 It's not going to be that easy here 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:42.920
 should I take another position times 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.920
 best with a grenade 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.399
 this is not easy i have to do now 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:50.640
 First of all, he has a good one 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.640
 position 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.449
 we have to go there for now 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:03.190
 I'm doing this to my task now 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:05.110
 I want to shoot a kid here best 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.930
 energy from behind i hope to come 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.369
 there somehow 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.130
 how to get there then is the entrance 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:16.569
 or who was that 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.929
 the one liter one now only has to 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:25.960
 somehow come up aha there we have 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:31.290
 the opportunity to say goodbye 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.290
 no, that's right now 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.490
 now I was ready 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.490
 I want you off 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:48.250
 I can also run back and forth like that 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:51.610
 that does not work because I'm going to go 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.800
 Here again you are afraid I come 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.950
 now it would be the spur here 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.060
 is that this is fucking shitty here 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:04.780
 I'm trying to get up from it 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:06.160
 I have very bad chances because 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.830
 either you look and want to fit me 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:17.110
 I will not come up here because 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:19.240
 Michael the scratching tree so somewhere 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.750
 entrance where you come from underneath and 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.290
 then I know that, unfortunately, I know 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.290
 Not 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.900
 Of course, if now with me one up 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.160
 I would definitely come there 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.459
 but there is certainly still one 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.459
 another way 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:49.840
 the question is only where knows of course 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:51.220
 even just the same and compass the grenades 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.310
 Of course, they are not enough up there 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.310
 or 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:07.270
 now brings me now nothing is coming 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:11.590
 One not out of the hat was one now 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:15.070
 cave really great 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:20.280
 yes sure because I thought I'm coming now 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.280
 there and that was probably nothing 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:36.310
 where is the entrance because I go where you have 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:38.730
 you made them tell me it knows 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.730
 him too 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:50.090
 oh crap was not enough but so was 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:57.650
 From there, the grenades throw themselves 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:04:06.560
 better I think my who was the 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:08.650
 deb off the people should go there 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:18.019
 not do 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:20.919
 very important to him not my friend like that 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.919
 I just do not do it to you 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:35.970
 I do not meet him either 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:40.319
 is a problem is a bit nasty 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.789
 only from up there by child so a few 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:44.000
 different position and we have too 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:46.979
 not bad 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.330
 Think about it a little bit 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.330
 just a bit boring of one 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.000
 position 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.620
 ok yes as i said webb dikkind 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.349
 I'm already clear from throughout 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.240
 now does not look bad 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.680
 I'm still curious how to get there 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.539
 high is probably the way to go 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.590
 come in 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.330
 but maybe we will again 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.740
 experienced if the very open I do 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.740
 another video all right
