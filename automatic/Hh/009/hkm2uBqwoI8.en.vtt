to oil you would expect it to be close
to<00:00:44.250> 10<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.760> 1<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.180> with<00:00:45.329> 120<00:00:45.899> hour<00:00:46.079> barrel<00:00:46.379> oil

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
to 10 to 1 so with 120 hour barrel oil

this discussion to other metals like
silver<00:04:07.430> and<00:04:08.329> platinum<00:04:08.570> and<00:04:09.200> then<00:04:09.320> maybe<00:04:09.470> the

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
silver and platinum and then maybe the

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.170 
silver and platinum and then maybe the
non<00:04:09.890> precious<00:04:10.340> ones<00:04:10.549> well<00:04:10.670> I<00:04:10.700> like<00:04:10.970> well

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180

silver<00:04:11.600> has<00:04:11.720> always<00:04:11.930> been<00:04:12.079> a<00:04:12.140> monetary<00:04:12.680> metal

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
silver has always been a monetary metal

silver has always been a monetary metal
and<00:04:13.190> I<00:04:13.250> think<00:04:13.519> you<00:04:13.670> know<00:04:13.760> gold<00:04:14.000> and<00:04:14.150> silver

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
and I think you know gold and silver

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.970 
and I think you know gold and silver
kind<00:04:14.660> of<00:04:14.720> go<00:04:14.840> hand<00:04:14.870> in<00:04:15.170> hand<00:04:15.230> I<00:04:15.440> think<00:04:15.470> there's

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
kind of go hand in hand I think there's

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.340 
kind of go hand in hand I think there's
a<00:04:16.040> bigger<00:04:16.310> move<00:04:16.579> coming<00:04:16.880> in<00:04:17.090> silver<00:04:17.540> if<00:04:17.750> gold

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
a bigger move coming in silver if gold

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.409 
a bigger move coming in silver if gold
is<00:04:18.500> at<00:04:18.680> five<00:04:18.859> thousand<00:04:19.400> dollars<00:04:19.640> an<00:04:19.760> ounce<00:04:19.880> you

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
is at five thousand dollars an ounce you

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:21.670 
is at five thousand dollars an ounce you
know<00:04:20.540> silver<00:04:20.900> could<00:04:21.049> be<00:04:21.140> at<00:04:21.229> five<00:04:21.440> hundred

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
know silver could be at five hundred

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.170 
know silver could be at five hundred
dollars<00:04:22.039> an<00:04:22.160> ounce<00:04:22.250> and<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:22.550> ratio<00:04:22.880> might<00:04:23.060> be

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
dollars an ounce and the ratio might be

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.240 
dollars an ounce and the ratio might be
