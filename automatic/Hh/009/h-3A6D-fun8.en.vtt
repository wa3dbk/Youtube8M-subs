would<00:04:05.250> be<00:04:05.610> difficult<00:04:05.910> because<00:04:06.870> he<00:04:07.290> had<00:04:07.440> lots

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
would be difficult because he had lots

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.320 
would be difficult because he had lots
of<00:04:07.860> animals<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:08.640> it<00:04:09.060> was<00:04:09.180> Saudis<00:04:09.810> spread<00:04:10.290> that

least did accomplish this however by
rerouting<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.340> rivers<00:04:20.730> so<00:04:21.090> then<00:04:21.269> they<00:04:21.840> would

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
rerouting to rivers so then they would

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.410 
rerouting to rivers so then they would
flow<00:04:22.620> right<00:04:23.040> into<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.430> stables<00:04:23.850> and<00:04:24.060> wash

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
flow right into the stables and wash

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:33.060 
flow right into the stables and wash
away<00:04:24.570> oh<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.500> debris<00:04:26.010> and<00:04:26.490> dirtiness
