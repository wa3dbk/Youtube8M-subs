and<00:00:11.000> this<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.150> one<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.570> just<00:00:12.750> did<00:00:13.019> actually

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
and this is one that I just did actually

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.269 
and this is one that I just did actually

for my sister-in-law she loves brown and
so<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.310> had<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:17.640> ribbon<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.289> mix<00:00:19.289> them<00:00:19.560> with

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
so I had this ribbon to mix them with

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.990 
so I had this ribbon to mix them with
and<00:00:20.039> just<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.279> show<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.460> about<00:00:20.609> how<00:00:20.820> much

and just to show you about how much

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.140 
and just to show you about how much
ribbon<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.539> bow<00:00:21.750> tapes<00:00:22.250> this<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.430> 30-foot

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
ribbon that bow tapes this is a 30-foot

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.689 
ribbon that bow tapes this is a 30-foot
roll<00:00:25.880> brand-new<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.859> this<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:29.160> what<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.670> left

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
roll brand-new and this is what is left

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.440 
roll brand-new and this is what is left
of<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.539> role<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:32.160> made<00:00:32.610> her<00:00:32.759> bow<00:00:32.940> from<00:00:33.270> so

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
of the role that I made her bow from so

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.910 
of the role that I made her bow from so
it<00:00:33.540> takes<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.809> good<00:00:33.930> bit<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.520> ribbon<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.610> do<00:00:35.760> it

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
it takes a good bit of ribbon to do it

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.850 
it takes a good bit of ribbon to do it
this<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.280> fullness<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:39.149> like<00:00:39.680> you<00:00:40.680> can

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
this is the fullness that I like you can

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.160 
this is the fullness that I like you can
make<00:00:41.010> them<00:00:41.190> even<00:00:41.489> puffier<00:00:41.850> or<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.510> little<00:00:42.960> less

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
make them even puffier or a little less

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.110 
make them even puffier or a little less
so<00:00:43.469> just<00:00:43.770> depending<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.250> what<00:00:44.579> your<00:00:44.730> taste<00:00:44.879> is

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
so just depending on what your taste is

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.060 
so just depending on what your taste is
i<00:00:45.680> would<00:00:46.680> suggest<00:00:47.190> using<00:00:47.760> ribbon<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:49.170> has

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
i would suggest using ribbon that is has

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.950 
i would suggest using ribbon that is has
some<00:00:50.280> body<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.760> maybe<00:00:51.120> some<00:00:51.390> wire<00:00:51.600> edge

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
some body to it maybe some wire edge

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.799 
some body to it maybe some wire edge
driven<00:00:52.500> or<00:00:52.980> some<00:00:53.460> ribbon<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.600> little

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
driven or some ribbon that is a little

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.500 
driven or some ribbon that is a little
bit<00:00:54.930> stiff<00:00:55.260> if<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.530> use<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> real<00:00:56.010> thin<00:00:56.510> or

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
bit stiff if you use a real thin or

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.910 
bit stiff if you use a real thin or
narrow<00:00:57.899> not<00:00:58.230> then<00:00:58.469> but<00:00:58.620> narrow<00:00:58.980> or<00:01:00.920> limp

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
narrow not then but narrow or limp

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.070 
narrow not then but narrow or limp
ribbon<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:03.059> going<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.329> kind<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.510> flop<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.930> you

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
ribbon it's going to kind of flop on you

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.690 
ribbon it's going to kind of flop on you
a<00:01:04.110> little<00:01:04.229> bit<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.680> i<00:01:04.710> definitely<00:01:05.250> had<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
a little bit so i definitely had the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.270 
a little bit so i definitely had the
best<00:01:05.909> results<00:01:06.900> out<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.049> using<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.560> fuller

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
best results out of using a fuller

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.359 
best results out of using a fuller
ribbon<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:09.990> it's<00:01:10.380> i<00:01:10.560> don't<00:01:10.860> know<00:01:10.979> what<00:01:11.220> this

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
ribbon and it's i don't know what this

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.070 
ribbon and it's i don't know what this
is<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.729> correct<00:01:12.000> technique<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
is the correct technique but this is the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.870 
is the correct technique but this is the
way<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.229> learned<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.100> do<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.700> works

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
way I learned to do it and it works

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.149 
way I learned to do it and it works
great<00:01:15.000> I've<00:01:15.450> had<00:01:15.600> many<00:01:16.290> people<00:01:16.590> ask<00:01:16.740> me<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.009> tie

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
great I've had many people ask me to tie

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.510 
great I've had many people ask me to tie
bows<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:18.500> may<00:01:19.500> not<00:01:19.680> be<00:01:19.799> technically<00:01:20.490> correct

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
bows so may not be technically correct

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.270 
bows so may not be technically correct
but<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.210> works<00:01:21.560> so<00:01:22.560> here<00:01:22.740> we<00:01:22.799> go<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:23.070> only

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
but it works so here we go this only

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.550 
but it works so here we go this only
takes<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.640> minute<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.360> like<00:01:25.259> you're<00:01:25.439> going

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
takes a minute I just like you're going

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.240 
takes a minute I just like you're going
to<00:01:25.619> start<00:01:25.920> making<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.310> regular<00:01:26.640> bow<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:28.250> if

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
to start making a regular bow and if

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.340 
to start making a regular bow and if
yours<00:01:29.520> your<00:01:30.000> ribbon<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.360> one-sided<00:01:30.810> like<00:01:31.110> this

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
yours your ribbon is one-sided like this

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.899 
yours your ribbon is one-sided like this
is<00:01:32.030> what<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.060> do<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.600> as<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.290> make<00:01:34.530> my<00:01:34.560> loops<00:01:35.009> to

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
is what I do is as I make my loops to

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.230 
is what I do is as I make my loops to
make<00:01:36.119> sure<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:37.290> patterns<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> outside<00:01:38.790> I

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
make sure the patterns on the outside I

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.210 
make sure the patterns on the outside I
just<00:01:39.930> make<00:01:40.079> loops<00:01:40.290> back<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.770> forth<00:01:40.950> back<00:01:41.189> and

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
just make loops back and forth back and

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.660 
just make loops back and forth back and
forth<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:42.380> if<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.590> ribbon<00:01:43.890> gets<00:01:44.100> twisted

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
forth and if the ribbon gets twisted

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.270 
forth and if the ribbon gets twisted
just<00:01:45.210> twist<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.689> ribbon<00:01:46.020> nature<00:01:46.290> as<00:01:46.470> you're

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
just twist the ribbon nature as you're

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.450 
just twist the ribbon nature as you're
holding<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:49.130> keep<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:52.130> pattern<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.340> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
holding it to keep the pattern on the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.300 
holding it to keep the pattern on the
correct<00:01:53.670> side<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.530> at<00:01:55.530> first<00:01:55.770> try<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.130> make

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.540 
has some body and you just keep making
loops<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.479> then<00:02:10.259> as<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.709> starts<00:02:11.099> getting<00:02:11.280> to

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
loops and then as it starts getting to

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.340 
loops and then as it starts getting to
the<00:02:11.670> fullness<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.450> want

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
the fullness that you want

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.760 
the fullness that you want
I<00:02:13.470> will<00:02:14.250> start<00:02:15.090> slightly<00:02:15.810> reducing<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.560> size

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
I will start slightly reducing the size

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.420 
I will start slightly reducing the size
of<00:02:17.070> my<00:02:17.220> loops<00:02:17.660> to<00:02:20.330> make<00:02:21.330> it<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.570> little<00:02:21.720> fuller

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
of my loops to make it a little fuller

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.460 
of my loops to make it a little fuller
towards<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.580> center<00:02:24.440> and<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.800> just<00:02:26.040> keep

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
towards the center and I just keep

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.070 
towards the center and I just keep
making<00:02:28.470> loops<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:29.010> mean<00:02:29.400> super<00:02:29.880> easy<00:02:30.120> my<00:02:30.690> son<00:02:30.930> is

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
making loops I mean super easy my son is

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.380 
making loops I mean super easy my son is
holding<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.410> camera<00:02:31.650> for<00:02:31.860> me<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.220> could<00:02:32.550> do

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
holding the camera for me so I could do

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.810 
holding the camera for me so I could do
this<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:33.960> I'm<00:02:34.410> sorry<00:02:34.680> y'all<00:02:34.890> if<00:02:35.010> I'm<00:02:35.190> bouncing

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
this and I'm sorry y'all if I'm bouncing

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.250 
this and I'm sorry y'all if I'm bouncing
around<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:36.240> told<00:02:36.300> him<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.630> hold<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.870> real<00:02:37.020> still

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
around I told him to hold it real still

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.600 
around I told him to hold it real still
and<00:02:37.290> he's<00:02:37.620> having<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:37.920> bounce<00:02:38.100> around<00:02:38.400> and

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
and he's having to bounce around and

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.240 
and he's having to bounce around and
keep<00:02:38.730> up<00:02:38.910> with<00:02:39.030> my<00:02:39.180> hand<00:02:39.450> so<00:02:40.040> hopefully<00:02:41.040> y'all

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
keep up with my hand so hopefully y'all

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.350 
keep up with my hand so hopefully y'all
can<00:02:41.280> follow<00:02:41.760> us<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:43.400> more<00:02:44.400> loops<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.150> think

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
can follow us and more loops and I think

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.220 
can follow us and more loops and I think
I<00:02:45.450> might<00:02:45.660> make<00:02:46.100> one<00:02:47.100> or<00:02:47.250> two<00:02:47.430> more<00:02:47.990> for<00:02:48.990> this

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
I might make one or two more for this

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.020 
I might make one or two more for this
one<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.980> get<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.130> kind<00:02:50.340> of<00:02:50.400> fullness<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.820> I

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
one to get the kind of fullness that I

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.550 
one to get the kind of fullness that I
like<00:02:51.270> and<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.570> see<00:02:51.780> I'm<00:02:51.900> kind<00:02:52.350> of<00:02:52.440> making

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
like and you see I'm kind of making

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.620 
like and you see I'm kind of making
these<00:02:52.770> a<00:02:52.830> little<00:02:53.040> bit<00:02:53.340> smaller<00:02:54.000> than<00:02:54.150> those<00:02:54.420> on

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
these a little bit smaller than those on

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.350 
these a little bit smaller than those on
the<00:02:54.720> outside<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:56.010> then<00:02:56.940> I'm<00:02:57.030> gonna<00:02:57.150> twist

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
the outside and then I'm gonna twist

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.500 
the outside and then I'm gonna twist
this<00:02:57.540> ribbon<00:02:57.930> again<00:02:58.370> and<00:03:01.940> make<00:03:02.940> that<00:03:03.240> loop

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
this ribbon again and make that loop

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.440 
this ribbon again and make that loop
there<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.380> then<00:03:04.830> one<00:03:05.040> more<00:03:06.380> twist<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:07.650> again

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
there and then one more twist it again

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.940 
there and then one more twist it again
to<00:03:09.450> bring<00:03:09.600> it<00:03:09.810> down<00:03:10.020> and<00:03:11.630> then<00:03:12.630> holding<00:03:13.620> on<00:03:13.740> to

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
to bring it down and then holding on to

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.280 
to bring it down and then holding on to
the<00:03:14.070> center<00:03:15.350> what<00:03:16.350> I<00:03:16.380> do<00:03:16.500> is<00:03:17.600> cut<00:03:18.600> one<00:03:19.170> of<00:03:19.260> my

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
the center what I do is cut one of my

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.290 
the center what I do is cut one of my
tails<00:03:19.730> to<00:03:20.730> cut<00:03:20.940> it<00:03:21.060> from<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.630> road<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:23.030> then<00:03:24.030> I

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
tails to cut it from the road and then I

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.000 
tails to cut it from the road and then I
will<00:03:24.630> take<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.560> ribbon<00:03:25.800> off<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.850> Roll<00:03:27.030> and

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
will take the ribbon off the Roll and

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.060 
will take the ribbon off the Roll and
cut<00:03:29.010> another<00:03:29.460> length<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:31.650> we'll<00:03:31.800> see<00:03:31.950> how

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
cut another length and we'll see how

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.660 
cut another length and we'll see how
long<00:03:32.250> this<00:03:32.310> is<00:03:33.440> what<00:03:34.440> about<00:03:34.650> eight<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.490> ten

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
long this is what about eight to ten

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.240 
long this is what about eight to ten
inches<00:03:35.700> long<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.440> then<00:03:37.440> find<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:37.980> know<00:03:38.100> the

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
inches long and then find you know the

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.220 
inches long and then find you know the
center<00:03:38.490> of<00:03:38.520> your<00:03:38.610> bow<00:03:38.820> on<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.060> front<00:03:39.590> and

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
center of your bow on the front and

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.680 
center of your bow on the front and
bring<00:03:43.230> that<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.680> back<00:03:43.980> flip<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.120> over<00:03:45.240> and

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
bring that to the back flip it over and

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:53.060 
bring that to the back flip it over and
I<00:03:46.650> just<00:03:46.680> tie<00:03:47.130> a<00:03:47.160> knot<00:03:50.240> and<00:03:51.260> if<00:03:52.260> your<00:03:52.410> new<00:03:52.800> ribbon

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
I just tie a knot and if your new ribbon

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.740 
I just tie a knot and if your new ribbon
has<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.220> lot<00:03:53.430> of<00:03:53.460> body<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:53.910> will<00:03:54.090> hold<00:03:54.330> really

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
has a lot of body it will hold really

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.550 
has a lot of body it will hold really
well<00:03:55.020> like<00:03:55.230> that<00:03:55.470> does<00:03:55.710> and<00:03:55.950> then<00:03:56.640> all<00:03:56.910> you<00:03:57.150> do

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
well like that does and then all you do

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.920 
well like that does and then all you do
is<00:03:58.560> start<00:03:59.040> picking<00:03:59.850> up<00:03:59.940> your<00:04:00.210> loops<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:00.840> you

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
is start picking up your loops and you

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.160 
is start picking up your loops and you
can<00:04:01.080> rearrange<00:04:01.350> them<00:04:01.830> having<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:03.170> stiff

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
can rearrange them having the stiff

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.190 
can rearrange them having the stiff
ribbon<00:04:04.860> allows<00:04:05.130> you<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:06.260> do<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.410> arranging

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
ribbon allows you to do the arranging

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.920 
ribbon allows you to do the arranging
just<00:04:10.200> like<00:04:10.350> you<00:04:10.530> like<00:04:10.880> and<00:04:11.880> you<00:04:12.480> just<00:04:12.660> pick

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
just like you like and you just pick

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.810 
just like you like and you just pick
them<00:04:13.080> up<00:04:13.200> in<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.530> range<00:04:13.800> and<00:04:14.130> poof<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.520> a<00:04:14.580> range

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
them up in a range and poof and a range

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.150 
them up in a range and poof and a range
and<00:04:15.150> this<00:04:15.990> one<00:04:16.230> I've<00:04:16.380> got<00:04:16.530> one<00:04:16.739> loop<00:04:16.920> that's<00:04:17.070> a

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
and this one I've got one loop that's a

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.470 
and this one I've got one loop that's a
little<00:04:17.370> bit<00:04:17.460> longer<00:04:17.640> than<00:04:17.880> I<00:04:17.970> want<00:04:18.210> so<00:04:18.299> I'm

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
little bit longer than I want so I'm

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.230 
little bit longer than I want so I'm
going<00:04:18.690> to<00:04:18.720> pull<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:20.270> tail<00:04:21.270> a<00:04:21.570> little<00:04:21.780> bit<00:04:22.049> to

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
going to pull the tail a little bit to

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.630 
going to pull the tail a little bit to
tighten<00:04:24.240> it<00:04:24.510> up<00:04:24.660> and<00:04:24.960> you<00:04:25.260> just<00:04:25.290> adjust

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
tighten it up and you just adjust

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.330 
tighten it up and you just adjust
your<00:04:27.640> bow<00:04:28.170> until<00:04:29.170> you<00:04:29.260> get<00:04:29.470> exactly<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:30.160> look

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
your bow until you get exactly the look

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.640 
your bow until you get exactly the look
that<00:04:30.400> you<00:04:30.550> want<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.950> you<00:04:33.480> end<00:04:34.480> up<00:04:34.630> with<00:04:34.840> the

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650
