00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
the control panel it's the bottom left

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.389 
the control panel it's the bottom left
button<00:02:00.780> if<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.259> turn<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.709> push<00:02:02.039> that<00:02:02.189> button

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
button if you turn that push that button

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.029 
button if you turn that push that button
will<00:02:03.390> turn<00:02:03.569> on<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.840> metronome<00:02:03.959> the<00:02:04.649> default

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
will turn on the metronome the default

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.850 
will turn on the metronome the default
tempo<00:02:05.429> is<00:02:05.640> 120<00:02:06.020> but<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.140> can<00:02:07.289> adjust<00:02:07.679> the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
tempo is 120 but you can adjust the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.919 
tempo is 120 but you can adjust the
tempo<00:02:08.220> with<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.729> plus<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.090> minus<00:02:09.479> button

like<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:10.679> if<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.250> want<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.519> go<00:02:11.579> slower<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:14.010> can

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
like so if you want to go slower you can

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.839 
like so if you want to go slower you can
go<00:02:14.250> like<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.430> if<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.299> want<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.569> go<00:02:15.630> faster

off the metronome just push the button
one<00:02:32.129> more<00:02:32.280> time<00:02:32.459> like<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:34.129> you<00:02:35.129> can<00:02:35.280> also<00:02:35.400> add
