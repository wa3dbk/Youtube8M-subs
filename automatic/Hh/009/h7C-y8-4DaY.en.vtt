major adversaries towards its creation
one<00:01:43.079> was<00:01:43.290> its<00:01:43.470> ambient<00:01:43.920> surroundings<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.640> two

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
one was its ambient surroundings and two

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.760 
one was its ambient surroundings and two
were<00:01:45.240> bugs<00:01:45.509> or<00:01:45.780> creepy<00:01:46.110> crawlies<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.619> get

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
were bugs or creepy crawlies that get

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.770 
were bugs or creepy crawlies that get
into<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.189> now<00:01:47.700> bugs<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.149> mice<00:01:48.270> say<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.659> guys

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
into it now bugs and mice say you guys

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.240 
into it now bugs and mice say you guys
know<00:01:49.049> where<00:01:49.229> major<00:01:49.409> problems<00:01:49.890> for<00:01:49.979> early

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
know where major problems for early

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.980 
know where major problems for early
household<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.360> they<00:01:51.479> used<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.720> build<00:01:51.869> a

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
household and so they used to build a

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.929 
household and so they used to build a
box<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.470> bread<00:01:52.649> box<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.100> keep<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.759> keep

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
box of bread box to keep it in and keep

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.240 
box of bread box to keep it in and keep
the<00:01:54.090> bugs<00:01:54.240> out<00:01:54.509> early<00:01:55.409> bread<00:01:55.649> makers<00:01:55.979> found

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
the bugs out early bread makers found

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.740 
the bugs out early bread makers found
that<00:01:56.399> keeping<00:01:56.670> their<00:01:56.790> bread<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.119> these<00:01:57.270> boxes

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
that keeping their bread in these boxes

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.569 
that keeping their bread in these boxes
would<00:01:58.140> help<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.469> maintain<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.890> more<00:01:59.159> constant

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
would help to maintain a more constant

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.580 
would help to maintain a more constant
temperature<00:02:00.149> in<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.630> more<00:02:00.780> constant<00:02:01.110> level<00:02:01.380> of

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
temperature in a more constant level of

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.230 
temperature in a more constant level of
humidity<00:02:01.860> allowing<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.790> bread<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.090> say

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
humidity allowing the bread to say

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.240 
humidity allowing the bread to say
softer<00:02:03.780> longer<00:02:04.380> by<00:02:04.680> mitigating<00:02:05.219> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
softer longer by mitigating the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.399 
softer longer by mitigating the
retrograde<00:02:05.790> ation<00:02:06.240> process<00:02:06.750> which<00:02:07.170> made<00:02:07.380> a

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
retrograde ation process which made a

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.790 
retrograde ation process which made a
better<00:02:07.619> product<00:02:07.920> for<00:02:08.129> everyone

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
better product for everyone

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.980 
better product for everyone
and<00:02:09.130> so<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.640> modern<00:02:09.910> breadbox<00:02:10.330> was<00:02:10.570> born<00:02:10.810> and

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
and so the modern breadbox was born and

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.480 
and so the modern breadbox was born and
made<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.140> constant<00:02:11.710> in<00:02:11.860> almost<00:02:12.130> every

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
made a constant in almost every

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.790 
made a constant in almost every
household<00:02:12.910> now<00:02:13.570> bread<00:02:13.870> boxes<00:02:14.290> they<00:02:14.470> come<00:02:14.680> in

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
household now bread boxes they come in

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.010 
household now bread boxes they come in
all<00:02:14.950> shapes<00:02:15.280> sizes<00:02:15.460> and<00:02:15.850> prices<00:02:16.210> but<00:02:16.810> they<00:02:16.930> all

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
all shapes sizes and prices but they all

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.140 
all shapes sizes and prices but they all
have<00:02:17.080> two<00:02:17.410> major<00:02:17.680> functions<00:02:18.250> they<00:02:18.820> keep<00:02:19.030> the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
have two major functions they keep the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.970 
have two major functions they keep the
larger<00:02:19.540> more<00:02:19.720> problems<00:02:20.200> some<00:02:20.380> creatures<00:02:20.800> out

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
larger more problems some creatures out

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.040 
larger more problems some creatures out
of<00:02:21.130> your<00:02:21.250> baked<00:02:21.460> goods<00:02:21.490> and<00:02:21.910> two<00:02:22.570> they<00:02:22.750> allow<00:02:23.020> a

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
of your baked goods and two they allow a

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.020 
of your baked goods and two they allow a
small<00:02:23.380> enough<00:02:23.710> amount<00:02:24.040> of<00:02:24.130> airflow<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.820> keep

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
small enough amount of airflow to keep

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.000 
small enough amount of airflow to keep
mold<00:02:25.270> from<00:02:25.480> forming<00:02:25.960> but<00:02:26.500> they<00:02:26.620> don't<00:02:26.740> allow

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
mold from forming but they don't allow

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.700 
mold from forming but they don't allow
enough<00:02:27.430> airflow<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:28.230> quicken<00:02:29.230> them<00:02:29.410> stealing
