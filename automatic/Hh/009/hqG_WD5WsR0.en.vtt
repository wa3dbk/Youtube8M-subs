right here seems to be just as good open
up<00:01:16.010> a<00:01:16.130> package<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:16.729> it's<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:16.970> same<00:01:17.180> type<00:01:17.450> of

Ramsay<00:01:24.530> is<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:24.800> I<00:01:24.860> think<00:01:25.070> noir<00:01:25.280> is<00:01:25.430> probably

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850

Ramsay is and I think noir is probably
more<00:01:26.120> accessible<00:01:26.780> and<00:01:26.810> it's<00:01:27.110> like<00:01:27.200> it's<00:01:27.380> a

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
more accessible and it's like it's a

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.750 
more accessible and it's like it's a
little<00:01:27.620> cheaper<00:01:27.950> so<00:01:28.100> that's<00:01:28.280> even<00:01:28.550> better

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
little cheaper so that's even better

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.820

ice<00:02:00.950> pick<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:01.550> punch<00:02:02.479> a<00:02:02.630> hole<00:02:02.840> in<00:02:02.900> them<00:02:03.170> I

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
ice pick and punch a hole in them I

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.370 
ice pick and punch a hole in them I
decided<00:02:03.950> to<00:02:04.159> do<00:02:04.340> this<00:02:04.840> put<00:02:05.840> your<00:02:05.960> hole<00:02:06.110> on<00:02:06.260> each

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
decided to do this put your hole on each

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.830 
decided to do this put your hole on each
side<00:02:06.650> and<00:02:07.010> other<00:02:07.670> ways<00:02:07.850> I<00:02:08.030> can<00:02:08.209> just<00:02:08.390> fold<00:02:08.659> it

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
side and other ways I can just fold it

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.930 
side and other ways I can just fold it
over<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.259> set<00:02:10.099> it<00:02:10.220> inside<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.729> bucket

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
over and set it inside the bucket

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.180 
over and set it inside the bucket
because<00:02:11.540> if<00:02:11.780> we<00:02:11.959> open<00:02:12.319> up<00:02:12.379> the<00:02:12.530> buckets<00:02:12.920> saying

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
because if we open up the buckets saying

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.309 
because if we open up the buckets saying
a<00:02:13.340> couple<00:02:13.549> of<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.970> year<00:02:14.450> or<00:02:14.599> two<00:02:14.720> years<00:02:14.959> it

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
a couple of a year or two years it

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.140 
a couple of a year or two years it
whenever<00:02:15.590> emergency<00:02:16.459> hits<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:16.849> we<00:02:16.909> need<00:02:17.060> to

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
whenever emergency hits and we need to

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.699 
whenever emergency hits and we need to
use<00:02:17.299> it<00:02:17.450> or<00:02:17.569> if<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:17.780> just<00:02:17.930> actually<00:02:18.140> just<00:02:18.319> want

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
use it or if you just actually just want

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.350 
use it or if you just actually just want
to<00:02:18.799> take<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:20.440> start<00:02:21.440> using<00:02:21.770> them<00:02:22.209> what<00:02:23.209> you

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
to take and start using them what you

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.199 
to take and start using them what you
can<00:02:23.540> do<00:02:23.720> is<00:02:23.959> where<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:24.920> after<00:02:25.880> you<00:02:25.970> open<00:02:26.180> up

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
can do is where you after you open up

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.250 
can do is where you after you open up
the<00:02:26.360> bucket<00:02:26.690> after

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
the bucket after

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.780 
the bucket after
where<00:02:27.349> you<00:02:27.439> put<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.769> hole<00:02:28.010> through<00:02:28.310> it<00:02:28.580> let's

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
where you put the hole through it let's

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.759 
where you put the hole through it let's
get<00:02:28.909> you<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.090> piece<00:02:29.330> of<00:02:29.599> tape<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:30.290> put<00:02:30.349> on<00:02:30.620> each

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
get you a piece of tape and put on each

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.670 
get you a piece of tape and put on each
side<00:02:31.040> like<00:02:31.069> that<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:31.900> you've<00:02:32.900> you've<00:02:33.409> got

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
side like that and you've you've got

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.300 
side like that and you've you've got
this<00:02:33.890> stuff<00:02:34.450> put<00:02:35.450> basically<00:02:35.870> in<00:02:36.439> suspension

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
this stuff put basically in suspension

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.670 
this stuff put basically in suspension
from<00:02:37.549> where<00:02:37.760> you<00:02:38.180> originally<00:02:38.810> started<00:02:39.260> out<00:02:39.409> at

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
from where you originally started out at

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.770 
from where you originally started out at
if<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.459> shelf<00:02:40.760> life<00:02:41.000> when<00:02:41.239> this<00:02:41.329> thing<00:02:41.599> was

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
if the shelf life when this thing was

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.869 
if the shelf life when this thing was
was<00:02:42.349> 2<00:02:42.560> years<00:02:42.829> when<00:02:43.010> you<00:02:43.129> started<00:02:43.549> this<00:02:43.640> when

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
was 2 years when you started this when

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.130 
was 2 years when you started this when
you<00:02:43.970> open<00:02:44.180> up<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.390> bucket<00:02:44.690> this<00:02:44.750> dough<00:02:44.959> has

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
you open up the bucket this dough has

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.520 
you open up the bucket this dough has
two<00:02:45.349> years<00:02:45.620> on<00:02:45.829> it<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:47.230> doesn't<00:02:48.230> mean<00:02:48.349> that

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
two years on it and doesn't mean that

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.990 
two years on it and doesn't mean that
you<00:02:48.680> have<00:02:48.829> to<00:02:48.860> use<00:02:49.159> it<00:02:49.310> right<00:02:49.459> when<00:02:49.670> you<00:02:49.790> open

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
you have to use it right when you open

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.170 
you have to use it right when you open
the<00:02:50.060> bucket<00:02:50.420> you've<00:02:50.959> got<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.409> good<00:02:52.220> shelf<00:02:52.909> life

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
the bucket you've got a good shelf life

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.619 
the bucket you've got a good shelf life
left<00:02:53.840> on<00:02:54.019> it<00:02:54.170> just<00:02:54.739> like<00:02:54.920> that<00:02:54.950> so<00:02:55.519> which<00:02:56.450> is<00:02:56.599> a

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
left on it just like that so which is a

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.319 
left on it just like that so which is a
pretty<00:02:57.140> heck<00:02:57.319> of<00:02:57.439> a<00:02:57.500> deal<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:57.859> and<00:02:58.700> we<00:02:58.909> can<00:02:58.939> it

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
pretty heck of a deal so and we can it

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.059 
pretty heck of a deal so and we can it
looks<00:02:59.510> like<00:02:59.659> we<00:02:59.810> can<00:02:59.989> get<00:03:00.109> a<00:03:00.170> couple<00:03:00.739> more<00:03:01.010> of

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
looks like we can get a couple more of

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.869 
looks like we can get a couple more of
these<00:03:01.250> in<00:03:01.489> here<00:03:01.700> I<00:03:03.280> guess<00:03:04.280> I<00:03:04.400> need<00:03:04.579> to<00:03:04.609> count

them<00:03:17.629> over<00:03:17.750> about<00:03:18.319> just<00:03:19.220> a<00:03:19.280> little<00:03:19.340> bit<00:03:19.579> above

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
them over about just a little bit above

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.710 
them over about just a little bit above
where<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:21.370> product<00:03:22.370> is<00:03:22.519> and<00:03:22.879> when<00:03:23.510> I<00:03:23.540> was

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
where the product is and when I was

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.099 
where the product is and when I was
thinking<00:03:23.870> about<00:03:24.109> doing<00:03:24.409> maybe<00:03:25.099> is<00:03:25.959> taken<00:03:26.959> in

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
thinking about doing maybe is taken in

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.250 
thinking about doing maybe is taken in
and<00:03:28.180> yeah<00:03:29.180> probably<00:03:29.510> could<00:03:29.810> have<00:03:29.870> done<00:03:29.930> this<00:03:30.139> a

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
and yeah probably could have done this a

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.420 
and yeah probably could have done this a
little<00:03:30.379> bit<00:03:30.560> different<00:03:30.980> let's<00:03:31.129> exes<00:03:31.609> two<00:03:32.060> four

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
little bit different let's exes two four

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.059 
little bit different let's exes two four
two<00:03:34.430> four<00:03:34.870> six<00:03:35.870> got<00:03:36.199> eight<00:03:36.410> of<00:03:36.620> them<00:03:36.739> in<00:03:36.829> here

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
two four six got eight of them in here

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.150 
two four six got eight of them in here
which<00:03:37.549> is<00:03:37.579> not<00:03:37.849> bad<00:03:38.090> okay<00:03:38.889> probably<00:03:39.889> get<00:03:40.069> about

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
which is not bad okay probably get about

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.050 
which is not bad okay probably get about
16<00:03:40.699> total<00:03:41.000> maybe<00:03:41.329> and<00:03:41.889> we<00:03:42.889> can<00:03:43.099> bend<00:03:43.519> this<00:03:43.669> over

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
16 total maybe and we can bend this over

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.050 
16 total maybe and we can bend this over
and<00:03:44.889> closer<00:03:45.889> to<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.310> top<00:03:46.519> punch<00:03:46.849> a<00:03:46.940> little

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
and closer to the top punch a little

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.150 
and closer to the top punch a little
hole<00:03:47.180> in<00:03:47.540> it<00:03:47.660> oh<00:03:47.840> yeah<00:03:48.260> I<00:03:48.290> think<00:03:48.379> we<00:03:48.650> go<00:03:48.799> I<00:03:48.829> think

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
hole in it oh yeah I think we go I think

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.650 
hole in it oh yeah I think we go I think
we'll<00:03:49.280> be<00:03:49.370> able<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.549> get<00:03:49.669> about<00:03:49.790> 16<00:03:50.389> of<00:03:50.540> these

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
we'll be able to get about 16 of these

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.140 
we'll be able to get about 16 of these
in<00:03:50.930> here<00:03:51.139> you<00:03:51.769> know<00:03:51.919> so<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:52.549> I'm<00:03:52.910> just<00:03:53.030> going

it'll actually be that much that much
better<00:04:50.650> so<00:04:51.180> oK<00:04:52.180> we've<00:04:52.690> got<00:04:52.960> these<00:04:53.500> put<00:04:53.860> in<00:04:53.979> here

box<00:05:57.490> so<00:05:57.849> that's<00:05:58.060> like<00:05:58.210> 40<00:05:58.599> servings<00:05:59.050> which<00:05:59.260> is

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
box so that's like 40 servings which is

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.350 
box so that's like 40 servings which is
not<00:06:00.010> bad<00:06:00.220> okay

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
not bad okay

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.830 
not bad okay
so<00:06:01.570> what<00:06:01.659> we're<00:06:01.780> going<00:06:01.810> to<00:06:01.930> do<00:06:02.190> is<00:06:03.510> all<00:06:04.510> right

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
so what we're going to do is all right

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.010 
so what we're going to do is all right
if<00:06:04.960> I<00:06:05.199> can<00:06:05.349> get<00:06:05.440> the<00:06:05.530> jar<00:06:05.740> open<00:06:06.070> a<00:06:07.020> couple

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
if I can get the jar open a couple

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.310 
if I can get the jar open a couple
oxygen<00:06:08.560> absorbers<00:06:09.099> one<00:06:09.759> two<00:06:10.080> on<00:06:11.080> each<00:06:11.289> side

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
oxygen absorbers one two on each side

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.240 
oxygen absorbers one two on each side
then<00:06:11.740> I'll<00:06:11.860> go<00:06:12.070> ahead<00:06:12.130> and<00:06:13.740> seal<00:06:14.740> it<00:06:14.889> up<00:06:14.919> later

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
then I'll go ahead and seal it up later

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.580 
then I'll go ahead and seal it up later
I'll<00:06:15.430> make<00:06:15.580> sure<00:06:15.759> these<00:06:16.240> points<00:06:16.840> are<00:06:16.960> put<00:06:17.199> down

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
I'll make sure these points are put down

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.050 
I'll make sure these points are put down
to<00:06:18.099> the<00:06:18.130> bottom<00:06:18.789> that<00:06:18.880> way<00:06:19.090> they<00:06:19.240> don't<00:06:19.919> pop<00:06:20.919> up

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
to the bottom that way they don't pop up

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.720 
to the bottom that way they don't pop up
okay<00:06:22.750> oxygen<00:06:23.350> absorber<00:06:23.800> on<00:06:23.920> each<00:06:24.070> side<00:06:24.340> and<00:06:24.610> it

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:24.730 
okay oxygen absorber on each side and it

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.420 
okay oxygen absorber on each side and it
should<00:06:24.760> take<00:06:25.120> and<00:06:25.390> suck<00:06:25.750> all<00:06:25.900> the<00:06:25.960> oxygen<00:06:26.430> out

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
should take and suck all the oxygen out

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.910 
should take and suck all the oxygen out
of<00:06:27.490> the<00:06:27.850> packages<00:06:28.750> and<00:06:29.880> okay<00:06:31.380> and<00:06:32.380> hear<00:06:32.830> the

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:32.920 
of the packages and okay and hear the

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.780 
of the packages and okay and hear the
dog<00:06:33.670> barking<00:06:33.700> at<00:06:34.210> the<00:06:34.330> moon<00:06:34.480> no<00:06:35.320> I<00:06:35.770> think<00:06:36.580> the

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:36.790 
dog barking at the moon no I think the

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.520 
dog barking at the moon no I think the
dogs<00:06:37.030> barking<00:06:37.510> the<00:06:37.630> neighbors<00:06:37.960> a<00:06:37.990> dog<00:06:38.230> is

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
dogs barking the neighbors a dog is

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:40.510 
their barking and this dogs barking and

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.780 
their barking and this dogs barking and
I<00:06:40.570> think<00:06:40.840> they<00:06:40.990> just<00:06:41.020> having<00:06:41.530> a<00:06:41.620> bark<00:06:42.280> Festus

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:42.790 
I think they just having a bark Festus

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.250 
I think they just having a bark Festus
Eden<00:06:43.150> okay

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.260 
Eden okay

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.030

in<00:07:03.670> it<00:07:03.820> as<00:07:04.030> I<00:07:04.690> hit<00:07:04.900> it<00:07:04.930> so<00:07:05.400> we<00:07:06.400> are<00:07:06.430> actually

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:06.700 
in it as I hit it so we are actually

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.310 
in it as I hit it so we are actually
sealed<00:07:07.660> up<00:07:07.840> pretty<00:07:08.050> good<00:07:08.550> good<00:07:09.550> deal<00:07:10.020> so<00:07:11.020> that

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:11.320 
sealed up pretty good good deal so that

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.940 
sealed up pretty good good deal so that
was<00:07:11.740> what<00:07:12.310> we<00:07:12.430> say<00:07:12.640> 20<00:07:13.300> packages<00:07:13.720> of<00:07:14.500> the<00:07:14.710> nor

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:14.950 
was what we say 20 packages of the nor

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:19.800 
was what we say 20 packages of the nor
which<00:07:15.340> were<00:07:15.490> about<00:07:15.640> a<00:07:15.700> dollar<00:07:15.970> piece<00:07:16.300> and<00:07:18.810> six

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:19.810 
which were about a dollar piece and six

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.300 
which were about a dollar piece and six
dollars<00:07:19.960> so<00:07:20.290> for<00:07:20.440> about<00:07:20.620> twenty<00:07:20.920> six<00:07:21.100> dollars

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:21.310 
dollars so for about twenty six dollars

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.190 
dollars so for about twenty six dollars
you've<00:07:21.640> got<00:07:21.850> right<00:07:22.150> at<00:07:22.330> two<00:07:22.600> gallons<00:07:23.080> of

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:23.200 
you've got right at two gallons of

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.010 
you've got right at two gallons of
product<00:07:24.160> put<00:07:24.820> away<00:07:25.030> for<00:07:25.240> long-term<00:07:25.450> storage

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:26.020 
product put away for long-term storage

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.440 
product put away for long-term storage
and<00:07:26.350> I<00:07:26.860> would<00:07:27.040> imagine<00:07:27.340> you<00:07:28.030> could<00:07:28.180> probably

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:28.450 
and I would imagine you could probably

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:32.970 
and I would imagine you could probably
get<00:07:29.080> oh<00:07:29.940> four<00:07:30.940> to<00:07:31.060> five<00:07:31.240> years<00:07:31.690> of<00:07:32.350> storage<00:07:32.800> out

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:32.980 
get oh four to five years of storage out

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.860 
get oh four to five years of storage out
of<00:07:33.160> this<00:07:33.280> and<00:07:33.700> we<00:07:33.910> probably<00:07:34.180> needed<00:07:34.720> before

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:34.870 
of this and we probably needed before

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.600 
of this and we probably needed before
then<00:07:35.290> the<00:07:35.590> way<00:07:35.710> things<00:07:35.950> are<00:07:36.100> going<00:07:36.160> if<00:07:36.520> you

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:36.610 
then the way things are going if you

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.850
