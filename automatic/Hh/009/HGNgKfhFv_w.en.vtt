let's<00:00:55.469> take<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> look<00:00:55.949> at<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.190> packaging<00:00:56.789> you

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
let's take a look at the packaging you

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.060 
let's take a look at the packaging you
can<00:00:56.940> see<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> side<00:00:57.690> here<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:58.199> can<00:00:58.859> set<00:00:59.039> a

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
can see on the side here you can set a

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.069 
can see on the side here you can set a
goal<00:00:59.160> for<00:00:59.699> how<00:00:59.879> many<00:01:00.059> steps<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.539> want<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.870> walk

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
goal for how many steps you want to walk

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.020 
goal for how many steps you want to walk
and<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.350> gives<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.620> progress<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.489> it

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
and it gives you progress on that it

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.750 
and it gives you progress on that it
also<00:01:03.180> shows<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.809> time<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:05.040> also<00:01:05.189> tracks

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
also shows you the time it also tracks

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.760 
also shows you the time it also tracks
your<00:01:05.880> calories<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.600> also<00:01:07.140> tracks<00:01:07.470> your<00:01:07.650> sleep

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
your calories and also tracks your sleep

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.100

so<00:01:08.280> pretty<00:01:08.820> much<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.180> same<00:01:09.390> features<00:01:09.900> as<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
so pretty much the same features as the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.620 
so pretty much the same features as the
Fitbit<00:01:10.860> flex<00:01:11.040> but<00:01:11.520> we've<00:01:11.700> also<00:01:11.970> got<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> time

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
Fitbit flex but we've also got the time

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.450 
Fitbit flex but we've also got the time
displayed<00:01:13.140> on<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.439> one<00:01:13.619> as<00:01:13.770> well<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.130> that's

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
displayed on this one as well so that's

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.310 
displayed on this one as well so that's
really<00:01:14.549> nice<00:01:15.000> something<00:01:15.900> that's<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.110> little

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
really nice something that's a little

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.890 
really nice something that's a little
bit<00:01:16.500> different<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.939> instead<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.450> you

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
bit different is that instead of you

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.749 
bit different is that instead of you
recharging<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.070> looks<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.430> it's<00:01:20.610> got<00:01:20.700> a

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
recharging this it looks like it's got a

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.179 
recharging this it looks like it's got a
built<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.270> sort<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.570> integral<00:01:22.380> battery<00:01:22.890> we'll

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
built in sort of integral battery we'll

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.800 
built in sort of integral battery we'll
take<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.369> look<00:01:23.580> at<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.759> when<00:01:23.909> we<00:01:23.939> unboxing<00:01:24.600> and

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
take a look at that when we unboxing and

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.810 
take a look at that when we unboxing and
this<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> little<00:01:25.799> sort<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.130> preview<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.670> what

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
this is a little sort of preview of what

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.999 
this is a little sort of preview of what
the<00:01:26.939> app<00:01:27.180> looks<00:01:27.210> like<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:28.110> connects<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.770> via

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
the app looks like the connects to via

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.520 
the app looks like the connects to via
bluetooth<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:30.509> let's<00:01:30.869> have<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.110> look<00:01:31.259> inside

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
bluetooth so let's have a look inside

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.620 
bluetooth so let's have a look inside
the<00:01:31.860> box<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:33.090> available<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.509> different

some safety information we've also got

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.960 
some safety information we've also got
some<00:02:09.030> details<00:02:09.330> here<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.410> how<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.160> fit<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
some details here of how to fit the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.800 
some details here of how to fit the
little

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
little

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.320 
little
tracker<00:02:13.170> inside<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.160> band<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:15.060> you<00:02:15.150> can

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
tracker inside the band so you can

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.900 
tracker inside the band so you can
obviously<00:02:15.480> remove<00:02:16.050> this<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.560> change<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.880> a

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
obviously remove this and change to a

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.520 
obviously remove this and change to a
different<00:02:18.330> colored<00:02:18.569> band<00:02:18.780> if<00:02:18.989> you<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.290> wish

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
different colored band if you so wish

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.190 
different colored band if you so wish
and<00:02:19.890> then<00:02:20.730> we've<00:02:20.940> got<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.420> tracking<00:02:21.870> device

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
and then we've got the tracking device

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.640 
and then we've got the tracking device
itself<00:02:22.709> inside<00:02:23.370> this<00:02:23.610> little<00:02:23.819> pack<00:02:24.030> here<00:02:24.650> and

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
itself inside this little pack here and

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.990 
itself inside this little pack here and
then<00:02:26.190> we<00:02:26.340> also<00:02:26.520> got<00:02:27.209> this<00:02:27.870> little<00:02:28.110> USB

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
then we also got this little USB

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.330 
then we also got this little USB
connector<00:02:30.000> so<00:02:30.269> you<00:02:30.300> can<00:02:30.480> use<00:02:30.750> this<00:02:31.019> it<00:02:31.470> uses<00:02:31.860> an

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
connector so you can use this it uses an

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.180 
connector so you can use this it uses an
technology<00:02:32.910> or<00:02:33.239> m+<00:02:33.690> technology<00:02:34.349> and<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:35.069> can

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
technology or m+ technology and you can

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.089 
technology or m+ technology and you can
connect<00:02:35.459> this<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.970> your<00:02:36.140> USB<00:02:37.140> connector<00:02:37.980> on

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
connect this to your USB connector on

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.280 
connect this to your USB connector on
your<00:02:38.250> computer<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:39.390> can<00:02:39.540> synchronize<00:02:40.050> it

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
your computer and you can synchronize it

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.360 
your computer and you can synchronize it
to<00:02:40.440> your<00:02:40.590> laptop

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
to your laptop

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.910 
to your laptop
perhaps<00:02:41.840> so<00:02:42.840> let's<00:02:43.319> get<00:02:43.440> into<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.769> band

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
perhaps so let's get into the band

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.460 
perhaps so let's get into the band
itself<00:02:44.250> on<00:02:44.550> so<00:02:45.030> we've<00:02:45.150> got<00:02:45.299> a<00:02:45.450> another<00:02:46.110> strap

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
itself on so we've got a another strap

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.809 
itself on so we've got a another strap
in<00:02:46.590> here<00:02:46.709> I'm<00:02:46.890> assuming<00:02:47.010> this<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.549> another

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
in here I'm assuming this is another

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.990 
in here I'm assuming this is another
size<00:02:48.120> strap<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:50.400> get<00:02:50.549> into<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.790> band

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
size strap and to get into the band

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.220 
size strap and to get into the band
itself<00:02:51.510> we<00:02:51.900> have<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.260> peel<00:02:52.500> back<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:53.220> plastic

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
itself we have to peel back the plastic

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:01.759 
itself we have to peel back the plastic
and<00:02:55.850> we<00:02:56.850> have<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:58.370> unravel<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:01.080> band<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.680> this

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
and we have to unravel the band and this

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.190 
and we have to unravel the band and this
is<00:03:01.830> it<00:03:02.099> let's<00:03:02.340> peel<00:03:02.610> this<00:03:02.819> top<00:03:03.630> section<00:03:03.870> off

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
is it let's peel this top section off

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.780 
is it let's peel this top section off
and<00:03:06.530> we<00:03:07.530> can<00:03:07.680> have<00:03:07.799> a<00:03:07.830> look<00:03:08.040> so<00:03:08.370> let's<00:03:08.549> just

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
and we can have a look so let's just

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.610 
and we can have a look so let's just
turn<00:03:09.030> this<00:03:09.209> on<00:03:09.420> so<00:03:09.630> it<00:03:09.959> says<00:03:10.140> we've<00:03:10.290> got<00:03:10.319> to

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
turn this on so it says we've got to

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.309 
turn this on so it says we've got to
pair<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:11.190> so<00:03:11.940> basically<00:03:12.330> at<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.840> moment<00:03:12.870> what

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
pair it so basically at the moment what

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.630 
pair it so basically at the moment what
I've<00:03:13.410> done<00:03:13.590> is<00:03:13.709> I've<00:03:13.860> installed<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.430> free

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
I've done is I've installed the free

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.270 
I've done is I've installed the free
application<00:03:15.299> on<00:03:15.450> my<00:03:16.049> iPhone<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:16.859> I'm

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
application on my iPhone and I'm

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.280 
application on my iPhone and I'm
synchronizing<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.269> vivofit<00:03:18.600> band<00:03:19.049> across

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
synchronizing the vivofit band across

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.650 
synchronizing the vivofit band across
and<00:03:19.650> it's<00:03:19.739> got<00:03:19.890> this<00:03:20.010> countdown<00:03:20.660> counting

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
and it's got this countdown counting

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.780 
and it's got this countdown counting
down<00:03:21.780> here<00:03:22.079> from<00:03:22.320> 30<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:23.400> can<00:03:23.489> see<00:03:23.670> it's

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
down here from 30 you can see it's

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.150 
down here from 30 you can see it's
counting<00:03:24.150> down<00:03:24.180> in<00:03:24.480> twos<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:25.079> as<00:03:25.590> it's<00:03:25.769> doing

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
counting down in twos and as it's doing

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.039 
counting down in twos and as it's doing
the<00:03:26.280> countdown<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.760> progress<00:03:27.450> bar<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:27.870> going

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
the countdown the progress bar is going

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.470 
the countdown the progress bar is going
across<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.530> app<00:03:28.680> now<00:03:29.280> I<00:03:29.340> had<00:03:29.609> to<00:03:29.880> put<00:03:30.180> in<00:03:30.269> some

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
across the app now I had to put in some

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.569 
across the app now I had to put in some
details<00:03:30.630> in<00:03:31.049> here<00:03:31.410> such<00:03:31.709> as<00:03:31.890> my<00:03:32.069> weight<00:03:32.370> and

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
details in here such as my weight and

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.270 
details in here such as my weight and
height<00:03:32.880> etc<00:03:33.510> I'm<00:03:33.780> hoping<00:03:34.500> that<00:03:35.040> when<00:03:35.160> the

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
height etc I'm hoping that when the

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.250 
height etc I'm hoping that when the
synchronization<00:03:36.060> is<00:03:36.150> finished<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:37.140> will

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
synchronization is finished it will

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.229 
synchronization is finished it will
actually<00:03:37.470> display<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.489> correct<00:03:38.760> time<00:03:39.030> and

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
actually display the correct time and

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.400 
actually display the correct time and
everything<00:03:39.510> as<00:03:39.630> well<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:39.989> don't<00:03:40.109> have<00:03:40.290> to

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
everything as well so don't have to

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.289 
everything as well so don't have to
enter<00:03:40.739> that<00:03:40.829> manually<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:42.090> we've<00:03:42.180> almost

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
enter that manually so we've almost

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.660 
enter that manually so we've almost
finished<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.079> setup<00:03:43.500> now<00:03:43.709> it's<00:03:44.069> almost<00:03:44.400> down

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
finished the setup now it's almost down

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.460 
finished the setup now it's almost down
to<00:03:44.700> zero<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.389> then<00:03:45.750> we<00:03:45.870> can<00:03:46.019> take<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.260> look

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
to zero and then we can take a look

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.650 
to zero and then we can take a look
through<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:47.069> various<00:03:47.819> screens<00:03:48.180> on<00:03:48.359> here<00:03:48.540> so

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
through the various screens on here so

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.280 
through the various screens on here so
it's<00:03:48.780> saying<00:03:48.930> okay<00:03:49.139> I<00:03:49.650> can<00:03:50.459> tap<00:03:50.670> done<00:03:51.170> it<00:03:52.170> would

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
it's saying okay I can tap done it would

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.440 
it's saying okay I can tap done it would
like<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.709> know<00:03:52.980> my<00:03:53.190> current<00:03:53.670> location<00:03:53.850> uh

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
like to know my current location uh

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.080 
like to know my current location uh
let's<00:03:54.840> say<00:03:55.049> no<00:03:55.290> at<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.530> moment<00:03:55.889> and<00:03:56.090> it's

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
let's say no at the moment and it's

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.890 
let's say no at the moment and it's
asking<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.780> pair<00:03:58.290> and<00:03:58.880> sync<00:03:59.880> again<00:04:00.420> oh<00:04:00.600> here<00:04:00.840> we

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
asking to pair and sync again oh here we

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.129 
asking to pair and sync again oh here we
go<00:04:00.959> syncing<00:04:01.590> with<00:04:01.950> vivofit<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:02.910> there<00:04:03.840> we<00:04:03.959> go

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
go syncing with vivofit and there we go

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.710 
go syncing with vivofit and there we go
so<00:04:04.530> it's<00:04:04.680> now<00:04:04.799> saying<00:04:05.130> zero<00:04:05.459> steps<00:04:05.910> it's

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
so it's now saying zero steps it's

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.599 
so it's now saying zero steps it's
saying<00:04:06.900> zero<00:04:07.230> steps<00:04:07.620> on<00:04:07.799> this<00:04:07.980> screen<00:04:08.250> as<00:04:08.430> well

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
saying zero steps on this screen as well

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.180 
saying zero steps on this screen as well
so<00:04:09.389> I'm<00:04:09.450> not<00:04:09.480> going<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.780> look<00:04:09.900> at<00:04:10.049> the<00:04:10.230> app<00:04:10.650> in

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
so I'm not going to look at the app in

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.860 
so I'm not going to look at the app in
this<00:04:11.400> particular<00:04:11.700> video<00:04:12.030> or<00:04:12.450> look<00:04:12.660> at<00:04:12.750> that

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
this particular video or look at that

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.690 
this particular video or look at that
while<00:04:13.049> I'm<00:04:13.200> doing<00:04:13.410> my<00:04:13.440> testing<00:04:14.010> but<00:04:14.519> let's

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
while I'm doing my testing but let's

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.150 
while I'm doing my testing but let's
just<00:04:14.970> put<00:04:15.450> that<00:04:15.569> to<00:04:15.750> one<00:04:15.870> side<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.889> just<00:04:16.919> have

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
just put that to one side and just have

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.529 
just put that to one side and just have
a<00:04:17.190> little<00:04:17.340> look<00:04:17.549> at<00:04:17.639> the<00:04:17.729> display<00:04:18.090> here<00:04:18.329> so

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
a little look at the display here so

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.479 
a little look at the display here so
it's<00:04:18.660> obviously<00:04:18.900> displaying<00:04:19.320> zero<00:04:19.650> on<00:04:20.010> the

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
it's obviously displaying zero on the

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.920 
it's obviously displaying zero on the
steps<00:04:20.820> because<00:04:21.060> we<00:04:21.180> haven't<00:04:21.330> walked<00:04:21.570> anywhere

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
steps because we haven't walked anywhere

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.010 
steps because we haven't walked anywhere
if<00:04:22.409> we<00:04:23.039> tap<00:04:23.340> once<00:04:23.640> it<00:04:24.120> displays<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.810> goal

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
if we tap once it displays the goal

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.550 
if we tap once it displays the goal
which<00:04:25.349> is<00:04:25.380> seven<00:04:25.800> thousand<00:04:26.220> five

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
which is seven thousand five

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.140 
which is seven thousand five
hundred<00:04:26.800> steps<00:04:27.070> I'm<00:04:27.310> assuming<00:04:27.669> we<00:04:27.760> can<00:04:27.910> change

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
hundred steps I'm assuming we can change

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.200 
hundred steps I'm assuming we can change
this<00:04:28.450> and<00:04:29.320> then<00:04:29.560> tap<00:04:29.830> again<00:04:30.130> I've<00:04:30.430> done<00:04:30.760> zero

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
this and then tap again I've done zero

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.680 
this and then tap again I've done zero
miles<00:04:31.860> tap<00:04:32.860> again<00:04:33.160> I<00:04:33.310> have<00:04:33.850> burned<00:04:34.150> thirteen

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
miles tap again I have burned thirteen

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.540 
miles tap again I have burned thirteen
hundred<00:04:35.080> and<00:04:35.110> twenty<00:04:35.500> six<00:04:35.650> calories<00:04:36.130> just<00:04:36.160> by

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
hundred and twenty six calories just by

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.750 
hundred and twenty six calories just by
setting<00:04:36.790> this<00:04:37.060> device<00:04:37.389> up<00:04:37.630> I<00:04:37.900> joke<00:04:38.530> tap<00:04:39.490> again

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
setting this device up I joke tap again

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.640 
setting this device up I joke tap again
and<00:04:39.940> it<00:04:40.300> displays<00:04:40.690> the<00:04:40.870> current<00:04:41.080> time<00:04:41.410> which

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
and it displays the current time which

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.400 
and it displays the current time which
is<00:04:41.800> indeed<00:04:42.100> five<00:04:42.639> sixteen<00:04:43.180> and<00:04:43.360> then<00:04:44.050> tap

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
is indeed five sixteen and then tap

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.400 
is indeed five sixteen and then tap
again<00:04:44.710> it<00:04:44.950> displays<00:04:45.310> the<00:04:45.460> date<00:04:45.910> and<00:04:46.410> it

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
again it displays the date and it

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.750 
again it displays the date and it
actually<00:04:47.560> flicks<00:04:48.040> back<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.460> the<00:04:48.550> time

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
actually flicks back to the time

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.120 
actually flicks back to the time
automatically<00:04:49.419> so<00:04:50.169> if<00:04:50.230> we<00:04:50.350> tap<00:04:50.560> again<00:04:50.830> quickly

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
automatically so if we tap again quickly

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.340 
automatically so if we tap again quickly
it<00:04:51.550> cycles<00:04:51.970> background<00:04:52.540> to<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:53.050> steps

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
it cycles background to the steps

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.730 
it cycles background to the steps
completed<00:04:53.639> so<00:04:54.639> it<00:04:54.700> seems<00:04:55.030> like<00:04:55.210> when<00:04:55.900> you<00:04:56.350> come

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
completed so it seems like when you come

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.900 
completed so it seems like when you come
off<00:04:56.950> of<00:04:57.130> the<00:04:57.220> time

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
off of the time

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.670 
off of the time
let's<00:04:58.180> just<00:04:58.360> try<00:04:58.510> that<00:04:58.690> once<00:04:58.840> more<00:04:59.139> on<00:04:59.290> display

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
let's just try that once more on display

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.370 
let's just try that once more on display
the<00:04:59.830> date<00:05:00.040> it<00:05:01.000> automatically<00:05:01.600> goes<00:05:01.840> back<00:05:02.139> to

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
the date it automatically goes back to

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.990 
the date it automatically goes back to
displaying<00:05:02.830> the<00:05:02.979> time<00:05:03.190> now<00:05:03.820> I'm<00:05:03.910> assuming

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
displaying the time now I'm assuming

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.820 
displaying the time now I'm assuming
within<00:05:04.600> the<00:05:04.720> settings<00:05:05.110> here<00:05:05.350> we<00:05:05.470> can<00:05:05.590> change

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
within the settings here we can change

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.950 
within the settings here we can change
you<00:05:05.919> to<00:05:06.040> 24<00:05:06.610> hour<00:05:06.790> or<00:05:07.240> I'll<00:05:07.360> let<00:05:07.540> you<00:05:07.660> know<00:05:07.750> that

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
you to 24 hour or I'll let you know that

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.840 
you to 24 hour or I'll let you know that
in<00:05:08.080> my<00:05:08.229> full<00:05:08.440> review<00:05:08.650> as<00:05:08.860> well<00:05:09.040> but<00:05:09.610> what<00:05:09.760> I'm

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
in my full review as well but what I'm

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
in my full review as well but what I'm
going<00:05:09.970> to<00:05:10.030> do<00:05:10.150> over<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:10.389> next<00:05:10.419> couple<00:05:10.630> of

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
going to do over the next couple of

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.810 
going to do over the next couple of
weeks<00:05:10.930> is<00:05:11.229> actually<00:05:11.380> wear<00:05:11.710> this<00:05:11.919> alongside<00:05:12.310> my

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
weeks is actually wear this alongside my

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.440 
weeks is actually wear this alongside my
Fitbit<00:05:13.240> flex<00:05:13.419> and<00:05:13.900> see<00:05:14.590> how<00:05:14.800> this<00:05:14.979> performs<00:05:15.580> so

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
Fitbit flex and see how this performs so

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.110 
Fitbit flex and see how this performs so
at<00:05:17.020> the<00:05:17.290> moment<00:05:17.830> that<00:05:18.040> is<00:05:18.190> my<00:05:18.400> unboxing<00:05:18.760> and

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
at the moment that is my unboxing and

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.800 
at the moment that is my unboxing and
first<00:05:19.300> look<00:05:19.600> at<00:05:19.900> the<00:05:20.320> vivofit<00:05:21.300> from<00:05:22.300> Garmin<00:05:22.720> it

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
first look at the vivofit from Garmin it

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.200 
first look at the vivofit from Garmin it
looks<00:05:23.020> really<00:05:23.290> nice<00:05:23.440> the<00:05:23.830> the<00:05:24.700> actual<00:05:25.000> feel<00:05:25.180> of

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
looks really nice the the actual feel of

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.510 
looks really nice the the actual feel of
this<00:05:25.450> is<00:05:25.600> very<00:05:26.080> good<00:05:26.169> indeed<00:05:26.680> very<00:05:26.979> similar

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
this is very good indeed very similar

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.550 
this is very good indeed very similar
band<00:05:27.760> similar<00:05:28.479> adjustment<00:05:29.080> and<00:05:29.200> everything

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
band similar adjustment and everything

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.830 
band similar adjustment and everything
my<00:05:30.130> only<00:05:30.340> concern<00:05:30.760> is<00:05:30.789> obviously<00:05:31.150> the<00:05:31.450> battery

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
my only concern is obviously the battery
