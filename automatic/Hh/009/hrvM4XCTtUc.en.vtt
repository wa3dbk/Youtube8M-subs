 a friend of my group is good and they 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.070
 I bring a texture package to review 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.110
 that I liked a lot and good in the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.480
 description of the video is the link of the 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.580
 creator is the forum where is the 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.140
 texture of the creator and if my 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.000
 download link then download 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.739
 from the creator's forum everything is in the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.930
 description and I also leave a video 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.480
 how to install it along with that video 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.770
 is the updated blog video 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.980
 lancer but where they are installed 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.390
 textures then enter there or in that video 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.770
 that I leave then right there I leave the link 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.719
 of all updated not all are the 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.760
 description of the video so that they are 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.109
 asking and well also many black 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.670
 I can not have a tumaco to make a 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:52.559
 review of textures and all because I already 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.789
 I went up then if you can use it there's no 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.710
 no problem is and that's why I went up 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.940
 to have it done and you have 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.350
 that something happens to them if I'm not going to leave them 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.120
 use it but good here we are 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.920
 we started with the adornment blocks of 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.329
 home I do not know why the bed you see 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.640
 like it was good it seems that it does not 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.620
 has a place a larger tablecloth than 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.050
 another tablecloth now a stem 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.120
 the piece of so to speak a sheet 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.380
 a bedspread I do not know how they say more 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.659
 insane that another one here has a 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.040
 effect or maybe the window not seen 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.020
 good but good 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.750
 the oven 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.370
 in the craft box the rest in the cutter 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.820
 that has something weird texture 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.560
 what is the 98 putting the name the 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.930
 animals that look normal, I think 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.000
 good the cow the cow and the pig I think 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.270
 that only also if the rest has what 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.890
 same 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.630
 excuse me if I'm in a fucking wagon that 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.730
 is happening screaming for it 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.770
 but good thing is that that fucking car of 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.570
 announcements like the sea shit we're going to see 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.000
 to the zombies to see what's good here 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.020
 are the spiders are on this side there are 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.109
 what assholes today 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.880
 but well there are no good spiders in this 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:55.729
 at this moment there is no and there is no 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.079
 Monsters forgive excuse the demo what 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.490
 I feel but good that later in mode 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.159
 passive and the monsters were eliminated 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.069
 here the only ones are SMEs 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.899
 I think that they should be the only ones 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.819
 they are alone because if they generate 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.560
 automatically but they look the same I think 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.120
 that all the snot look the same but 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.700
 good from there to there we have the others 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.250
 blocks as to the door if you're already 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.799
 who is here with the glass windows 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.890
 or the sponge the level reactor that has 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:27.290
 rare texture is rare to see it reactor 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.700
 nothing with the refrigerator act with texture the 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:34.160
 ops in the network are the mats as their 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.680
 respective wool blocks all 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.360
 removable minerals that are here 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.019
 together with coal the tnt in the 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.360
 stairs the cobweb and this is low 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.069
 for javier from a green straw all the 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.750
 stone blocks together with quartz 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.910
 and the snow that is here stone 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.590
 quartz wooden blocks that look 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.470
 very very well I liked this this 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.150
 it seems like a guy I do not know if it seems 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.670
 that was riveted nails 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.049
 very good effect bricks all kinds of 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.680
 sand 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:06.079
 the stone of 5 the mother stone so I 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.780
 I call obsidian the blocks of 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.790
 neder the bricks of neverland was 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.480
 and the 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.189
 the bricks on the stairway 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.439
 brick or a brick step 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:20.150
 step of if it is not already I do not remember 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.879
 step of which is foreign I remember the 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.170
 truth of praia the key and the gravel and 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.290
 well here we see the ones that are 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.150
 Finally, the saplings and the trees 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.680
 the little pigs here are a round and if 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.069
 they realize this texture package has 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.060
 like a little or it makes you a little bit more 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.280
 transparent the leaves I do not know if they give 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.840
 but look how it does not have almost 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.090
 very bushy as it is not your 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.010
 spirituality of leaves and it looks more or 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.599
 pierces the visibility through 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.040
 the leaves do not tell us how to say but good 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.099
 nor because then here are the others 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.959
 things the plants and then the fire and everything 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.250
 this is an extra 16 x 16 package as well 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.689
 that has no book forgive for the 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.750
 monsters but I forgot to have to 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:58.220
 install the package the map to be able to 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.230
 have the monsters or what is 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.280

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.099
 liked because texture all the 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.489
