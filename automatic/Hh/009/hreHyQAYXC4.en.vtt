back up to the top floor which is the
starting<00:00:44.120> room<00:00:44.360> so<00:00:45.170> one<00:00:45.620> should<00:00:45.650> appear<00:00:46.130> I

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
starting room so one should appear I

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.780 
starting room so one should appear I
look<00:00:47.360> around<00:00:47.690> for<00:00:47.930> other<00:00:48.020> parts<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:49.100> parts<00:00:49.370> in

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
look around for other parts the parts in

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.000 
look around for other parts the parts in
this<00:00:49.910> video<00:00:50.180> may<00:00:50.480> vary<00:00:50.810> so<00:00:51.470> there<00:00:51.860> you<00:00:51.980> go

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
this video may vary so there you go

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.500 
this video may vary so there you go
that's<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:52.430> second<00:00:52.760> part<00:00:52.910> which<00:00:53.060> is<00:00:53.120> the<00:00:53.300> red

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
that's the second part which is the red

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.510 
that's the second part which is the red
flag<00:00:53.810> and<00:00:54.079> then<00:00:54.560> you<00:00:54.710> want<00:00:54.829> to<00:00:54.890> go<00:00:55.010> to<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.280> same

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
flag and then you want to go to the same

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.790 
flag and then you want to go to the same
route<00:00:55.790> do<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.270> same<00:00:56.510> drop<00:00:56.780> again<00:00:56.930> go<00:00:57.560> to<00:00:57.620> the

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
route do the same drop again go to the

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.890 
route do the same drop again go to the
craft<00:00:58.010> invention<00:00:58.550> add<00:00:58.730> that<00:00:58.940> part<00:00:59.150> starts<00:00:59.540> two

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
craft invention add that part starts two

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.550 
craft invention add that part starts two
parts<00:01:00.320> of<00:01:00.410> four<00:01:01.360> so<00:01:02.360> as<00:01:02.899> I<00:01:02.960> said<00:01:03.110> these

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
parts of four so as I said these

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.679 
parts of four so as I said these
locations<00:01:04.309> of<00:01:04.460> these<00:01:04.610> may<00:01:04.850> vary<00:01:05.149> but<00:01:05.390> this<00:01:05.540> is

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
locations of these may vary but this is

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.109 
locations of these may vary but this is
just<00:01:05.720> how<00:01:06.020> I<00:01:06.049> found<00:01:06.409> them<00:01:06.680> this<00:01:07.340> is<00:01:07.549> like<00:01:07.729> there

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
just how I found them this is like there

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.539 
just how I found them this is like there
are<00:01:08.329> certain<00:01:09.020> sets<00:01:09.380> of<00:01:09.619> locations<00:01:10.250> where<00:01:10.460> you

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
are certain sets of locations where you

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.760 
are certain sets of locations where you
can<00:01:10.670> find<00:01:10.850> them<00:01:11.090> so<00:01:11.360> this<00:01:11.930> set<00:01:12.259> will<00:01:12.439> be<00:01:12.500> the

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
can find them so this set will be the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.679 
can find them so this set will be the
same<00:01:12.979> as<00:01:13.220> another<00:01:13.759> set<00:01:14.240> where<00:01:14.389> they're<00:01:14.539> all

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
same as another set where they're all

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.080 
same as another set where they're all
near<00:01:15.109> the<00:01:15.259> first<00:01:15.439> room<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:16.310> then<00:01:16.460> they'll<00:01:16.909> be

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
near the first room and then they'll be

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.419 
near the first room and then they'll be
scattered<00:01:17.539> around<00:01:17.659> over<00:01:18.350> rooms<00:01:18.590> so<00:01:19.159> that's

00:01:19.419 --> 00:01:19.429 
scattered around over rooms so that's

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:21.999 
scattered around over rooms so that's
the<00:01:19.549> third<00:01:19.729> part<00:01:20.030> this<00:01:20.149> is<00:01:20.299> like<00:01:20.450> a<00:01:20.479> wind<00:01:21.170> pushy

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
the third part this is like a wind pushy

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.559 
the third part this is like a wind pushy
thing<00:01:22.340> I<00:01:22.460> can't<00:01:22.670> remember<00:01:22.909> the<00:01:22.999> exact<00:01:23.389> name

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
thing I can't remember the exact name

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:25.449 
thing I can't remember the exact name
for<00:01:23.780> it<00:01:23.869> but<00:01:24.469> once<00:01:24.649> you<00:01:24.740> grab<00:01:24.950> this<00:01:25.100> drop<00:01:25.429> down

00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:25.459 
for it but once you grab this drop down

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:28.029 
for it but once you grab this drop down
again<00:01:25.999> added<00:01:26.509> to<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.749> actual<00:01:27.229> bench<00:01:27.770> and

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
again added to the actual bench and

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.609 
again added to the actual bench and
that's<00:01:28.189> part<00:01:28.490> 3<00:01:28.729> or<00:01:28.909> 4<00:01:29.270> feet<00:01:29.990> trample<00:01:30.499> steam

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
that's part 3 or 4 feet trample steam

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.999 
that's part 3 or 4 feet trample steam
and<00:01:31.039> then<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:31.759> next<00:01:31.939> bar<00:01:32.450> is<00:01:32.749> the<00:01:32.990> battery<00:01:33.770> for

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
and then the next bar is the battery for

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.580 
and then the next bar is the battery for
it<00:01:34.100> and<00:01:34.280> I<00:01:34.549> found<00:01:34.789> this<00:01:35.060> near<00:01:35.539> the<00:01:36.079> front<00:01:36.409> room

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
it and I found this near the front room

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.010 
it and I found this near the front room
to<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:37.100> left<00:01:37.280> side<00:01:37.549> it's<00:01:38.240> just<00:01:38.450> on<00:01:38.569> this<00:01:38.749> edge

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
to the left side it's just on this edge

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.529 
to the left side it's just on this edge
it's<00:01:39.350> a<00:01:39.469> battery<00:01:39.829> I<00:01:39.920> think<00:01:40.189> it<00:01:40.310> is<00:01:40.429> so<00:01:41.119> once

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
it's a battery I think it is so once

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.690 
it's a battery I think it is so once
you've<00:01:41.689> got<00:01:41.810> that<00:01:41.840> I<00:01:42.259> run<00:01:43.039> back<00:01:43.219> down<00:01:43.279> to<00:01:43.670> the

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
you've got that I run back down to the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.330 
you've got that I run back down to the
bench<00:01:44.119> drop<00:01:44.630> down<00:01:44.840> on<00:01:44.959> the<00:01:45.079> edge<00:01:45.200> and<00:01:45.529> remember

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
bench drop down on the edge and remember

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.730 
bench drop down on the edge and remember
do<00:01:46.639> not<00:01:46.670> run<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.119> slowly<00:01:47.749> walk<00:01:48.079> and<00:01:48.380> drop<00:01:48.560> off

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
do not run to slowly walk and drop off

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.109 
do not run to slowly walk and drop off
and<00:01:48.979> you<00:01:49.039> should<00:01:49.189> fall<00:01:49.520> through<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:49.909> rocks

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
and you should fall through the rocks

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.660 
and you should fall through the rocks
anyway<00:01:50.450> add<00:01:51.229> this<00:01:51.469> to<00:01:51.709> it<00:01:51.740> and<00:01:52.039> that<00:01:52.279> is<00:01:52.399> part

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
anyway add this to it and that is part

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.089 
anyway add this to it and that is part
for<00:01:52.999> the<00:01:53.270> trample<00:01:53.689> steam<00:01:53.779> as<00:01:54.349> you<00:01:54.649> can<00:01:54.709> see<00:01:54.889> I

00:01:55.089 --> 00:01:55.099 
for the trample steam as you can see I

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:57.190 
for the trample steam as you can see I
pick<00:01:55.279> it<00:01:55.399> up<00:01:55.549> and<00:01:56.149> then<00:01:56.240> you<00:01:56.389> set<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:56.749> up<00:01:56.779> and

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
pick it up and then you set you up and

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.289 
pick it up and then you set you up and
it's<00:01:57.319> slowly<00:01:57.649> but<00:01:57.979> surely<00:01:58.340> lowers<00:01:58.700> down<00:01:58.729> and

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
it's slowly but surely lowers down and

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.480 
it's slowly but surely lowers down and
then<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.659> red<00:01:59.959> flag<00:02:00.259> raised<00:02:00.590> is<00:02:00.889> an<00:02:01.130> exit

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
then the red flag raised is an exit

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.819 
then the red flag raised is an exit
dinging<00:02:01.819> noise<00:02:02.029> when<00:02:02.359> it's<00:02:02.509> ready<00:02:02.749> so<00:02:03.529> that<00:02:03.709> is

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
dinging noise when it's ready so that is

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.949 
dinging noise when it's ready so that is
when<00:02:03.979> it's<00:02:04.130> active<00:02:04.670> active<00:02:05.359> and<00:02:05.569> you<00:02:05.659> can<00:02:05.840> just

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:05.959 
when it's active active and you can just

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.959 
when it's active active and you can just
jump<00:02:06.139> on<00:02:06.289> it<00:02:06.409> here<00:02:06.590> walk<00:02:06.979> onto<00:02:07.189> it<00:02:07.429> i'll<00:02:07.669> fling

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
jump on it here walk onto it i'll fling

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.510 
jump on it here walk onto it i'll fling
it<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.240> wherever<00:02:08.420> you<00:02:09.050> like<00:02:09.649> desire<00:02:10.039> whatever

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
it to wherever you like desire whatever

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.610 
it to wherever you like desire whatever
you<00:02:10.789> point<00:02:11.060> it<00:02:11.180> towards<00:02:11.660> that<00:02:12.260> is<00:02:12.380> where<00:02:12.530> you

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
you point it towards that is where you

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.699 
you point it towards that is where you
will<00:02:12.740> land<00:02:13.540> so<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:14.840> actual<00:02:15.230> trample<00:02:15.620> steam

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
will land so this actual trample steam

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.770 
will land so this actual trample steam
is<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.069> really<00:02:16.400> good<00:02:16.550> tactic<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.150> use<00:02:17.300> it<00:02:17.599> can

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
is a really good tactic to use it can

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.630 
is a really good tactic to use it can
kill<00:02:18.140> zombies<00:02:18.560> with<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:18.799> just<00:02:18.950> like<00:02:19.069> that<00:02:19.189> and

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
kill zombies with it just like that and

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.819 
kill zombies with it just like that and
you<00:02:20.030> can<00:02:20.180> get<00:02:20.299> to<00:02:20.450> over<00:02:20.689> buildings<00:02:21.140> across<00:02:21.590> the

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
you can get to over buildings across the

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.620 
you can get to over buildings across the
map<00:02:22.010> so<00:02:22.310> like<00:02:22.700> this<00:02:23.060> is<00:02:23.120> an<00:02:23.390> air

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
map so like this is an air

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.990 
map so like this is an air
which<00:02:23.900> can<00:02:24.110> drop<00:02:24.320> down<00:02:24.500> sir<00:02:24.770> and<00:02:24.980> then<00:02:25.640> I

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
which can drop down sir and then I

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.120 
which can drop down sir and then I
settled<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.870> trample<00:02:27.290> steam<00:02:27.380> here<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:28.010> this

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
settled the trample steam here and this

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.130 
settled the trample steam here and this
was<00:02:28.370> just<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.700> test<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:29.150> didn't<00:02:29.420> think<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:29.930> could

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
was just a test I didn't think you could

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.910 
was just a test I didn't think you could
do<00:02:30.410> this<00:02:30.650> but<00:02:31.430> as<00:02:31.870> like<00:02:32.870> most<00:02:33.110> people<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:33.530> tested

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
do this but as like most people I tested

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.110 
do this but as like most people I tested
this<00:02:34.040> out<00:02:34.220> just<00:02:34.490> to<00:02:34.610> see<00:02:34.760> if<00:02:34.850> he<00:02:34.940> actually

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
this out just to see if he actually

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.660 
this out just to see if he actually
worked<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:35.960> i<00:02:36.470> set<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:36.920> trample<00:02:37.250> steam<00:02:37.340> or

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
worked so i set the trample steam or

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.490 
worked so i set the trample steam or
wait<00:02:38.000> for<00:02:38.210> it<00:02:38.300> to<00:02:38.330> do<00:02:38.570> it<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:38.900> then<00:02:39.050> it<00:02:39.230> flings

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
wait for it to do it and then it flings

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.440 
wait for it to do it and then it flings
me<00:02:39.680> over<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.160> other<00:02:40.250> building<00:02:40.370> if<00:02:41.090> this

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
me over to the other building if this

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.210
