this<00:01:56.420> is<00:01:56.780> not<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:57.050> same<00:01:57.320> scar<00:01:57.680> as<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.220> one<00:01:58.400> in

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
this is not the same scar as the one in

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.850 
this is not the same scar as the one in
mono<00:01:58.730> or<00:01:58.940> four<00:01:59.150> -<00:01:59.360> it<00:01:59.600> is<00:01:59.960> not<00:02:00.110> even<00:02:00.410> an<00:02:00.530> assault

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
mono or four - it is not even an assault

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.100 
mono or four - it is not even an assault
rifle<00:02:00.950> it's<00:02:01.400> actually<00:02:01.730> an<00:02:01.790> SMG<00:02:02.180> in<00:02:02.720> this<00:02:03.200> game

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
rifle it's actually an SMG in this game

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.140 
rifle it's actually an SMG in this game
there's<00:02:06.400> a<00:02:07.400> scar<00:02:07.730> so<00:02:07.760> rifle<00:02:08.479> SMG<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:10.000> if<00:02:11.000> I

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
there's a scar so rifle SMG and if I

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.670 
there's a scar so rifle SMG and if I
remember<00:02:11.300> correctly<00:02:11.810> I<00:02:11.900> think<00:02:12.020> there's<00:02:12.440> one

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
remember correctly I think there's one

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.110 
remember correctly I think there's one
for<00:02:13.070> a<00:02:13.550> light<00:02:14.000> machine<00:02:14.330> guns<00:02:14.540> -<00:02:14.810> but<00:02:16.120> correct

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
for a light machine guns - but correct

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.870 
for a light machine guns - but correct
me<00:02:17.240> if<00:02:17.390> I'm<00:02:17.540> wrong<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:18.110> don't<00:02:18.170> know<00:02:18.520> so<00:02:19.520> anyway

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
me if I'm wrong I don't know so anyway

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.350 
me if I'm wrong I don't know so anyway
so<00:02:19.940> this<00:02:20.690> is<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.920> scar<00:02:22.430> which<00:02:22.820> is<00:02:23.030> in<00:02:23.240> the

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
so this is the scar which is in the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.050 
so this is the scar which is in the
engineer<00:02:23.870> class<00:02:24.020> there's<00:02:24.620> assault<00:02:25.100> which<00:02:25.880> is

helicopters and tanks rather than for
people<00:03:32.870> which<00:03:33.590> I<00:03:33.800> learned<00:03:34.570> just<00:03:35.570> right<00:03:35.750> here

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
people which I learned just right here

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.259 
people which I learned just right here
after<00:03:36.560> shooting<00:03:37.070> right<00:03:37.519> at<00:03:37.550> somebody's<00:03:38.060> face

yeah so use this game for small maps
which<00:03:44.000> is<00:03:44.510> really<00:03:45.290> a<00:03:45.320> big<00:03:45.650> map<00:03:45.830> in<00:03:46.100> mountain

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
which is really a big map in mountain

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.880 
which is really a big map in mountain
warfare<00:03:46.459> too<00:03:46.820> so<00:03:47.239> you<00:03:47.989> have<00:03:48.050> to<00:03:48.260> really<00:03:48.410> play

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
you say what's the point of the silencer

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.339 
you say what's the point of the silencer
it<00:05:17.610> doesn't<00:05:17.940> decrease<00:05:18.060> damage<00:05:18.690> it<00:05:18.990> doesn't<00:05:19.229> do

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:19.349 
it doesn't decrease damage it doesn't do

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:21.950 
it doesn't decrease damage it doesn't do
any<00:05:19.500> of<00:05:19.590> that<00:05:19.710> the<00:05:20.039> only<00:05:20.340> I<00:05:21.090> guess<00:05:21.389> advantage

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
any of that the only I guess advantage

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.640 
any of that the only I guess advantage
to<00:05:22.320> the<00:05:22.410> silencer<00:05:22.860> is<00:05:24.050> indicated<00:05:25.050> the<00:05:25.229> muzzle

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
to the silencer is indicated the muzzle

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.710 
to the silencer is indicated the muzzle
flash<00:05:25.789> yeah<00:05:26.789> the<00:05:27.000> most<00:05:27.150> fun<00:05:27.389> that's<00:05:27.599> where

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
flash yeah the most fun that's where

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.250 
flash yeah the most fun that's where
song<00:05:28.070> decreases<00:05:29.070> the<00:05:29.220> muzzle<00:05:29.550> flash<00:05:29.580> to

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
song decreases the muzzle flash to

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.580 
song decreases the muzzle flash to
basically<00:05:31.260> nothing<00:05:31.740> rather<00:05:32.130> than<00:05:32.400> other<00:05:32.699> guns

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
basically nothing rather than other guns

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.820 
basically nothing rather than other guns
so<00:05:34.590> for<00:05:35.310> example<00:05:35.760> if<00:05:35.940> you<00:05:36.060> shot<00:05:36.330> some<00:05:36.599> an<00:05:37.410> enemy

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
so for example if you shot some an enemy

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.170 
so for example if you shot some an enemy
teammate<00:05:38.250> and<00:05:38.520> then<00:05:38.910> there<00:05:39.060> was<00:05:39.150> another

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
teammate and then there was another

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.960 
teammate and then there was another
enemy<00:05:39.810> right<00:05:40.320> near<00:05:40.560> him<00:05:40.800> and<00:05:41.039> he<00:05:41.580> saw<00:05:41.789> his

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
enemy right near him and he saw his

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.730 
enemy right near him and he saw his
teammate<00:05:42.449> died<00:05:42.599> he<00:05:43.020> wouldn't<00:05:43.349> know<00:05:43.470> where<00:05:43.650> you

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
teammate died he wouldn't know where you

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.850 
teammate died he wouldn't know where you
are<00:05:43.770> because<00:05:44.370> not<00:05:45.120> only<00:05:45.150> is<00:05:45.479> the<00:05:45.660> gun<00:05:46.590> the

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
are because not only is the gun the

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.310 
are because not only is the gun the
sound<00:05:47.130> is<00:05:47.340> so<00:05:47.520> quiet<00:05:47.820> on<00:05:48.150> its<00:05:48.389> own<00:05:48.570> but<00:05:49.199> also

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
sound is so quiet on its own but also

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.520 
sound is so quiet on its own but also
the<00:05:49.590> flash<00:05:49.889> is<00:05:50.250> basically<00:05:51.240> invisible<00:05:51.539> so<00:05:52.440> you

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
the flash is basically invisible so you

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.480 
the flash is basically invisible so you
can<00:05:52.800> really<00:05:53.070> be<00:05:53.220> a<00:05:53.250> stealth<00:05:54.120> clown<00:05:55.340> for<00:05:56.340> those

it's<00:06:06.050> too<00:06:06.620> big<00:06:06.889> of<00:06:07.070> an<00:06:07.190> advantage<00:06:07.720> else<00:06:08.720> I

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
it's too big of an advantage else I

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.400 
it's too big of an advantage else I
think<00:06:09.889> of<00:06:09.979> it<00:06:10.100> as<00:06:10.280> almost<00:06:11.000> pointless<00:06:11.479> but<00:06:12.259> it

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
think of it as almost pointless but it

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.520 
think of it as almost pointless but it
just<00:06:12.530> looks<00:06:12.770> cool<00:06:13.040> and<00:06:13.430> if<00:06:14.270> a<00:06:14.570> if<00:06:15.080> your<00:06:15.289> close

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
just looks cool and if a if your close

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.960 
just looks cool and if a if your close
quarter<00:06:15.860> combat<00:06:15.889> and<00:06:16.460> there's<00:06:16.580> a<00:06:16.669> bunch<00:06:16.850> of

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
quarter combat and there's a bunch of

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.090 
quarter combat and there's a bunch of
people<00:06:17.360> and<00:06:17.900> other<00:06:18.320> people<00:06:18.710> don't<00:06:18.830> know<00:06:18.979> who

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
people and other people don't know who

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.400 
people and other people don't know who
you<00:06:19.220> are<00:06:19.370> well<00:06:19.880> I<00:06:19.910> guess<00:06:20.240> it's<00:06:20.419> worth<00:06:20.600> it<00:06:20.840> it

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
you are well I guess it's worth it it

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.140 
you are well I guess it's worth it it
just<00:06:21.560> depends<00:06:22.070> on<00:06:22.100> the<00:06:22.220> person<00:06:22.250> and<00:06:22.759> they're

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
just depends on the person and they're

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.129 
just depends on the person and they're
placed<00:06:23.389> on<00:06:23.600> how<00:06:23.840> they<00:06:24.020> play<00:06:24.310> so<00:06:25.310> um<00:06:25.550> yeah<00:06:26.389> so

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:27.139 
placed on how they play so um yeah so

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:32.710 
placed on how they play so um yeah so
moving<00:06:27.620> on<00:06:27.770> I<00:06:28.070> use<00:06:28.789> this<00:06:29.770> telescope<00:06:30.770> of<00:06:31.720> death

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 
moving on I use this telescope of death

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.779 
moving on I use this telescope of death
I<00:06:33.139> would<00:06:33.650> call<00:06:33.889> it<00:06:35.710> to<00:06:36.710> seek<00:06:37.100> out<00:06:37.250> I<00:06:37.460> don't

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:37.789 
I would call it to seek out I don't

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:39.850 
I would call it to seek out I don't
really<00:06:37.940> I<00:06:38.330> don't<00:06:38.449> really<00:06:38.570> use<00:06:38.840> it<00:06:38.870> to<00:06:39.560> get

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
really I don't really use it to get

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.100 
really I don't really use it to get
kills<00:06:40.160> but<00:06:40.550> rather<00:06:40.729> just<00:06:41.090> to<00:06:41.270> know<00:06:41.449> where<00:06:41.750> the

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
kills but rather just to know where the

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.950 
kills but rather just to know where the
enemy<00:06:42.260> is<00:06:42.470> located<00:06:43.460> so<00:06:44.060> you<00:06:44.090> see<00:06:44.419> somebody

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 
enemy is located so you see somebody

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.719 
enemy is located so you see somebody
pops<00:06:45.289> out<00:06:45.560> of<00:06:45.710> the<00:06:45.800> crate<00:06:46.100> right<00:06:46.130> over<00:06:46.490> there

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:46.729 
pops out of the crate right over there

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:49.540 
pops out of the crate right over there
so<00:06:47.360> I<00:06:47.389> go<00:06:47.720> out<00:06:47.930> try<00:06:48.350> and<00:06:48.470> get<00:06:48.590> him<00:06:48.740> I<00:06:48.830> get<00:06:49.070> in<00:06:49.250> but

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
so I go out try and get him I get in but

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.010 
so I go out try and get him I get in but
one<00:06:49.699> of<00:06:49.820> his<00:06:49.910> teammates<00:06:50.270> shoots<00:06:50.690> me<00:06:50.870> in<00:06:50.900> the

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
one of his teammates shoots me in the

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.050 
one of his teammates shoots me in the
back<00:06:51.199> so<00:06:52.130> yeah

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:53.060 
back so yeah

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.550 
back so yeah
teammates<00:06:53.539> in<00:06:53.750> this<00:06:53.870> game<00:06:54.139> they're<00:06:54.410> usually

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560

teammates in this game they're usually
cluttered<00:06:55.190> up<00:06:55.340> rather<00:06:56.150> than<00:06:56.270> spread<00:06:56.720> out<00:06:56.870> so

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:57.410 
cluttered up rather than spread out so

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.189 
cluttered up rather than spread out so

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:24.169 
try and pick people people off across

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:28.060 
try and pick people people off across
the<00:07:24.580> rail<00:07:25.580> railings<00:07:26.210> but<00:07:26.780> I<00:07:27.229> do<00:07:27.590> get<00:07:27.800> a<00:07:27.860> few

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:28.070 
the rail railings but I do get a few

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.820 
the rail railings but I do get a few
kills<00:07:28.310> here<00:07:28.849> but<00:07:29.090> later<00:07:29.300> on<00:07:29.389> I<00:07:29.570> do<00:07:29.810> get<00:07:30.349> picked

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:30.830 
kills here but later on I do get picked

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:36.159 
kills here but later on I do get picked
off<00:07:31.330> because<00:07:34.090> people<00:07:35.090> in<00:07:35.150> this<00:07:35.240> game<00:07:35.479> blend<00:07:35.870> so

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:36.169 
off because people in this game blend so

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:38.290 
off because people in this game blend so
well<00:07:36.349> in<00:07:36.710> the<00:07:37.130> environment<00:07:37.699> so<00:07:37.940> it's<00:07:38.090> kind<00:07:38.270> of

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:38.300 
well in the environment so it's kind of

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.080 
well in the environment so it's kind of
hard<00:07:38.449> to<00:07:38.570> tell<00:07:38.810> the<00:07:39.470> location<00:07:39.949> of<00:07:40.099> people<00:07:40.460> so

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:41.090 
hard to tell the location of people so

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:42.370 
hard to tell the location of people so
you're<00:07:41.210> gonna<00:07:41.360> have<00:07:41.510> to<00:07:41.599> watch<00:07:41.780> out<00:07:42.050> for<00:07:42.080> that

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:42.380 
you're gonna have to watch out for that

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:47.140 
you're gonna have to watch out for that
so<00:07:43.250> give<00:07:43.760> my<00:07:43.960> submachine<00:07:44.960> gun<00:07:45.169> pin<00:07:46.090> trying<00:07:47.090> to

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:47.150 
so give my submachine gun pin trying to

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.330 
so give my submachine gun pin trying to
get<00:07:47.270> more<00:07:47.479> of<00:07:47.570> those<00:07:47.750> the<00:07:48.349> whole<00:07:48.560> purpose<00:07:48.860> of

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:49.340 
get more of those the whole purpose of

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.390 
get more of those the whole purpose of

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.400 
using the engineer class gonna rack up

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.180 
using the engineer class gonna rack up
points<00:07:52.430> trying<00:07:53.120> to<00:07:53.240> get<00:07:53.990> platinum<00:07:54.440> stars<00:07:54.770> on
