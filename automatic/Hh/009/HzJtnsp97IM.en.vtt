00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
to ask that question next how much

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.520 
to ask that question next how much
longer<00:03:59.030> does<00:03:59.239> it<00:03:59.359> last<00:03:59.480> what's<00:03:59.810> the<00:03:59.959> economy

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
longer does it last what's the economy

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.860 
longer does it last what's the economy
mode<00:04:00.739> though<00:04:01.010> that's<00:04:01.280> an

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
mode though that's an

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.930 
mode though that's an
more<00:04:02.019> well<00:04:02.500> economy<00:04:03.010> mo<00:04:03.159> is<00:04:03.340> that<00:04:03.549> when<00:04:03.700> you

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
more well economy mo is that when you

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.880 
more well economy mo is that when you
are<00:04:04.180> let's<00:04:04.629> say<00:04:04.720> a<00:04:04.989> lot<00:04:05.170> when<00:04:05.349> you're<00:04:05.470> using<00:04:05.650> a

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
are let's say a lot when you're using a

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.949 
are let's say a lot when you're using a
projector<00:04:06.069> a<00:04:06.459> lot<00:04:06.670> of<00:04:06.790> times<00:04:07.030> and<00:04:07.330> you<00:04:07.390> wanted

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
projector a lot of times and you wanted

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.869 
projector a lot of times and you wanted
to<00:04:08.140> power<00:04:08.379> it<00:04:08.560> down<00:04:08.680> to<00:04:08.920> you<00:04:09.040> maybe<00:04:09.220> a<00:04:09.370> low<00:04:09.640> mode

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
to power it down to you maybe a low mode

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.149 
to power it down to you maybe a low mode
to<00:04:10.390> conserve<00:04:10.540> energy<00:04:11.319> and<00:04:11.500> also<00:04:12.010> that

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 
to conserve energy and also that

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:14.339 
to conserve energy and also that
prolongs<00:04:12.549> your<00:04:12.730> lamp<00:04:12.940> life<00:04:13.180> so<00:04:13.750> in<00:04:13.959> regular
