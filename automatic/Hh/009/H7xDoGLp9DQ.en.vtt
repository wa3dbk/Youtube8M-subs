here<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.120> probably<00:00:54.270> noticed<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.050> that

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
here that you probably noticed is that

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.049 
here that you probably noticed is that
changing<00:00:55.739> your<00:00:55.860> weapon<00:00:56.190> also<00:00:56.370> changes<00:00:56.910> your

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
changing your weapon also changes your

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.270 
changing your weapon also changes your
ship<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:58.170> turn<00:00:58.379> changes<00:00:58.800> your<00:00:58.980> speed

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
ship and that in turn changes your speed

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.220 
ship and that in turn changes your speed
and<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.850> last<00:01:00.090> weapon<00:01:00.390> there<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> good

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
and that last weapon there is a good

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.990 
and that last weapon there is a good
example<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.890> balance<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.460> game<00:01:02.730> has

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
example of the balance this game has

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.420 
example of the balance this game has
this<00:01:03.420> weapon<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.930> monstrously<00:01:04.650> powerful<00:01:05.250> but

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
this weapon is monstrously powerful but

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.250 
this weapon is monstrously powerful but
it's<00:01:05.580> risky<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.119> use<00:01:06.150> because<00:01:06.930> you're<00:01:07.049> so

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
it's risky to use because you're so

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.500 
it's risky to use because you're so
freaking<00:01:07.799> slow<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.760> machine<00:01:09.060> gun<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.360> much

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
freaking slow the machine gun is much

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.030 
freaking slow the machine gun is much
weaker<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:10.110> you're<00:01:10.260> quick<00:01:10.470> enough<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.799> dodge

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
weaker but you're quick enough to dodge

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.859 
weaker but you're quick enough to dodge
a<00:01:11.070> lot<00:01:11.400> more<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.119> also<00:01:12.270> power<00:01:12.540> up<00:01:12.750> your

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
a lot more you can also power up your

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.140 
a lot more you can also power up your
weapon<00:01:13.200> up<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.500> three<00:01:13.740> times<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.580> yeah<00:01:14.820> there's

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
weapon up to three times so yeah there's

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.030 
weapon up to three times so yeah there's
lots<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.570> replay<00:01:15.930> value<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.500> just<00:01:16.530> trying<00:01:16.920> out

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
lots of replay value and just trying out

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.520 
lots of replay value and just trying out
each<00:01:17.250> weapon<00:01:17.490> for<00:01:17.820> each<00:01:17.909> stage<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.689> you'll

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
each weapon for each stage and you'll

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.050 
each weapon for each stage and you'll
really<00:01:19.890> want<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.130> do<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.400> because<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.880> game

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
really want to do that because this game

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.030 
really want to do that because this game
is<00:01:21.210> pretty<00:01:21.390> hard<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:22.049> life<00:01:22.290> bar<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.770> see<00:01:22.950> at

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
is pretty hard that life bar you see at

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.280 
life replenishment is tough to come by
also<00:01:29.729> for<00:01:29.939> each<00:01:30.090> hit<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.509> take<00:01:30.720> your<00:01:30.960> weapon

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
also for each hit you take your weapon

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.990 
also for each hit you take your weapon
loses<00:01:31.650> its<00:01:31.829> power<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.490> if<00:01:32.610> you've<00:01:32.729> collected

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
loses its power so if you've collected

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.090 
loses its power so if you've collected
three<00:01:33.390> power-ups<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.110> weapon<00:01:34.259> get<00:01:34.890> hit

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
three power-ups for that weapon get hit

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.830 
three power-ups for that weapon get hit
and<00:01:35.369> you're<00:01:35.579> down<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.970> two<00:01:36.150> what's<00:01:36.630> nice

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
and you're down to two what's nice

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.929 
and you're down to two what's nice
though<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.259> it's<00:01:37.590> only<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.430> weapon

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
though is that it's only that weapon

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.910 
though is that it's only that weapon
that<00:01:39.210> down<00:01:39.479> Gura<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:39.930> not<00:01:40.259> all<00:01:40.500> three<00:01:40.740> of

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
that down Gura it's not all three of

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.770 
that down Gura it's not all three of
them<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.369> you'd<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.670> wise<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:41.939> stash<00:01:42.479> away<00:01:42.509> a

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
them so you'd be wise to stash away a

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.359 
them so you'd be wise to stash away a
powered<00:01:43.259> up<00:01:43.409> weapon<00:01:43.770> when<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.009> come<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.340> a

tough section where you know you're

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.870 
tough section where you know you're
going<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.200> get<00:01:46.380> hit<00:01:46.590> maybe<00:01:47.009> my<00:01:47.220> favorite<00:01:47.490> part

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880

so<00:02:12.640> yeah<00:02:12.910> just<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.450> basic<00:02:13.900> gameplay<00:02:14.140> here<00:02:14.620> is

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
so yeah just the basic gameplay here is

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.620 
so yeah just the basic gameplay here is
enough<00:02:15.220> reason<00:02:15.460> to<00:02:15.670> play<00:02:15.910> this<00:02:16.090> game<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.570> it

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
enough reason to play this game and it

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
obviously helps that they nail down the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.950 
obviously helps that they nail down the
usual<00:02:18.520> shoot-'em-up<00:02:18.970> aspects<00:02:19.420> here<00:02:19.630> like<00:02:19.840> the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
usual shoot-'em-up aspects here like the

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.750 
usual shoot-'em-up aspects here like the
balance<00:02:20.290> of<00:02:20.440> speed<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:20.890> pacing<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.610> a

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
balance of speed and pacing and a

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.280 
balance of speed and pacing and a
variety<00:02:22.120> of<00:02:22.150> weapons<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.750> play<00:02:22.930> around<00:02:23.140> with

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
but there's enough even just on the

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.030 
but there's enough even just on the
surface<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.270> appeal<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.570> anyone<00:02:26.020> as<00:02:26.380> a<00:02:26.560> bonus
