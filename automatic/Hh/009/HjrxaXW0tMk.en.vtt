 indeed have 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.870
 4 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.790
 on 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.580
 Sal Dr 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.580
 Although certainly increased 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.310
 Doom 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.380
 No 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:16.519
 on 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.519
 Well 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.319
 May come at the company with the brands 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.589

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:07.739
 Of course that's the way it is 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.739

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:17.999
 and why lies 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:26.529
 they also meant Luger 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:32.649
