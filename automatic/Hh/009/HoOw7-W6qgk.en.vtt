and he slams it on the ground and it
causes<00:04:52.110> another<00:04:52.530> explosion<00:04:53.250> where<00:04:53.430> he

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
causes another explosion where he

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.310 
causes another explosion where he
bounces<00:04:54.060> past<00:04:54.330> across<00:04:54.659> the<00:04:54.840> finish<00:04:55.020> line<00:04:55.139> so

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:50.069 
the name in the panel so he actually got

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:51.890 
the name in the panel so he actually got
clarification<00:05:50.849> of<00:05:51.060> her<00:05:51.270> name<00:05:51.479> and<00:05:51.719> she<00:05:51.870> was

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
clarification of her name and she was

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.980 
clarification of her name and she was
for<00:05:52.289> placement<00:05:52.979> like<00:05:53.069> whoa<00:05:53.840> she<00:05:54.840> is

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
for placement like whoa she is

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.809 
for placement like whoa she is
incredibly<00:05:55.560> strong<00:05:55.830> to<00:05:56.129> be<00:05:56.219> fourth<00:05:56.520> place

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:56.819 
incredibly strong to be fourth place

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:59.659 
incredibly strong to be fourth place
like<00:05:57.150> I<00:05:57.419> did<00:05:57.689> not<00:05:58.080> think<00:05:58.319> she<00:05:58.590> was<00:05:58.710> that<00:05:59.189> strong

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669 
like I did not think she was that strong

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:01.730 
like I did not think she was that strong
so<00:06:00.029> she's<00:06:00.569> in<00:06:00.599> fourth<00:06:00.930> place<00:06:01.080> right<00:06:01.439> behind

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740

number 40 this person placed in so I'm

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:08.059 
number 40 this person placed in so I'm
gonna<00:07:06.779> guess<00:07:07.050> that<00:07:07.080> this<00:07:07.349> person's<00:07:07.770> gonna<00:07:07.889> be

00:07:08.059 --> 00:07:08.069 
gonna guess that this person's gonna be

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:10.159 
gonna guess that this person's gonna be
very<00:07:08.370> important<00:07:08.849> later<00:07:08.939> on<00:07:09.060> because<00:07:09.599> there<00:07:10.050> is

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:10.169 
very important later on because there is

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:11.899 
very important later on because there is
no<00:07:10.349> way<00:07:10.529> in<00:07:10.680> hell<00:07:10.949> the<00:07:11.189> manga<00:07:11.610> code<00:07:11.819> would

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:11.909 
no way in hell the manga code would

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:13.429 
no way in hell the manga code would
actually<00:07:12.360> put<00:07:12.569> some<00:07:12.719> dialogue<00:07:13.139> for<00:07:13.349> this

00:07:13.429 --> 00:07:13.439 
actually put some dialogue for this

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:15.350 
actually put some dialogue for this
character<00:07:13.710> and<00:07:14.069> if<00:07:14.370> it<00:07:14.490> was<00:07:14.639> not<00:07:14.939> very

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 
character and if it was not very

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.360 
character and if it was not very
important<00:07:15.899> later<00:07:16.110> on<00:07:16.319> like<00:07:16.710> this<00:07:17.129> character

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:17.370 
important later on like this character

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.070 
important later on like this character
most<00:07:17.610> likely<00:07:17.849> is<00:07:17.909> gonna<00:07:18.060> get<00:07:18.210> a<00:07:18.270> major<00:07:18.599> shining

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 
most likely is gonna get a major shining

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.240 
most likely is gonna get a major shining
point<00:07:19.259> later<00:07:19.439> on<00:07:19.500> most<00:07:19.770> likely<00:07:19.949> in<00:07:20.129> this

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:20.250 
point later on most likely in this

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.579 
point later on most likely in this
upcoming<00:07:21.169> tournament<00:07:22.169> pretty<00:07:22.319> much<00:07:22.439> like
