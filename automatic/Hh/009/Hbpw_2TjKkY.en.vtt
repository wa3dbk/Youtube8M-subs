00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.700
 Hello guys 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.650
 I'm here for me 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.980
 second stage after we have 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.599
 built the container for 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.340
 put the paulo owner chick and 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:26.460

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:43.520
 also for commercialization 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.880
