00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:50.910 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.930 

Wow<00:06:51.480> the<00:06:52.050> pave<00:06:52.320> low<00:06:52.620> is<00:06:52.890> really<00:06:53.430> cleaning<00:06:53.730> up

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 
Wow the pave low is really cleaning up

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.390 
Wow the pave low is really cleaning up
none<00:06:54.870> of<00:06:54.900> those<00:06:55.170> women<00:06:55.410> Gunners<00:06:55.920> we're

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 
none of those women Gunners we're

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:24.580 
none of those women Gunners we're
packing<00:06:56.760> any<00:06:56.970> rockets<00:06:57.420> apparently

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:24.590 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.220 

so<00:07:25.220> the<00:07:25.370> pave<00:07:25.610> low<00:07:25.910> ended<00:07:26.480> up<00:07:26.630> getting<00:07:26.930> 12

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:27.230 
so the pave low ended up getting 12

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:31.330 
so the pave low ended up getting 12
kills<00:07:27.820> 30<00:07:28.820> kills<00:07:29.180> and<00:07:29.390> zero<00:07:29.600> deaths<00:07:29.980> the<00:07:30.980> score
