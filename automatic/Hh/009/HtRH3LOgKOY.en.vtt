is made entirely in the USA another

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.260 
is made entirely in the USA another
thing<00:02:05.530> is<00:02:05.799> that<00:02:05.829> if<00:02:06.369> you<00:02:06.490> have<00:02:06.520> an<00:02:06.880> allergy<00:02:07.000> to

me is important because my sister
actually<00:02:10.420> has<00:02:10.690> an<00:02:10.810> allergy<00:02:10.929> to<00:02:11.200> sulfates<00:02:11.560> and
