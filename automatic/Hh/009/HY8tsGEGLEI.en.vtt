00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 the sander of the horses inside.com me 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.150
 would like to make me today with a basis 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.309
 the topic deals with the right one 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.309
 Selection and adaptation of halters 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.880
 time and again I see that in practice 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.250
 unfortunately this topic is very neglected 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.230
 and that can lead to accidents and 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.460
 Of course, dramatic experiences 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.920
 not and will lead 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.820
 so here a little bit 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.890
 base work 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.960
 Here I have a horse with one 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.600
 Halfter what is clearly too big 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.970
 yes, that's why it's so big because it depends a lot 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.010
 deep down and at the same time 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.530
 This nasal area too big 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.180
 the size of a halter is the better 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.129
 bigger is the danger that I'm a horse 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.799
 hurt yourself 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.510
 and myself , for example , I did 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.519
 personally know also a lipizzaner 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.080
 that was really great stallion s-dressage 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.780
 formed with the I used 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.689
 more often on courses and that has become 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.310
 example , we had the owner of the 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.500
 animal unfortunately on the phone 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.110
 says he's in the meadow times 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.570
 just as new and just keep it simple 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.939
 because of the figure something scratched his ear 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.710
 There is now foot kept in this 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.200
 Half year and has itself the neck 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.689
 he turned off soon he could not 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.210
 understand that within the attack and 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.890
 so it's just a certain 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.659
 dangerous situation especially if half 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.090
 not well adjusted like this one 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.939
 just way too long and way too far 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.450
 In addition, it is wrong 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.789
 that here actually this cabin 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.759
 so closes the carbine always belongs 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.890
 so that closed here so to speak this 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.929
 end to the outside shows but that's just 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.210
 a trifle but correct 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.619
 closed is also just knew that 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.819
 even at the woods and so on though 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.200
 you within the appendix 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.780
 Generally you have to really 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.969
 superior to help with this makes sense 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.850
 yes, because that's just when 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:06.039
 Fly and brake time is a high one 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.140
 driven injury risk in itself 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.260
 holds now there are very good 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.959
 continued since helped there are those who 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.940
 small mattress circlip that 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.450
 if it is stuck somewhere 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.950
 then this ring goes on there are sure 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.870
 but further half with 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.480
 Velcro work 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.120
 there is the keb closure on it and it 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.420
 Of course, halter is the one too 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.610
 for example, have the care area here 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.250
 take names or in the laid that 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.019
 means when it is finished then it is 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.209
 who can halter and thereby 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.420
 no serious injury, so to speak 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.459
 or danger to the horse arises when 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.410
 you just have to continue to use 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.209
 For insurance reasons, for example 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.129
 Personally, I would always continue to do so 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.340
 has the recommend because otherwise it is real 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.330
 can be very dangerous 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.579
 Here we would have direct 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.430
 Comparison on halter well adapted 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:03.130
 So the belt is not so tight 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.500
 is not too much merge here 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.780
 these respiratory tracts are completely free, yes 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.380
 then try to really work freely 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.870
 can 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.670
 The chinstrap is loose enough too 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.620
 that he swallowed well and not 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.560
 But it will not affect you either 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.750
 so far that he can easily go somewhere 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.269
 a doctor or style or somehow 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.630
 can a fence to impose or 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.940
 even in some place somewhere 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.139
 a horse can also be pulled 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.180
 It is also an important aspect 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:33.250
 if the way there are so great then 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.069
 other horses really hurt 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.930
 cause or injury so lead 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.870
 that would be well adapted now the halter 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.420
 and we did not call it that easy 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.260
 to determine the right halter or 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.540
 To sum up because he is relatively one 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.239
 substructure here in the nasal area has pine 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.040
 but above relative wider head in the 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.510
 relationship 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.459
 therefore such half-time are the one 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.950
 of course, really individual in the 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:03.609
 Adjusting the nose area can be ideal 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.579
 So as simple cheaper halfter the 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:08.650
 are not set 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:10.599
 that 's it for fair halter right 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.310
 customize and select i hope so 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.620
 could give you some tips and hints 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.570
 let's not do that 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.910
 we also have great videos 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.049
 youtube about the theme of how I hang 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.120
 I'm sure 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.400
 and of course many other great content 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.599
 therefore our youtube channel 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.320
 to subscribe 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:30.690
 so that he always has the info and 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.550
 storm horses inside.com informed since 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.230
 We are also happy when we have ours 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.360
 facebook page easily and if you are 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.970
 comment on this and others 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.910
 Of course we do videos because we want to 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.070
 Create meaningful content for you and 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.940
 for the horse world so that's just more 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.940
 horses as they exist
