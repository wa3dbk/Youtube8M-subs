26<00:00:27.420> million<00:00:27.660> XP<00:00:28.230> but<00:00:28.380> apparently<00:00:28.800> it's<00:00:29.130> far

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
26 million XP but apparently it's far

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.139 
26 million XP but apparently it's far
off<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.480> will<00:00:30.720> need<00:00:30.929> 8<00:00:31.230> mod<00:00:31.679> million<00:00:32.399> experience

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
pain in the ass and the only reason why

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.049 
pain in the ass and the only reason why
how<00:00:40.260> like<00:00:40.440> 10,000<00:00:40.980> blue<00:00:41.070> champs<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.579> because<00:00:41.850> I

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
how like 10,000 blue champs is because I

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.600 
how like 10,000 blue champs is because I
killed<00:00:42.300> 1000<00:00:42.989> corporal<00:00:43.320> corporal<00:00:43.710> beasts<00:00:44.430> and

killed 1000 corporal corporal beasts and

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.660 
killed 1000 corporal corporal beasts and
a<00:00:45.300> lot<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.480> tormented<00:00:46.079> demons<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.190> didn't

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
a lot of tormented demons so I didn't

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.979 
a lot of tormented demons so I didn't
collect<00:00:48.000> them<00:00:48.210> on<00:00:48.329> purpose

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
collect them on purpose

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.290 
collect them on purpose
so<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.590> could<00:00:49.739> gain<00:00:50.399> some<00:00:50.430> more<00:00:50.879> summoning

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.180 
so it could gain some more summoning
experience<00:00:51.750> or<00:00:51.899> anything<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.500> will<00:00:52.980> not

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
experience or anything so that will not

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.029

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.789 
his YouTube channel you can go to his
video<00:04:08.449> description<00:04:09.019> and<00:04:09.139> you<00:04:09.229> can<00:04:09.379> see<00:04:09.560> it's<00:04:09.709> a

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
video description and you can see it's a

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.979 
video description and you can see it's a
fake<00:04:10.040> link<00:04:10.400> to<00:04:10.939> a<00:04:10.970> fake<00:04:11.209> forum<00:04:11.599> so<00:04:11.840> he

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
fake link to a fake forum so he

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.969 
fake link to a fake forum so he
definitely<00:04:12.560> needs<00:04:12.769> to<00:04:12.919> get<00:04:13.009> muted<00:04:13.459> and<00:04:14.979> yeah

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:15.979 
definitely needs to get muted and yeah

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:19.499 
definitely needs to get muted and yeah
so<00:04:16.310> I<00:04:17.049> think<00:04:18.049> we<00:04:18.169> actually<00:04:18.320> cleared<00:04:18.859> the<00:04:19.009> vadik

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:19.509 
so I think we actually cleared the vadik

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.969 
so I think we actually cleared the vadik
let's<00:04:20.509> go<00:04:20.750> to<00:04:20.810> one<00:04:20.989> more<00:04:21.019> place<00:04:21.199> this<00:04:21.620> is<00:04:21.769> where

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
let's go to one more place this is where

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:26.080 
let's go to one more place this is where
they<00:04:22.190> advertise<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:24.039> these<00:04:25.039> two<00:04:25.279> people<00:04:25.639> yeah

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
they advertise the these two people yeah

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.950 
they advertise the these two people yeah
this<00:04:26.690> is

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
this is

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.540 
this is
but<00:04:27.050> usually<00:04:27.410> usually<00:04:27.590> there<00:04:27.979> are<00:04:28.009> two<00:04:28.130> people

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
but usually usually there are two people

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.059 
but usually usually there are two people
I<00:04:28.699> don't<00:04:28.759> know<00:04:28.940> why<00:04:29.150> because<00:04:30.080> if<00:04:30.410> you<00:04:30.530> mute<00:04:30.740> one

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:31.069 
I don't know why because if you mute one

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.400 
I don't know why because if you mute one
the<00:04:31.370> second<00:04:31.699> one<00:04:31.729> will<00:04:32.210> get<00:04:32.389> muted<00:04:32.750> as<00:04:32.870> well<00:04:33.110> so

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
the second one will get muted as well so

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.950 
the second one will get muted as well so
I<00:04:34.030> don't<00:04:35.030> know<00:04:35.090> why<00:04:35.240> they<00:04:35.389> do<00:04:35.449> that<00:04:35.569> so<00:04:35.900> I'm

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
I don't know why they do that so I'm

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.360 
I don't know why they do that so I'm
going<00:04:36.080> to<00:04:36.139> just<00:04:36.349> mute<00:04:36.470> this<00:04:36.710> one<00:04:36.949> this<00:04:37.160> one

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
going to just mute this one this one

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.110 
going to just mute this one this one

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.029 
already got muted what's that well
that's<00:04:41.300> just<00:04:41.419> one<00:04:41.720> so<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:42.560> final<00:04:42.889> destination

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
that's just one so the final destination

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.790 
that's just one so the final destination
now<00:04:43.580> is<00:04:43.819> the<00:04:44.240> duel<00:04:44.509> arena<00:04:44.720> so<00:04:45.259> let's<00:04:45.470> go<00:04:45.650> in
