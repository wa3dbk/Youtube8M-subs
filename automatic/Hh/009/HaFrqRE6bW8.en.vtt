00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
star that's on top of the tree so I'll

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.990 
star that's on top of the tree so I'll
draw<00:00:21.290> a<00:00:21.320> point<00:00:21.590> like<00:00:21.980> that<00:00:22.220> that's<00:00:22.730> pretty

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
draw a point like that that's pretty

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.240

round<00:00:23.710> at<00:00:24.710> the<00:00:24.770> top<00:00:26.140> I'll<00:00:27.140> draw<00:00:27.529> the<00:00:27.590> two<00:00:27.890> side

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
round at the top I'll draw the two side

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.959 
round at the top I'll draw the two side
points<00:00:28.790> of<00:00:28.970> the<00:00:29.090> star<00:00:29.360> like<00:00:29.960> that<00:00:30.640> so<00:00:31.640> the<00:00:31.759> star

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:31.969 
points of the star like that so the star

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:36.060 
points of the star like that so the star
is<00:00:32.000> going<00:00:32.210> to<00:00:32.270> be<00:00:32.360> quite<00:00:32.630> cute<00:00:32.899> in<00:00:33.110> shipping

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:48.010

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
star on top I'll draw one line going

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.920 
star on top I'll draw one line going
down<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.490> that<00:00:56.700> and<00:00:57.980> another<00:00:58.980> line<00:00:59.310> going

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
down like that and another line going

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:07.450 
down like that and another line going
the<00:01:00.930> other<00:01:00.960> way<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.720> is<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.230> be<00:01:04.440> a

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.910 

simplified<00:01:08.460> top<00:01:08.910> branch<00:01:09.470> for<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.500> Christmas

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
simplified top branch for the Christmas

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:21.260 
simplified top branch for the Christmas
tree<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:11.250> both<00:01:11.430> sides<00:01:19.190> from<00:01:20.190> this<00:01:20.400> part<00:01:20.700> I'll

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
tree on both sides from this part I'll

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.990 
tree on both sides from this part I'll
draw<00:01:21.510> another<00:01:21.660> line<00:01:22.580> going<00:01:23.580> down<00:01:25.790> on<00:01:26.790> both

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
draw another line going down on both

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:37.550 
draw another line going down on both
sides<00:01:30.650> come<00:01:31.650> back<00:01:31.830> in<00:01:35.960> you<00:01:36.960> can<00:01:37.140> see<00:01:37.350> this

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
sides come back in you can see this

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.940 
sides come back in you can see this
distance<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.250> lot<00:01:38.580> wider<00:01:38.820> than<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.950> it's

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
distance is a lot wider than this it's

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.080 
distance is a lot wider than this it's
pretty<00:01:41.220> triangular<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.720> let's<00:01:42.990> do<00:01:43.229> one<00:01:43.619> more

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:57.410 

like<00:01:48.090> that

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.580 

for<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.509> bottom<00:01:58.840> part<00:01:59.049> of<00:01:59.080> the<00:01:59.200> Christmas

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
for the bottom part of the Christmas

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.030 
for the bottom part of the Christmas
tree

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
tree

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:08.240 
tree
I'll<00:02:00.220> draw<00:02:00.640> few<00:02:01.030> more<00:02:01.330> cute<00:02:01.659> little<00:02:01.840> branches

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:21.230 

a<00:02:13.130> cute<00:02:14.130> little<00:02:14.340> bottle<00:02:19.910> now<00:02:20.910> I'm<00:02:21.030> going<00:02:21.180> to

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
a cute little bottle now I'm going to

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.809 
a cute little bottle now I'm going to

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.300 

and<00:02:25.360> let's<00:02:25.540> get<00:02:25.689> the<00:02:25.840> big<00:02:26.200> fun2draw<00:02:26.560> eyes<00:02:26.980> on

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
and let's get the big fun2draw eyes on

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.660 
and let's get the big fun2draw eyes on
us<00:02:27.989> so<00:02:28.989> I<00:02:29.019> drew<00:02:29.230> these<00:02:29.379> curves<00:02:29.829> inside<00:02:30.400> there

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
us so I drew these curves inside there

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.050 
us so I drew these curves inside there
on<00:02:31.150> either<00:02:31.480> side<00:02:31.959> of<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:33.099> little<00:02:33.250> smile<00:02:33.730> and

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
on either side of the little smile and

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.550 
on either side of the little smile and
on<00:02:34.629> top<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:34.870> each<00:02:35.260> curve<00:02:35.620> let's<00:02:36.159> draw<00:02:36.459> one

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
on top of each curve let's draw one

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.880 
on top of each curve let's draw one
curve<00:02:38.560> going<00:02:38.859> up<00:02:39.129> and<00:02:39.450> another<00:02:40.450> one<00:02:40.890> going

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
curve going up and another one going

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.740 
curve going up and another one going
down<00:02:43.709> I'll<00:02:44.709> draw<00:02:44.890> one<00:02:45.040> more<00:02:45.220> curve<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.599> make

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
down I'll draw one more curve to make

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.539 
down I'll draw one more curve to make
the<00:02:46.900> side<00:02:47.109> of<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.319> eye<00:02:47.349> and<00:02:47.890> I'll<00:02:48.220> make<00:02:48.370> this

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
the side of the eye and I'll make this

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:54.569 
the side of the eye and I'll make this
side<00:02:48.819> really<00:02:49.150> dark<00:02:52.950> okay<00:02:53.950> let's<00:02:54.189> do<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.400> same

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
side really dark okay let's do the same

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:09.390 
side really dark okay let's do the same
thing<00:02:54.639> other<00:03:06.689> and<00:03:07.689> let's<00:03:08.470> make<00:03:08.769> those<00:03:08.980> big

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
thing other and let's make those big

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.440 
thing other and let's make those big
pupils<00:03:09.939> look<00:03:10.209> up<00:03:10.530> like<00:03:11.530> this

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.440 

to<00:03:15.080> make<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.380> pupil<00:03:15.740> look<00:03:15.860> shiny<00:03:16.240> to<00:03:17.240> another

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
to make the pupil look shiny to another

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.089 
to make the pupil look shiny to another
curve<00:03:17.750> inside<00:03:18.170> each<00:03:18.410> of<00:03:18.590> them<00:03:18.739> for<00:03:19.010> the

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
curve inside each of them for the

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.820 
curve inside each of them for the
highlight<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:20.780> shade<00:03:21.110> in<00:03:21.349> the<00:03:21.470> furniture

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
highlight and to shade in the furniture

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.920 
highlight and to shade in the furniture
I<00:03:21.980> let's<00:03:22.670> start<00:03:22.940> with<00:03:23.090> a<00:03:23.120> diagonal<00:03:23.569> line

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
I let's start with a diagonal line

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.420 
I let's start with a diagonal line
underneath<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:24.800> highlight<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:25.750> this<00:03:26.750> area

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
underneath the highlight and this area

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.400 
underneath the highlight and this area
between<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.819> highlight<00:03:29.330> and<00:03:29.569> the<00:03:29.900> diagonal

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
between the highlight and the diagonal

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:38.199 
between the highlight and the diagonal
line<00:03:30.590> would<00:03:30.739> be<00:03:30.770> shaded<00:03:31.250> all<00:03:31.580> in<00:03:32.120> black<00:03:37.209> I'll

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
line would be shaded all in black I'll

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.300 
line would be shaded all in black I'll
draw<00:03:38.420> these<00:03:38.569> diagonal<00:03:39.140> lines<00:03:39.410> going<00:03:39.739> down<00:03:39.860> the
