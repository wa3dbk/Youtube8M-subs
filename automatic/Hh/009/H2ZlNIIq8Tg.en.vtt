portion chest is still fairly new to me

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.410 
portion chest is still fairly new to me
benching<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.840> still<00:00:25.289> fairly<00:00:25.590> new<00:00:25.770> to<00:00:25.949> me<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:27.150> I

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
benching is still fairly new to me so I

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.090 
benching is still fairly new to me so I
feel<00:00:27.630> like<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.840> have<00:00:28.020> made<00:00:28.260> progress<00:00:28.500> pretty

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
feel like I have made progress pretty

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.160 
feel like I have made progress pretty
quick<00:00:29.340> but<00:00:30.320> this<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.500> one<00:00:32.129> of<00:00:32.160> my<00:00:32.989> one<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.020> my

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
quick but this is one of my one of my

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.799 
quick but this is one of my one of my
heavier<00:00:34.890> days<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.370> guess<00:00:35.400> where<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.210> try<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.600> go

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
heavier days I guess where I try to go

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.790 
heavier days I guess where I try to go
as<00:00:36.930> heavy<00:00:37.140> as<00:00:37.350> possible<00:00:37.949> and<00:00:38.190> keep<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.330> reps

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
as heavy as possible and keep the reps

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.329 
as heavy as possible and keep the reps
lower<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.220> I<00:00:41.250> think<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.670> was<00:00:41.790> doing<00:00:42.030> like<00:00:43.339> for

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
lower so I think I was doing like for

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:47.590 
lower so I think I was doing like for
like<00:00:44.909> four<00:00:45.330> or<00:00:45.449> five<00:00:45.479> four<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.470> six<00:00:46.710> reps<00:00:47.040> um

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
like four or five four to six reps um

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.950 
like four or five four to six reps um
think<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.780> highest<00:00:49.320> i<00:00:50.120> typically<00:00:51.120> started

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
think the highest i typically started

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.380 
think the highest i typically started
out<00:00:52.080> with<00:00:52.260> 75<00:00:53.159> i<00:00:53.519> think<00:00:53.790> is<00:00:53.940> where<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.150> began

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
out with 75 i think is where I began

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.600 
out with 75 i think is where I began
I've<00:00:54.690> only<00:00:54.839> been<00:00:55.019> benching<00:00:55.710> for<00:00:55.890> probably<00:00:56.220> I

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
I've only been benching for probably I

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.450 
I've only been benching for probably I
don't<00:00:57.030> know<00:00:57.150> since<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.540> summertime<00:00:58.110> so<00:00:58.470> um<00:00:59.370> I

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
because I've noticed it really has made

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.010 
because I've noticed it really has made
significant<00:01:05.309> strength<00:01:06.090> gains<00:01:06.479> for<00:01:06.750> me<00:01:06.869> with

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
significant strength gains for me with

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.530 
significant strength gains for me with
my<00:01:07.140> shoulders<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.010> just<00:01:08.520> my<00:01:08.670> arms<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.150> general

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
still unsure of myself right here I

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.719 
still unsure of myself right here I
don't<00:01:25.380> normally<00:01:25.799> do<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:25.979> movement<00:01:26.399> I've

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
don't normally do this movement I've

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.880 
don't normally do this movement I've
never<00:01:26.939> done<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.750> before<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.289> this<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.770> just

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
never done it before so this is just

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.719 
never done it before so this is just
cable<00:01:29.310> crossovers<00:01:30.259> 44<00:01:31.259> chest<00:01:31.530> really<00:01:32.429> trying

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
cable crossovers 44 chest really trying

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.359 
cable crossovers 44 chest really trying
to<00:01:32.789> squeeze<00:01:33.119> through<00:01:33.359> the<00:01:33.509> chest<00:01:34.159> this<00:01:35.159> was<00:01:35.340> a

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
to squeeze through the chest this was a

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.279 
to squeeze through the chest this was a
good<00:01:35.549> movement<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.179> really<00:01:36.570> got<00:01:36.840> my<00:01:37.020> chest

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
good movement that really got my chest

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.380 
good movement that really got my chest
feeling<00:01:37.619> weak<00:01:37.920> especially<00:01:38.219> after<00:01:38.729> benching

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
feeling weak especially after benching

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.029 
feeling weak especially after benching
so<00:01:41.119> does<00:01:42.119> not<00:01:42.359> take<00:01:42.689> much<00:01:42.719> for<00:01:43.259> me<00:01:43.289> on<00:01:43.469> chest<00:01:43.829> to

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
so does not take much for me on chest to

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:45.770 
so does not take much for me on chest to
be<00:01:44.159> feeling<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.880> love<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.210> do<00:01:45.270> love<00:01:45.570> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
be feeling it and I love I do love the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.840 
be feeling it and I love I do love the
fact<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.259> makes<00:01:46.409> your<00:01:46.560> entire<00:01:46.950> upper

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
fact that it makes your entire upper

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.760 
fact that it makes your entire upper
body<00:01:47.880> sore<00:01:48.539> so<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.840> think<00:01:48.960> that's<00:01:49.229> really<00:01:49.560> been

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
body sore so I think that's really been

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.700 
body sore so I think that's really been
helpful<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.310> do<00:01:51.299> these<00:01:51.479> chest<00:01:51.869> movements<00:01:52.499> in

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
helpful to do these chest movements in

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.069 
helpful to do these chest movements in
terms<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.759> changes<00:01:54.299> I've<00:01:54.420> noticed<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:54.990> my

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
terms of changes I've noticed in my

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.289 
terms of changes I've noticed in my
upper<00:01:55.380> body<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.609> said<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.850> just<00:01:57.149> feel

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
upper body and like I said I just feel

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.809 
upper body and like I said I just feel
stronger<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:58.049> any<00:01:58.409> other<00:01:58.920> arm<00:01:59.219> movements<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.759> do

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
stronger on any other arm movements I do

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.370 
stronger on any other arm movements I do
now<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.719> then<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:01.859> was<00:02:02.039> decline<00:02:02.460> bench

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
now and then this was decline bench

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.169 
now and then this was decline bench
which<00:02:04.380> at<00:02:04.619> this<00:02:04.829> point<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.340> had<00:02:05.460> done<00:02:05.639> like<00:02:05.880> five

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
which at this point I had done like five

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.800 
which at this point I had done like five
or<00:02:06.359> six<00:02:06.780> sets<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.679> flat<00:02:08.039> bench<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.819> was

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
or six sets on that flat bench I was

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.730 
or six sets on that flat bench I was
pretty<00:02:10.050> fatigued<00:02:10.530> going<00:02:11.250> into<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.670> movement

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740
