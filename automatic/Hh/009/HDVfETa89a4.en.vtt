00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:05.589
 today sometimes but I mean a 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.959
 Sunday more to the channel they bring the one 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:10.509
 there is in my travel bag I have to 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:14.290
 to say that I have adapted a long trip 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:16.900
 by plane the worst but you can 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.910
 adapt it to any pose you can remove 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.880
 and power things because the truth is I have 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.120
 a lot a lot of things so 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.310
 well let's go 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.770
 when the bag in question is this one 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.110
 here that weighs that my mother of love 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.390
 beautiful the first two keys that stops 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.480
 me are very important under is that they are 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.420
 crucial is the documentation first thing 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.810
 of everything is to say the passport dni I do not know 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.000
 what to bring and the tickets of 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.980
 plane of whatever and I say it because no 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.800
 it would be the first time that one forgets 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.410
 of any of these 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.390
 and the second is a cardigan or a garment 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.970
 of coat because although it seems that no 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.120
 on airplanes when you get to certain 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.309
 height is quite cold at least 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.040
 of tea or cold I'm really chilly what 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.229
 First of all, I have the ipod and this one 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.110
 This is a great piece of furniture the furniture 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.150
 but good and is that in some aircraft 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.619
 every time it is a very long trip already 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.590
 they put as a kind of ai for 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.710
 go ahead with with movies and games and 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.619
 well but not to others so well 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.830
 perhaps a hair brush that in the end I 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.810
 I usually carry one where the bag and 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.479
 then I take one of the suitcase because 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:34.479
 well to save some weight like that 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.479
 that it may not be 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.940
 then he took a notebook passbook 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.320
 little girl and a politics I do not know why 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.720
 I always carry vic but it gives me the 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.690
 feeling that not exploited so easy 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.820
 like the ink and is that as 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.500
 I have already exploited it but a lot 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.450
 I play well that you will say that 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.979
 you have the mobile notes that you can already 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.750
 adjust there but for me it's not the same 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.210
 point something here you have to write it down in 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.520
 a mobile note so always what 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.020
 then wear a paste paste hair 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.330
 and toothbrush and I have to say 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.340
 what's the same with me and with him 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.470
 I have already worn the comb that the 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.539
 trip and so I saved the weight from there what 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.940
 I have been here but to carry a small 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.650
 already a big one came to a success there 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.300
 this is the wipes it was always used 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.370
 very much the Kleenex always come back 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.400
 with the ones gone but the wipes for 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.390
 they are super necessary after the 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.730
 wallet 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.370
 and now the bochinche of the 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.769
 question that is the makeup bag 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.900
 and the bag of the loaders and the 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.370
 varied electronics something that I learned to 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.750
 basis of trial and error at the time of 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.690
 traveling is to wear a little makeup 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.150
 for three very simple reasons first 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:47.010
 it weighs a lot second if you go to the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:49.079
 beach site heat joke allows 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.450
 finish makeup until here and then 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.879
 apart because to those who live in Spain 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.400
 above all you will know that the makeup 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.319
 here it is very expensive when you go abroad 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.019
 makeup is much cheaper the skies 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.519
 where you find new and expensive brands 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.099
 what happened to me was that I was wearing 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.049
 a you are the state of makeup and it came back 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.660
 with three makeup sins that's a 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.910
 terrible weight but now I have learned 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.060
 that I do not take one in half and can 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.409
 be that comes with this filled with what 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.450
 that I have come and it is already because 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.209
 found nothing 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.280
 Well, this must never be taken alone 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.739
 I have now now that I'm going to 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.569
 use and that I have bought and it is the country 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.800
 of the stool and the camera stick 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.000
 it is sporty 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.390
 and I think you can adapt 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.470
 let's go then 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.470
 here I will notice 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.020
 Then he sees me this because I 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.900
 I qualify after this should be that 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.080
 for me it is one of the most important that is 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.650
 where I carry the rest of the 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.709
 equipment of the camera 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.170
 the little camera or a plug and the charger 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.390
 of the iphone and the ipod charger because 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.459
 Well, this is what this change of 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.620
 cables that apple has made that everything 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.420
 you carry the two I also recommend that you 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.370
 If you are going to make a plane ride very 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.200
 long take them by hand because now in 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.290
 the planes as I have told you in some 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.200
 in yemen since it comes to you as a 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.720
 kind of panel where you can connect 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.150
 this and you can charge the mobile so 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.859
 well of Namibia and also in some 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.280
 airports you also have plugs for 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.260
 charge the mobiles and also so 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.030
 discouraged now there is a law that in 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.160
 some countries before entering the 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.560
 revised country I mean battery 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.030
 in electronic devices by 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.820
 security issues so it's very 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.650
 important to have a battery too 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.600
 would carry a portable charger but it's 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.539
 I can not find it so that's why 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.889
 and here I also wear the headphones that 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:47.840
 I never say them for the purse because 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.639
 I always finish them here 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.220
 making a knot last there is inside 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.900
 I have two usb and an adapter for the 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.850
 camera card in case some 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.830
 moment I run out of memory in the 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.229
 card can empty the through a 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:04.680
 computer and put everything here is all 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:07.490
 controls on sunglasses are is 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.490
 if it opens 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.379
 before 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.870
 So that and a fan after I follow a 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.639
 mask that for me this is 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.889
 very important in a plane trip 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:31.050
 long because in a car as soon as I 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:33.030
 I'm falling asleep and in a bus 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.430
 also but in a plane it costs me 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.009
 very much the sound does not bother me so much 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.530
 but the light and the environment follows 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:42.240
 plane bothers me a lot then takes the 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.830
 house keys you will say that small 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.360
 foolishness that I do with the house keys 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.360
 of the machines 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.229
 a few years ago being a republic 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:53.849
 Dominican we put out and put it 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:57.870
 because I went with my family we got into the 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:06:00.900
 travel bag the house keys and the 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.819
 toilet bag disappeared so but no 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.860
 open that disgust please me all 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:08.659
 the here and if you do not lose is yours 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.659
 responsibility and for a day 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.900
 candies that good on a long trip to 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.880
 where perhaps in the end you do not know what 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.100
 do you say what I do is like and also 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.290
 usually carry a magazine but here 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.360
 I do not have it like that and that's the way 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.910
 I recommend you to pay rare time in 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.980
 the airport and the controls you carry 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:30.310
 together with the makeup bag a 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.320
 bag these plastic entities because 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.910
 now they make you get liquids like this 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.600
 that just in case if you have something that 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:40.419
 can alarm the staff because I and 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:44.140
 Well, as Felix, there's nothing else 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:45.520
 apart from the strap and good as I do not 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.260
 I am a supporter of carrying a bag 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.990
 little one with four things neither in the 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.760
 cabin suitcase because that I have to 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.919
 take it all the bag one size 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.960
 quite considerable and good that we 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:07:00.150
 we see next week that very many 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.150
 thanks for being there with those huge 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:05.889
 they have to clean you have to clean 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.790
 and me 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:22.780
 everything is clear recording is that you call and 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.780
 if this one is recording to lift 

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.760
 OK yes
