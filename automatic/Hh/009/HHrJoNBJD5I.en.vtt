here's the view from the side and we get

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.700

flashlight

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.830 
flashlight
I'm<00:02:14.879> guessing<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.269> headlights<00:02:15.569> aren't

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
I'm guessing the headlights aren't

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.020 
I'm guessing the headlights aren't
enough<00:02:15.989> here's<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.040> view<00:02:17.189> of<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.370> back<00:02:17.519> which

looks really cool here's the bottom and
there's<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.450> top<00:02:21.769> and<00:02:22.769> we<00:02:22.860> just<00:02:23.040> rip<00:02:23.220> this<00:02:23.370> off

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
there's the top and we just rip this off

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.009 
there's the top and we just rip this off
just<00:02:23.730> slide<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.180> our<00:02:24.329> minifigures<00:02:24.750> in<00:02:24.870> there

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
just slide in our minifigures in there

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.839 
just slide in our minifigures in there

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
and we got enough space for both of them

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.330 
and we got enough space for both of them
so<00:02:27.720> we'll<00:02:27.870> slide<00:02:28.049> the<00:02:28.560> first<00:02:28.799> place<00:02:29.040> I'm<00:02:29.189> up

makes them sick so I thought that was a
little<00:02:58.260> strange<00:02:58.530> so<00:02:58.829> let<00:02:59.040> me<00:02:59.129> you<00:02:59.190> can<00:02:59.280> have

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
otherwise looks like a pretty cool

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.270 
otherwise looks like a pretty cool
patrol<00:03:03.930> car<00:03:04.109> and<00:03:04.680> there<00:03:04.920> we<00:03:05.010> go

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
patrol car and there we go

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.680 
patrol car and there we go
and<00:03:05.370> now<00:03:05.909> we<00:03:05.970> can<00:03:06.120> move<00:03:06.180> on<00:03:06.329> to<00:03:06.450> the

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
and now we can move on to the

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.869 
and now we can move on to the
recommendations<00:03:10.280> overall<00:03:11.280> I'd<00:03:11.489> say<00:03:11.519> it's<00:03:11.819> a

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
recommendations overall I'd say it's a

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.000 
recommendations overall I'd say it's a
pretty<00:03:12.209> decent<00:03:12.810> set<00:03:13.019> when<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.650> comes<00:03:13.799> to<00:03:13.920> the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
pretty decent set when it comes to the

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.440 
pretty decent set when it comes to the
value<00:03:14.099> I'll<00:03:14.549> have<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:14.819> say<00:03:15.030> that<00:03:15.269> it's

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
value I'll have to say that it's

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.020 
value I'll have to say that it's
actually<00:03:15.780> fair<00:03:16.280> even<00:03:17.280> though<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.700> price<00:03:17.849> for

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
actually fair even though the price for

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.460 
actually fair even though the price for
peace<00:03:18.150> facial<00:03:18.480> is<00:03:18.540> about<00:03:18.659> 1.4<00:03:19.109> cents<00:03:19.349> apiece

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
peace facial is about 1.4 cents apiece

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.930 
peace facial is about 1.4 cents apiece
and<00:03:19.859> the<00:03:20.040> reason<00:03:20.250> why<00:03:20.370> I<00:03:20.400> say<00:03:20.639> that<00:03:20.760> is<00:03:20.910> because

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
and the reason why I say that is because

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.699 
and the reason why I say that is because
when<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:21.959> look<00:03:22.079> at<00:03:22.139> the<00:03:22.199> parts<00:03:22.500> you're

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
when you look at the parts you're

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.479 
when you look at the parts you're
getting<00:03:23.010> about<00:03:23.280> 10<00:03:23.849> to<00:03:24.650> almost<00:03:25.650> $14<00:03:26.280> with<00:03:26.370> the

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
getting about 10 to almost $14 with the

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.039 
getting about 10 to almost $14 with the
parts<00:03:26.730> here<00:03:26.849> not<00:03:27.120> including<00:03:27.449> me<00:03:27.540> figures<00:03:27.840> and

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
parts here not including me figures and

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.710 
parts here not including me figures and
this<00:03:28.859> is<00:03:29.040> retails<00:03:29.370> for<00:03:29.400> 12<00:03:29.790> it's<00:03:30.419> like<00:03:30.540> right

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
this is retails for 12 it's like right

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.240 
this is retails for 12 it's like right
there<00:03:30.840> in<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:30.959> middle<00:03:31.139> so<00:03:31.319> yeah<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:31.650> say<00:03:31.949> fair

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
there in the middle so yeah I say fair

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.280 
there in the middle so yeah I say fair
even<00:03:33.180> though<00:03:33.329> usually<00:03:33.599> you<00:03:33.900> want<00:03:33.989> to<00:03:34.109> set

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
even though usually you want to set

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.569 
even though usually you want to set
that's<00:03:34.500> always<00:03:34.739> in<00:03:34.889> your<00:03:34.949> favor<00:03:35.160> of<00:03:35.340> course

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
that's always in your favor of course

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.129 
that's always in your favor of course
where<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:36.090> always<00:03:36.209> gain<00:03:36.419> more<00:03:36.629> value<00:03:37.019> of

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
where you always gain more value of

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.409 
where you always gain more value of
bricks<00:03:37.410> than<00:03:37.799> what<00:03:38.099> you're<00:03:38.220> paying<00:03:38.340> for<00:03:38.459> but

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
bricks than what you're paying for but

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.659 
bricks than what you're paying for but
when<00:03:39.569> it<00:03:39.629> comes<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:39.900> play<00:03:40.079> value<00:03:40.410> I<00:03:40.590> think<00:03:41.280> is

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
when it comes to play value I think is

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.030 
when it comes to play value I think is
pretty<00:03:42.209> good<00:03:42.510> even<00:03:42.780> though<00:03:43.530> I'm<00:03:43.769> not<00:03:43.889> too

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
pretty good even though I'm not too

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.979 
pretty good even though I'm not too
happy<00:03:44.220> about<00:03:44.400> paying<00:03:44.609> 12<00:03:45.120> bucks<00:03:45.329> for<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.569> patrol

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
happy about paying 12 bucks for a patrol

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.319 
happy about paying 12 bucks for a patrol
car<00:03:46.169> I<00:03:46.379> mean<00:03:47.129> I<00:03:47.160> think<00:03:47.280> ii<00:03:47.879> totally<00:03:48.150> do<00:03:48.299> it

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
car I mean I think ii totally do it

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.689 
car I mean I think ii totally do it
without<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.780> barrier<00:03:49.169> but<00:03:50.010> if<00:03:50.190> you<00:03:50.310> do<00:03:50.549> feel

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:50.699 
without the barrier but if you do feel

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.369 
without the barrier but if you do feel
like<00:03:50.760> gang<00:03:51.000> multiple<00:03:51.389> patrol<00:03:51.629> cars<00:03:51.870> you<00:03:52.199> can

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
like gang multiple patrol cars you can

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.869 
like gang multiple patrol cars you can
make<00:03:52.560> yourself<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:53.069> little<00:03:53.310> bridge<00:03:53.489> with<00:03:53.730> all

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
make yourself a little bridge with all

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.819 
make yourself a little bridge with all
the<00:03:54.000> barriers<00:03:54.269> that<00:03:54.419> are<00:03:54.510> left<00:03:54.660> over<00:03:54.750> in<00:03:55.680> fact

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
the barriers that are left over in fact

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.229 
the barriers that are left over in fact
give<00:03:56.040> me<00:03:56.099> a<00:03:56.129> second<00:03:56.459> we<00:03:56.609> just<00:03:56.760> change<00:03:57.000> this<00:03:57.090> up

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
give me a second we just change this up

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.319 
give me a second we just change this up
a<00:03:57.269> bit<00:03:58.459> and<00:03:59.459> you<00:03:59.760> might<00:03:59.790> end<00:03:59.940> up<00:04:00.150> with

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
a bit and you might end up with

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:01.789 
a bit and you might end up with
something<00:04:00.599> that<00:04:00.720> looks<00:04:00.750> like<00:04:00.930> this<00:04:01.199> although

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
something that looks like this although

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.080 
something that looks like this although
honestly<00:04:02.010> i<00:04:02.190> don't<00:04:02.280> really<00:04:02.430> recommend<00:04:02.760> these

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
honestly i don't really recommend these

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.849 
honestly i don't really recommend these
as<00:04:03.419> supports<00:04:03.959> for<00:04:04.109> a<00:04:04.139> bridge<00:04:04.349> because<00:04:04.709> it's

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
as supports for a bridge because it's

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.800 
as supports for a bridge because it's
not<00:04:04.980> that<00:04:05.159> stable<00:04:05.370> but<00:04:06.299> if<00:04:06.419> you<00:04:06.480> have<00:04:06.599> a<00:04:06.629> bunch

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
not that stable but if you have a bunch

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.240 
not that stable but if you have a bunch
of<00:04:06.870> these<00:04:07.019> put<00:04:07.199> together<00:04:07.319> then<00:04:07.739> it'll<00:04:08.010> be<00:04:08.069> much

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
of these put together then it'll be much

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.280 
of these put together then it'll be much
stronger<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:09.000> with<00:04:09.510> some<00:04:09.690> of<00:04:09.720> your<00:04:09.870> own<00:04:09.959> parts

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
stronger and with some of your own parts

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.140 
stronger and with some of your own parts
you<00:04:10.530> can<00:04:10.650> definitely<00:04:10.739> replace<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.819> pillars

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
you can definitely replace the pillars

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.960 
you can definitely replace the pillars
and<00:04:12.419> maybe<00:04:13.260> make<00:04:13.470> some<00:04:13.709> railing<00:04:14.069> up<00:04:14.699> to<00:04:14.879> you

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
and maybe make some railing up to you

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.430 
and maybe make some railing up to you
just<00:04:15.150> look<00:04:15.419> them<00:04:15.540> all<00:04:15.629> up<00:04:15.840> together<00:04:15.959> and<00:04:16.289> i

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
just look them all up together and i

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.719 
just look them all up together and i
might<00:04:16.590> look<00:04:16.680> pretty<00:04:16.739> cool<00:04:17.070> it's<00:04:17.400> not<00:04:17.549> a<00:04:17.579> bad

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
might look pretty cool it's not a bad

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.789 
might look pretty cool it's not a bad
idea<00:04:17.870> so<00:04:18.870> again<00:04:19.169> i<00:04:19.289> do<00:04:19.349> think<00:04:19.590> this<00:04:19.650> is<00:04:19.739> a

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
idea so again i do think this is a

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.529 
idea so again i do think this is a
pretty<00:04:19.979> cool<00:04:20.159> set<00:04:20.430> i<00:04:20.639> do<00:04:20.940> like<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.269> fact<00:04:21.299> that

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
pretty cool set i do like the fact that

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.480 
pretty cool set i do like the fact that
we<00:04:21.690> get<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.840> horse<00:04:22.470> place<00:04:22.680> and<00:04:22.860> anti<00:04:23.099> robber<00:04:23.280> and

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
we get a horse place and anti robber and

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.760 
we get a horse place and anti robber and
they<00:04:23.610> both<00:04:23.760> fit<00:04:23.940> in<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.090> patrol<00:04:24.360> car<00:04:24.469> so<00:04:25.469> yep

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
they both fit in the patrol car so yep

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.170 
they both fit in the patrol car so yep
it's<00:04:26.039> definite<00:04:26.310> where<00:04:26.430> fought<00:04:26.580> to<00:04:26.849> get<00:04:27.030> and

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
it's definite where fought to get and

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.430 
it's definite where fought to get and
that<00:04:27.599> sums<00:04:27.780> up<00:04:27.840> my<00:04:27.960> review

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440
