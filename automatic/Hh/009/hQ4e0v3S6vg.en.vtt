this my friends is Firestone Walker
parabola<00:00:39.460> it<00:00:39.970> is<00:00:40.150> a<00:00:40.530> 12.5%<00:00:41.820> Imperial<00:00:42.820> Stout

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
parabola it is a 12.5% Imperial Stout

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.900 
parabola it is a 12.5% Imperial Stout
that's<00:00:43.449> aged<00:00:43.750> in<00:00:43.989> various<00:00:44.769> types<00:00:44.980> of<00:00:45.129> barrels

that's aged in various types of barrels

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.670 
that's aged in various types of barrels
for<00:00:46.390> up<00:00:46.510> to<00:00:46.629> 12<00:00:46.839> months<00:00:47.019> ranging<00:00:47.559> from

they've aged other Firestone Walker
beers<00:00:55.449> in<00:00:55.690> so<00:00:56.050> they<00:00:56.559> blend<00:00:56.890> them<00:00:57.010> all<00:00:57.070> together

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
beers in so they blend them all together

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.459 
beers in so they blend them all together
and<00:00:57.699> you<00:00:57.850> get<00:00:57.969> parabola<00:00:58.329> it<00:00:58.870> is<00:00:58.989> a<00:00:59.020> limited

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469
