00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.230 
a this my my take on what Isaac Newton
could<00:00:11.290> be<00:00:11.469> if<00:00:11.710> he<00:00:11.860> was<00:00:12.010> based<00:00:12.340> on<00:00:12.519> this<00:00:12.760> Malcolm

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
could be if he was based on this Malcolm

could be if he was based on this Malcolm
character<00:00:13.690> so<00:00:13.900> this<00:00:14.200> guy<00:00:14.380> as<00:00:15.040> malcolm<00:00:15.550> and

you so some of the some of the poses and

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.790 
you so some of the some of the poses and
capabilities<00:00:27.430> so<00:00:28.390> yeah<00:00:28.630> so<00:00:29.160> expressive<00:00:30.160> and

capabilities so yeah so expressive and

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.700 
capabilities so yeah so expressive and
really<00:00:32.800> he's<00:00:33.220> really<00:00:33.489> malleable<00:00:33.850> so<00:00:34.710> what

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
really he's really malleable so what

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.829 
really he's really malleable so what
you've<00:00:35.860> got<00:00:35.890> is<00:00:36.250> this<00:00:36.550> is<00:00:36.729> this<00:00:36.970> sort<00:00:37.600> of<00:00:37.629> on

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:37.839 
you've got is this is this sort of on

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:39.990 
you've got is this is this sort of on
face<00:00:38.199> controller<00:00:38.739> thing<00:00:39.159> where<00:00:39.400> you're

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
face controller thing where you're

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.560 
face controller thing where you're
utilizing<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:40.690> transforms<00:00:41.559> of<00:00:41.799> the<00:00:42.570> these

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
utilizing the transforms of the these

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.950 
utilizing the transforms of the these
controllers<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:45.460> just<00:00:46.150> move<00:00:46.330> them<00:00:46.570> around<00:00:46.690> and

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
controllers to just move them around and

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.840 
controllers to just move them around and
create<00:00:47.199> you<00:00:47.620> know<00:00:47.739> make<00:00:47.979> things<00:00:48.220> happen<00:00:48.430> so

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
create you know make things happen so

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.119 
create you know make things happen so
that's<00:00:49.030> it's<00:00:49.390> based<00:00:49.809> on<00:00:49.960> on<00:00:50.170> face<00:00:50.470> controllers

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
that's it's based on on face controllers

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.820 
that's it's based on on face controllers
and<00:00:51.430> there<00:00:52.360> are<00:00:52.479> also<00:00:52.659> some<00:00:53.019> sliders<00:00:53.409> which

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
and there are also some sliders which

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.630 
and there are also some sliders which
sort<00:00:54.460> of<00:00:54.519> change<00:00:55.890> change<00:00:56.890> things<00:00:57.220> too<00:00:57.430> because

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
sort of change change things too because

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.670 
sort of change change things too because
not<00:00:57.790> everything<00:00:58.030> can<00:00:58.210> be<00:00:58.500> transformed<00:00:59.500> like

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
not everything can be transformed like

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.770 
not everything can be transformed like
that<00:00:59.860> but<00:01:00.100> this<00:01:00.250> is<00:01:00.400> how<00:01:00.549> you<00:01:00.610> sort<00:01:01.570> of<00:01:01.659> like

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
that but this is how you sort of like

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.380 
that but this is how you sort of like
build<00:01:02.049> your<00:01:02.260> poses<00:01:02.739> really<00:01:03.549> easily<00:01:03.879> like<00:01:04.150> that

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
build your poses really easily like that

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.800 
build your poses really easily like that
and<00:01:04.659> they're<00:01:05.530> just<00:01:05.740> I<00:01:05.979> spent<00:01:06.700> a<00:01:06.790> lot<00:01:07.030> of<00:01:07.060> effort

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
and they're just I spent a lot of effort

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.709 
and they're just I spent a lot of effort
and<00:01:07.930> time<00:01:08.170> on<00:01:08.439> making<00:01:08.770> them<00:01:08.890> really<00:01:09.719> bendable

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:10.719 
and time on making them really bendable

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:12.840 
and time on making them really bendable
and<00:01:10.899> so<00:01:11.590> you<00:01:11.680> know<00:01:11.890> you<00:01:11.950> can<00:01:12.070> you<00:01:12.549> can<00:01:12.700> do

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
and so you know you can you can do

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.700 
and so you know you can you can do
things<00:01:13.060> like<00:01:13.149> angle<00:01:13.719> the<00:01:13.840> eyes<00:01:14.079> and<00:01:14.469> you<00:01:14.560> can

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
things like angle the eyes and you can

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.429 
things like angle the eyes and you can
scale<00:01:15.130> things<00:01:15.520> and<00:01:15.880> you<00:01:15.939> can<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.869> know<00:01:19.960> squash

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
scale things and you can you know squash

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.880 
scale things and you can you know squash
and<00:01:20.740> stretch<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.909> can<00:01:22.060> bend<00:01:22.359> the<00:01:22.630> head<00:01:22.929> and<00:01:23.770> I

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
and stretch you can bend the head and I

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.529 
and stretch you can bend the head and I
have<00:01:24.070> even<00:01:24.189> added<00:01:24.399> the<00:01:24.609> lattices<00:01:25.149> yet<00:01:25.359> but

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
have even added the lattices yet but

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.749 
have even added the lattices yet but
this<00:01:25.630> it's<00:01:25.960> all<00:01:26.170> really<00:01:26.560> bendable<00:01:27.250> and<00:01:27.399> really

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
this it's all really bendable and really

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.800 
this it's all really bendable and really
mushy<00:01:28.060> ball<00:01:28.359> and<00:01:28.600> really<00:01:28.780> scalable<00:01:30.810> for

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
mushy ball and really scalable for

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.419 
mushy ball and really scalable for
maximum<00:01:32.380> expressivity<00:01:32.979> and<00:01:33.310> that's

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
maximum expressivity and that's

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:36.980 
maximum expressivity and that's
something<00:01:33.670> that<00:01:33.820> I<00:01:33.939> feel<00:01:34.179> like<00:01:34.240> this<00:01:34.600> guy

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.069 

specializes<00:01:37.990> in<00:01:38.289> is<00:01:38.619> that<00:01:39.549> is<00:01:40.390> that<00:01:40.570> approach

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
specializes in is that is that approach

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.230 
specializes in is that is that approach
and<00:01:41.409> so<00:01:41.590> that's<00:01:41.770> that's<00:01:42.070> one<00:01:42.310> thing<00:01:42.520> that<00:01:42.729> you

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
and so that's that's one thing that you

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.120 
and so that's that's one thing that you
know<00:01:43.810> not<00:01:43.929> every<00:01:44.229> teacher<00:01:44.499> here<00:01:44.770> is<00:01:44.859> a<00:01:44.890> blue

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
know not every teacher here is a blue

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.169 
know not every teacher here is a blue
sky<00:01:45.340> but<00:01:45.549> it's<00:01:45.909> sort<00:01:46.149> of<00:01:46.240> like<00:01:47.819> you<00:01:48.819> know<00:01:48.850> sort

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
sky but it's sort of like you know sort

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.830 
sky but it's sort of like you know sort
of<00:01:49.299> centered<00:01:49.719> at<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.170> blue<00:01:50.560> sky<00:01:50.829> so<00:01:51.729> we've<00:01:52.659> got

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
of centered at a blue sky so we've got

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.309 
of centered at a blue sky so we've got
really<00:01:53.740> fleshy<00:01:54.509> controls<00:01:55.509> so<00:01:55.810> being<00:01:56.109> able<00:01:56.170> to

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 
really fleshy controls so being able to

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:58.289 
really fleshy controls so being able to
like<00:01:56.499> squish<00:01:56.950> this<00:01:57.159> stuff<00:01:57.429> together<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:58.149> move

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
like squish this stuff together and move

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.300 
like squish this stuff together and move
it<00:01:58.420> around<00:01:58.479> and<00:01:59.079> and<00:02:01.319> get<00:02:02.319> everything<00:02:02.829> so<00:02:03.189> it

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
it around and and get everything so it

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.149 
it around and and get everything so it
just<00:02:03.520> has<00:02:03.670> a<00:02:03.700> really<00:02:03.819> nice<00:02:04.740> fleshiness<00:02:05.740> and

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
just has a really nice fleshiness and

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.280 
just has a really nice fleshiness and
appeal<00:02:07.119> so<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.479> try<00:02:07.869> to<00:02:07.899> make<00:02:08.110> it<00:02:08.170> so<00:02:08.440> you<00:02:09.250> can

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
appeal so I try to make it so you can

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.320 
appeal so I try to make it so you can
