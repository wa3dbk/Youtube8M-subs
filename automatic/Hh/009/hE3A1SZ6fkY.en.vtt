00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
games of shared goals but I know if that

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.980 
games of shared goals but I know if that
was<00:00:26.160> just<00:00:26.310> more<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.519> fluke<00:00:26.970> or<00:00:27.240> whether<00:00:27.779> it's

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990

this team can really defend but going
forward<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.630> all<00:01:42.750> right<00:01:42.930> it's<00:01:43.140> good<00:01:43.290> passing

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
forward is all right it's good passing

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.859 
forward is all right it's good passing
good<00:01:44.310> dribbling<00:01:44.670> which<00:01:44.850> saw<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.180> main<00:01:45.390> idea

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
good dribbling which saw the main idea

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.679 
good dribbling which saw the main idea
of<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.439> midfield<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.100> scene<00:01:47.310> anyway<00:01:47.689> so

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
of the midfield in this scene anyway so

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.999 
of the midfield in this scene anyway so
then<00:01:48.810> we<00:01:48.899> look<00:01:48.990> good<00:01:49.140> too<00:01:49.320> good<00:01:49.470> nor<00:01:49.619> good<00:01:49.829> dog

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
then we look good too good nor good dog

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.819 
then we look good too good nor good dog
and<00:01:50.159> i'll<00:01:50.340> show<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.520> say<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:51.680> decent<00:01:52.680> pace

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
and i'll show you say a decent pace

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.710 
and i'll show you say a decent pace
really<00:01:53.549> good<00:01:53.670> passing<00:01:54.030> riga<00:01:54.240> dribbling<00:01:54.600> he's

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
really good passing riga dribbling he's

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.850 
really good passing riga dribbling he's
got<00:01:54.840> quite<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.049> good<00:01:55.140> defender<00:01:55.350> as<00:01:55.530> well<00:01:55.680> so

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
got quite a good defender as well so

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.830 
got quite a good defender as well so
that's<00:01:55.950> why<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.130> stuck<00:01:56.340> him<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.579> middle<00:01:56.840> so

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
that's why I stuck him in the middle so

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.320 
that's why I stuck him in the middle so
you<00:01:57.899> saw<00:01:58.200> shore<00:01:58.469> up<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.680> midfield<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.100> bit

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
you saw shore up the midfield a bit

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.620 
you saw shore up the midfield a bit
um<00:02:01.070> yeah<00:02:02.070> sup<00:02:02.400> that's<00:02:02.670> mainly<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.240> idea<00:02:03.540> of

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
um yeah sup that's mainly the idea of

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.720 
um yeah sup that's mainly the idea of
this<00:02:03.690> team<00:02:03.900> is<00:02:04.050> good<00:02:04.230> dribbling<00:02:04.530> good<00:02:04.740> passing

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 
this team is good dribbling good passing

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.999 
this team is good dribbling good passing
so<00:02:06.630> we<00:02:06.720> got<00:02:06.840> two<00:02:06.960> over<00:02:07.200> here<00:02:07.230> not<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.830> best

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
so we got two over here not the best

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.800 
so we got two over here not the best
part<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.430> all<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.640> best<00:02:08.790> pace<00:02:09.090> or<00:02:09.420> shoot<00:02:09.660> in

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
part in all the best pace or shoot in

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.960 
part in all the best pace or shoot in
but<00:02:10.080> for<00:02:10.320> me<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.009> found<00:02:11.250> him<00:02:11.460> to<00:02:11.640> be<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.820> best

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
but for me I found him to be the best

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.150 
but for me I found him to be the best
out<00:02:12.210> of<00:02:12.240> the<00:02:12.360> three<00:02:12.390> scored<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.440> think<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.040> was<00:02:14.100> a

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
out of the three scored I think it was a

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.560 
out of the three scored I think it was a
second<00:02:14.460> top<00:02:14.580> scorer<00:02:14.850> for<00:02:14.880> me<00:02:15.120> in<00:02:15.240> this<00:02:15.330> team

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
second top scorer for me in this team

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.070 
second top scorer for me in this team
his<00:02:15.920> dribbling<00:02:16.920> is<00:02:17.010> just<00:02:17.160> an<00:02:17.220> absolute<00:02:17.310> joke

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
his dribbling is just an absolute joke

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.630 
his dribbling is just an absolute joke
felt<00:02:19.080> better<00:02:19.320> than<00:02:19.500> goodness<00:02:20.130> be<00:02:20.250> honest<00:02:20.490> even

felt better than goodness be honest even

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.990 
felt better than goodness be honest even
though<00:02:20.760> he's<00:02:20.910> not<00:02:21.060> as<00:02:21.150> far<00:02:21.630> sort<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:22.290> limbo<00:02:22.500> I
