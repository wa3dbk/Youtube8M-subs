State<00:00:37.380> Building<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.800> exactly<00:00:38.219> how<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.399> was<00:00:38.700> 50

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
State Building is exactly how it was 50

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.850 
State Building is exactly how it was 50
years<00:00:39.300> ago<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.050> we<00:00:40.170> have<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.320> significant

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
years ago so we have a significant

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.830 
years ago so we have a significant
challenge<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.579> actual<00:00:41.910> car<00:00:42.090> itself<00:00:42.420> will<00:00:42.809> be

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
challenge the actual car itself will be

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.720 
challenge the actual car itself will be
cut<00:00:43.170> into<00:00:43.320> six<00:00:43.649> different<00:00:43.800> pieces<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.579> whole

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
cut into six different pieces the whole

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.279 
cut into six different pieces the whole
goal<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.180> not<00:00:45.510> make<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.870> look<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.140> you

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
goal is to not make it look like you

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.690 
goal is to not make it look like you
actually<00:00:46.469> had<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.800> cut<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.070> car<00:00:47.250> up<00:00:47.460> but<00:00:47.610> we

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
actually had to cut the car up but we

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.549 
actually had to cut the car up but we
have<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.000> cut<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.300> car<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.719> pieces<00:00:49.110> he's

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
have to cut the car in the pieces he's

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.229 
have to cut the car in the pieces he's
only<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:49.890> an<00:00:50.010> elevator<00:00:50.340> that's<00:00:50.550> 36<00:00:50.969> inches

that<00:00:53.219> elevator<00:00:53.370> as<00:00:53.820> we<00:00:54.449> went<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.750> took

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
that elevator as we went and took

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.720 
that elevator as we went and took
measurements<00:00:55.289> we<00:00:55.590> actually<00:00:55.980> built<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.370> mock-up

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730
