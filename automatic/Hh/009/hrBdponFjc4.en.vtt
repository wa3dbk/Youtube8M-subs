years<00:01:34.100> ago<00:01:34.490> it<00:01:35.180> was<00:01:35.240> a<00:01:35.390> long<00:01:35.750> process<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:36.380> yeah

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
years ago it was a long process so yeah

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.320 
years ago it was a long process so yeah
I'd<00:01:36.890> say<00:01:37.190> it<00:01:37.280> was<00:01:37.400> probably<00:01:37.670> harder<00:01:38.000> than<00:01:38.030> this

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
is going to be and it doesn't cost the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.330 
is going to be and it doesn't cost the
